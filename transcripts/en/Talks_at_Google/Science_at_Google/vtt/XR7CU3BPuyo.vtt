1
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.160
Now let's talk about our guest author.
Uh,
so we have bonding Rockman.

2
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.400
She's a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

3
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.390
She's a Seattle local currently and an award winning health and science writer.

4
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.430
Her,
uh,
her work has appeared in Time magazine,
time.com.
Oh,

5
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.870
that's the Oprah magazine,
parenting babble,

6
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.280
double x linked cookie and the news and observer.
Uh,

7
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.650
she's here today to talk about her first book,
which came out one week ago.
I,

8
00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:31.330
it's the gene machine.
How did,
uh,

9
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.990
how genetic technologies are transforming parenting and reshaping our society.

10
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.800
And in this book she explores the cutting edge of gene technology and how it is

11
00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:41.320
transforming medicine,
bioethics,
healthcare,

12
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.180
and the factors that shape our families.
So let's welcome Miss Bonnie Roseman.

13
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.363
I Rock,
man.

14
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.840
<v 0>Hi everyone.
Thanks so much for having me.
Um,</v>

15
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.500
I want to let you know if you're worrying,
oh,

16
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.370
this doesn't really have that much to do with my,
my particular line of work.
Yes,

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.230
it does.
At its heart,
this is really a story about data and I know that,
that,

18
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.580
um,
that speaks to you.

19
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.810
So I'm going to start by telling you how this book came about,

20
00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:16.811
which requires me to pull up this question about graduation texts or from 1994

21
00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:19.580
when I graduated from UNC,

22
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.800
it was the bicentennial UNC happens to be the nation's oldest public university.

23
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.910
And we were fully expecting a really impressive speaker.

24
00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:33.800
So other classes had gotten Madeline Albright,
Desmond Tutu,
John Grisham,

25
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.970
and uh,
we heard we were,
we were,
uh,

26
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.800
we were getting a guy named Francis Collins at no one knew who he was at the

27
00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:46.460
time.
Mother,
I see.
Not there at the time.

28
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.750
He was director of the National Human Genome Research Institute.
What,

29
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.840
no one knew what that was either.
So he,

30
00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:58.841
his job was to try to articulate all 3 billion base pairs that are part of our

31
00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:02.390
genome,
our genetic code.
And it has,

32
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.500
I have to say it seemed incredibly remote.
Uh,
nevertheless,

33
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:09.170
Francis did a bang up job.
He gave a great speech.

34
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.130
We all went out into the world and in,

35
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.390
he did such a good job that in 2009,
15 years after graduation,

36
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.160
he was actually appointed head of the National Institutes of health or NIH,

37
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:26.990
which is our country's medical research agency.
Um,

38
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:30.360
that was the same year that I,
um,

39
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.200
started working at Time magazine and a,
I was a health and parenting columnist.

40
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.050
This was my column.

41
00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:40.670
It was called family matters and I could write about pretty much anything I

42
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:44.900
wanted as long as it intersected with health and parenting.

43
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.710
So that means I got the write about Beyonce and her promotion of public

44
00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:53.711
breastfeeding and how friends influence other friends decision to vaccinate or

45
00:02:54.171 --> 00:02:56.770
not to vaccinate their children.
Um,

46
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.320
and I have found that left to my own devices,

47
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:02.350
I actually wrote quite a bit about genetics.

48
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.950
So I wrote about some pretty questionable,
uh,

49
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.300
companies that were marketing tests to kind of determine the,
um,

50
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.050
your child's aptitude for a particular sport.
You know,

51
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.680
kind of depend based on their genes,

52
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.370
what they would be particularly good at if you want to sort of steer them in a

53
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:23.080
direction of a particular sport.

54
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.240
And I wrote about parents' decisions to share or not to share their genetic

55
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:31.300
testing results with um,
with their children.

56
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.690
And I had been doing this job for about six months when this study up there,

57
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.470
um,
landed in my inbox and I remember,
um,

58
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.480
I remember this very well because I was on a plane with my family on route to a

59
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:51.040
family vacation and my kids who are three,
six,
and eight at the time,

60
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:52.660
I remember looking over at them,

61
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:56.080
they were all seated in one row and thinking,

62
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.080
what I want to know this level of data,

63
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:03.640
this depth of information about my kids.
So what this study was about,

64
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:07.620
the level of the information that this study was looking to,

65
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.690
to find out how to do with a group of parents who had had genetic testing and

66
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:17.140
the parents were then asked hypothetically if they would want to test their kids

67
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.430
under the age of 18 for some very common adult onset disorders,

68
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.740
things like diabetes,

69
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.460
like skin cancer and like high cholesterol or high blood pressure.

70
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.750
And the parents pretty much uniformly across the board said,
yeah,

71
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:34.570
totally bring it on.
We're going to,
this is going to be amazing.

72
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.940
We're going to get the clean bill of health,

73
00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:40.600
are going to feel like our kids are super healthy and we'll move on.

74
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.370
So what they didn't realize was that these myths,

75
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.450
these mutations are so common that on average each kid would have about nine.

76
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.270
Now,
not to say there would definitely get the disease,
but they would,

77
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.650
they were at increased risk for developing this disease,
uh,
later on.

78
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.950
So what was striking to me is that people did not understand the connection

79
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:07.570
between genes,
heredity,
disease,

80
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.800
increased risks,

81
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:12.040
that they were doing this testing because they thought they were just roll

82
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:13.900
things out and feel really good.

83
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.280
And instead what they were going to do is find information that was not

84
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:23.200
particularly definitive but kind of raised more questions and in some cases

85
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:25.510
could actually raise more anxiety.

86
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.520
So that made me realize that genes are not black and white.

87
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.170
That in some cases their suggestions about what will happen down the road and in

88
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:38.080
some cases their certainty.
But it's really,

89
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.270
it's not very cut and dried.

90
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.490
And so there's this misconception really the genes are destiny,

91
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.460
but in truth,
it's really just part of the puzzle.

92
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.740
So I was so interested in these findings that genes are not always destiny,

93
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:01.580
that you really can't know that I decided to look into it more.

94
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:06.500
So this multidimensional aspect of DNA and genes of heredity,
um,

95
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.270
led me to pitch a story to my editor at time about the implications of

96
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:14.960
sequencing children's genomes or reading their entire genetic code.

97
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.380
And I'm about getting all this data,
all this,

98
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:22.470
these huge quantities of information about your kids,
some of which will be,
um,

99
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.680
deterministic,
others,
you know,

100
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.550
at some of the information what really we won't even really know what it means.

101
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:31.180
And is that a good idea?
So,
um,

102
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.140
it ended up being a series of weeklong online series and then that morphed into

103
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:40.910
a cover story,
the last cover story of 2012 which you see up on the screen.

104
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.220
And you know,
when you spend a ton of time on a big project,
you're either,

105
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.760
you never want to hear another word about it or you're even more intrigued.

106
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.960
So for me,

107
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:55.961
it was the ladder and I decided to go ahead and write a book about this world in

108
00:06:56.451 --> 00:07:01.451
which we have more access than ever to cutting edge technology to peer inside

109
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:06.290
our genomes and,
and to emerge with the snapshot of disease,

110
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.480
both potential and actual.

111
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.470
And I wanted to do this by telling the stories of real people.

112
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.310
So speaking of stories of real people you may know,

113
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.990
recognize this guy up there on the screen.
So,
uh,

114
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.390
several years ago,
um,

115
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.510
Sergei Brin did a 23 and me gene panel and he learned that he has got a pretty

116
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:37.370
rare genetic mutation that predisposes him to develop Parkinson's.

117
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.090
Um,

118
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:43.090
so I looked up his blog from when he got his test results and he says that,

119
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.080
um,
that when he had done the genetic testing,

120
00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:51.710
he quote viewed it mostly as entertainment.

121
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.160
And yet what happened is he ended up finding this gene mutation that actually

122
00:07:57.771 --> 00:08:02.771
means he has a significantly elevated risk of developing Parkinson's disease.

123
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:05.803
Now,

124
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:10.810
some people in his situation might feel very freaked out about that depending on

125
00:08:11.481 --> 00:08:14.990
how,
what their impressions are and what their relationship is with data,

126
00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:18.860
especially personal genetic data.
But Sergei,

127
00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:23.210
on the other hand that he said this in his,
um,
in his blog,
he said,

128
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.690
I feel fortunate to be in this position until the fountain of Youth.

129
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:30.740
It's discovered all of us will have some conditions in our old age only.

130
00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:32.180
We don't know what they will be.

131
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.320
I have a better guest than almost anyone else for what ILS may maybe mine and

132
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:40.340
have decades to prepare for it.
So that is,

133
00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:43.260
that made me think back to that study that I,
you know,

134
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.020
originally set me off on this entire journey and it's really interesting what

135
00:08:48.021 --> 00:08:52.640
he's,
what Sergei says because he is then he actually goes on in his blog to give

136
00:08:52.641 --> 00:08:57.641
specific examples of how he might change his life due to learning about this

137
00:08:57.781 --> 00:09:00.630
genetic mutation and the predisposition to Parkinson's.

138
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.130
So there's some research showing that exercise may be protective against the

139
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:06.360
development of Parkinson's.

140
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:10.410
So I can only imagine that he has the common gym rat.

141
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:16.220
He can also direct his money to help support research into causes of Parkinson's

142
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:18.930
treatments for Parkinson's.

143
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:24.170
So I think that his experience is really illustrative of how genetic data,

144
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.300
even if it is not a certainty,

145
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.570
really allows you to take control of your life.

146
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.060
This is Gracie,
she has down syndrome.

147
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.460
I'll tell you a little bit more about Gracie and a second.
Um,

148
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:44.540
one way that all this access to new genetic technology and data is really

149
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:49.260
changing our world is that it's redefining the holy grail concept of what it

150
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:53.880
means to be or to have a healthy baby.
So when you get pregnant,
um,

151
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.300
oftentimes if you ask people,
oh,
you haven't a girl or a boy though,

152
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.330
they will sometimes,
sometimes they have a preference,

153
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.020
but sometimes they'll just say,
I don't care.
I just want a healthy baby.

154
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:06.300
So what exactly is a healthy baby?

155
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.440
We have this constantly expanding array of genetic technologies that offer

156
00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:13.260
insight prenatally into a baby's health.

157
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:17.790
But what does it mean to be healthy?
For example,
a child,

158
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.500
a baby born with down syndrome,

159
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.790
about half of the time they have heart defects that need surgical repair,

160
00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:27.540
but about half of the time they don't and they can just go home from the

161
00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:30.210
hospital.
So is a baby with down syndrome,

162
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.620
a healthy baby up for debate j.
So,

163
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.050
you know,
when I was born,

164
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.970
my mom didn't know if I had down syndrome,
shouldn't even know what gender I was.

165
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.370
And today already in the first trimester,

166
00:10:44.371 --> 00:10:47.770
there are blood tests that can detect down syndrome,
um,

167
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.800
in a noninvasive way,

168
00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:54.480
which is really reshaping a lot of the debate around,
um,

169
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:59.220
around disability and the perception of who should and should not be born in our

170
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:03.780
society.
So back to Gracie.
She is,
um,
she's in Boston.

171
00:11:03.781 --> 00:11:08.610
You lives in Boston,
right outside and uh,
she likes lipsync into Taylor swift.

172
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.320
I visited her,
uh,
two years ago and she,

173
00:11:13.321 --> 00:11:18.030
um,
Lipsync Macklemore's thrift shop for me.
She is funny.

174
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:22.620
She is a diligent learner.
She is doing really well in school,

175
00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:24.320
thanks to her mom's advocacies.

176
00:11:24.321 --> 00:11:28.470
So she's an inclusion classes and she's also really charmingly irreverent.

177
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.740
One of the funniest stories in the book is Gracie's mom telling me about

178
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:38.250
Gracie's trip to the dentist.
So I'm Gracie.

179
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.750
The dentist was trying to butter her up and said to Gracie,
oh,

180
00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:47.310
you're so cute.
Can you open your mouth for me?
And Gracie responded,

181
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.070
get away from me.
You word that rhymes with witch.

182
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.190
A friend of Gracie's mom joke.

183
00:11:55.191 --> 00:11:59.340
The Gracie was really just saying what everyone else is thinking.
Anyway.
Um,

184
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:05.050
since there is now new research to improve the lives of people who have down

185
00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:08.680
syndrome,
there's research and to silencing the extra copy,

186
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:12.820
the extra copy of the 21st chromosome that characterizes this condition.

187
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:17.530
There's research into drugs that can be taken prenatally by a pregnant mom or

188
00:12:17.531 --> 00:12:20.950
drugs that can be taken after birth by a child with down syndrome.

189
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.600
And as you might imagine,

190
00:12:22.601 --> 00:12:26.740
some parents are really excited about this and some parents are super
conflicted.

191
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:31.600
And for from Melanie Gracie's mom,
you know,

192
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.230
like any parent,
how many of you have kids?

193
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.360
Okay,
so,
and even for those of you who don't have kids,

194
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:42.940
you can imagine,
think back to your parents.

195
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.030
Everyone always wants the best for their child.

196
00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:48.970
They want their child to have every single opportunity.

197
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.500
Yet that really raises the question of what does it mean to have every

198
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:54.400
opportunity,

199
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.970
our drugs actually changing the essence of the child versus helping them to

200
00:13:00.641 --> 00:13:04.030
achieve their potential.
So let's do a quick poll.

201
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.110
I'm going to ask you if it's good,
bad,

202
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:13.350
or in consequential to have a baby who's born blind or missing a lamb or with

203
00:13:14.171 --> 00:13:16.750
some sort of intellectual disability.
Um,

204
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:21.360
raise your hand if you think that's a good thing.
What about that

205
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.550
in consequential doesn't matter at all.
So that's,

206
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.840
that's pretty standard.
I've never had anyone say it's a good thing.

207
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.340
I'm most people.
Um,

208
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:38.110
most people say it's a bad thing and usually a couple of people say it's

209
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.740
inconsequential.
It doesn't really matter one way or aren't they or another.

210
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:46.910
And I interview a professor of law in the book who,

211
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.800
who he researches Eugenics,
which is the,
um,

212
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.860
the practice of trying to build a superior race and that is now out of favor in

213
00:13:57.821 --> 00:14:02.560
this country.
It reached its height during the Nazi era.

214
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.760
Um,
but it did go on in the United States for many,
many,
many years.

215
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.160
And this professor Paul Lombardo,

216
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.950
he posited that if he would do a survey of most people whom he consider

217
00:14:13.951 --> 00:14:17.890
considers compassionate and not mean spirited,

218
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.490
that most people would say there are actually some conditions the baby should

219
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:24.400
not be born with.
If there is a way to avoid it.

220
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.150
I found that really powerful because you know,

221
00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:30.430
we as a society in general,

222
00:14:30.431 --> 00:14:34.390
we think that we are open minded,
open hearted,

223
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.730
and yet when it comes right down to it,

224
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:41.530
if you're asked about disability and you have the option to,

225
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.070
uh,
to opt out of it,
most people,

226
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.980
most people say no thanks in that sort of situation.

227
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:55.340
So I spoke with a mom who's son has something called 22 Q deletion,

228
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.930
which is,
um,

229
00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.800
which is a condition in which her son is missing the small part of his 22nd

230
00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:03.740
chromosome.
And it's accompanied by,
you know,

231
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:07.940
mild to moderate intellectual disability.
There can be heart defects.

232
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.800
So this boy in particular was doing amazingly well when I interviewed his mom,

233
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.660
he was in a four year university.

234
00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:19.661
He was living three hours away from home and still this mom was terrified of the

235
00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:26.201
possibility that her son would give birth to a child like him.

236
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.210
So every year when her son,

237
00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:31.910
who was I think around 20 at the time,

238
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.670
would go for a checkup with his geneticist.

239
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.220
This mom would besiege the geneticists to say,

240
00:15:37.221 --> 00:15:41.060
you have to tell him that he has to use birth control.

241
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:46.160
So here you have this mom who loves her son and who's really proud of his

242
00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:50.690
accomplishments and his achievements.
But she's saying,
oh my God,

243
00:15:50.691 --> 00:15:52.310
don't have a kid like you.

244
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:56.720
So people were 22 Q have a 50% chance of passing that onto their children.

245
00:15:56.721 --> 00:16:01.100
And this,
this mom is saying,
please don't,
don't give me a grandchild.

246
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.320
Like don't give me a grandchild like you.
Um,

247
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.730
so you can imagine what kind of delicate ethical,

248
00:16:07.731 --> 00:16:10.910
tight rope that is too to be perched on.

249
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.650
You can actually avoid 22 Q by three,

250
00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:18.590
something called preimplantation genetic diagnosis.

251
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:23.980
This is a picture up here of an embryo and a couple cells are being siphoned out

252
00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:28.730
of the embryo.
The embryo is just a few days old,
probably about five days old.

253
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:34.060
And then those cells are analyzed to determine whether there is the presence or

254
00:16:35.301 --> 00:16:39.050
absence of a particular genetic mutation.

255
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:43.970
And so the way that it is currently used right now is,
um,

256
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.290
it's,
um,

257
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:50.320
it's employed in most cases to get rid of very severe,

258
00:16:50.691 --> 00:16:53.740
often fatal childhood diseases,
something like taste the,

259
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:58.160
which is often fatal before a child would reach kindergarten.

260
00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.020
So you take these embryos so you're not,

261
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:04.010
it's very different from something like gene editing and you probably have all

262
00:17:04.011 --> 00:17:08.300
heard of something called Crispr,
which is a way to edit genes.
So this,

263
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.270
this is not editing genes.
Instead,
this is taking embryos,

264
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:16.160
looking at them and saying,
oh,
that one,
that one has,
that one has taste sacks.

265
00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.640
Okay,
let's discard that.
Or let's throw that,
let's put that aside.

266
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:24.440
And this one doesn't have taste x,
let's implant that one into a woman's uterus.

267
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.650
So you are picking and choosing and you're,

268
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.680
you're selecting in favor of not having a particular disease.

269
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.700
So what's different,
again,
going back to,
um,
to Crispr,

270
00:17:37.701 --> 00:17:40.590
CRISPR obviously raises concerns of what's,
you know,

271
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.660
in the media we talk about designer babies.
What does that really mean?
Well,

272
00:17:44.661 --> 00:17:49.220
the truth is that we don't know currently how,

273
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:50.520
uh,

274
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.520
build a future Google engineer or manufacture the next Michael Jordan or the

275
00:17:56.401 --> 00:17:57.450
next Yoyo Ma.

276
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.980
And the reason is because there is not one single gene that codes for a killer

277
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.910
jumpshot or amazing,
um,

278
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:09.780
amazing ability as a cellist or as a programmer.
Um,

279
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:14.460
it's a confluence of
influences from your environment,

280
00:18:14.461 --> 00:18:15.990
where you live,
who your parents are,

281
00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:20.550
your exposure to all sorts of things plus your genetic makeup.

282
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:26.190
So PGD,
um,
is often PGD.

283
00:18:26.191 --> 00:18:30.990
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis is not as,
as you might imagine,

284
00:18:30.991 --> 00:18:33.000
it is not as,
um,

285
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:38.180
as ethically fraught as something using CRISPR technology to edit genes to edit

286
00:18:38.611 --> 00:18:39.444
embryos.

287
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.600
And it's been used for decades to avoid transmitting these serious diseases such

288
00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:46.860
as taste acts that I mentioned,

289
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:52.190
but it's also now increasingly being considered for diseases that are not quite,

290
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.830
that are not necessarily fatal.
So,

291
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.580
so most people in this room probably know someone who's been diagnosed with

292
00:18:59.581 --> 00:19:04.500
breast cancer and you can select an embryo that does not have a breast cancer

293
00:19:04.501 --> 00:19:05.100
mutation.

294
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:10.100
So if that BRC one or be Mrca to mutation runs in your family or a whole host of

295
00:19:11.461 --> 00:19:15.390
other breast cancer mutations,
Brc one and two are just the most common.

296
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.890
So if those run in your family and you want to kind of stop that train and say,

297
00:19:19.891 --> 00:19:23.940
I don't want to transmit,
um,
you know,
this has been hell in my family.

298
00:19:23.941 --> 00:19:28.370
My mom died,
my aunt died,
I was diagnosed when I was,
you know,

299
00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.100
in my twenties and I don't want to pass this legacy onto my child.

300
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.510
You can do preimplantation genetic diagnosis to have a child who has not

301
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:39.600
inherited that.
Your,
your genetic mutation.

302
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.250
So that raises the question of is,

303
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.010
are we playing God by doing something like this?
You know,

304
00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:49.260
breast cancer is very different from Tay-sachs.

305
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.370
Having a genetic mutation that predisposes you to breast cancer just means that

306
00:19:53.371 --> 00:19:56.400
you're an increased risk for it.
It's like Sergei and his Parkinson's,

307
00:19:56.401 --> 00:20:00.450
he won't necessarily get it.
It means he's at elevated risk for it.

308
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.400
So knowing that someone,

309
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.790
knowing that an embryo is an elevated risk for a disease,

310
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.870
is it ethical to not have that child?

311
00:20:09.871 --> 00:20:13.830
To not bring that child into the world because of a possibility of a disease

312
00:20:13.831 --> 00:20:16.020
that may develop decades down the road.

313
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.770
Now let's change the scenario even a little bit more.

314
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.520
Let's say you are completely opposed to doing something like that to using

315
00:20:23.521 --> 00:20:27.040
preimplantation genetic diagnosis and that data to,
you know,

316
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.430
weed out certain embryos.
So,

317
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.080
but let's say you have a breast cancer mutation in your family and you have a

318
00:20:34.081 --> 00:20:34.740
baby,

319
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:39.630
do you then think that you have the right to data to know whether your child has

320
00:20:39.631 --> 00:20:41.580
inherited your genetic mutation?

321
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:45.780
So pediatric ethics guidelines say no you don't.

322
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.560
You don't have the right to know.

323
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.040
You don't have the right to test your child under the age of 18 unless it's

324
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:52.480
medically necessary.

325
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.900
And something like knowing about a risk for breast cancer would not be

326
00:20:55.901 --> 00:21:00.040
considered medically necessary for us three months old.
So I'm going to,

327
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:04.060
I'm going to read to you a little bit from the book of even something like this,

328
00:21:04.061 --> 00:21:07.280
how complicated it can be.
So the first,
um,

329
00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:12.330
the first little bit I'm going to read to you is from a doctor named Mike bomb

330
00:21:12.401 --> 00:21:12.731
shot.

331
00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:17.680
He is the head of pediatric genetic medicine at Udab and he says,

332
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:22.270
we are recommending that parents be left with the ambiguity that their infant is

333
00:21:22.271 --> 00:21:26.560
a higher risk for breast cancer because they have breast cancer in their family.

334
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:31.740
But we're unwilling to test the baby to know for sure he disagrees with that.

335
00:21:32.021 --> 00:21:32.620
And he says,

336
00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:36.460
if we're counseling someone in clinic and they're at high risk for breast cancer

337
00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:38.500
and they have their infant daughter with them,

338
00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.880
why in the world would we wait to talk again until she's 18?

339
00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:48.130
Why would we not test and say she's not a BRC,
a carrier or she is.

340
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:51.940
And here's what you should do about it.
We should use this information,

341
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.160
this data to improve health care.

342
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:58.990
And one of the clearest ways to improve health care is to prevent disease.

343
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.580
It's very clear cut.
So I find that incredibly persuasive.

344
00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:09.090
And then I'm going to read to you a passage from a woman who became my friend

345
00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:13.720
after I interviewed her.
She was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 32.

346
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:18.740
Her mom died when,
um,
when she was very young and,
um,
and she has a,

347
00:22:18.741 --> 00:22:22.960
a BRC mutation.
So,
um,
this is Debbie.

348
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.180
Right after she found out via ultrasound that she was having a daughter,

349
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:33.070
I came out saying,
oh my God,
what if she gets breast cancer?
Her husband,
Evan,

350
00:22:33.071 --> 00:22:37.300
did not understand.
He calls me doom and gloom,
but I said,

351
00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.760
I'm going to die if she gets breast cancer.

352
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:44.260
Debbie was determined to find a way to test her daughter,
her daughter,
Jordan,

353
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.370
but her husband was adamantly opposed and now she agrees with him.

354
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.420
I don't think it's fair for us to have that information and have that heaviness

355
00:22:52.421 --> 00:22:55.150
in our family or in how we relate to Jordan.

356
00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.100
I think knowing whether Jordan is positive or negative would also cause a lot of

357
00:23:00.101 --> 00:23:04.150
tension and sadness in our family.
When you think about testing a child,

358
00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.380
you have to think of the ramifications that it would have on lots of family

359
00:23:08.381 --> 00:23:09.214
members.

360
00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.480
So you can see two very well reasoned,

361
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:17.860
yet extremely different perspectives on the value and the appropriateness of

362
00:23:17.861 --> 00:23:20.710
information.
It's really super complicated.

363
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:25.870
As the technology evolves,
these,
um,

364
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:30.100
these ethical dilemmas are coming at us fast and furious.

365
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:31.900
I'm not a scientist.

366
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:36.100
I like to think of myself as a humanist and I wrote this book because I'm really

367
00:23:36.101 --> 00:23:37.570
fascinated by these questions.

368
00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:41.590
Have right or wrong and red lines are there red lines,
if there are red lines,

369
00:23:41.591 --> 00:23:43.630
where are they?
Who Decides?

370
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:48.960
And nowhere is more heated than when it comes to making babies.

371
00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:54.110
Again,
we have to just keep asking ourselves the question.
And as Google Earth,

372
00:23:54.111 --> 00:23:59.111
I'm sure you can appreciate that this is there such a thing as too much

373
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:04.100
information.
So these are all really big ideas.

374
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.650
I don't give yes or no answers because I don't believe there are none.
Um,

375
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.530
I think these,
um,
decisions are all extremely personal.

376
00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.870
They're individual and it really comes down to choice in what's right for you

377
00:24:17.871 --> 00:24:21.980
and your comfort with a great degree of information and data.

378
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.880
So if you're sick of small talk at your next party,

379
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.220
you can try these topics on for size.

380
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:32.600
Do parents have a right to all of their child's health data?

381
00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.110
So some experts believe that within a couple of years we're going to have our

382
00:24:36.111 --> 00:24:39.380
genome in the cloud.
So if parents,

383
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.780
if that does come to pass,

384
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:47.200
should parents know everything there is to know about a child's DNA and let's

385
00:24:47.361 --> 00:24:48.710
say that there's a problem.

386
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:52.880
Would you love your kid less or maybe even more?

387
00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.810
Now back to that BRC mutation,

388
00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:02.170
say your newborn hazard genome sequenced and a BRC mutation is discovered.

389
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.600
You know,
a couple of minutes ago I told you that,
well,

390
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.930
pediatric ethics guidelines say that we don't test,

391
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.830
we don't have kids under 18 for something that's not medically necessary and

392
00:25:12.831 --> 00:25:15.200
needs to be dealt with right now by it.

393
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:20.590
It's really likely that that baby has inherited her genetic mutation from her

394
00:25:22.221 --> 00:25:23.480
mom or her dad.

395
00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:28.220
And let's say those parents don't know that they have the mutation.

396
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:33.520
So by telling them you then are enabling them to take whatever measures they

397
00:25:35.421 --> 00:25:39.590
feel are appropriate.
Um,
a mom could have a prophylactic mastectomy,

398
00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:43.820
a dad could get,
men obviously get breast cancer as well.

399
00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.920
They're also at greater risk for prostate cancer.

400
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:49.640
So you're just basically enabling them to be more empowered regarding their own

401
00:25:49.641 --> 00:25:52.490
health.
And you know,

402
00:25:52.491 --> 00:25:56.990
it's really complicated because you think that you're not supposed to tell the

403
00:25:56.991 --> 00:26:00.650
parents because you're sort of encroaching upon the child,
you know,

404
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:05.760
the child's right of privacy and protecting her own genetic data and yet telling

405
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.113
the Chai,

406
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:12.560
telling the parents that the child has a mutation could actually be a way,

407
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:17.590
a clear way to do something really amazing for that child by potentially a

408
00:26:18.741 --> 00:26:21.200
burden the death of one of her parents.

409
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:29.150
So in short,
it used to be a lot easier to be pregnant.

410
00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:30.620
Um,
as I said,

411
00:26:30.621 --> 00:26:34.970
my mom did not even know if I was a boy or a girl when I was born.

412
00:26:34.971 --> 00:26:39.500
And today we have tons and tons of genetic data.
Um,

413
00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.230
we often,

414
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:47.580
I won't say often vet regularly at the test get,
get more and more sophisticated.

415
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:51.000
We'll find out information that is completely unclear.
Um,

416
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.920
and you have to then decide,

417
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:56.790
do you proceed with this pregnancy based on really uncertain information?

418
00:26:56.791 --> 00:27:00.840
I spend the stories of several families who got really disconcerted information,

419
00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:02.070
like their baby was missing,

420
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.370
missing a couple of genes or some DNA was duplicated.

421
00:27:05.371 --> 00:27:09.000
And what exactly does that mean?
And how do you proceed with that?

422
00:27:09.001 --> 00:27:11.760
In some of these cases of parents learned that they actually had the same

423
00:27:11.761 --> 00:27:14.940
deletions or genetic duplications,
and then it's,
you know,

424
00:27:14.941 --> 00:27:17.940
it's pretty mind blowing me.
You have to figure out how to process all of that.

425
00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:22.410
So I'm going to end with,
um,

426
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:26.940
I'm an end with the best compliment that I received about this book,

427
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.750
which is going to entail me telling you a little bit about the book building

428
00:27:30.751 --> 00:27:32.730
process and these,
um,

429
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:36.180
these impressive blurbs that if here on the back,

430
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.260
I feel like Vanna white up here.
Um,
so,
you know,

431
00:27:40.261 --> 00:27:41.850
those blurbs don't just appear there.

432
00:27:41.851 --> 00:27:44.760
It's not like someone goes into a bookstore,
reads my book,

433
00:27:44.761 --> 00:27:48.210
and it's just so incredibly moved that they contact my publisher and say,

434
00:27:48.211 --> 00:27:52.170
I've got to write some words of praise for the back of that lady's jacket.

435
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.330
Um,
no.
Instead,

436
00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:59.310
it's this very arduous process of reaching out to,
um,

437
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.470
uh,
so I,
uh,

438
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.650
convened with my editor and we kind of developed a list of really influential

439
00:28:04.651 --> 00:28:07.680
people who would be amazing to blurb the back of the book.

440
00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:11.850
And then it's this very humiliating and process of reaching out via email and

441
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.510
basically begging these people who are already incredibly busy.
Two,

442
00:28:15.511 --> 00:28:19.560
please read your book and if they're so inclined and if they like it,

443
00:28:19.561 --> 00:28:23.740
maybe they'll write a couple pithy words for you to stick on the jacket.

444
00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:28.970
So one of these women,
um,
Kelly Behnam French had just written her own book,

445
00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.640
really beautiful memoir about the birth of her extremely premature daughter.

446
00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:37.590
The book is called Juniper.
And I had,
uh,
she had agreed,
uh,

447
00:28:37.591 --> 00:28:38.850
to receive a copy of the book.

448
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.040
And so I followed up for the first time on October 26,
um,

449
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:48.420
by writing,
um,
to her and saying,
Hey,
just checking in,
you know,

450
00:28:48.421 --> 00:28:51.060
trying to remain all casual.
And she responded,

451
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:55.080
just got the book and haven't looked at it yet,
but I'm looking forward to it.

452
00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:59.940
So I wrote back,
Ugh,
isn't this blurb seeking just the worst?

453
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.760
I appreciate your making the effort,
Kelly.

454
00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:07.380
And the next day she wrote back the whole book promotion thing.
Ugh.

455
00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:10.470
Standing naked on the street corner would be more fun.

456
00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.500
So I decided I was going to up the ante here,

457
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:19.190
more like standing naked on the street corner in Subzero temps in times square

458
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.940
that would only begin to capture the Har.

459
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:27.950
And she went radio silent on me after I bared my soul.
Um,

460
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.930
so I decided to check in and after a week,

461
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.720
hello fellow naked street corner dweller,

462
00:29:33.721 --> 00:29:38.721
I'm gritting my teeth and oh so casually checking in to see if you just might be

463
00:29:38.851 --> 00:29:42.970
inclined to blurb this book of mine.
Time dragged by.

464
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.350
There was no word.

465
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:49.390
And then finally I got an email from her 10 words total.

466
00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.580
This book doesn't suck.
Thank God that would've been awkward.

467
00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:04.340
I laughed and I wrote back to her,
that is the blurb right there.

468
00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:08.750
This book doesn't suck.
And then she responded.

469
00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.840
You can see we had a great email correspondence going.
Um,

470
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:14.720
and she really had the last word she wrote.

471
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:20.600
Really that's all any of us can ever hope for.

472
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:25.640
So I find that,
uh,
it wasn't just about my buck.

473
00:30:25.641 --> 00:30:27.850
That's really a universal truth.
Um,

474
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:32.420
so I hope you enjoyed hearing about the book and I hope you find it interesting.

475
00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:36.350
I hope it makes you think about things that you hadn't really considered before

476
00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:41.060
about science and babies and how these two things intersect in ways both

477
00:30:41.061 --> 00:30:44.890
marvelous and mysterious.
And thank you so much for coming.

478
00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.740
I'm happy to take any questions.
Okay.

479
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:48.850
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

480
00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:53.050
So I mean we can debate the ethics and have a lot of philosophical arguments,

481
00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:57.010
but at the end,
either have technology will work or it won't.
Right.
So you know,

482
00:30:57.011 --> 00:31:00.100
when,
when little Johnny goes to school,

483
00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.210
if little Alice who had genetic modification is better than him and everything,

484
00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:08.890
then when Johnny has a brother or sister,
if the parents can afford it,

485
00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:10.000
they're going to do it.
Right.

486
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:16.290
<v 0>Oh Wow.
I'm not speaking for Joe for Johnny's parents.</v>

487
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:17.783
Bye.

488
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:24.430
The important thing to note is that currently we don't know how to make so

489
00:31:24.501 --> 00:31:28.070
called designer babies.
In fact,
in the book I talk about,
well,

490
00:31:28.071 --> 00:31:30.350
in some ways we're actually already creating designer babies.

491
00:31:30.351 --> 00:31:34.630
If anyone here has had a child,
um,
via IVF,
um,

492
00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:39.200
or know someone who has and it's everywhere now,
um,

493
00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.371
those could,

494
00:31:40.371 --> 00:31:43.690
those babies could actually technically be considered designer babies.

495
00:31:43.691 --> 00:31:46.070
So if you're choosing donor sperm,

496
00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:51.090
you go through this entire checklist,
you can,
um,
learn,
um,

497
00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:55.490
where the donor or went to school at the donor's job is what the donor's

498
00:31:55.491 --> 00:32:00.350
personality is like.
You can access baby pictures.
Um,
you know,

499
00:32:00.351 --> 00:32:04.550
it's basically like this whole smorgasbord of,
um,
um,

500
00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.670
trays there.
You know,
the donor has a quick temper,

501
00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:11.090
the donor has an amazing sense of humor and you can select all of these things,

502
00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:16.370
but,
um,
you know,
so I think it can be argued that already were doing that.

503
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:20.360
And you know,
people who have,
um,
who go through assisted reproduction,

504
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.120
but if you're just having sex the regular way,

505
00:32:23.121 --> 00:32:27.050
the way that we've done for centuries,
um,
we just don't,

506
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:30.230
you can't,
you know,
it's luck of the draw.

507
00:32:30.231 --> 00:32:34.520
And even if you then apply technologies through assisted reproduction,

508
00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:39.470
we don't know how to make the next Einstein.
So it's a whole,
you know,

509
00:32:39.471 --> 00:32:43.830
it's kind of,
someone could crack the code then I think that your,
um,

510
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.730
I think your question would be a lot more valid.

511
00:32:46.731 --> 00:32:49.670
But currently we don't know.
There's not one,

512
00:32:49.671 --> 00:32:54.500
there's not the intelligence gene and the awesome on the football field,

513
00:32:54.501 --> 00:32:57.740
you know,
Seattle Seahawks gene.
So it's just not,
it's not,

514
00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.570
it's not possible at this point in time.

515
00:32:59.571 --> 00:33:04.570
It's really focused more on disease and elimination of disease.
Well,

516
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:07.160
thank you very much for telling us about your book.
That doesn't suck.

517
00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:09.960
Thank you.
