1
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.340
All right,
well,

2
00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:13.600
welcome everyone who's physically present and welcome everyone who is virtually

3
00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:14.600
present.
Um,

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.210
my job is a really fun one today is to tell you about what many people are

5
00:00:19.211 --> 00:00:23.350
calling the sky event of the decade.
August 21.

6
00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:28.351
There will be a total eclipse visible from one country in one country only and

7
00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:30.730
that's the United States.

8
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.300
They were already calling it the all American eclipse.

9
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.350
I'm sure the administration in Washington is going to try to take full credit

10
00:00:38.351 --> 00:00:41.920
for it.
The minute they wake up to the fact that it's happening.

11
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.330
They're a little busy shuffling the deck chairs on the titanic right now.

12
00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:47.830
But um,
there,

13
00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:51.420
there will eventually I think be a big claim for this and I need,

14
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:56.290
it is interesting that the clips this total only in the United States,

15
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.150
what's going to happen?
Well,
during an eclipse,

16
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.320
the moon covers the sun and if you think about that,

17
00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:09.490
that's a really remarkable coincidence.
As seen from Earth,

18
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.880
the moon in the sky and the sun in the sky happened to be exactly the same size.

19
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.750
That's not true,
by the way,

20
00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:21.370
from any other planet moon combination in the solar system,

21
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.300
all new from Earth.
Is that true?
Uh,
in case you don't believe me,

22
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.360
here is one of the moons of Mars trying to eclipse the sun as seen from Mars.

23
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.880
And you can see it's pathetic,
right?

24
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.360
There's the little rock called Phobos.
Can't possibly eclipse the sun,

25
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.840
but here from Earth,
the moon and the sun are the same size.
So in eclipse works,

26
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.440
here's what's happening.
During an eclipse geometrically,
uh,

27
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.550
the moon gets in front of the sun and therefore the shadow of the moon makes a

28
00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:55.810
dark spot on the earth.

29
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.770
Now the nice thing is the earth turns.

30
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.800
That's what it does for a living.
That's what it says on his business card,
right?

31
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.030
And the moon moves in its orbit and the relative motion makes the shadow spot of

32
00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:12.460
the eclipse move across the earth.

33
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.060
And that's what's going to happen on August 21st,
you know,

34
00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:19.240
zone about 60 to 70 miles wide.

35
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.280
The eclipse spot,

36
00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:25.690
we'll move across the United States starting on one side of the country in the

37
00:02:25.691 --> 00:02:29.410
Pacific side,
all the way to the Atlantic side.
Um,

38
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.720
just in case you don't believe me,
here is a previous eclipse as seen from space,

39
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.820
and there really is a shadow spot during the eclipse,
right on the earth.

40
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.710
Um,
when this happens,
here's the sequence of events.
Uh,

41
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.330
this is a beautiful sequence of photographs put together by my colleague Rick

42
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.990
Feinberg.
Um,

43
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.990
but you can see the sun slowly begins to see the moon encroaching it,

44
00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.730
the moon moves across it.
Uh,
then the eclipses total,

45
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.710
the sky goes dark and night comes in the middle of the day.

46
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.930
It's a really spectacular,

47
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.070
the stars actually come out and around the sun.

48
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:16.750
This faint but beautiful halo is visible.
That's the sun's atmosphere.

49
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.310
Usually we don't see the suns that seekers,
his sons main bodies so bright.

50
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.470
But when the main body of the sun is actually totally eclipsed,

51
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.170
then the faint atmosphere becomes visible.
Uh,

52
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.560
we'll talk more about that atmosphere a little while,
but then eventually,

53
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:35.740
and in this case only two and a half minutes later,

54
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.100
but eventually the moon moves away from being directly in front of the sun.

55
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.760
And after,
uh,
the moon moves completely off the sun,

56
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.730
the sun is restored to its former glory.

57
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.130
That's the sequence of events.

58
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.460
Now for those of you who are interested in seeing the total eclipse,

59
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.840
here's the big event before the eclipse,

60
00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:04.841
we comes total here you see a flash of light from the very last valley around

61
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:11.350
the mountains of the moon,
which is learning sunlight through.

62
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.190
People call this the diamond ring effect cause it looks like there's a,

63
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.720
a ring of light already.
And then one flash in that valley,

64
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.180
which makes for the diamond in the diamond ring.

65
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.840
So this is your clue that the eclipse is about to go total.

66
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.380
Where do we have a total eclipse?
Then?
As I say,

67
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:33.250
the faint atmosphere of the sun comes out.
This is taken through a telescope.

68
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.370
So here we can actually see prominences great tongues of hot material,

69
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.170
the jet out from the surface of the sun,
some fallback,

70
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.410
some are released into space.

71
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.290
Here's the situation for the dark eclipse spot on earth on August 21 it starts

72
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:57.940
out in the Pacific,
then moves across the country,
uh,

73
00:04:57.941 --> 00:05:02.941
going diagonally down until it reaches South Carolina where it then goes off the

74
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:07.180
United States and into the Atlantic Ocean.

75
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.750
Here's a list of states which are going to be seeing the total eclipse.

76
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.840
But remember not all of each of these states is going to see it only a 60 to 70

77
00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:21.280
mile wide path.
By the way,

78
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.310
all these slides are part of a free booklet that I'm going to tell you at toward

79
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.750
the end of the talk,
how you can get off the web.

80
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.460
So if you want to send that map or the little charts that I'm going to show you

81
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.800
to friends,
relatives,
colleagues,

82
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.590
there'll be a way to get all this information out.

83
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:43.520
You don't need to take notes and I promise this won't be on the quiz.
Um,
but,
uh,

84
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.740
these are the states where it's visible.
And,
um,
the

85
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.480
interesting thing about the eclipse is that no major metropolitan area,

86
00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.710
we'll see the total.
I pay any corner of Saint Louis.

87
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.690
We'll have a total eclipse.
Nashville,
Tennessee,
we'll have the total eclipse,

88
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.990
but mostly it's small towns,

89
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.970
rural areas,
national parks,
state parks,
et Cetera.

90
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.340
So this is going to be non urban eclipse for the most part.

91
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.380
I think airbnb is going to clean up on this eclipse because there are many more

92
00:06:23.381 --> 00:06:25.870
private residences and farms.

93
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.400
Then there are major hotels in the can zone.
Here,
for example,

94
00:06:30.401 --> 00:06:34.330
is our nearest state,
which has a total eclipse that's Oregon.

95
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.400
And you'll notice that in Oregon are the eclipse is not going to go over

96
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.390
Portland,
the big city.

97
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.530
It's not going to go over Eugene where the University of Oregon is.

98
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.420
It's going to go through central Oregon and a relatively small talents for the

99
00:06:49.421 --> 00:06:52.150
most part in central Oregon.
Um,

100
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.970
<v 2>yeah,</v>

101
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.970
<v 0>the towns that do get the total eclipse are beside themselves with excitement.</v>

102
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:00.630
For example,

103
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.660
Hopkinsville Kentucky is going to have the longest eclipse just by the geometry

104
00:07:06.991 --> 00:07:10.140
of these Dell have two minutes and 40 seconds of a coach.

105
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.460
So they're already advertising the most exciting two minutes and 40 seconds in

106
00:07:14.461 --> 00:07:18.300
astronomy,
which is a takeoff on the Kentucky Derby,

107
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.650
which is in Kentucky,
which is the most exciting two minutes in sports.

108
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.240
Um,
so

109
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:26.723
<v 2>the</v>

110
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.980
<v 0>calculations by Michael Zeiler cryptographer,</v>

111
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
a geographer indicate that about 12 million Americans live within the path of

112
00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:40.780
the total solar eclipse,
which is about 4% of the country.

113
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:46.290
So if a couple of hundred thousand visitors come into that area and join the

114
00:07:48.941 --> 00:07:53.140
people already living there to enjoy the eclipse,
that should be fine.

115
00:07:53.141 --> 00:07:56.260
And there have been many,
many eclipse.

116
00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:01.460
I Fitzy are not those who have been planning for years to go into this eclipse

117
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.660
zone.
So that's not the problem.

118
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.140
Here's what we are definitely scared about 47 million Americans live within a

119
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.340
hundred mile drive of the eclipse.

120
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:21.630
And so if in Mobile America right where we are,

121
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.430
so many people have cars,

122
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:30.130
10 million of these people decide the last weekend.
Hey honey,

123
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.280
let's grab the kids,
put them in the car,

124
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.100
drive a hundred miles and we'll see the eclipse.

125
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:41.370
Those 10 million additional people will completely overwhelmed the services,

126
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:47.140
the roads,
et cetera.
In that rural area of the country.

127
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:52.100
I won't even begin to think of how many people live 200 miles within the

128
00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:55.530
eclipse,
which many of us drive when we have to.
Uh,

129
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.270
so it's going to be a real problem.

130
00:08:57.271 --> 00:09:00.300
And here's the biggest issue in everyone's mind.

131
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.400
And seriously,

132
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.870
if they're an extra million to 10 million people in those areas,

133
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.680
where are they going to go to the bathroom?
Right?

134
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.670
All the porter potties in those states have already been spoken for,

135
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.570
but there are serious concern that they may not be enough facilities.

136
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.780
So what we're telling people is don't leave your eclipse planning for the last

137
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.560
minute.
Those people wise enough,
like all of you listening to this talk,

138
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.250
Dev advanced notice of the eclipse,
please,

139
00:09:32.251 --> 00:09:35.940
planner hand tried to be where the eclipses total.

140
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.030
If you're going to see it the day before,
not that morning,

141
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.510
because that morning we're expected to look like this.

142
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:47.490
And this is of course misleading because look at all the lanes on this crowded

143
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:52.380
freeway.
Most of the roads in the subzone or nothing like this,

144
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:56.520
they're not freeways there.
Small roads,
country roads,

145
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.740
one lane,
two lane places.

146
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.860
So it's going to be a real challenge navigating just before and just after the

147
00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:08.940
eclipse.
Now the rest of the country is going to see a partial eclipse.

148
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.370
If you are off this dark spot,

149
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.340
then the sun will not completely be covered.

150
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.390
The moon will only cover part of the sun.
But in the United States,

151
00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:22.830
pretty much everywhere or substantial bite will be taken out of the sun.

152
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.360
And this eclipse,
the partial eclipse will be visible.

153
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:32.361
Rethink the almost 500 million people in North America because Canada and Mexico

154
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.400
and even parts of the,
uh,
uh,
countries below Mexico,

155
00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:40.530
south of Mexico will be able to see it.

156
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:44.370
So my 500 million people will be able to see the,

157
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.810
the partial eclipse.
And because when the eclipse is partial,

158
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.300
the sun is still out.

159
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.570
It's dangerous to look at for any length of time.

160
00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:00.080
So we would really need some way to teach all those 500 million people how to

161
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:02.790
observe the eclipse safely.

162
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:08.270
And I'm on the National Task Force of the American Astronomical Society,

163
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.430
which has been working for two years to prepare the country for the eclipse.

164
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.550
And this is what we look like at typical meetings,
right?

165
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.260
500 million people.
One are we going to do about all those people?

166
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:26.790
They're all going to need some way to protect their eyes and the best his

167
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:31.620
glasses are there are inexpensive paper and plastic glasses,

168
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.430
which are perfect for protecting your eyes.
Those,
uh,

169
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.060
Google employees who are the good sense to actually physically come to the

170
00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:42.750
lecture,
have gotten free glasses.
Uh,
the rest of you there,

171
00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:47.460
I will leave the counter,
do explain how people can get glasses.
What glasses are.

172
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.200
One easy way to do this.

173
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:55.310
Now let me show you the circumstances of the partial eclipse for the largest

174
00:11:56.651 --> 00:12:01.240
cities in the United States.
They're really quite interesting.
Um,
and again,

175
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:02.770
if you want to have this chart,

176
00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:06.280
it'll be in the free booklet that I tell you about a little bit later.

177
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.630
But notice in New York City,
uh,
just look at the last column,

178
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:15.490
71% of the sun's area will be covered.
That's not bad.

179
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.990
Oh,
Los Angeles,

180
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:22.050
62% of the sun or be covered here in the San Francisco Bay area,

181
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.980
76% of the sun will be covered.

182
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:32.130
And in Washington DC the cover up will be about 81% and that's pretty typical of

183
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:38.490
the cover up in Washington DC?
No,
no,
I didn't say that.

184
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.120
Here in the San Francisco Bay area,

185
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.510
here are the circumstances of the clips.

186
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:51.100
So the partial eclipse for us begins at nine oh one when most people are

187
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:52.570
arriving at work.

188
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:57.930
The eclipses that maximum three quarters of the sun covered at 10:15 AM and it's

189
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:02.030
all over by 11:37 AM.

190
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.350
So if you're planning for that Monday in August,

191
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:10.660
the crucial times here in the bay area will be from about 10 to ten third.

192
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:15.610
That's what I would make a special point of being outside with the glasses and

193
00:13:15.611 --> 00:13:16.630
looking at the sun.

194
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:21.010
A large dark bite will be taken out of the sun,

195
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.160
the sun,
the Sunny d.
If it's a sunny day,

196
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.400
when you're looking big will look like a more cloudy day.

197
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:32.440
As the moon goes across the,
um,

198
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.750
where the eclipse is total,
uh,
there will be a much more spectacular.

199
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:42.650
But again,
as I mentioned,
only up small,
uh,
said,
oh,

200
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:47.260
relatively small towns will get to see the total eclipse.
Ah,

201
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:52.120
Salem,
Oregon,
Casper,
Wyoming,
St Joseph,
Missouri,
Carbondale,

202
00:13:52.121 --> 00:13:56.470
Illinois.
They are going nuts in Carbondale,
Illinois.

203
00:13:56.471 --> 00:14:00.550
This is the biggest thing that's happening in Carbondale,
Illinois.

204
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.953
Um,

205
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:06.760
another big factor in terms of your enjoyment of this eclipse,

206
00:14:06.761 --> 00:14:09.400
whether it's total or partial,
is the weather.

207
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:14.020
If it's completely cloudy or as often happens in San Francisco,

208
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:18.130
completely foggy,
you will not be able to joy.
Enjoy the eclipse.

209
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.930
So the world's expert on eclipse or weather is Jay Anderson,

210
00:14:22.931 --> 00:14:25.510
this jovial Canadian meteorologist.

211
00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:30.580
He has a whole website updating the weather constantly called [inaudible] dot

212
00:14:30.581 --> 00:14:34.090
com.
But you don't need to go to his website,
all the other websites,

213
00:14:34.091 --> 00:14:38.860
steal the information from him and put it up because he's been keeping track of

214
00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:43.861
decades of weather on August 21 to be able to make a statistical prediction for

215
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:49.900
the likelihood of cloud cover in any place on August 21.

216
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:54.440
And here's a quick of his most recent,

217
00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.590
our findings on this chart.

218
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.700
You go from left to right across the United States.

219
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.110
So the Pacific coast is on the left,
the Atlantic coast is on the right.

220
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.950
And then up and down the further up you go,

221
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.140
the more likelihood of cloud cover.

222
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.280
So you can see the red line on this chart.
Basically,

223
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:21.400
there's a great variation from less than 40% in Oregon and parts of Idaho don't,

224
00:15:23.451 --> 00:15:28.451
almost 80% in South Carolina in terms of the likelihood of cloud cover.

225
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.880
So those of you on the West Coast here,

226
00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:36.550
congratulations for picking the better coast for eclipse when,
um,

227
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.470
but this'll be an important factor.
And again,

228
00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:44.471
our fear is that if there are thousands of people in some total eclipse location

229
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.560
who have planned for years to be there for this sky spectacular and in Ghana

230
00:15:51.501 --> 00:15:55.700
location,
the clouds come,
they're not going to be okay with that.

231
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.460
They're going to want to move.
Right.

232
00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.840
And these herds of people will try to get out of the cloudy area too where it's

233
00:16:02.841 --> 00:16:07.841
sunny and there'll be incredible gridlock in terms of cars or people trying to

234
00:16:08.151 --> 00:16:10.960
walk or anything like that.
So,
uh,

235
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.890
paying attention in advanced to the weather predictions is also a good idea as

236
00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:19.820
you're making your clips plans.
Now,
as I say,

237
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:24.880
this will be a Monday in August and from the best weekend pal,

238
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:30.700
about half the schools in the United States will be in session and half the

239
00:16:31.101 --> 00:16:32.030
schools won't.

240
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:37.570
So half the kids will be with their parents and half the kids will be with their

241
00:16:37.641 --> 00:16:42.140
teachers.
But for many school districts,
that's the first day of instruction.

242
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:46.220
That's true.
For example,
in San Francisco and Oakland,
both of them have,

243
00:16:46.221 --> 00:16:50.570
the first day of school will be August 21 so you can just imagine this,

244
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.100
the kids come in and as a WHO's my teacher or here's my teacher,
he's a teacher,

245
00:16:55.101 --> 00:16:57.620
gives that name and that says,
okay,
now there's an eclipse.

246
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.190
What are they going to do?
Are they going to go outside where they be ready,

247
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.830
where they'd be prepared?
I,
and we have no idea.

248
00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.060
We'd been working with teachers for two years.
Uh,

249
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:13.090
we've been doing seminars and webinars and training workshops and putting out

250
00:17:13.521 --> 00:17:18.470
materials.
I'll tell you more about that in a second.
But still,
for the most part,

251
00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:20.000
particularly in elementary schools,

252
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.210
most teachers are not yet aware that the eclipse is happening.

253
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.310
And like many members of the public,

254
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:30.080
they may have only wake up to this relatively close to the eclipse itself when

255
00:17:30.081 --> 00:17:33.380
the mainstream media begin to make a big deal of this.

256
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.560
So if you know where your children are going to be that day,

257
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:43.460
try to make preparations for them to be safe and educated.

258
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.980
That is to have information available.

259
00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.130
Many people who get information about the eclipse,

260
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.840
one of these talks that I'm giving all over the web,

261
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:55.200
we're encouraging them to share that with their child's teacher,

262
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.810
to make sure that the teachers are aware of what's happening.

263
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.610
Maybe see if the teacher or the school can order Goss's eclipse glasses for the

264
00:18:02.611 --> 00:18:06.570
whole class,
uh,
help them out if they can't and,
uh,

265
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.670
take a look at what's going on.
Um,

266
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.990
now I have an update thing here on my screen.

267
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.870
Uh,
can you help me with that one?

268
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.550
Okay,
great.
All right.
So,
um,

269
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:27.920
there's a lot of misinformation out there about the eclipse already.
Uh,

270
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.410
for example,
people get mixed up between a lunar and a solar eclipse,

271
00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:37.490
a solar eclipse.
As long as the sun is out,

272
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:42.170
it's relatively dangerous to look at.
And you need your glasses.

273
00:18:42.171 --> 00:18:44.540
And we've known this for some time.
Uh,

274
00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:48.440
this is a headline from 1918.

275
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.370
That was the last time an eclipse cross the United States.

276
00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:57.260
And it's a thousands for glasses.
It's fun to watch your clips.

277
00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:01.790
Very relevant today except cross out the thousands and write million.

278
00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.740
MMM,
I'm sorry.

279
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.330
Is that a similar path?
It's a,
we'd have to calculate.

280
00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:13.530
All right,

281
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:18.530
so it comes to classes are available from two companies in the United States and

282
00:19:20.461 --> 00:19:23.520
American paper optic and rainbows to beneath.

283
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.610
But of course they're overwhelmed with orders.
Uh,

284
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.370
so the earlier you can order your eclipse glasses,

285
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:33.240
the better the cub scouts and there will also be available in many other places.

286
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.920
Every Science Museum has the Foothill College Bookstore has them.

287
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.460
I'm sure that a hardware stores will have them.

288
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:46.580
There's talk of Walmart perhaps having someone who has it

289
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.010
three groceries.
So people have ordered them and it's sort of a chance.

290
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:58.190
But of course we worried quite a bit about how to distribute glasses to people

291
00:19:58.951 --> 00:20:03.420
who are,
may not be prepared for this,
who will need them.

292
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:07.890
And,
um,
I actually thought to myself,

293
00:20:07.891 --> 00:20:12.891
where could we distribute glasses to people who don't usually get to share in

294
00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:15.000
events like this?

295
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:19.170
And that's where we hit on this great idea of public libraries.

296
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:23.760
Public libraries are in the information distribution business.

297
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:29.150
And so if we could somehow get glasses to public libraries,

298
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.740
that would be really,
really wonderful.

299
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:36.210
And so I'm really pleased to say that you guys,
Google,

300
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.870
uh,
joined with a foundation here on the peninsula,

301
00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:43.290
the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation,
and you,

302
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.940
through your generosity,

303
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:50.120
we have now distributed 2 million eclipse glasses free of charge to public

304
00:20:50.711 --> 00:20:52.450
libraries around the country.

305
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:56.650
And I want to applaud all of you at Google for doing this.
Calvin,

306
00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:01.480
thank you so much for being an important part of this.
Uh,
and uh,

307
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:05.500
here's a now no longer a current map,

308
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:10.501
but it just gives you an the first 2000 eclipse glasses libraries.

309
00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:15.490
We're now up to 5,000 libraries.
And by the way,

310
00:21:15.491 --> 00:21:19.840
inspired by how popular this program has been and what you guys have done,

311
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.940
NASA has now come in and donated another hundred thousand glasses.

312
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:29.230
So we hope to be up to 6,000 libraries within the next week.

313
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.840
So people at 6,000 libraries around the country,

314
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.730
we'll be able to get free glasses and,

315
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:38.200
and we've sent them information booklets and ways to have eclipse events at each

316
00:21:38.201 --> 00:21:40.450
library.
And I've liked,
I was telling Calvin,

317
00:21:40.451 --> 00:21:45.451
I've been speaking at libraries around the bay area and at every library,

318
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.520
it's been standing room only.

319
00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.640
There's been just tremendous interest in the eclipse.

320
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.820
We're getting some help from the U s postal service.

321
00:21:55.230 --> 00:22:00.230
The US Postal Service issued an eclipse stamp on June 20th which is the first

322
00:22:00.641 --> 00:22:05.320
ever Therma chromic ink stamp.
And you all know what that means,

323
00:22:05.321 --> 00:22:10.000
right?
No,
I had no,
what the heck is thermo chromatic?
But it's really cool.

324
00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.870
It turns out there's an ink.
If you touch it,

325
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.660
the picture changes.
So if you're,

326
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.020
the heat of your finger touches the stamp on the left,

327
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:25.210
it turns into the stamp on the right.
And this is a real collector's item.

328
00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.000
Any post offices already out,

329
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:33.130
but you can always order the stamps at the u s postal service website,

330
00:22:33.131 --> 00:22:38.131
uspss.gov if you want to get your own souvenir eclipse stamp.

331
00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.790
All right.
So as I say,
you guys will have your glasses,

332
00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.280
but what about people who don't have to us as,

333
00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:49.610
what are some safe ways of observing the eclipse if you don't happen to have

334
00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:54.040
access to these?
Uh,
paper and plastic glasses.
Well,

335
00:22:54.041 --> 00:22:58.030
there are a number of things you can do.
If you have a tripod with binoculars,

336
00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.760
you can cover up one half of the binoculars,

337
00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.670
make a sun shade around the other half,

338
00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:08.910
and then project an image through the binoculars onto a white sheet of paper.

339
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:14.920
The Sun Shade makes for a dark background on which you can see the eclipse.

340
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.390
So if you aren't comfortable and familiar with setting that up,

341
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.010
that's one way to do it.

342
00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:26.250
A much simpler way to safely view the eclipse of you to have glasses is to take

343
00:23:26.441 --> 00:23:30.400
a hand mirror or a woman's compact mirror,

344
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:35.920
cover it with cardboard leaving only a hole about the size of a die.

345
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.980
And then take that small mirror,

346
00:23:38.981 --> 00:23:43.981
the leftover mirror part and projected an image reflected image onto a wall.

347
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:51.010
So you try to get the sun into the mirror and then make an image appear on a

348
00:23:52.881 --> 00:23:55.880
wall where a number of people,
I'm looking at it now,

349
00:23:55.970 --> 00:24:00.970
don't try this for the first time on August 21 it takes a little practice to be

350
00:24:01.491 --> 00:24:02.300
able to do it.

351
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:07.300
So what I would do is to go out on August 20th or August 18 and see where you're

352
00:24:08.901 --> 00:24:12.830
going to be on August 21st bring this covered mirror with you.

353
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.870
Practice until you're good at it.

354
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.530
And that Monday you will be the hero of your neighborhood.

355
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.180
When you get to make a publicly viewable image on a nearby wall.

356
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:27.980
Um,
if you have nothing else,
you can make a pin hole projector,

357
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:32.300
just have a piece of cardboard with a pin hole in it and then an image of the

358
00:24:32.301 --> 00:24:35.720
sun on another sheet of paper sub distance away.

359
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:40.700
But the image is really small and as long as this is the way you want to see the

360
00:24:40.701 --> 00:24:44.690
eclipse,
I have a much better suggestion.
A colander,

361
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.400
colander is full of little pin holes.

362
00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.530
Take bring your colanders what you wash the fruit and vegetables in,
right?

363
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:58.810
Bringing a colander with you on August 21 hold the colander over your shoulder

364
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:05.740
with the sun at your back and the shadow you make on the pavement.

365
00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:11.140
We'll show lots and lots of pinhole images of the eclipse sun and it is really

366
00:25:11.181 --> 00:25:15.290
spectacular.
People come over and look at you like you're a magician,

367
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:20.410
and then when you're done,
it's a nice fashion accessory to keep the sun off.

368
00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:25.220
So I suggest everybody bring our calendar to work on August 21.

369
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:27.350
Um,

370
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:32.350
but one way or another we want to urge people please to not just protect your

371
00:25:32.661 --> 00:25:33.380
eyes,

372
00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:38.380
but make sure the eyes of everyone you know are safely protected on that day.

373
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:43.550
Sunglasses are not enough.
Even if they're polarized,

374
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:47.420
the various things that people have talked about,
smoke glass and so on,

375
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:49.730
then not good enough to protect your eyes.

376
00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:53.180
The only other thing that works is welder's glass.

377
00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:58.420
If you have a welder friend welder's glass number 14 or greater,

378
00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:03.450
we'll also do it,
but it's gotta be number 14 or greater.
Otherwise,
uh,

379
00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:07.340
either a projected image or eclipse glasses is the way to go.

380
00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.380
Now as you've heard,

381
00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:14.610
we've been working with teachers in particular with the National Science

382
00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.400
Teachers Association for about two years,
getting information out.
Um,

383
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.390
and they've been really great at it.

384
00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:25.380
We have a book called solar science that we put together for teachers.
Um,

385
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.970
and it's full of activities that teachers can do in the classroom.

386
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:34.180
But I bring that up because part of that book was an eight page Layman's terms,

387
00:26:34.971 --> 00:26:39.971
nontechnical plain English introduction to the eclipse and the national science

388
00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:45.550
teachers association has very kindly put this entire eight page booklet up on

389
00:26:45.841 --> 00:26:50.490
the web free of charge for anyone.
For those of you here in the room,

390
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.240
it's on your pink sheet that you got,
but for everyone else,

391
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:58.320
this is how you get to that free nontechnical brochure,

392
00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:02.160
which has all the tables of when and where the eclipse is visible.

393
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:03.970
You just go to Ennis,

394
00:27:03.971 --> 00:27:08.971
ta.org and SD has national science teachers association and sta.org forward

395
00:27:12.571 --> 00:27:17.160
slash solar science.
And you can download that booklet.
It's free.

396
00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.740
You can pat.
It's a pdf file.
Please,

397
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:23.730
please feel free to send it on to other people.
You know,

398
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:27.720
if you have people all around the country who are not yet aware of the eclipse,

399
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.920
please share the booklet with them.
It's,
it's a public service.
Um,

400
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.350
one shameless plug.

401
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:39.300
We have written a book then in shots and I've written a children's book called

402
00:27:39.301 --> 00:27:43.920
when the Sun goes dark,
uh,
which is in the form of a story.

403
00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:47.940
Uh,
two grandparents in the story are eclipse chasers.

404
00:27:47.941 --> 00:27:52.770
They look at eclipses for a hobby and they explained to the grandkids what's

405
00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:55.890
happening with eclipses and as part of the story.

406
00:27:56.390 --> 00:28:01.390
And we suggest a series of activities that families can do with kids to get the

407
00:28:01.561 --> 00:28:05.670
kids ready for the eclipse.
So for example,
you can use a light bulb,

408
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.990
a tennis ball,
and a kid's head to simulate and eclipse.

409
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:13.800
So there are various family activities in there.
Uh,
some of you who came earlier,

410
00:28:13.801 --> 00:28:16.800
you've got sample copies of the book.
Um,

411
00:28:16.801 --> 00:28:21.220
and please share that with a kid or,
or a school,
uh,

412
00:28:21.221 --> 00:28:24.770
if you're not into children's books.
But,
uh,

413
00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.270
this has a quite a bit of good information,

414
00:28:27.271 --> 00:28:31.950
not just about solar eclipses but lunar eclipses as well.
Um,

415
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:36.120
so I want to just briefly mentioned some citizen science projects connected with

416
00:28:36.121 --> 00:28:39.920
the eclipse.
And uh,
this is the one that you guys are very much involved in.

417
00:28:39.921 --> 00:28:44.130
In Calvin Johnson has taken a great leadership role in this.
Um,

418
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:49.000
the eclipse mega movie project,
a photographers,
uh,

419
00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:54.050
around the entire total eclipse zone are going to send wirelessly pictures of

420
00:28:56.011 --> 00:29:01.011
the total eclipse with the atmosphere of the sun showing wireless lead to Google

421
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:06.830
and a team at Google is going to stitch together pictures from all around the

422
00:29:07.111 --> 00:29:12.111
country into what's called a mega movie and a continuous movies showing what the

423
00:29:13.291 --> 00:29:17.220
son was like as the eclipse moved across the United States.

424
00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:22.490
Now the eclipse takes one hour and 37 minutes to go from Oregon to South

425
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.520
Carolina.
That's a lot less time than United,
right?

426
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.620
One hour and 37 minutes to go across the country.
But during that one hour,

427
00:29:31.621 --> 00:29:35.180
37 minutes,
the sun's atmosphere varies quite a bit.
It's,

428
00:29:35.181 --> 00:29:37.920
it's a variable active,
seizing,

429
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:41.010
energetic kind of region around the sun.

430
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:46.200
And so we will have an hour and a half record of what the son was doing during

431
00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:47.891
this time.

432
00:29:47.891 --> 00:29:52.720
It's really a very ambitious project that I'm delighted you guys are putting it

433
00:29:52.721 --> 00:29:55.990
together and then it's going to be available publicly when it's done,

434
00:29:55.991 --> 00:29:59.800
which is very nice.
So not just scientists,
but everyone in the country.

435
00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:04.760
We would be able to share in this wonderful movie.
Um,
another,
uh,

436
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.620
citizen science project is called life responds.

437
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:12.850
It comes from the California Academy of Sciences and Golden Gate Park.

438
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:16.900
And what they're looking at is animal reactions to the eclipse.

439
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:21.370
We have a lot of anecdotal evidence about animal reactions,
for example,

440
00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.760
because the sky suddenly goes dark.

441
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:30.270
Many farm animals think it's nighttime and they do the thing they usually do at

442
00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:34.160
nighttime,
which is gold toward the barn or whatever they do.
Um,
eh,

443
00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:38.950
but their stomach and their eyes are not agreeing in terms of the time of day.

444
00:30:38.951 --> 00:30:42.790
So some animals were quite confused about why it's suddenly day.

445
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:46.540
I said the day has turned into the night.
Um,
we,
as I say,

446
00:30:46.541 --> 00:30:49.010
we have lots of anecdotes about this,
but,
uh,

447
00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:54.030
what the idea here is that people were willing record animal reactions on a

448
00:30:54.791 --> 00:30:58.030
phone app and then send them into the academy.

449
00:30:58.210 --> 00:30:59.950
And instead of just anecdotes,

450
00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:05.020
we will have a database of how animals have reacted all across the eclipse path.

451
00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.100
Again,
a very interesting project.
Um,

452
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:11.230
NASA is all gung ho about the clips.

453
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:14.680
They have a special NASA website with lots of information.

454
00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:19.780
One of the things they have is what events are happening in each little city

455
00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:23.320
along the eclipse path.
So if you don't just want to go to the clips,

456
00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:27.310
where do you want to go to a music festival or when our food fair or whatever

457
00:31:27.311 --> 00:31:28.210
else is going on.

458
00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:33.390
The NASA side is collecting all the interesting events along the path of the

459
00:31:34.151 --> 00:31:39.010
eclipse.
Uh,
they also have lots of good information and uh,
uh,

460
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:40.620
maps and so on.
Uh,

461
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:46.020
the American astronomical society has a website called eclipse.aas.org and if

462
00:31:48.851 --> 00:31:53.830
you're photographing the eclipse,
uh,
not necessarily for the mega movie project,

463
00:31:53.831 --> 00:31:56.700
but just for your own enjoyment.
Uh,

464
00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:59.650
this website is probably the best to go to,

465
00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.230
to get information about photography,

466
00:32:02.231 --> 00:32:05.680
both regular still photography and video photography.

467
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.610
There's a whole section with lots of,

468
00:32:07.611 --> 00:32:11.930
lots of good information and links and safety considerations,

469
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:16.840
et cetera.
So this is a very reliable site in general for clips information.

470
00:32:16.841 --> 00:32:21.430
It clips dot Aas.
Dot.
O r.
G.
Well,

471
00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:22.150
uh,

472
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:27.150
just a word about why eclipses are such a big deal and we don't get them that

473
00:32:27.281 --> 00:32:28.540
often.
Um,

474
00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:34.050
this is another feature of the solar system that many people are not aware of.

475
00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:39.510
The Moon's orbit is tilted relative to everybody else's orbit.

476
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.761
If you,
for example,

477
00:32:40.761 --> 00:32:45.740
consider the orbit that we make around the sun and then you look at the orbit of

478
00:32:45.741 --> 00:32:48.530
the moon,
it's stilted by about five degrees.

479
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:54.190
And that tilt means that as the moon goes around us and the moon,

480
00:32:54.381 --> 00:32:58.400
by the way,
goes around those once a moon,
you say month,

481
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:59.860
but it's really mood,
right?

482
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:05.080
The moon goes around us once a month and every month there is a time when the

483
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.360
moon and the sun are in the same general part of the sky.

484
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:10.370
But because of this tilt,

485
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:17.240
think of it as two Hula hoops because of the hill on a typical month,

486
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.050
the moon is either below the sun or above the sun.

487
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:24.050
And so there's no eclipse in a typical month.

488
00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:29.630
But as you can see in this diagram,
twice a year,
the Hula hoops cross,

489
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:35.350
so roughly every six months we have what's called eclipse season when it clips

490
00:33:35.551 --> 00:33:40.551
to become eclipses become possible because the orbit of the of the Moon crosses

491
00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.360
the orbit that we make around the sun.

492
00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:49.280
And so the result of that is that somewhere in the world and eclipse as possible

493
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:52.940
every six months,
it's not always a total eclipse.

494
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:57.530
Sometimes the moon in its orbit is a little further away and we don't completely

495
00:33:57.531 --> 00:34:01.310
cover the sun.
Sometimes the angle is such a,
we got a partial eclipse.

496
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.050
Sometimes you get a lunar eclipse,

497
00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:06.860
but generally every six months on eclipse as possible.

498
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.770
And then we often get a total eclipse,

499
00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:13.220
but not overpopulated territory,

500
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.250
two thirds of the earth's surface water.

501
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.880
And so it's very likely that a typical clips will fall over just ocean or a

502
00:34:22.821 --> 00:34:27.821
couple of barely inhabited islands and rich people usually retired.

503
00:34:27.921 --> 00:34:32.921
Rich people have time and money will often go to those places and that's their

504
00:34:33.621 --> 00:34:35.180
hobby to chase eclipses,

505
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:40.160
but very few people actually get to see the eclipse because of the way the

506
00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:41.810
geometry worked out this time.

507
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:46.990
This is a very democratic eclipse and it falls over a richly populated area

508
00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.510
which has access to the web,
right,

509
00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:55.720
and cars and so there's going to be I much greater interest in this eclipse

510
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:58.160
sizing.
Any other eclipse in history.

511
00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:01.910
This is really the first USA clips of the Internet.

512
00:35:01.911 --> 00:35:04.310
Age of the Google Age,

513
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:09.430
right information will be available to people all over the web and so we are

514
00:35:10.281 --> 00:35:10.881
very,

515
00:35:10.881 --> 00:35:15.881
very excited and scared about how much public involvement there will be in this

516
00:35:17.901 --> 00:35:19.250
eclipse.
Now,

517
00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:24.251
this is quite a contrast from times past when he clips his were not predictable

518
00:35:24.771 --> 00:35:25.880
like they are now.

519
00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:30.380
These days we can predict eclipses hundreds of years in advance,

520
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:33.410
but back when they were not predictable.
You can imagine.

521
00:35:33.411 --> 00:35:38.100
Our ancestors got pretty upset when for no reason whatsoever.

522
00:35:38.101 --> 00:35:39.150
In the middle of the day,

523
00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:44.940
the solder whiteout and the legends that we have recorded is that they thought

524
00:35:44.941 --> 00:35:47.760
some monster was eating the sun in Asia.

525
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.410
There were a lot of discussions of a dragon eating the sun,
and they said,

526
00:35:52.411 --> 00:35:53.460
what can we do?
Well,

527
00:35:53.461 --> 00:35:58.430
the idea is to absolutely frightened this monster or this dragon.
Oh,

528
00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.520
away from the sun.

529
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:03.540
That's when the tradition arose of having pots and pans with you.

530
00:36:03.541 --> 00:36:06.090
When you come out to the eclipses,
banging them together,

531
00:36:06.091 --> 00:36:09.210
making a really loud noise to frighten the Dragon,

532
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:14.770
and you know what you and always work.
That's it.
It always works.
And so the,

533
00:36:14.771 --> 00:36:17.280
the monster went away and the sun came back.

534
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:21.300
Today we enjoy eclipses for their scientific value.

535
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:25.980
Here's a little diagram showing the outer layers of the sun.

536
00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.900
Uh,
beyond that,
the photos fear the outer edge of the sun.

537
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:35.460
There are several layers,
complex energetic layers,

538
00:36:35.461 --> 00:36:39.420
including something we call the Chromos fear closer to the sun.

539
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:43.500
And then the giant outer atmosphere of the sun called the corona.

540
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:48.630
And you'll notice here on the side that the corona is hotter than the inner

541
00:36:48.631 --> 00:36:51.480
atmosphere and the surface of the sun.

542
00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:57.260
That's fascinating that the outermost atmosphere should be harder than the inner

543
00:36:57.721 --> 00:37:01.770
layers of the sun's surface.
And the answer is magnetism.

544
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:06.950
There's tremendous magnetic activity in the outer layers and the outer

545
00:37:07.591 --> 00:37:08.940
atmosphere of the sun.

546
00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:14.040
And the result is that it can heat up the particles in the corona and the outer

547
00:37:14.041 --> 00:37:16.140
layers to tremendous temperatures.

548
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:20.220
Sometimes those particles actually boil off the sun.
There's the,

549
00:37:20.221 --> 00:37:25.221
when a gentle regular wind of partner goes blowing away from the hot outer

550
00:37:25.531 --> 00:37:26.550
layers of the sun.

551
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:31.380
And then every once in a while we actually get a whole lump of material leaving

552
00:37:31.381 --> 00:37:36.381
the Karuna that's called a coronal mass ejection and it's hot charged particles

553
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.980
leaving the sun moving away from the sun had reasonably great speed.

554
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:47.700
And luckily most of the time when one of these injections happens,

555
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:51.750
it's in a random direction in the solar system where there isn't anything.

556
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:57.060
But every once in a while one of these coronal mass ejections happens to be Jack

557
00:37:57.061 --> 00:38:00.150
did right in the direction of planet earth.

558
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:04.140
And when that happens,
we have to take precautions.

559
00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:09.350
It can damage sensitive instruments on our spacecraft out in space and it can so

560
00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:15.321
overload the magnetic zone of the earth that the charge particles coming down

561
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:20.010
actually reached the surface and effect the power grid.

562
00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:25.280
We've had power outages and power surges as a result of these core coronal mass

563
00:38:25.891 --> 00:38:28.140
ejections reaching the earth.

564
00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:33.260
We call this space whether or solar storms and one of the reasons we study this

565
00:38:34.531 --> 00:38:39.531
sun during eclipses in it other times it's to learn more about predicting space

566
00:38:39.761 --> 00:38:44.320
rather were about as good at predicting space rather as we are at earth weather,

567
00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.590
which is not very satisfactory.
All right,

568
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:53.170
now I want it to show you Einstein laughing.

569
00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:57.700
Uh,
and he's laughing here because I'm talking about eclipses and I dunno if you

570
00:38:57.701 --> 00:38:58.001
know,

571
00:38:58.001 --> 00:39:03.001
but it's eclipses are particular tips in particular that made Einstein famous.

572
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:07.120
Um,
in 1916,

573
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.260
Einstein proposed one of his most outrageous ideas.

574
00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:16.530
One of the strangest theories in all of science called the general theory of

575
00:39:16.841 --> 00:39:17.770
relativity,

576
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:22.950
which predicts in very oversimplified terms terms that gravity can be thought

577
00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:27.550
of,
not just as a poll,
but as a warping,

578
00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:32.940
a distortion of the very fabric of space and time itself.

579
00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:40.050
And this was such a ridiculous sounding idea that Einstein knew that it wouldn't

580
00:39:40.061 --> 00:39:44.800
be accepted even by his colleagues unless there was some direct proof,

581
00:39:44.801 --> 00:39:49.360
some experimental proof,
that space really did warp with gravity.

582
00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:49.921
I,

583
00:39:49.921 --> 00:39:54.921
it's not calculated that the earth's gravity is so weak cosmically speaking that

584
00:39:55.751 --> 00:40:00.490
the effect was impossible to measure in 1916 from earth on earth,

585
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:01.720
from the earth's gravity.

586
00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:07.210
But he did calculate that one object in the solar system had enough gravity to

587
00:40:07.211 --> 00:40:11.680
have the warping of space near it be measurable.
And that was the sun.

588
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:17.430
And I assigned reason that if you could see beams of starlight coming right

589
00:40:17.801 --> 00:40:22.300
close to the sun,
they would travel through slightly warped space.

590
00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:26.380
Those beams of starlight would bend in that warped space.

591
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:31.480
And so if you look back down,
back to the beam,
to the origin and the beam,

592
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:36.520
you would see the stars right near the sun in the wrong place in the sky.

593
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.550
They would be slightly out of place because of this warming.

594
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:44.860
While there's a small tactical problem seeing beams of starlight come by the
sun,

595
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:48.640
what's that?
Sounds a little bright,
right?

596
00:40:48.641 --> 00:40:52.870
You can't see stars as daytime when the sun is out.
But I,
I was no dummy.

597
00:40:52.871 --> 00:40:54.490
He knew about eclipses.

598
00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:58.630
Said wait until there's any cups during the total eclipse.

599
00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:01.480
The stars actually come out near the sun.

600
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:06.040
You can see stars in the middle of the day cause the sky right above you is
dark.

601
00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:07.391
He said,

602
00:41:07.391 --> 00:41:12.391
wait til the next total eclipse and take a photograph of the eclipsed sun with

603
00:41:13.001 --> 00:41:14.650
the stars nearby showing.

604
00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:18.040
Look at the position of the stars in the sky.

605
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:22.600
Compare them to any star atlas where we have the positions of the stars.

606
00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:27.840
You will see that the stars' closest to the Sun will be in the wrong place by a

607
00:41:28.031 --> 00:41:32.650
small amount because of the warping of space.
Uh,
in 1916,

608
00:41:32.651 --> 00:41:36.380
World War One was going on.
Nobody was going on any pleasure trips,

609
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.450
but by 1919,

610
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:43.250
the world had settled its differences and there was an eclipse visible from an

611
00:41:43.251 --> 00:41:46.010
island off the coast of Africa.
Uh,

612
00:41:46.011 --> 00:41:49.730
an international team of astronomers went to that island,

613
00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:54.200
took a photo of the eclipse.
Here you see some of the,

614
00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:59.450
the newspaper versions of that photo and found that the stars were out of place

615
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:04.640
near the sun by exactly the amount I had started had predicted.

616
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.710
And this observation of the eclipse is what made Einstein famous.
Before that,

617
00:42:09.711 --> 00:42:13.670
Einstein's work was known to nerds but not to the general public.

618
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:17.000
When after 1919,
after this eclipse expedition,

619
00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:20.120
Einstein's name became public property,

620
00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:22.700
he would became the best known scientists in the world.

621
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:27.850
And I love the headline from the New York Times Lights all askew in the heavens.

622
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.230
How could you not read that article?

623
00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:34.270
Lights all askew or skewed means all over the place in the heaven.

624
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:39.470
Men of science,
right?
More or less a gog,
how can you be more or less a god,

625
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.500
either your mortgage or your loss guy?

626
00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:46.030
Over the result of eclipse ops observations.
Einstein's theory triumphs.

627
00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:47.091
All right,
well,

628
00:42:47.091 --> 00:42:52.091
let me finish up by noting that most of the time when a country has an eclipse,

629
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.850
it has to wait decades.

630
00:42:56.060 --> 00:43:00.230
Maybe centuries before another eclipse comes its way.

631
00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:03.890
But here in the United States,
we are very lucky.

632
00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.100
It turns out if you miss this eclipse,

633
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:10.850
there will be another eclipse in only seven years,

634
00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:15.230
seven years.
Um,
put the,
the,
the date,

635
00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:19.790
put this on your social calendar is April 8th,

636
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:24.020
2024 there will be another eclipse crossing the country.
You can see,
uh,

637
00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:28.910
on this diagram that across crosses in an x shape relative to this eclipse.

638
00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:33.260
This eclipse is being shown from Oregon to South Carolina here.

639
00:43:33.261 --> 00:43:36.620
It's going to come Mexico to Canada,

640
00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.590
but it's going to cross the United States as well.

641
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:43.700
And so we will have another opportunity to use the glasses.

642
00:43:43.701 --> 00:43:48.350
You got to explain things to the kids and enjoy an eclipse,

643
00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.590
uh,
on,
uh,
in only seven years

644
00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:58.970
old.
It turns out the place where it crosses his Carbondale,

645
00:43:58.971 --> 00:44:03.610
Illinois.
That's why they're so excited.
All right.

646
00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:09.130
That's all right.
So,
um,
the out,

647
00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:13.520
this is the sky during the eclipse this time in August 21.

648
00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.720
I'm not going to go through this,
but I will point out the,

649
00:44:16.721 --> 00:44:20.030
just to the right of the eclipse sun is Venus.

650
00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:24.770
So there will be one bright spot that everyone can recognize as an eclipse

651
00:44:24.771 --> 00:44:28.310
happens just to the right of the sun is the planet Venus.

652
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:34.290
Well,
I hope I've given you a lot to chew on,
uh,
during this,
uh,

653
00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:39.630
during this discussion.
But I do want to say that,
uh,

654
00:44:39.631 --> 00:44:43.890
one of the great things about the Internet is that there's all this information

655
00:44:43.891 --> 00:44:44.724
available.

656
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:48.300
One of the things that worries all of us about the Internet is that there's a

657
00:44:48.301 --> 00:44:53.100
lot of misinformation available and there's already a lot of discussion on the

658
00:44:53.101 --> 00:44:56.250
Internet that this eclipse is the end of the world.

659
00:44:56.430 --> 00:45:00.510
The terrible things are going to happen at some sort of prophecy,
et cetera.

660
00:45:00.511 --> 00:45:04.050
So let's try to,
to not worry about those things.

661
00:45:04.051 --> 00:45:06.150
This is a perfectly natural phenomenon.

662
00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.620
The world will continue for good or for bad after the eclipse,

663
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:14.640
if you like us are a little overwhelmed by the eclipse experience.

664
00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:18.690
There's always a little bit of this to take care of the problem,

665
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.120
but more seriously,

666
00:45:21.121 --> 00:45:26.121
I want to wish all of you cause you're a skies and good companions on August

667
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.420
21st thank you very much.

668
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:38.180
Should I answer questions?
What?
I don't know how things work from the all time.

669
00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:41.660
Great.
Yes,

670
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:48.503
<v 3>yes.</v>

671
00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:53.690
<v 4>Well these also be useful for watching the occasional sunrise and sunset.</v>

672
00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:54.581
<v 0>Yes.
So the,</v>

673
00:45:54.581 --> 00:45:58.840
the good thing about these glasses is that you can use them to watch the sun

674
00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.400
anytime.
So here are the glasses,
right?
These are the Google ones,
right?
I,
yes,

675
00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:04.870
like lifts mega movie,
Google.

676
00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:08.200
So you can use these gases to watch the sun ain't got,

677
00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:12.040
the main thing to watch out for is that that especially if you're working with

678
00:46:12.041 --> 00:46:12.610
kids,

679
00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:17.290
that they don't crinkle or put any holes into the material that's in front of

680
00:46:17.291 --> 00:46:22.120
your eyes.
As long as that material is intact,
it's long lasting.
You can use it.

681
00:46:22.121 --> 00:46:25.990
You can look at the sun for a long period of time and not hurt yourself.
And yes,

682
00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:31.120
when the sun is again active right now we're what we call solar minimum.

683
00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:36.340
The Sun's activity is at its lowest level in the 11 year cycle of solar

684
00:46:36.341 --> 00:46:40.330
activity,
but in five or six years when we to reach solar maximum,

685
00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:42.640
when there are lots of sunspots groups on the sun,

686
00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.440
this is perfectly okay for watching the sun,
uh,

687
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:49.780
and seeing sunspots or just watching during the sunrise or sunset.

688
00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:50.953
Absolutely.

689
00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:53.490
<v 4>So couple of quick questions.
Uh,</v>

690
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:57.220
what would you recommend for people wear glasses can be used,
this kind of thing.

691
00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.970
And the other question is,
do,
can you watch the total,

692
00:47:00.971 --> 00:47:03.580
I mean the entirety of the eclipse with these losses or do you recommend just

693
00:47:03.581 --> 00:47:06.490
watching it for a few seconds and watching again?
Great.

694
00:47:06.491 --> 00:47:07.630
So this is really important.

695
00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:11.590
<v 0>First of all,
if you're wear glasses,
just put these in front of your glasses.</v>

696
00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:13.510
That's what I do is I keep my,

697
00:47:13.511 --> 00:47:16.600
God says I'm cause otherwise everything is fuzzy in the world.
Right?

698
00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:19.570
And so I just put these in front of my glasses and there's no problem.

699
00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:24.170
But so let's you're really clear about when you need the glasses do when you

700
00:47:24.171 --> 00:47:28.910
don't,
any time the sun is out,
you need the glasses.

701
00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:33.130
Anytime there's a total eclipse,
put the glasses away.
You don't need them.

702
00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:38.580
So for those people going to the eclipse path for the two minutes of the

703
00:47:39.701 --> 00:47:41.830
eclipse,
don't use the glasses.

704
00:47:41.831 --> 00:47:45.400
You'll miss all the beautiful thing phenomena in the Scott.

705
00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:50.410
You only need the glasses when the sun is out.
Um,
now one more.

706
00:47:50.411 --> 00:47:52.360
Where as long as you've given me this opportunity,

707
00:47:52.361 --> 00:47:55.960
let me say one more word about observing the eclipse.

708
00:47:56.110 --> 00:48:00.340
If you're going to go and see the total eclipse,
I've already said,
plan ahead.

709
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:05.410
Make sure when you're there in the crowded zone,
you have gas for your car,

710
00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:07.960
you have some food and drink with you,
et cetera.

711
00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:13.320
But also don't try to take a photograph if this is your first eclipse.

712
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:20.100
The phenomenon itself is overwhelmingly beautiful.

713
00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:24.400
It's eerie,
it's all other world.
If you've never seen an eclipse,

714
00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:28.240
it's amazing.
You suddenly see the sun go out,

715
00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.870
the stars come out,
you see this halo around the sun.

716
00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:36.160
People are just going,
oh my God,
you can,
I mean,

717
00:48:36.161 --> 00:48:39.130
it's really an amazing thing and there's only two minutes this time.

718
00:48:39.131 --> 00:48:42.550
It's a relatively shorter cubs.
Don't fiddle with equipment.

719
00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:44.230
Don't try to take pictures.

720
00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:47.920
Lots of people with lots of experience with Dick taking.
No offense.

721
00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:50.350
Much better pictures than you.
Right.

722
00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:55.420
I knew all be in the movie anyway,
so just enjoy it.

723
00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:59.530
Take the glasses off during the total part and just enjoy it.

724
00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:02.920
If you can't go to this total eclipse because you haven't planned,

725
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:07.330
then now you have seven years to plan for the next one and see if you can take

726
00:49:07.331 --> 00:49:11.620
time off to be in the 2024 eclipse.
Thank you for asking.

727
00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:14.410
Other questions,
thoughts?

728
00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:22.910
<v 5>Uh,
I was just thinking that when I was a kid,
I used to,
uh,
a solar eclipse.</v>

729
00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:25.830
It wasn't total.
He was in Europe and uh,

730
00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:28.490
in the Times that we didn't have digital cameras,

731
00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:32.900
it was easy to make those glasses because I just used the film.

732
00:49:32.901 --> 00:49:34.490
But without being imprinted.

733
00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:38.780
The film that we had and it was completely dark except for where the song was.

734
00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:43.900
<v 0>Yeah,
that's right.
In the old days,
we used to use many layers,
not just one.</v>

735
00:49:43.901 --> 00:49:47.320
I hope that many layers of portal exposed.
Phil,

736
00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:51.880
does anyone still remember Phil?
Right in the euro digital photography,

737
00:49:51.881 --> 00:49:55.660
chemical photography has got the way of the dinosaur,
but yes,

738
00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:00.760
many layers of film were thought to be.
Okay,
not so great.
It turns out this,

739
00:50:00.761 --> 00:50:03.040
this kind of plastic with Daryl is much better.

740
00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.470
<v 5>It wasn't exposed at all,</v>

741
00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.320
so it was the one that is not exposed to is completely dark,

742
00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:12.140
<v 0>completely.
Dot.
Yeah.
Never,
nevertheless,
I recommend these over.
Yup.</v>

743
00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:13.333
Absolutely.

744
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.233
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

745
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:17.800
<v 0>Can you explain what's so special about those glasses?</v>

746
00:50:17.801 --> 00:50:21.430
Was a bake off and how do they work?
Yeah.
Oh sure.

747
00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:25.300
So the glasses are just made of a,
a mylar like plastic.

748
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:28.160
What it does is it's so dark,

749
00:50:28.161 --> 00:50:33.050
it's so good at cutting light out that it cuts out both the visible light and

750
00:50:33.051 --> 00:50:37.340
the ultraviolet light of the sun.
And so normally right,

751
00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:42.460
it hurts to look at this on your eye is equipped to react to staring at the sun.

752
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:47.360
And nobody stares at the sun in their right mind.
But during an eclipse,

753
00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:52.480
astronomical enthusiasm can overwhelm common sense and people tend to look

754
00:50:52.911 --> 00:50:55.400
longer than they should.
With these glasses,

755
00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:59.600
all the rays that can hurt your eyes are cut out and you'll see if you're trying

756
00:50:59.601 --> 00:51:03.440
to put them on regularly,
you can't see anything in any normal environment.

757
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:07.220
You need the sun to be bright enough to get through these lenses.

758
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:12.370
So these are very good at cutting out the vast majority of the visible light and

759
00:51:12.561 --> 00:51:17.370
the ultraviolet light.
And as I say,
if you can't get glasses here,
um,

760
00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:21.080
many other places will have glasses.
There's a organization,

761
00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:24.590
San Francisco called the astronomical society.
The Pacific,

762
00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:29.400
they have glasses for sale to foothill college bookstore has them.
Um,

763
00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:33.080
I'm sure that the tech museum and other places around here,
we'll have them.

764
00:51:33.081 --> 00:51:35.720
So check it out if you can't get them from middle.

765
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:38.600
<v 4>And one note on that as well.
If you're a Googler,</v>

766
00:51:38.601 --> 00:51:41.420
we are sending them to a lot of remote offices.
So if you're calling,

767
00:51:41.421 --> 00:51:43.600
if you're watching the live stream,
uh,

768
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.330
we should have some at the lobby at the remote office and we're handing them out

769
00:51:47.331 --> 00:51:49.670
in building 1225 here in mountain view,

770
00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:50.920
which is where they're making sense and it

771
00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.350
<v 0>seems based,
right?</v>

772
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:57.390
So maybe I should say that Google hasn't just restricted it's generous donation

773
00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:59.350
to the library's.

774
00:51:59.351 --> 00:52:03.550
There have been many other educational projects which have received Google

775
00:52:03.551 --> 00:52:05.650
glasses.
I,
I know that for example,

776
00:52:05.651 --> 00:52:10.651
the American Astronomical Society has a project to get glasses to underserved

777
00:52:10.991 --> 00:52:14.620
minority schools to Indian reservations,
et cetera.

778
00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:18.640
And you've generously contributed glasses to that project and to many other

779
00:52:18.641 --> 00:52:20.290
educational settings.
So again,

780
00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:24.250
thanks all of you for being part of the eclipse outreach for this eclipse

781
00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:29.620
where I will thank you very much for coming and I hope this is enlightened you a

782
00:52:29.621 --> 00:52:31.580
little bit and light.
