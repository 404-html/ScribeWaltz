WEBVTT

1
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.900
Nope.
Thanks for you're welcome.
And good afternoon.
And uh,

2
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.150
I'm happy to come over here.

3
00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:22.151
I said I joined NASA Ames in 1987 so I have memory of when a Google had an SBAR

4
00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:29.900
contract,
you know,
single digits,
but uh,

5
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.400
and I live near way most.
So I get to see the parade of,
uh,

6
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.140
vehicles passing by my front yard every evening around 10 o'clock headed back

7
00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:40.520
into the mothership I guess.

8
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.180
So have a watched with some interest and I'm honored to have been asked to come

9
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:50.840
out and talk a little bit about some of what I'm doing on the other side of

10
00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:54.740
Stevens Creek along with my colleagues and peers over there.

11
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.180
So the picture behind me,

12
00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:02.450
you could argue a relates to possibly,

13
00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:04.250
maybe not self driving vehicles,

14
00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:08.150
but it is an autonomous rover and then NASA,
his case,

15
00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:13.010
we tend to use those for moving our instruments and means of,
uh,

16
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.720
gathering samples and data to far away places.
Going back to,

17
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.290
uh,
and most recent Mars history,

18
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:26.291
we've had a curiosity and the Mer rovers back in the two thousands and

19
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.370
pathfinder before that.
And,
um,

20
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.010
one of the follow ons to curiosity or to the Mars science laboratory as it was

21
00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:37.784
then called,

22
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.240
it was something called the Mars astrobiology field laboratory or AFL having

23
00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:45.750
nothing to do with football leagues.
But uh,

24
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.850
in about the 2007 or 2006 timeframe,

25
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.610
there was going to be something based on the chassis and on the technology that

26
00:01:55.611 --> 00:02:00.611
currently went into what was then going to be the 2009 Msl mission and a with a

27
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:07.451
two meter coring drill a means to handle that material and get it up from

28
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:11.270
underneath the surface and then crush pieces of it.

29
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.220
Subsample pick it apart.
And why do we want to do this?
Well,

30
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:18.320
one of the things is that we are,

31
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.610
people are interested in looking for biomarkers,

32
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.420
for signs of life in could life have existed in places other than on earth.

33
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.220
The astrobiology question
was,
oh,
we,

34
00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:35.810
this was a proposed mission to figure out where their habitable zones or at

35
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:40.811
least on Mars and how those zones might have developed and what does that tell

36
00:02:40.941 --> 00:02:44.210
us about earth as well as the evolution of Mars?

37
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.950
And to look for any specific biomarkers or uh,
evidence.

38
00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:49.910
If we found anything.

39
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.480
There were concepts of this that had went down to the point of specing

40
00:02:56.481 --> 00:03:01.270
specifying what it should include.
It had to have some means to get sample.

41
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:06.271
If you're going to look for organics or past cellular debris or anything else

42
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:10.810
that might be stuck that might give you evidence of it that was once habitable.

43
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.730
There needs to be some mains to get the sample in the first place.
So it had the,

44
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:17.640
I guess as I said,
a two meter drills,

45
00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:21.250
sample transfer could sub sample course could deliver these things to

46
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:26.110
instruments.
So self driving and self handling and self drilling.

47
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.100
However,
if you're looking for life,

48
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.290
this complicates things.

49
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.650
The current curiosity rover is not sterilized to the levels that would be

50
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:41.410
necessary to send it into what we call a uh,

51
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.750
COSPAR special region.

52
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:48.751
A special region is a place where maybe just maybe life could exist under some

53
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:52.060
conditions.

54
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.060
If you happen to introduce the right microbe and you happened to warm it up and

55
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:55.720
put it in the radio.

56
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.500
Basically places where you could maybe terraform by accident if you weren't

57
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:03.780
careful.
So we don't want to do that,
especially not unintentionally,
you know,

58
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.820
can you talk to your favorite science fiction author otherwise about the

59
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:09.130
advisability of this?
But you know,
the,

60
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:12.910
we have agreements that we are going to try to protect other planetary

61
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:16.780
environments,
not just a spoiled them as it were.
Also,

62
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:20.500
if you're looking for signs of life,
you have to make sure you're not just,
uh,

63
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.660
you know,
looking at your own foot,
so to speak,

64
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:24.920
that you're not simply discovering the microbes that you,

65
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.710
or the biomarkers you brought with you.
So contamination avoidance,

66
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.150
you have to be very,
very,
very,

67
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:35.650
very clean both to protect where you're going and to make sure that your results

68
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:40.340
have some validity.
And then how would you know if you,
you know,

69
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.770
if there was life there,
if you saw it now,

70
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:45.100
you might find weird life silicon bay store,

71
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.910
something we haven't even imagined yet.
So it's,
you know,
the,
it becomes,

72
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.490
how do you detect that something you don't know about,

73
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.360
but you can at least come up with instruments to detect earth-based life.

74
00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.540
So all of these were concepts of this astrobiology field laboratory mission that

75
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:05.290
was supposed to follow and eventually became the 2020 rover,

76
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:07.930
which is not an astrobiology field mission.

77
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.040
And maybe in the 20 twenty's we will get an AFL mission.

78
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.250
And that leads us into our ads in some sense because you know,

79
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.790
after the AFL idea was shelved,

80
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.950
there's the desire to figure out how would you look for signs of life?

81
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.620
How would you take a mobile platform,
how would you sub sample,

82
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:32.410
how would you drill those?
Those issues didn't go away.

83
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.070
So it was sort of inspired by the astrobiology field lab rover concepts starting

84
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:44.860
about 2010 after AFL is canceled and we started putting together proposals and

85
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.650
working and tinkering with them.

86
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.770
And in 2014 we put together the proposal shown here with a rover,

87
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.680
a two meter automated drill from honeybee,

88
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.050
a sample transfer arm with a scoop on the end of it.

89
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:08.051
They could either scoop material like the Phoenix mission or could take powdered

90
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:13.211
cuttings or material from the drill and carry it over to instrument.

91
00:06:13.731 --> 00:06:17.660
It could do double duty in a sense as well as instruments.

92
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.670
If you think back to those AFL calls for looking at habitability and as well as

93
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:23.660
for signs of life.

94
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.020
Well we had the a reef lie of the Phoenix's wet chemistry laboratory discovered

95
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:35.411
perchlorates on Mars and half of the exomars planned moma instrument.

96
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.740
Basically a laser disruption mass spec.

97
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.930
That way we don't have to incinerate our sample,

98
00:06:42.931 --> 00:06:45.910
so using the laser to ping it in effect,

99
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.890
we can hopefully catch the right ions and we will detect things that we

100
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:53.170
otherwise would just incinerate if we have to do parallel paralysis.
And uh,

101
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.750
he did up the Spanish solid instruments.

102
00:06:56.751 --> 00:07:00.650
Signs of life detector is an Amino Assay.

103
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.450
I sometimes joke to folks,

104
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:06.260
it's like certified [inaudible] 512 home pregnancy tests printed on a chip.

105
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.980
That's gross over oversimplification of course.
But it is an immunoassay.

106
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.750
You're looking for a specific molecules or specific compounds specific to

107
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:18.440
organisms or specific,
you know,
you can look,
pick your favorite amino acid,

108
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.390
you only get a grid of them.

109
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.310
So if you don't pick the right 256 so the right 512 and you get something else

110
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:28.580
instead,
you don't see it.
So that's the drawback.
On the other hand,

111
00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:32.210
you can look for a lot of different things and it will fluoresce and it'll tell

112
00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:35.810
you if you've got a positive hit.
Just like with many uh,
medical tests now.

113
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:43.030
And finally the wood there has been an instrument called the chemical laptop

114
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.120
electrophoresis based micro fluidic instrument developed at Berkeley about this

115
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:52.790
point 1214 years ago.

116
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.750
And the descendants of the chemical laptop and various places are being

117
00:07:56.751 --> 00:08:01.751
developed into instruments both at JPL and Nasa Ames actually as we speak and

118
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:03.950
put into various mission proposals.

119
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.700
The microfluidic life analyzer is one of these,

120
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:11.420
it's coming from JPL in this case.
And,
uh,

121
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:16.430
it would be able to give us amino acids and their curiosity and we could have

122
00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:17.990
some idea of the,

123
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.630
what we are looking at and if this was from a biogenic origin or not based on

124
00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:24.740
what we could get from that.

125
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:30.580
So we put this together as a package proposed for increasing capabilities,

126
00:08:30.981 --> 00:08:34.910
starting from basically just taking the pieces out to the Atacama to putting

127
00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:37.880
things on the rover with the drill and the arm too.

128
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:39.590
Then in integrating instruments.

129
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.890
Then finally operating the whole thing remotely from the u s and sort of a

130
00:08:42.891 --> 00:08:44.240
mission style operation.

131
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:49.241
So got picked in early 2015 and a with our partners at honeybee and in Spain and

132
00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:55.740
I'm JPL and Goddard and so forth.
So off we went.

133
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.130
The basic concept is we will go to a earth analog site,

134
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.090
something that is,

135
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.260
has some aspects or some attributes that are similar if the we be,

136
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:11.790
the feel is similar in some respects to another planet.
We,
in this case,

137
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:15.540
we were looking for someplace with a very low bioburden this very dry,

138
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:18.180
very desiccated.
It's not as dry.

139
00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:23.181
Desiccated is Mars but it's probably it's the driest place on earth.

140
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:28.620
It's so we can get some of the same effects and if we are looking for life and

141
00:09:28.621 --> 00:09:30.060
desiccated dry places,

142
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:34.500
well this is a good place to test the same techniques at least at a first cut.

143
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:35.610
Uh,

144
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:40.610
we would make field use of astrobiology sort of prototypes of fight instruments

145
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.530
and at the same time grabbed samples that we can take back to our lab.

146
00:09:44.531 --> 00:09:49.531
So we can compare the performance of the flight instrument versus the tabletop.

147
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.720
Expensive well calibrated,

148
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:55.230
well tuned instrument that can get two orders of magnitude more precision

149
00:09:55.231 --> 00:09:59.950
probably then what we can put onto a rover.
We would have to,

150
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.800
since you light speed means that on Mars that plus the deep space network only

151
00:10:04.801 --> 00:10:07.170
gives you two windows a day to talk to your missions.

152
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.710
You know that plus the 10 minutes in each direction means that whatever you send

153
00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:14.640
out there has to be autonomous.
It had not only has to be self driving,

154
00:10:14.641 --> 00:10:15.930
it has to be self drilling,

155
00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:20.310
it has to be self transporting in terms of samples and the instruments.

156
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:22.530
All have to be able to not burn themselves up.

157
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.450
And so there's the autonomy and the software implications of this are

158
00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:27.991
significant.

159
00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:32.910
I mean just the drilling alone is something that on earth still is pretty much a

160
00:10:32.911 --> 00:10:37.770
human dominated activity.
Even deep sea drilling,

161
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:42.780
the oil and gas industry that's done remotely as done joystick with people in

162
00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:46.410
Houston or similar places doing VR work.

163
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:49.470
But do you have human operators just as if they were flying drones,

164
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.300
they're essentially flying the drill while on the bottom of the sea floor.

165
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.400
It's still a human governed,
that kind of reaction time.

166
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.790
And finally we have to know if anything we're discovering is valid.

167
00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:04.470
So we have to have a control.

168
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:09.650
So the best field science and also to study the desert and the outcome as a Mars

169
00:11:10.861 --> 00:11:12.270
analog in and of itself.

170
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.320
And I'll skim through some of this I guess,

171
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:18.780
but this is just to put it into context,

172
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:23.850
how we were addressing science was in terms of figuring out what are the limits

173
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:28.110
of life in an extreme environment and Dewey find biomarkers there on the
surface.

174
00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:29.100
More about that later.

175
00:11:29.101 --> 00:11:33.180
And is this a good Martian low to mid latitude model?

176
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.570
The technology since there's the software automation and autonomy,

177
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.600
surface mobility and drilling,
integrating those together.
Yes,

178
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:46.410
curiosity has a drill but it has a five centimeter drill about the size of my

179
00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:51.411
thumb designed for sampling outcrops and it doesn't get used that it's quite an

180
00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:59.110
engineering challenge as it is.
And then science operations,

181
00:11:59.111 --> 00:12:04.060
how do we do remote surface operations that involve this much complexity

182
00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:09.061
transfer in analysis given the lightspeed and the bandwidth limitations that we

183
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:12.190
only get to talk to these two the vehicle twice a day.

184
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.060
So we were not saying,
well we address all of these things.

185
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:20.300
We have a nice AFL looking proposal and a,

186
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.250
the folks within NASA headquarters who look at these things said yea verily go

187
00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:25.084
forth

188
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.650
because they're operating off of a astrobiology roadmap,

189
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.160
which has been revised I guess a couple,

190
00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.260
two or three years before that and just would not to be labor.

191
00:12:36.261 --> 00:12:40.060
Since most of you are probably familiar with,
uh,
the main,
where do we come from?

192
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:43.480
Are we alone?
Although that's as much of a silly question,
but you know,

193
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.660
how can we detect whether that's microbial are complex?

194
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.330
And then what does that tell us about our own future?

195
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:56.980
We strive to investigate a bunch of different science goals,

196
00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.520
but the ones that are most relevant here are how would early life interact and

197
00:13:03.371 --> 00:13:07.360
evolve with the changing environment because the environment in the Atacama and

198
00:13:07.361 --> 00:13:11.260
show a changed dramatically over the past few million years.

199
00:13:11.261 --> 00:13:16.240
And when it's been gone to a very dry desiccated,
in some respects,

200
00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:19.780
it may be a good model for what could have happened billions of years ago on

201
00:13:19.781 --> 00:13:22.960
Mars.
If we look at early Mars versus going up to the present,

202
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:28.770
it also gives us an idea of how to look for habitable environments and how to

203
00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:33.781
recognize signatures of life by looking at do we find signatures of life in this

204
00:13:34.961 --> 00:13:36.880
very barren,
hostile environment.

205
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.420
So astrobiology is a motivation,

206
00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:43.810
but at the same time we have to find a place.

207
00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:47.080
There are no perfect earth analogs.

208
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.290
Everything is a partial cause.
We're not on Mars,

209
00:13:50.291 --> 00:13:53.130
we're not on your rope or we're not really,
everything is uh,

210
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.100
we may be very dry and desiccated in Chile,
but we're hot.

211
00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.250
We're not cold in the ambient pressure is way too high.

212
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.460
I can go to the dry valleys in Antarctica.

213
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:07.750
We've tested there with past drills and instruments and it's pretty dry,

214
00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:11.470
although not as dry as the outcome.
And it's cold.
But again,

215
00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:14.380
the ambient temperature and pressure and it's a little bit wetter.

216
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.220
I can likewise go to the Arctic to the big impact crater.

217
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.190
And the soil has been broken up.

218
00:14:21.191 --> 00:14:24.430
You have something very akin to regolith from the meteor impact,

219
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.590
but it's a bit wetter and it's not as dry.
So you,
you'll take your pick,

220
00:14:29.591 --> 00:14:34.591
you can sort of have some venn diagram of a possible characteristics that look

221
00:14:35.231 --> 00:14:37.960
like Mars or other places,
but you can't have all of it.

222
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:43.390
So we decided to take this to Chile.
We looked at three sites,

223
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.800
one near Epica,
one at Maria Elena south,

224
00:14:47.801 --> 00:14:52.801
which is the listed as number three there on that chart and one at the young guy

225
00:14:52.821 --> 00:14:53.630
station,

226
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:58.630
ghost town about 90 kilometers east southeast of Antofagasta

227
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.850
and pictures of these,
there are gypsum polygons.

228
00:15:04.851 --> 00:15:08.030
There are eroded formations.
There's a,

229
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:12.880
there are solars with the haylight deposits and salt crystals that actually hook

230
00:15:12.881 --> 00:15:16.490
up as though they were arms coming out Zombie like out of the ground.

231
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:23.620
We ended up sticking with number two at Antofagasta both because it has a

232
00:15:24.051 --> 00:15:25.220
variety of things.

233
00:15:25.221 --> 00:15:29.660
It's drier than anywhere except for maybe number three at Maria Elena south and

234
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:34.310
it has a derelict,
uh,
sort of ghost town abandoned agricultural station,

235
00:15:34.311 --> 00:15:37.670
which we can outfit to support us for as far as the logistics go.

236
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.170
But uh,
this is a very barren place.
One of my cohorts,

237
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.520
one of the folks working on this on the field science side,

238
00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:51.521
Mary Beth Wilhelm is about to publish a paper talking about a transect going

239
00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:57.491
from further south to the north from warmer and cooler and wetter to hotter and

240
00:15:58.821 --> 00:16:01.340
drier.
And this is what she's finding.

241
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.870
These are actually early a results from this past field season.

242
00:16:05.871 --> 00:16:10.800
A little map at the bottom tells you roughly the geographical,
although that's a,

243
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:15.380
again,
read instead of a left or right,
that's really kind of south to north,

244
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:20.570
but it shows that as you go from extreme,
merely extremely arid,

245
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:21.830
too hyper arid,

246
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:27.460
the markers like psycho appropriate in the second a chart down,

247
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:32.840
go to zero,
the LDS ship,
total fluorescence,
that's solid.

248
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.680
That is again,
from this year's uh,
testing,

249
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.290
we saw that samples fed two solid.
By the time we get to young guy,

250
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:47.650
we have something like eight out of 256 that we were still seeing any positive

251
00:16:48.981 --> 00:16:52.970
hits on.
Same thing.
Fatty acids fall down.
Basically the,
they're the,

252
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:58.030
the signs of life or activity diminished to almost nothing by the time we reach

253
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:04.700
young gay or Maria Elena south,
which is even further over here.

254
00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:10.640
So in that sense,
it's probably a really good analog site.

255
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:14.570
And again,
it's a good simulant for what we might find at Mars.
Again,

256
00:17:14.571 --> 00:17:19.340
it's to the pressure's too hot and it's too warm,
but it's very dry,

257
00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:21.280
very desiccated.
And,
uh,

258
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.500
we're not seeing signs of ongoing activity.

259
00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:30.680
And again,
from Mary Beth's work,
this is a impress currently.

260
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.840
We see it changes as you go from the south to the north.
And this is,
you know,

261
00:17:35.841 --> 00:17:40.820
looking at this transition zone from biologically active where we see at least a

262
00:17:40.821 --> 00:17:45.590
few occasional Intelysis things growing and rocks or a fuel plants are lichens a

263
00:17:45.591 --> 00:17:50.591
little bit of biomass to places like young gay or Maria Elena where there's no

264
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:55.230
visible activity,
low biomass and the,

265
00:17:55.231 --> 00:17:58.680
when we say significant racism,
[inaudible] amino acids,

266
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.950
what that indicates is they're decaying.

267
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.760
Typically they have been irradiated and they're breaking down it's dead stuff,

268
00:18:05.761 --> 00:18:10.500
Jim.
Basically it's very dead stuff.

269
00:18:10.501 --> 00:18:15.501
Most of what we were finding was on the order of 10 to 40,000 years dead stuff.

270
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.670
It just in the surface soil.

271
00:18:17.671 --> 00:18:22.671
So there's not much activity and most of what you find are microbial skeletons,

272
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:27.030
whom that may have even blown in some distances from other places.

273
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:35.330
So that was sort of framing why we went to this particular bear in place and

274
00:18:37.231 --> 00:18:40.530
what collection of stuff we wanted to take with us.
And why.

275
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:41.940
So a little bit about,

276
00:18:41.941 --> 00:18:45.060
well what did we actually go out and do or what are we in the middle of doing?

277
00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.830
The first year we went out did some of these studies that you just saw displayed

278
00:18:49.831 --> 00:18:54.390
here.
Oh and a sampled at young gay as well as some of the other sites,

279
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:59.250
Maria Elena and the Epica site.
We took two instruments,

280
00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:01.620
the wet chemistry lab and solid,

281
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:06.450
you saw some solid results on that previous chart.
Wet Chemistry lab,
brass board,

282
00:19:06.451 --> 00:19:08.280
even though it flew on Phoenix.

283
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:13.370
What we have is a had been in storage for about six or seven years and was a

284
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:17.580
brass board,
not a full flight unit.
So we had to renovate that.

285
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:22.410
We started work on the two instruments we didn't have in hand and we got a new

286
00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:26.490
drill and a new robot arm since the ones that we had originally proposed broke.

287
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:30.190
And that's part of the downside of taking things out and trying to break them.

288
00:19:30.191 --> 00:19:34.800
And sometimes you succeed and it's not necessarily a bad thing,
but a,

289
00:19:34.801 --> 00:19:37.500
you want to break things because if you don't break things,

290
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:40.350
you're not learning and you're not able to improve and go and come up with

291
00:19:40.351 --> 00:19:41.520
things that won't break later.

292
00:19:41.521 --> 00:19:44.220
But still you have to keep putting things together then.

293
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.440
And I keep having to justify the budgets.

294
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:51.390
So this year and February,
2017,

295
00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:55.920
our objective was to take the k rex to rover,

296
00:19:55.921 --> 00:19:57.560
which is,
um,

297
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.590
a vehicle from Terry Fong is here in the audience.

298
00:20:01.591 --> 00:20:06.090
It is his group that has developed this as one of their stable of rovers over

299
00:20:06.091 --> 00:20:08.520
the years.
So in collaboration with that,

300
00:20:08.521 --> 00:20:13.521
we have a honeybee and NASA drill that you see,

301
00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.770
uh,
up to the upper right kind of sticking up,

302
00:20:16.771 --> 00:20:21.500
kind of a gold spindle with a long shaft protruding and um,

303
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:25.470
MDA aerospace,
sort of a Canadian contribution I suppose,

304
00:20:25.471 --> 00:20:29.010
although it's are u s Uhso subsidiary,
um,

305
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.380
arm with a scoop on the end of that.

306
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.720
And they did the Phoenix and insight arms and uh,

307
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:39.270
helped JPL with the curiosity arms.
So they have a long track record.

308
00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:43.770
A Honeybee did the rock abrasion tool for grinding things away from the Mer

309
00:20:43.771 --> 00:20:47.340
rovers and the dust removal tool on curiosity.

310
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:52.620
These are all entities with some direct experience in flight hardware.

311
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:54.491
So this is,

312
00:20:54.491 --> 00:20:58.570
it's sitting in the Atacama as it was after nightmares of getting it through

313
00:20:58.571 --> 00:21:02.530
Chilean custom's included in this rover.

314
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:06.190
We have three different robotic subsystems there.

315
00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:09.850
This is the k rex to rover and its own autonomous navigation.

316
00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.600
And you see it there even though maybe the perspective isn't as good,

317
00:21:13.601 --> 00:21:18.490
but the tracks left by the rover as it trembled up a hill.

318
00:21:18.491 --> 00:21:22.680
That's about a 1520 degree angle.
Although again,
since you're looking uphill,

319
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.920
it's not quite as obvious.

320
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:28.180
But the rover is going and finding its own way around the boulders and obstacles

321
00:21:28.181 --> 00:21:29.014
in his path.

322
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:34.590
We have the arm that again from MDA aerospace and it was something that we're

323
00:21:36.761 --> 00:21:39.580
not usually always scratching our head and we look at it.
But uh,

324
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.720
and then we have the latest generation of honeybee robotics,

325
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:48.700
rotary percussive,
lightweight,
15 kilos,
two meter class drills.

326
00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:52.450
Usually the deal there is that honeybee designs the mechanics and we usually

327
00:21:52.451 --> 00:21:56.590
write their software over at NASA ames,
so we do the drill control.

328
00:21:56.591 --> 00:22:00.910
They do the drill mechanisms.
Usually we don't fight each other too much.

329
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:07.690
The rover itself will carry four instruments,
maybe a fifth,

330
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.150
maybe three.
We will see this will develop,

331
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:15.450
the arm will deploy sample two individual instruments,

332
00:22:15.671 --> 00:22:17.110
one after another after another.

333
00:22:17.111 --> 00:22:20.470
We're just taking a scoop and basically dumping dirt and three different

334
00:22:20.471 --> 00:22:25.471
physical locations and it can autonomously navigate and uh,

335
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.320
possibly even we'll be able to identify if we get a little bit of supplemental

336
00:22:29.321 --> 00:22:33.230
support,
good locations to drill on its own.
That would be a coup.

337
00:22:33.231 --> 00:22:34.750
If we can get that in a couple of years.

338
00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.760
Rover navigation,

339
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.950
this is just a showing one of the Atacama from this past season,

340
00:22:44.951 --> 00:22:46.480
I believe it might've been the same run.

341
00:22:46.481 --> 00:22:49.720
You saw it trending uphill just at the rover.

342
00:22:49.721 --> 00:22:54.721
Both does image processing for navigation and has a lidar mounted on it as well.

343
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.890
You know,
we have to be careful with the lidar.

344
00:22:56.891 --> 00:22:59.590
We take it to other countries because it's a export controlled.

345
00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:04.330
But nonetheless,
it can autonomously find obstacles,

346
00:23:04.331 --> 00:23:09.331
navigates to identify and do a limited amount of contextual analysis that we

347
00:23:09.611 --> 00:23:11.590
might be able to leverage in future years.

348
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:18.250
The robot arm replaced our old robot arm,
which eventually we killed.

349
00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:19.803
Um,

350
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.800
given this is a sort of a track family history from the insight in Phoenix arms.

351
00:23:26.261 --> 00:23:31.040
We just got this,
we have been tuning it ever since.
And uh,
our,

352
00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.930
the software for controlling it of course as the biggest problem because the,

353
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:35.530
you know,

354
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:39.100
we didn't want the flight code because we want to operate it on a laptop or on

355
00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:40.690
an embedded thing off the rover.

356
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.260
So they had to write something new for us specifically.

357
00:23:44.261 --> 00:23:45.920
And we're still working with that,

358
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.760
but it is not killed anyone yet.

359
00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.300
There was once upon a time,
a,
uh,

360
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.560
an apocryphal story of a,

361
00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:01.970
somebody working violating buddy principle rules around a robot arm in a lab

362
00:24:01.971 --> 00:24:03.230
late at night on a Friday,

363
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:07.490
who then had forgotten to set the safety perimeter app if the system got

364
00:24:07.491 --> 00:24:10.430
activated,
came around and scratched them,

365
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:14.720
at which point they ran down the hallway shouting,
I need medical help.

366
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:16.070
I've been attacked by a robot

367
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.750
that's only somewhat anecdotal,
but I'll leave it at that.

368
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:24.410
The new drill,

369
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:29.440
which is the fifth generation of lightweight planetary prototype drills that we

370
00:24:29.451 --> 00:24:33.950
have broken in succession was funded by a combination of projects.

371
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.090
Two of them are ones I'm working on air ads and a another one that we'll be

372
00:24:38.091 --> 00:24:42.410
going to Spain in two months and the resource prospector project,

373
00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:46.490
which is currently in sort of a pre phase a state at Nasa Ames and elsewhere.

374
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.930
It's a joint 15 kilo,

375
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:53.000
two meter capable of the,

376
00:24:53.001 --> 00:24:55.540
most of the time we only operate it with a single drill strings,

377
00:24:55.541 --> 00:25:00.541
so that's about little over one meter and it is able to operate into about plus

378
00:25:02.241 --> 00:25:07.241
70 see down to a lunar equivalent minus 230 sea temperatures.

379
00:25:09.261 --> 00:25:14.261
So it's a ruggedized and designed to be able to be cold world are sort of Europa

380
00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.620
compatible in that sense or lunar compatible for resource prospector.

381
00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:26.300
So we took this out,
we bundled this together,
we drove,

382
00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:28.400
we integrated,
we drove it,

383
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:33.640
we braved the dust devils and customs and shipping and all the other constraints

384
00:25:35.151 --> 00:25:38.510
that sometimes get in the way of doing some sort of a technical test out in the

385
00:25:38.511 --> 00:25:43.511
middle of nowhere and were successful in getting not quite 14 meters,

386
00:25:45.291 --> 00:25:45.861
but uh,

387
00:25:45.861 --> 00:25:50.861
that was doing actually darn good considering deepest was full stroke,

388
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:51.853
two meters.

389
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:58.120
And we saw three of the five major fault modes simply occur in the course of a

390
00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.470
mother nature binding or over torque.
You know,

391
00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:05.780
basically if we have something that we are going into and it grabs the side of

392
00:26:05.781 --> 00:26:06.380
the Auger,

393
00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:10.340
in this case corkscrewing which typically comes when you try to retract,

394
00:26:10.341 --> 00:26:12.890
if it catches on an edge,
suddenly your intention,

395
00:26:12.891 --> 00:26:14.930
it's like you're trying to pull the cork out of the bottle,

396
00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:19.430
you're trying to unscrew it and it's not unscrewing the way you would like it or

397
00:26:19.431 --> 00:26:20.330
hard material,

398
00:26:20.331 --> 00:26:24.200
which can also be a worn out drillbit or something else that is causing your

399
00:26:24.201 --> 00:26:27.500
rate of penetration to go to zero.
So we found some nice ways,

400
00:26:27.501 --> 00:26:31.640
way in which we can fault or break the drill while it's on the rover so he can

401
00:26:31.641 --> 00:26:36.641
then look at how does being on a suspension or my new movements in the rover

402
00:26:37.671 --> 00:26:41.720
platform effect compared to a lander platform or something that's more stable.

403
00:26:41.721 --> 00:26:43.740
So those were all very useful for us.

404
00:26:43.741 --> 00:26:47.310
We also managed to demonstrate that we could take the dirt,

405
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.250
the sample that was coming up out of the ground and transfer it.

406
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.190
Since we don't have the instruments on it this past year,

407
00:26:53.191 --> 00:26:57.570
we could still send it to a catchment bucket or a sample jar on the back.

408
00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:58.531
In one case,

409
00:26:58.531 --> 00:27:01.530
we did put an instrument back there just so we could say we had done it,

410
00:27:01.531 --> 00:27:06.300
but that wasn't a really an integration
but still successful.

411
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.740
We should also,
as you see here and on the opening charge,

412
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.930
in order to when we were testing,

413
00:27:12.931 --> 00:27:17.931
we have to clean very thoroughly when about four successive levels of solvent

414
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.170
between a test between sampling.
So,

415
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.190
and we don't want to breathe on it or bring our own microbes.

416
00:27:26.191 --> 00:27:30.750
So we have to wear bunny suits,
masks,
hair nets,
booties,

417
00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:36.120
which and when it's already a hundred degrees and you're in the sun and you're

418
00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:38.040
in a bunny suit,
sweating,

419
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:43.390
bending over and trying to swabs small amounts of,
you know,

420
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.980
either alcohol or something stronger solvent wise,

421
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
that's tough work but it was necessary every single 10 centimeter sample.

422
00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.720
So when we did clean samples it we,

423
00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:01.740
it was time consuming and you see them in the middle here of a cleaning cycle

424
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:06.420
and someone back off about 20 or 30 meters who's recording the data from the

425
00:28:06.421 --> 00:28:07.410
previous sample set

426
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:16.230
for anyone who is into penetration rates and the hardware involved for the

427
00:28:17.321 --> 00:28:20.740
drill.
This is a comparison of the new drill versus the old drill.

428
00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:26.160
The biggest thing here is really the stroke length is improved and the masses a

429
00:28:27.131 --> 00:28:29.710
little bit higher from 13 to 15 kilos,

430
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.470
but we have a lot more torque that we can play with,

431
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.300
which keeps us from getting stuck.

432
00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.960
The old Lita drill would notoriously wimpy and some materials if you went into

433
00:28:40.721 --> 00:28:42.700
basalt or if he went into solid ice.

434
00:28:42.701 --> 00:28:46.600
I once had to dig one out in the Arctic with the leader drill and air ads should

435
00:28:46.601 --> 00:28:49.160
not have this issue.
Good thing if we're planning on,

436
00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.840
if we're looking for ice deposits for the resource prospector folks,

437
00:28:52.841 --> 00:28:54.520
we don't want this getting stuck in ice.

438
00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:01.520
And again,
honeybee does the hardware.
NASA ames typically does the software.

439
00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:06.780
We leverage our m slice sequencer and uh,

440
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:10.250
take some diagnostic modules that we uh,

441
00:29:10.251 --> 00:29:14.800
we reasoned about the g we have some ordinary limit checky expert system.

442
00:29:14.801 --> 00:29:19.310
He stuff we look at vibrations and do some um,

443
00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:23.870
genetic algorithms to basically do the frequency shifts and process the

444
00:29:23.871 --> 00:29:25.940
frequency shifts in realtime.

445
00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.510
And then we do a little bit of model comparison to see if it's behaving the way

446
00:29:29.511 --> 00:29:30.710
we think it should be behaving.

447
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:35.360
We have to arbitrary traits all of these down at the bottom where it says

448
00:29:35.361 --> 00:29:40.160
diagnostics and then decide with the exec that we are,

449
00:29:40.161 --> 00:29:44.920
uh,
you,
what recovery action if anything or what parameters to shift in realtime.

450
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.780
And we have to handshake.
We're,
we keep flipping back and forth.

451
00:29:49.781 --> 00:29:51.850
I think we were originally going to use zero Mq.

452
00:29:51.851 --> 00:29:56.080
I think we were just you back to DDS now in terms of how we handshake and what

453
00:29:56.081 --> 00:29:56.920
we do with honeybee.

454
00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.260
One other aspect of handing material,

455
00:30:02.261 --> 00:30:06.250
assuming we're successful in our automated drilling and the rover has positioned

456
00:30:06.251 --> 00:30:09.340
us and we have something in the scoop while we have dirt.
Okay.

457
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.910
We have pulverized rock.
Well,
so what?
Uh,

458
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:15.760
but instruments have to be automated too.

459
00:30:15.761 --> 00:30:20.500
If I have an instrument that's designed to only operate on finely milled flowery

460
00:30:20.501 --> 00:30:24.010
particles and they're going to extract and I dump a bunch of gravel in it,

461
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.370
then I've just killed my instrument mission over or at least that instruments

462
00:30:27.371 --> 00:30:28.204
over.

463
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:33.240
So this led to lots of gnashing of teeth and a discovery proposal I was working

464
00:30:33.371 --> 00:30:38.371
on in the 2013 to 2015 timeframe that called icebreaker where we had huge fights

465
00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:44.110
among the team working on the proposal back and forth across institutions

466
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.420
screaming and yelling and you know,

467
00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:51.510
project managers being replaced all over this one issue of can we take the risk

468
00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:57.390
of screening or not screening sample particles being fed to it from a drill like

469
00:30:58.151 --> 00:30:58.984
this.

470
00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.950
And because we had an instrument that couldn't handle anything bigger than about

471
00:31:02.951 --> 00:31:07.951
two millimeters diameter or it could handle maybe one or two two millimeter are

472
00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.300
bigger particles,
but nothing bigger than that.

473
00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:14.260
And so did we need to build a saas spa like on Msl,

474
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.280
a complex filters,
screening 12 motors,

475
00:31:18.281 --> 00:31:22.480
lots of degrees of freedom or it could we just have a simple screen or not

476
00:31:22.481 --> 00:31:25.000
screen anything and just say,
well,
we might get a bigger rock,

477
00:31:25.001 --> 00:31:27.850
but we probably will happen so infrequently,
we're not going to worry about it.

478
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.860
You know,
I was in the latter camp.

479
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.310
Other people were in the former camp since they're not here to defend
themselves,

480
00:31:33.311 --> 00:31:34.810
I won't revisit that argument.

481
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:39.640
Only to say this show that this is an important thing that a will the next time

482
00:31:39.641 --> 00:31:43.420
we propose this in a year or two will undoubtedly be used as ammunition by both

483
00:31:43.421 --> 00:31:46.900
sides.
So if you look at this,

484
00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:51.930
you can see that the distribution is mostly in the OE half millimeter quarter

485
00:31:53.981 --> 00:31:58.160
millimeter and the 500 or 250 uh,

486
00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:02.530
micro meter range.
If you look at the proportions of the bulk here,

487
00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:08.010
and if you go all the way out to the 2000 which would be two millimeters is a

488
00:32:08.291 --> 00:32:13.291
little tiny bit to 3% 1% 4% and the s the 60 2020 and greater,

489
00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:21.520
130 those are depths brought up from as far as drilling goes on average.

490
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.660
So the stuff that we would really kill about the stuff that might cause hiccups

491
00:32:25.661 --> 00:32:28.870
are the four centimeter,
four millimeter sized particles.

492
00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:33.460
And one of those we have none.
And the others,
we have just a tiny amount,

493
00:32:33.461 --> 00:32:38.410
1% of the sample.
So if we're only doing 10 samples,

494
00:32:38.411 --> 00:32:40.940
let's say on a given mission with a given instrument,

495
00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.480
1% might show up with a rock.
Okay,

496
00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:47.330
so maybe in one or two of those 10 we might get a rock.

497
00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:48.800
We could probably keep operating with that.

498
00:32:48.801 --> 00:32:53.120
So this is a useful result when we're making those sort of risk assessments are

499
00:32:53.121 --> 00:32:56.300
will we jam up our internals of our instruments?

500
00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:03.940
Have you think back to the description of the astrobiology field laboratory,

501
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:11.810
one of the things it was concerned about was contamination,

502
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:13.820
not just how do you sterilize it,

503
00:33:13.821 --> 00:33:15.650
how do you make it very clean when you bring it?

504
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.950
And that's sort of comparable to the people you saw on the bunny suits,

505
00:33:18.951 --> 00:33:22.850
making it clean in that sense,
but also the,

506
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.990
how do you know you're not just observing the life you brought with you suppose

507
00:33:26.991 --> 00:33:30.440
you are contaminating your own mechanism for detecting life.

508
00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:32.720
So we needed to,

509
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.360
we have needed to study this and get some sort of a handle on it.

510
00:33:35.361 --> 00:33:37.910
So we have done some tracer studies.

511
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.410
This shows one from this past February where we essentially took

512
00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:49.400
hydrogen bromide as spray.
And laid it across the area.
We're going to drill into,

513
00:33:49.401 --> 00:33:54.401
then drilled through with a clean sterilized drill after we had backed away from

514
00:33:55.971 --> 00:33:57.300
it.
And uh,

515
00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:02.320
see what concentration of the bromine shows up in the samples coming down from

516
00:34:02.841 --> 00:34:05.150
the surface.
Okay.
Then the one in the center,

517
00:34:05.151 --> 00:34:09.530
we actually sprayed the tracer on the drill bit itself in a different whole

518
00:34:09.531 --> 00:34:11.210
before it went down below the surface.

519
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.280
So one of the things this tells you,

520
00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:20.330
we also tried to control for how often,
is there percussion,

521
00:34:20.331 --> 00:34:23.390
the little hammer signs or do we see any moisture in the whole,

522
00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.070
the little droplets [inaudible]

523
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:31.460
as you might expect if you're just drilling one hole,
as you drill,

524
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:36.160
a pile of cuttings builds up.
Those of you who've used a hand tool,

525
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.160
you know if you do home improvement or something else,
you drill into something.

526
00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:44.570
A little pile comes up the auger and builds deposits itself near the borehole to

527
00:34:44.571 --> 00:34:48.530
surface.
And then once you've drilled enough and enough stuff has come up,

528
00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.250
some of that material starts falling back down in the hole again as you shake it

529
00:34:52.251 --> 00:34:56.470
or bump it around.
So here you see that,
um,

530
00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:01.740
as you went deeper you started seeing more and more of the tracer and you might

531
00:35:01.741 --> 00:35:05.440
say,
well that's counterintuitive.
The tracer was on the surface.
Why are you,

532
00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:07.220
you know,
you're going deeper and further away.

533
00:35:07.221 --> 00:35:09.560
Why are you seeing more in the samples you're bringing up?

534
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.730
Well answer is is that you weren't seeing material you had brought with you,

535
00:35:13.731 --> 00:35:16.700
you are seeing circulation,
you are bringing up particles,

536
00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.160
dumping them on the surface.
As you drill deeper,

537
00:35:19.161 --> 00:35:23.180
which then fell down again back down in the hole and sometimes made a couple of

538
00:35:23.181 --> 00:35:26.420
cycles of this and each time they would carry more of tracer back down the hole.

539
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:31.930
So something at the surface in proximity could actually be more of a problem to

540
00:35:34.071 --> 00:35:36.440
some extent.
Now I suppose if you went really,
really deep,

541
00:35:36.441 --> 00:35:37.950
if this is a hundred meter drill,

542
00:35:37.951 --> 00:35:40.800
I imagine this would taper off at some point as far as the effects go,

543
00:35:40.801 --> 00:35:42.420
but down to a meter,

544
00:35:42.421 --> 00:35:46.020
this is what we saw when you sprayed it on the drill bit.

545
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:50.280
That's more or less straight across.

546
00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:53.970
You might've seen a little bit of tapering off just as you are finally wearing.

547
00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:57.840
Of course levels are higher than just what was coming down from the surface.

548
00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:02.010
And then finally when you would drill a little,
bring it back up,

549
00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.870
drill a little bit more and bring it back up.

550
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:08.520
You are sort of both exciting material on the surface and exposing the bit to it

551
00:36:08.521 --> 00:36:09.720
as you went in and out of it.

552
00:36:09.721 --> 00:36:13.920
So it was a bit higher than the first case but not as high as the second case.

553
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:14.641
And again,

554
00:36:14.641 --> 00:36:19.080
there may have been some attenuation going on as you bring it up and out,

555
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.680
you knock the pile back so less of it was falling down after awhile.

556
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.250
So again,
cross contamination.

557
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:29.100
We don't want to introduce our own microbes into our instruments,

558
00:36:29.101 --> 00:36:32.970
so we have to get an idea of how do we drill cleanly and is this going to be a

559
00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:35.790
problem with our own contamination.
And it looks like it is

560
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:41.040
a little bit about our instruments.
Um,

561
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:44.370
and I'll wrap this up with the wet chemistry lab.

562
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.990
10 kilos flew on Phoenix A,
we've taken it out there already.

563
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:54.230
It detected perchlorate on Mars in 2007 so it can give us the habitability in

564
00:36:55.711 --> 00:37:00.660
the background of what we're looking for.
The signs of life detector,

565
00:37:00.661 --> 00:37:03.400
I talked a little bit about this.
It's an amino assay.

566
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:08.420
It can look for a grid of potential molecules or markers of past life and uh,

567
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.090
can operate in the presence of perchlorate.

568
00:37:12.091 --> 00:37:16.170
It doesn't heat anything up and it's an antibody match

569
00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.550
and some examples.
So if you notice as you go down,

570
00:37:20.551 --> 00:37:22.440
you may see antibodies matching differently.

571
00:37:22.441 --> 00:37:27.441
This is from some 2016 data from a pit to near where you saw the picture of the

572
00:37:27.721 --> 00:37:29.460
rover before.
Notice the,

573
00:37:29.461 --> 00:37:33.330
you got way more signatures when you got to 80 centimeters depth in this case,

574
00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:37.290
big signature there and then suddenly you go to 20 centimeters back to almost

575
00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:42.180
background levels again.
And at 130 there's hardly anything.
You also,

576
00:37:42.181 --> 00:37:46.430
if you notice at the surface in that particular pitch or in that particular
hold,

577
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.680
it was hardly anything but desiccated upper surface in a much of what you're

578
00:37:49.681 --> 00:37:52.380
seeing at 80 or 100 at a meter down,

579
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.710
maybe a couple of million years old fossilized material

580
00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:58.680
from this year's data.

581
00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:02.940
You could see that after this 256 or 51,

582
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:05.280
um,
potential hits,

583
00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:08.960
you only saw about eight proteins as far as him,

584
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:11.700
the solid or in this case LD chip.

585
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:14.280
If you take it out of the solid case and you're doing it in the lab.

586
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.810
And here's a comparison of young gays results with those of some of the other

587
00:38:18.811 --> 00:38:20.970
sites.
This is also for Mary Beth's paper,

588
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:28.890
the Mila microfluidic flute life analyzer,
Eh,

589
00:38:28.891 --> 00:38:33.800
you can see a picture of the chemical laptop in the upper left corner and it
can,

590
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:39.140
it does a excellent job of amino acid analysis potentially,

591
00:38:39.461 --> 00:38:43.750
at least for a portable unit.
It looks a little bit like in practice,

592
00:38:43.751 --> 00:38:46.120
like a mister coffee sitting on top of the laptop.

593
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:50.650
So that's an inglorious way to refer to it,
I suppose.

594
00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:54.130
But we did have it up and running in the field.
As we see here,

595
00:38:54.131 --> 00:38:57.610
there's the extractor there.
Start Real.
That's really not a mister coffee.

596
00:38:57.611 --> 00:39:00.620
It does have a funnel on the top,
but that's way more,
you know,

597
00:39:00.621 --> 00:39:02.110
no coffee grains in that at all.

598
00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:04.930
But then you see the chemical laptop in the back.

599
00:39:04.931 --> 00:39:08.650
So the two were operated separately and off to the side with samples that we,

600
00:39:08.651 --> 00:39:12.250
Jace basically just carried it from the rover over to the field to give to the

601
00:39:12.251 --> 00:39:14.710
meal of folks and they did their analysis.

602
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:21.380
Next year we will have the laser disruption mass spec.
Again,

603
00:39:21.381 --> 00:39:23.810
it's half of the Exomars Moma instrument.

604
00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.870
Of course as Xo Morris has continued to slide,

605
00:39:26.871 --> 00:39:30.770
when we propose this in 2014 it was going to be a 2016 flights.

606
00:39:30.771 --> 00:39:32.960
So we were going to have this already tested,

607
00:39:32.961 --> 00:39:35.480
already flown and instrument that we are simply going to leverage.

608
00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:40.760
Now it's slipped to 2020 and may go to 2022 who knows what's means though that

609
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:41.690
they are,
you know,

610
00:39:41.691 --> 00:39:44.690
we're now still working with the engineering unit and as they look at their own

611
00:39:44.691 --> 00:39:46.100
design and redesign cycle,

612
00:39:46.101 --> 00:39:49.610
so they have a harder time getting hardware ready for us.

613
00:39:49.611 --> 00:39:50.930
So their schedule has slipped.

614
00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:55.370
They didn't make it in time for the February field test.
We are,
look,

615
00:39:55.371 --> 00:39:57.530
they also have to operate in a vacuum chamber.

616
00:39:57.531 --> 00:40:01.880
So we have to create a Mars atmosphere inside of the cylinder that we are

617
00:40:01.881 --> 00:40:05.180
pumping down trundling along on the back of the rover in the Atacama.

618
00:40:05.181 --> 00:40:09.350
So in some sense we have a sort of Mars like environment here and we're

619
00:40:09.351 --> 00:40:14.000
recreating the atmospheric constituents for this instrument as we go along.

620
00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.020
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

621
00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:18.000
<v 1>something we had never really anticipated,</v>

622
00:40:18.001 --> 00:40:21.990
but we had been playing around with the [inaudible] nanopore sequencing,

623
00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:26.070
which you can get for about a thousand bucks from a company in England,

624
00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:28.140
Oxford Research,
I think.

625
00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:34.100
And there's a picture of one held the next to a haylight nodule it over in one

626
00:40:34.351 --> 00:40:36.180
of the solars.
You can see it's literally,

627
00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:39.420
it's the closest thing so far to a tricorder in the sense of being able to

628
00:40:39.421 --> 00:40:44.421
identify and sequence something and identify organisms and do censuses.

629
00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:45.150
What's,
you know,

630
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:50.150
what microbes are here and here is a one that we weren't expecting to see Selena

631
00:40:50.191 --> 00:40:50.610
bacteria.

632
00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:55.610
You see the little thin blue wedge at the Young Gay Clr in 2016 but it's

633
00:40:55.921 --> 00:40:59.820
comparable to the PCR and centrifuge,
you know,

634
00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:01.710
traditional DNA sequencing approaches.

635
00:41:01.711 --> 00:41:06.000
But you can do it in your hand from a laptop as long as you can keep it cold

636
00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:12.990
and some more men I and analysis and data from this past year showing both the

637
00:41:12.991 --> 00:41:16.680
archaea bacteria if we're looking at for extreme of files,

638
00:41:16.681 --> 00:41:21.681
even viruses and then the haylight liking versus non haylight liking splits and

639
00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:25.380
the archaea and bacteria respectively.

640
00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:26.953
<v 0>Okay.</v>

641
00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.970
<v 1>We've also taken our field science samples.</v>

642
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:30.840
<v 0>Okay.</v>

643
00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:35.840
<v 1>Ben Done offline analysis both to young gay and study the region better and to</v>

644
00:41:36.321 --> 00:41:39.380
also provide a control for what we're doing with the instruments.

645
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:43.010
And one of the things that Jocelyn do,
regear row,

646
00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:47.210
what are the team members from Johns Hopkins found is that she had taken samples

647
00:41:47.211 --> 00:41:51.590
in the area in 2013 in 2015 there was a rainfall event,

648
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:54.170
very,
very rare there.
And just,

649
00:41:54.171 --> 00:41:58.040
and she noticed a significant shift in the populations,

650
00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:02.840
uh,
bacteria.
We're a much more diverse compared to the archaea or you know,

651
00:42:02.841 --> 00:42:07.841
the extreme of files and they are out competing the Saltin strategist as it were

652
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.050
then.
So cyanobacteria,

653
00:42:12.051 --> 00:42:16.160
which you hardly ever see in that area were suddenly popped up to in the

654
00:42:16.161 --> 00:42:17.180
noticeable numbers.

655
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:21.800
So this was an interesting sort of shift in terms of uh,

656
00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:25.850
climate change effects even in the Atacama in these haylight populations of

657
00:42:25.851 --> 00:42:29.300
microbes just as a side effect of doing this for the sake of the project.

658
00:42:29.301 --> 00:42:30.134
Otherwise.

659
00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:35.090
And this compares traditional methods to the results with the men I n so fairly

660
00:42:35.091 --> 00:42:38.390
comparable and uh,
we'll probably go forward with that.

661
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.250
So things which are wrap up that we are currently doing,

662
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:48.170
we finished our field deployment,
we had a,

663
00:42:48.171 --> 00:42:50.240
we will head our initial Ameela test.

664
00:42:50.241 --> 00:42:54.470
We have the laser disruption mass spec going to a vacuum chamber in June.

665
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:57.620
In the autumn,

666
00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:01.700
we will be taking these instruments and instrument mockups and putting them on

667
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:05.360
Terry's rover there along with the drill in the arm and seeing if they will all

668
00:43:05.361 --> 00:43:08.630
fit and if we drive them around and bang them around and get them all dusty,

669
00:43:08.631 --> 00:43:10.760
will they still work or will they fry themselves?

670
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:14.300
We'd rather find out if they fry themselves here in mountain view before rather

671
00:43:14.301 --> 00:43:19.301
than taking them to the Atacama and we'll continue to do sample analysis and do

672
00:43:19.491 --> 00:43:23.270
our vibration,
thermal and power of environments characterization.

673
00:43:23.271 --> 00:43:28.271
So that'll take us to maybe next February or March two year three.

674
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.620
So the three of the multiple steps we have done,
two of them,

675
00:43:33.621 --> 00:43:38.180
the first two 2018 we'll put the instruments on the rover that will be locally

676
00:43:38.181 --> 00:43:42.560
controlled except the LDM s will probably be operated on the side still given

677
00:43:42.561 --> 00:43:47.561
their lagging now and then in leading the 2019 early 2019 we will operate this

678
00:43:48.201 --> 00:43:53.060
as a mission sim to at least some level sending it commands remotely from a Nasa

679
00:43:53.061 --> 00:43:54.380
Ames or other places.

680
00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:59.810
And that concludes what I had prepared for y'all.
It's,

681
00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:02.990
so we've got about 10 minutes I guess for questions if anybody's interested.

682
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:04.303
Thanks.

683
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:09.743
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

684
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:15.500
we're all looking at it.

685
00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.680
<v 1>Okay.
So the bottom of the hole on the bottom of the hole</v>

686
00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.353
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

687
00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:27.960
<v 1>this is a 2.5 meter deep pit that has been documented in the literature,</v>

688
00:44:29.861 --> 00:44:32.940
actually has been a in multiple papers.

689
00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:37.980
It a is over about 10 kilometers west of the young gay station,

690
00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:40.500
sorta the ghost town area,

691
00:44:40.501 --> 00:44:44.640
but is one of the primary research areas and where the samples that are labeled

692
00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:48.330
as young gay come from the vicinity of this because we actually,

693
00:44:48.331 --> 00:44:50.040
without using a drill or other means,

694
00:44:50.041 --> 00:44:53.730
this was dug out with people in bunny suits with pick axes.

695
00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:59.060
So if you can imagine being carefully bundled up to avoid contaminating what's

696
00:44:59.191 --> 00:45:03.720
down at two meters down because if you've got tiny traces of organic material

697
00:45:03.721 --> 00:45:08.040
and biomarkers,
you know you don't want to spit on it or sweat on it.

698
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.820
So you have to be bundled up and you're in a hundred degree heat and you're

699
00:45:11.821 --> 00:45:14.610
digging at something in your,
you know,
below the level of this.

700
00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:19.611
So you can imagine how much of a adventure that has been by five or 10 years

701
00:45:19.681 --> 00:45:24.360
worth of successive graduate students doing their PhD dissertations coming to

702
00:45:24.361 --> 00:45:27.630
this location among others.
Also,

703
00:45:27.631 --> 00:45:32.110
it makes a nice looking up at the field science crew photo,
which is,

704
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.150
I just thought they looked inquisitive,
so like to use it.
So

705
00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:42.440
<v 3>in the back,
my question is about the rover.</v>

706
00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:47.770
Is that the final look and feel of the rover that's going to Mars because they

707
00:45:48.051 --> 00:45:51.870
noticed some differences like this is four wheel versus like usually literally

708
00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:52.713
six wheel.

709
00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:58.010
And is there anything that you guys learned from the current issues with the

710
00:45:58.011 --> 00:46:01.820
wheels like damage your wheels and the aluminum wheels?

711
00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:08.050
<v 1>Well,
there are mobility architecture issues.
Yeah,
of course.</v>

712
00:46:08.051 --> 00:46:12.490
The irony of course is you're sitting next to the rover guy as it were,

713
00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:16.720
uh,
and the audience.
So this is really his rover,

714
00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:21.930
but there are not everyone is wedded to the rocker bogey architecture that you

715
00:46:22.181 --> 00:46:27.100
see on the Mer rovers or curiosity.
It's one amongst several.

716
00:46:27.101 --> 00:46:30.250
There are advantages in terms of maneuverability and getting yourself in and out

717
00:46:30.251 --> 00:46:34.150
of things between just a rocker architecture independently like you see here.

718
00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:40.050
We did have to the look at if you notice we had rubber tires and um,

719
00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:44.800
while that probably wouldn't go to planetary surface because rubber has organic,

720
00:46:44.801 --> 00:46:47.770
you leave as you,
anyone who walks along a highway,

721
00:46:47.771 --> 00:46:50.650
you see bits of rubber that are shed by tire.
So you're thinking,

722
00:46:50.651 --> 00:46:53.710
well aren't you going to contaminate your samples with bits of rubber?

723
00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:59.020
So we actually needed to do drive the rover over ground before we drilled it and

724
00:46:59.021 --> 00:47:02.620
then take the drilled spent samples and sample in surface samples and send them

725
00:47:02.621 --> 00:47:05.950
off for analysis to see if we were getting appreciable contamination.

726
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:10.630
Not from bro mine but from tire rubber and we've had to look at that and things

727
00:47:10.631 --> 00:47:14.560
like outgassing of solvents and things wells.
In terms of the Longterm rover,

728
00:47:14.561 --> 00:47:18.640
it probably really is a function as much of the intended,

729
00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:24.540
the surface roughness and sort of the masses,
you know,

730
00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:29.550
the sandy versus from obstacle size dimensions of the obstacle.

731
00:47:30.581 --> 00:47:33.580
You know there are architectures where you might be better off with treads

732
00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:37.870
depending on the treads are pretty heavy.
So I would not say that the,

733
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:43.400
the dual rocker architecture is inherently superior for Mars or Europa.

734
00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:49.360
It's really a trade off or a trade study according to your design intended

735
00:47:49.361 --> 00:47:50.194
environment

736
00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.660
over on the side blue shirt.

737
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:00.610
<v 4>Um,</v>

738
00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:05.410
you mentioned earlier on that one goal is to have the rover be able to determine

739
00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.150
what is a good place to drill.

740
00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:11.380
So my question is what constitutes a good place to trail and how would the rover

741
00:48:11.381 --> 00:48:12.430
go about determining that?

742
00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:14.640
<v 0>Okay,</v>

743
00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.320
<v 1>what is a good place to drill?</v>

744
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:22.670
The way a geologist or an investigator in the field would choose this?

745
00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.420
If I were working for an exploration company,

746
00:48:27.421 --> 00:48:32.310
I would want to do seismic or other geophysical surveys and have some idea of

747
00:48:32.311 --> 00:48:36.660
the strata and what lies underneath my feet for underneath my wheels.

748
00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:41.250
Figuratively speaking,
problem is on most planetary surfaces.

749
00:48:41.251 --> 00:48:42.390
We're not going to have that.

750
00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:47.570
We might have something at tens of meters scale that we've gotten from ground

751
00:48:47.641 --> 00:48:50.040
penetrating radar for some sort of remote sensing,

752
00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:55.380
but we're not going to know down to the meter scale probably of what's down

753
00:48:55.381 --> 00:48:55.501
there.

754
00:48:55.501 --> 00:48:58.650
So how do we know that there's this interesting feature two meters down here,

755
00:48:58.651 --> 00:49:00.240
but it's not over there.

756
00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:06.110
So we can only go by visuals and surface and we can look for patterns,

757
00:49:09.211 --> 00:49:11.010
things that look like outflows,

758
00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:16.310
things that look like a fractal structures in the soil or on rock surfaces.

759
00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:20.880
We can also do the logistical or practical side of obstacle avoidance.

760
00:49:20.881 --> 00:49:21.360
We didn't hit,

761
00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:25.440
let's not drill or position ourselves over a boulder or over something with a

762
00:49:25.441 --> 00:49:27.620
sharply canted,
um,

763
00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:31.860
surface that is going to deflect our drill and make it just operationally

764
00:49:31.861 --> 00:49:34.380
difficult to go through.
So if we can handle the,
at least the,

765
00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:38.340
let's at least find a nice flat space to drill as opposed to the top of a

766
00:49:38.341 --> 00:49:42.930
boulder that's at least doing sort of our bottom level of Maslow's hierarchy,

767
00:49:42.931 --> 00:49:44.760
well,
at least not doing any harm.

768
00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:49.200
And then if we can work it up and start picking things that are more visually

769
00:49:49.201 --> 00:49:50.130
more interesting,

770
00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:54.480
we can start weeding out all the bulk of the things that are less interesting.

771
00:49:54.481 --> 00:49:58.920
And even if I can throw away 85% of the potential drill sites,

772
00:49:58.921 --> 00:50:00.270
including the tops of boulders,

773
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:05.100
that means I've just narrowed it down to 10 or 15% of interesting spaces.

774
00:50:05.101 --> 00:50:07.140
And while those still may be boring in the end,

775
00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:09.660
I'm still a lot better off if I can do that,

776
00:50:09.661 --> 00:50:11.010
especially if I have to lift the rover,

777
00:50:11.011 --> 00:50:14.520
make that decision because of the communications lag and the bandwidth issues.

778
00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.850
And we are talking about,
you know,
what's,

779
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:22.860
how would you incorporate remote sensing data?
I,
there are folks that,

780
00:50:22.861 --> 00:50:25.440
uh,
colleagues who are working on that now,

781
00:50:25.441 --> 00:50:30.441
how do you incorporate visual from a rover or from something and whatever remote

782
00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:34.760
sensing you've got to try to figure out where to prospect or where to drill,

783
00:50:34.761 --> 00:50:36.860
you know,
where it is.
X marks the proverbial spot.

784
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:40.790
Any other questions?

785
00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:48.323
<v 0>Well,</v>

786
00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:53.830
<v 1>and that case,
thank you very much for your attention and for inviting me over.</v>

787
00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:57.820
And,
uh,
if you,
if anyone is interested,

788
00:50:57.821 --> 00:51:02.821
I have a few of our most recent mission deployment patches here for your taking

789
00:51:05.051 --> 00:51:09.340
as you like to go along.
And uh,
feel free to grab one.

790
00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:10.450
Thanks again.
