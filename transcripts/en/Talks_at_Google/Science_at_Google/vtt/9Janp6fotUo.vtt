1
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.870
Uh,
today we've got doctor Penelope Boston joining us from,
uh,

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.100
just next door over at NASA ames.
Uh,

3
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:14.760
she's the director of the NASA astrobiology institute and we'll be here talking

4
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:15.930
today a little bit about our research.

5
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.540
<v 2>Great.
Cool.
Welcome.</v>

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.853
<v 1>Okay,</v>

7
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.860
<v 2>thanks Kelvin.
I'm really happy to be here,
uh,</v>

8
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.060
to share a few thoughts,
uh,
with everybody about,
uh,

9
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.510
one of the most challenging things that we're trying to do at NASA and in fact

10
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.800
other space agencies around the world and that is,
uh,

11
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.330
trying to hunt for extra terrestrial life.

12
00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:45.290
And of course we've been doing this for a number of decades.
Um,

13
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.690
uh,
both within NASA,

14
00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:52.490
within the university and a research lab environment.

15
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.080
And um,

16
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.520
Europe is highly involved in this and other countries are coming on board.

17
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.090
Um,
Japan has a very active,
um,

18
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.300
a space program and a lot of interest in astrobiology as,
uh,

19
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.490
do people in China and many other parts of the world.

20
00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:13.010
So this is really a global enterprise,

21
00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:17.600
but I'm going to give you a really my own perspective on where the robbing

22
00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:18.434
points are.

23
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.250
Looking for life is extraordinarily difficult because life is not really a

24
00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:26.780
collection of stuff.
It's a collection of stuff.

25
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:29.780
Those actually behaving in the time dimension.

26
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.810
So it's an ongoing process and this means that it is

27
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.530
at one sense flamboyant.

28
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.850
We live on a planet that's actually a saturated with life.
This,

29
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.840
our planet is dominated by life.

30
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.480
But if we have a life on other bodies in our solar system,

31
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:55.280
it clearly isn't the same kind of,
uh,
global dominating force that it is here.

32
00:01:55.281 --> 00:02:00.281
And so this really changes the game and a lot of the work that those of us in

33
00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:04.160
the,
in the science community have done on this,
uh,

34
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.240
have to do with looking at examples that we have on this planet that are,

35
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.860
um,
very challenging.
So marginal environments,

36
00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:17.300
extreme environments on our planet has really sort of set the stage for trying

37
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:20.360
to expand our,
our thinking in that regard.

38
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.550
Um,

39
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.380
we really want a tricorder where you just point your device at something and it

40
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:31.180
tells you a bunch of wonderful stuff.
But we actually really,
uh,

41
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.120
are still fumbling around in many cases with,
uh,

42
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.460
more like a Rube Goldberg device.

43
00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:41.780
And this is the cartoon that actually started,
um,

44
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.880
the idea of these crazy devices that Rube Goldberg who was a famous artist and

45
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:50.720
um,
and cartoonist actually came up with back in the 1930s.

46
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.150
So we often refer to Rube Goldberg devices as some kind of kluged together
thing.

47
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.300
So even though we have many a technologies that we are,

48
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.360
that we are working with because life is a subtle phenomenon and we don't know

49
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:11.980
what it's going to be made on other planets and we don't know even what it's,
um,

50
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.260
pace of life and many other things about it are actually going to be like we are

51
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:22.261
trying to design a instrumentation and protocols and accessibility to places

52
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:30.181
that we are tremendously unfamiliar with and where the life might be so

53
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.760
different in its many different properties.

54
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.300
That trying to even recognize it as life might be very challenging.

55
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.980
Now I could go the other way.

56
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:43.750
It could be that there's something so optimized about the way our life does

57
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:48.490
chemistry,
that it's the only road available.
I don't personally believe that,

58
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:50.140
but there are people who do believe that.

59
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.850
But really these are articles of faith at this point rather than really
informed,

60
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.750
uh,
stances.
So that's the background.

61
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.740
So what are we looking for?
Well,
we're looking for things that are still alive.

62
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.500
If they were cute and green with three eyes like a,
these guys from the movies,

63
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:09.400
that would be easy.

64
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.380
The truth is that they're much more likely to be microbial organisms.

65
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.150
And one of the reasons that we think so,
of course,

66
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:23.380
is because really for three quarters of the time that we have evidence of life

67
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.160
on our planet in the rock record,
it was microbial life,

68
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.240
big things like us.
We're,
um,
uh,
decorative,

69
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:35.980
additional afterthoughts that happened after many different cycles of geological

70
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:39.370
changes had occurred over hundreds and hundreds of millions of years,

71
00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:40.330
billions of years.

72
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.200
So it wasn't until between seven and 800 million years ago that what we would

73
00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:53.560
now call complicated,
multicellular things began to be,
uh,

74
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.663
evolving.

75
00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.090
And this is on a planet where we have evidence of life back to at least 3.6

76
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:04.150
possibly 3.7 and possibly 3.8 depending,

77
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.780
uh,
evidence from that period of time.

78
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:10.960
It's really subtle and really hard to interpret.
But anyway,

79
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.040
the bottom line is it was a heck of a lot longer ago then.

80
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.780
Then we have big things.
So this pushes us in,
into the realm of microbiology.

81
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.240
On the other end of the spectrum,
of course,

82
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.030
we are also looking for evidence of past life.

83
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.830
And I don't know if there are any amateur paleontologists in the room,
but if so,

84
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:34.831
you'll know that the way you look for fossil material is very different from the

85
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:39.520
way you studied living material.
And yet we have both of these twin goals,

86
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.680
uh,
because we don't know what we're going to find.

87
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.340
And even though we would all love to find a actively living organisms somewhere

88
00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:48.880
in our solar system,

89
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.860
we'd still be very happy if we found convincing evidence of even past life,

90
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:55.000
for example,
on Mars.

91
00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.020
So one of the biggest problems is that if you take a physics and chemistry

92
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:03.200
perspective,
this is very instructive,

93
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.410
accept that life is really not a package of bulk properties.

94
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.140
So in many cases we are measuring bulk properties of a planet and buy bulk.

95
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:18.830
I don't mean uh,
you know,
things the size of California,

96
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.060
I mean bulk things that are above the microbial scale.

97
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.200
So micro organisms are individually very tiny,
although they can be,
uh,

98
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.740
macroscopically visible in the aggregate,

99
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.690
but in very low nutrient environments where,
uh,

100
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.390
the numbers of organisms are very low,

101
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.460
you have patchy distributions that are hard to explain.

102
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.180
You know,
the obvious thing is if you have a nutrient gradient,

103
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:51.290
you would expect organisms to be arrayed along that nutrient gradient.

104
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.060
And there is some of that,

105
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:56.990
but there's also a more magical properties that life has,

106
00:06:56.991 --> 00:07:01.220
which seemed to have something to do with self organizing properties of complex

107
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:03.800
systems.
And they do not just,
you know,

108
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.740
trivially map onto what is available for them.

109
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.090
And this is something that a number of folks in the community are studying,

110
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:12.800
but we really don't have a grasp of it.

111
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.180
So why am I talking to you about this?
Other than the,
um,

112
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.710
working at NASA currently,

113
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:23.060
I have spent most of my career working in extreme environments and for the past

114
00:07:23.061 --> 00:07:24.440
25 years or so,

115
00:07:24.441 --> 00:07:29.150
I have focused primarily on the subsurface and natural caves and minds.

116
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.550
I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on my work,

117
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:34.550
but I just want to show you a few examples,

118
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:37.640
some of our more photogenic examples,
um,

119
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:43.030
that try to look at the most extreme physical and chemical conditions that we

120
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:48.551
can find on our planet in an environment in the subsurface where photosynthesis

121
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:50.270
is not possible.

122
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.960
So our focus has always been on the micro organisms that make their living not

123
00:07:57.051 --> 00:08:00.230
off organic materials,
but off inorganic materials.

124
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:04.370
They're essentially rock eaters and they get their various,
um,

125
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.890
energy quantum by quantum,

126
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:11.300
by doing things like oxidizing metals in,
in minerals.

127
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.200
So this is a geologically driven,

128
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:20.510
a source of energy for these organisms.
And as we look around our solar system,

129
00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:23.600
we see no where else that is green and gooey like our planet.

130
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:29.590
And so the fact that we have photosynthesis as our primary driver of the energy

131
00:08:31.941 --> 00:08:35.180
that goes to run our biosphere is very lucky for us.

132
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.410
That's why we're all sitting here.

133
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:41.060
But on a planet with a much more subdued a potential biology,

134
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.710
we're not going to see that.

135
00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:46.700
And we know that we don't have anywhere else like earth that we can find in our

136
00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:49.940
solar system.
So we're looking for a much more subtle,

137
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.790
much lower biomass systems,

138
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:56.910
perhaps functioning at a much a slower level.

139
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.800
So we go places like in the,
uh,

140
00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:05.520
the upper left hand corner.
This is a cave that we have studied in Tabasco,

141
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:08.400
Mexico for,
uh,
almost 20 years now,

142
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.770
starting in 1998.
And this system has dominated by sulfuric acid.

143
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:18.771
It has hydrogen sulfide pouring into it from a number of springs and um,

144
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.560
that goes into a reaction with oxygen in the system,

145
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.650
in the water and in the air and produces sulfuric acid.

146
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:32.130
So it's a hyper acidic environment and that's where we're all duded up in the

147
00:09:32.131 --> 00:09:36.490
suits and so forth.
Um,
and the breathing masks and,
um,

148
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.920
auxiliary oxygen bottle so that we can actually survive in there long enough to

149
00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:45.390
do the work that's actually very chemically extreme.

150
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:49.470
It's not temperature extreme.
So if you go to the upper right hand side,

151
00:09:49.471 --> 00:09:52.320
you can see that we're working in another environment.

152
00:09:52.321 --> 00:09:56.400
This is a much newer project on the flanks of Mount Rainier.

153
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.310
There's a lot of mountaineering involved in getting up there.

154
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:04.200
There are a permanent ice caves that are the result of being in an IC

155
00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:07.380
environment,
but these are a volcanic fumaroles.

156
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.850
Mount Rainier courses are very large and gorgeous volcano.
Um,

157
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.870
that is definitely still active,
although it hasn't erupted in a good long time,

158
00:10:15.871 --> 00:10:17.250
but it will again someday.

159
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.360
And in the meantime it's got a lot of the similar gasses,
but these,

160
00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:23.520
you're coming out into a very cold environment.

161
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:29.100
And then the lower left has been the focus of a lot of national geographic

162
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:33.220
expeditions that we have,
um,
had been part of.
And,
uh,

163
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:37.560
we have explored these giant crystals in a very hot environment.
So,

164
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.630
uh,
this is on the order of between 40 and sixties,
um,
Celsius.

165
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:43.973
Um,

166
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:49.280
the hottest that we've had in there is a in excess of 60 degrees c to the point

167
00:10:49.561 --> 00:10:53.220
where one of my former graduate students got a second degree burns when one of

168
00:10:53.221 --> 00:10:57.780
her boots ruptured.
So that's pushing in the very hot direction.

169
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:03.000
There are things in the subsurface of earth that are unsuspected in the surface.

170
00:11:03.001 --> 00:11:08.001
And so it's almost like going to another planet every time you go into one of

171
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:09.660
these extraordinary environments.

172
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.960
And that has been very helpful in my own thinking about imagining these

173
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:18.960
different kinds of conditions combined in various different ways and how you

174
00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:23.700
would go about actually trying to find these in,
um,
uh,
you know,

175
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:28.410
alien terrain and certainly robotically for the foreseeable future.

176
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.420
Ultimately,
perhaps we will have humans on Mars that can actually do some of this

177
00:11:33.421 --> 00:11:34.201
exploration,

178
00:11:34.201 --> 00:11:37.770
but for a good long time we're not going to be able to do it other than with our

179
00:11:37.771 --> 00:11:42.480
devices that we send there.
So this is a wordy slide,

180
00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:47.070
but I want you to really focus on the colored,
um,
uh,
words.

181
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.670
These are the high level thing.
So we talk about biosignatures,

182
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.040
meaning anything that leaves behind,

183
00:11:54.041 --> 00:11:59.041
and this is can be as subtle as metabolically produced gases that you see here

184
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:00.694
in this list.

185
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:06.010
Obviously the gold standard would be if we could actually find live organisms,

186
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:11.250
but much more subtle accumulations of suggestive biological molecules that we

187
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:14.530
know are a part of our biology here.

188
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.380
Possibly molecular fossils.

189
00:12:17.381 --> 00:12:21.520
These are traces of organic materials that we know at least on earth are

190
00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:25.300
associated with various different kinds of organisms might be preserved and

191
00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:29.250
things like,
uh,
a silicate materials or carbonates.

192
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:33.580
And of course if we find true fossils,

193
00:12:33.581 --> 00:12:38.290
they're known as body fossils that are somehow recognizable by their structure

194
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.340
and not a,
a,
an artificial,

195
00:12:41.341 --> 00:12:46.341
a mimic of a form of life that would be obviously the most strong type of

196
00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:47.231
evidence.

197
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:51.250
But there are many other things that we see on earth that are the result of life

198
00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:53.500
including biopack,
excuse me,

199
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.360
bio minerals that are produced by the activity of these,
uh,
rock eating and,

200
00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:01.120
and mineral pooping out organisms that I was just mentioning.

201
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:06.550
And then other subtle Geo chemical traces that I will not go into the nitty

202
00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:09.730
gritty details well on my life.

203
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:13.390
Oh meter on the left hand side you can see I've got sort of a slider bar from

204
00:13:13.391 --> 00:13:17.770
extent life to extinct life.
So all these different kinds of pieces of evidence,

205
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.970
um,
either,
uh,

206
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:25.020
pertain more to the extinct life end of that spectrum and more or more to the

207
00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:28.060
extent life,
uh,
guys that are still alive.

208
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.320
So the truth is about our,

209
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.370
our current grasp on life detection that we were really doing it by

210
00:13:36.371 --> 00:13:37.900
circumstantial evidence.

211
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:43.620
We are looking at some of those weaker lines of evidence that I just quickly

212
00:13:44.141 --> 00:13:48.790
flashed before you in the previous slide and looking for um,

213
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:53.890
uh,
places where we may find complicated organic compounds.

214
00:13:53.891 --> 00:13:55.930
And I don't mean just simple amino acids,

215
00:13:55.931 --> 00:14:00.550
I mean things that are more complex that we can imagine being a product of life

216
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.580
and the co location of those,
um,

217
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:08.610
or patterns of molecular or even suspicious patterns of um,

218
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.800
uh,
elemental abundances in one place.

219
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:17.110
But that's really still forensically a circumstantial piece of evidence,
right?

220
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.770
None of those things are really the clinchers.
You could go,
gee,

221
00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:24.880
that looks really suspicious,
but if it isn't wiggling around,

222
00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.060
you don't really know that it's life without a whole lot more work.

223
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.770
On the other hand,
of course it's very hard to find complicated structures.

224
00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:37.490
So um,
this particular electron micrograph that you see there is from uh,

225
00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.890
one of our lava tube caves that we've studied and they're pretty convincing.

226
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:46.150
They're fuzzy,
they look sort of like little chrysanthemums to me.

227
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.690
Although each one of those is about a micrometer in diameter.

228
00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:53.510
So you could fit a hundred of those across the diameter of one of your hairs.

229
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.801
I'm so very,

230
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:59.801
very tiny and they appear in very patchy distributions in this lava tube cause

231
00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:02.780
there isn't a whole lot for them to eat.

232
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:07.670
So what are our chances of being able to look at enough material on a robotic

233
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.340
mission to actually come up with those?

234
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.450
So you can begin to see this conundrum and we've got,
you know,

235
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.370
various different lines of evidence that we need.

236
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:22.420
But trying to get them all on the same sample or in the same time is really

237
00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:24.194
challenging.

238
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:29.810
So I just show this as an example of the work of one of my colleagues.
And um,

239
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.990
uh,
in fact,
uh,
one of the team members of our,

240
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:37.850
one of our NASA astrobiology institute teams,
uh,
happens to be the one that,

241
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.390
uh,
is headed out of Seti right here.
And,
uh,

242
00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:44.330
Richard spends a lot of his time worrying about how we're going to do life

243
00:15:44.331 --> 00:15:44.860
detection,

244
00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:49.400
has come up with a steps towards one of these analytical combinations.

245
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:51.410
And we're not going to go through this in detail,

246
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:56.650
but just to point out that he's trying to combine micro fluidics to actually get

247
00:15:57.021 --> 00:16:00.200
access to a micro organism,

248
00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.300
a sized creatures,

249
00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:07.540
and at the same time use fluorescence to try to look for living materials.

250
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.040
Um,
very often,
of course,

251
00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:14.840
we look for natural fluorescence or we look for fluorescence that we can

252
00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:16.620
actually induce,
um,

253
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:21.290
by using various wavelengths or in fact even putting materials into,

254
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:22.350
uh,

255
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:26.750
the sample that will bind with biological compounds.

256
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:30.380
So we're making a lot of progress in the these lines.

257
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.060
But even this is not really a life detection.
It,

258
00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:38.450
it is still piecing together a tiny bits of information about the chemistry and

259
00:16:38.451 --> 00:16:41.450
hoping this is real life detection.

260
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.680
If something was big and it came up and bit you on the ankle,

261
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:50.510
that'd be pretty convincing.
And anything short of that is much less convincing.

262
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.190
And so the question for us is,
what is the suite of things that we need?

263
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:59.360
How many different lines of evidence do we need and how strong does that

264
00:16:59.361 --> 00:17:04.220
evidence have to be to actually convince us at sometime in the future that we've

265
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:08.300
found an actual living creature?
Well,
this is not new.

266
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.360
This is a famous cartoon from the New Yorker,

267
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.870
a that was drawn in 1962.
Um,

268
00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:19.820
very early on in the space age and the fundamental principles of what we need to

269
00:17:19.821 --> 00:17:23.540
do are still the same.
It's really hard,

270
00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:28.880
but we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what life forms you might get

271
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:33.980
from first principles given whatever properties you know about a particular

272
00:17:33.981 --> 00:17:36.290
body.
So,
for example,
Mars,

273
00:17:36.291 --> 00:17:41.060
we've had a long history of attempting to look for life on Mars.

274
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.730
Our first attempts in,
um,

275
00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:49.060
in the early to mid 1970s were very naive in retrospect.

276
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.720
We didn't know that,
um,

277
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:55.740
this was before we'd even discovered that there were hydrothermal vents at the

278
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.390
bottom of the oceans.
Right?
We,

279
00:17:57.391 --> 00:18:01.770
we did not know about the world of extreme of files,
um,

280
00:18:01.771 --> 00:18:02.491
at that time,

281
00:18:02.491 --> 00:18:07.491
but we did know that maybe on a planet there would be a very different

282
00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:12.090
atmosphere and the creatures there would be using that.

283
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:16.200
So that notion is one that has been in people's minds for a long time.

284
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:21.630
So I just want to share with you some of my biggest concerns and where I hope

285
00:18:21.631 --> 00:18:25.830
that,
um,
not only folks within NASA and the university communities,

286
00:18:25.831 --> 00:18:29.070
but everybody within the tech realm,
uh,

287
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:33.270
that might be interested in,
in some of these,
um,
these issues,

288
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.270
um,
could find a way to contribute.

289
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:41.040
So these are the five biggest problems that I see right now.

290
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.200
Simultaneous measurements,
you would think we would assault this.
We haven't,

291
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.800
um,
in terms of doing the kind of biology,
um,

292
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.510
that we do in extreme environments or any environment on our,

293
00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.980
we have missions that don't last that long and if they do last long,

294
00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:02.400
we go to different places.

295
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:08.180
So the idea of long term observations to capture changes in things that might be

296
00:19:10.381 --> 00:19:12.390
alive that may be living on a very,

297
00:19:12.391 --> 00:19:16.440
very slow timescale and growing very,
very occasionally,

298
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:20.910
perhaps once every hundred years,
perhaps once every 10,000 years.

299
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:27.030
And we have examples of that in the Antarctic,
even on our own planet.

300
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:33.110
Uh,
the doubling time for cells that are living under sandstone,

301
00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:34.500
um,
uh,

302
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:39.590
in sand stones in the Antarctic dry valleys probably only reproduce once every

303
00:19:39.751 --> 00:19:44.400
20,000 years.
Well,
that's pretty darn hard to capture that,
um,

304
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:48.450
anywhere
and certainly on another planet.

305
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.520
So how do we solve that problem?

306
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.870
A problem three is access to challenging terrain as well.
It's robots.

307
00:19:55.230 --> 00:20:00.230
I love robots and there's a wonderful community of robot designers that are

308
00:20:03.601 --> 00:20:06.940
coming up with,
with,
um,
concepts that are,
you know,

309
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:10.140
certainly the kinds of things that we're going to need.
And yet,

310
00:20:10.141 --> 00:20:14.190
what are we still flying?
Where's Fluor?
Flying a mini coopers basically.

311
00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:19.090
Okay.
So we have to close the gap of trying to,
uh,

312
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:24.120
be able to do to tech demos and actually vet these kinds of much more creative

313
00:20:24.301 --> 00:20:29.100
and much more capable robotic capabilities before we can fly them.

314
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.890
What you do on earth is one thing,

315
00:20:31.891 --> 00:20:36.570
but getting something ready to be approved for space flight is a whole other

316
00:20:36.571 --> 00:20:40.590
thing.
It's vastly more difficult.
It's vastly more expensive.

317
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.100
Problem four is essentially seeing like a human.

318
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:48.280
And by that I mean sensing and integrating at the same time,

319
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:54.930
particularly for the icy moons around the gas giants where we know that there

320
00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:56.830
are,
uh,

321
00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:02.280
liquid interiors of these and where there's a huge amount of,

322
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.120
uh,
uh,

323
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:09.660
circumstantial hope and evidence that these would be very habitable places on

324
00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:13.690
the interior.
We,
um,

325
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.950
cannot direct these immediately on a step by step basis from Earth.

326
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:22.810
It's hard enough with Mars in terms of the delay in the return time of

327
00:21:22.811 --> 00:21:27.490
commanding spacecraft and commanding payloads when you get out,
uh,

328
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.910
to the orbits of Saturn and Jupiter.
Uh,

329
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.610
the delay time just makes that ridiculous.

330
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:38.090
And in fact the interference from the radiation environment,

331
00:21:38.091 --> 00:21:42.550
he's high radiation environments and the,
and the gas giants and the fact that,

332
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.713
um,

333
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:48.880
wherever your interrogating is going to be eclipsed by the planet episodes and

334
00:21:48.881 --> 00:21:49.301
so forth,

335
00:21:49.301 --> 00:21:53.380
that fluidity of communication that you need to actually run things from the

336
00:21:53.381 --> 00:21:55.390
ground is simply not going to be there.

337
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:58.840
And this of course push it to the US in the direction of,
uh,

338
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.850
devices that can make their own decisions.

339
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:06.450
And then binding all these together is a thing called planetary protection.

340
00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:10.920
I don't how many of you have ever heard of this term?
Um,

341
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.660
it is not planetary defense,

342
00:22:13.661 --> 00:22:18.010
which is a related term that NASA has interests in.

343
00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:22.720
Uh,
that's when we're thinking about near Earth asteroids slamming into us.

344
00:22:22.721 --> 00:22:24.040
And what are we going to do about that?

345
00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:27.790
This is on the other end of the spectrum and this has to do with microbiology.

346
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.253
And this

347
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.720
is a problem that was recognized right at the dawn of the space age and before.

348
00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:40.380
And that is microbial life could potentially be a hazard to any life on another

349
00:22:41.951 --> 00:22:46.450
planet if it comes from here.
And then in turn,

350
00:22:46.451 --> 00:22:50.770
the reverse is also true and that is as we get to the era where we're bringing

351
00:22:50.771 --> 00:22:55.180
back samples from,
uh,
astrobiology targets like Mars,

352
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:59.670
we want to make sure that we are not risking any,
uh,
uh,

353
00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:03.340
adverse consequences for own one and only home planet.

354
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.060
So these are very serious issues and they have been taken very seriously.

355
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.800
NASA has a planetary protection officer and office with worries about this.

356
00:23:11.801 --> 00:23:16.510
There is an international body called Cospar,
um,
that,
uh,

357
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.790
brings together the,

358
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:22.820
the global space community and one of its divisions of courses devoted to

359
00:23:24.101 --> 00:23:27.070
planetary protection.
And in fact this year,

360
00:23:27.071 --> 00:23:31.500
the COSPAR meeting this summer is actually going to be down,
um,

361
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.900
in the Pasadena area in southern California.

362
00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:39.400
It travels all over the world.
The last one was in Turkey,
uh,

363
00:23:39.401 --> 00:23:42.430
was intended to be in Turkey and that was just as the COO happened,

364
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.200
so that one was canceled.

365
00:23:44.201 --> 00:23:48.590
But this is the body that deals with a lot of interactions and it deals with

366
00:23:48.591 --> 00:23:52.910
this problem of how do we make sure that we're not screwing up somebody else's

367
00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:57.740
planet and that we're not screwing up our own.
So this is a very serious problem.

368
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:02.570
So just a few details.
The simultaneous measurements,

369
00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:04.700
we've got a lot of signal to noise problems.

370
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:09.110
It doesn't matter what kind of planet it is.
We've got issues with both of these.

371
00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.970
Um,
we're looking at patching us that we don't understand.

372
00:24:13.971 --> 00:24:16.250
As I mentioned before,
low biomass,

373
00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.310
probably the life might be very cryptic that is,

374
00:24:19.311 --> 00:24:24.230
I'm not recognizable to us and they might a thrash around at a very,

375
00:24:24.231 --> 00:24:25.910
very slow pace compared to us.

376
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:31.670
And the minute you take a microbial sample,
even here on earth,

377
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:32.990
you have changed it.

378
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:39.140
And we try to compensate for that here on earth because we understand a lot more

379
00:24:39.141 --> 00:24:40.400
about our own biology.

380
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:45.590
But we have found that a problem in extreme environments where we are poking

381
00:24:45.591 --> 00:24:48.290
around at things that we don't know who's there,

382
00:24:48.291 --> 00:24:49.760
we don't know how many are there.

383
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.360
It all looks like minerals or soil or something,
uh,

384
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.050
is only after a significant amount of work that you can actually prove that some

385
00:24:57.051 --> 00:24:58.220
of these things are alive.

386
00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.400
And some of those examples I show here from uh,

387
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.890
some of our previous work,

388
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.920
the stars that you see on the interior of each one of those manganese oxide

389
00:25:09.031 --> 00:25:14.031
stars is a tiny micro organism and it causes the precipitation of that manganese

390
00:25:15.021 --> 00:25:20.021
oxide as a byproduct of using other oxidation states manganese minerals to make

391
00:25:20.991 --> 00:25:25.340
its living.
And it produces these characteristic things.
Um,

392
00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:30.260
I can't tell you how many times this kind of work has to be submitted before you

393
00:25:30.261 --> 00:25:34.370
can prove to yourself and other people that you really looking at a living
thing.

394
00:25:34.371 --> 00:25:37.220
Because from the surface it just looks like a mineral.

395
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:42.950
The other end of the scale is we see things here on earth that we cannot

396
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.240
determine what they are.

397
00:25:44.241 --> 00:25:47.450
And I show this thing that looks like a broken mesh stocking.

398
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.130
And we have found these kinds of structures literally all over the world in

399
00:25:52.131 --> 00:25:56.600
every kind of geochemistry and every kind of temperature in caves,

400
00:25:56.601 --> 00:26:00.500
in the subsurface.
And after 20 years of working on this,

401
00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:01.550
we still don't know what they are.

402
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.100
They don't map onto any other kind of micro organism.

403
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:10.220
So even here we essentially are working with aliens in a way.

404
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:16.300
So the solution to this is really that we need simultaneous multispectral and

405
00:26:16.431 --> 00:26:20.300
multiscale imaging and we need to have that done at the same time.

406
00:26:20.301 --> 00:26:25.301
We're actually interrogating the chemistry and preferably something about the

407
00:26:25.941 --> 00:26:30.941
energy state to look at what the in tropic condition is within a suspected

408
00:26:32.061 --> 00:26:35.660
organism and all at the same scale that matters to microorganisms,

409
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:37.220
which is really very tiny.

410
00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:42.800
It doesn't do you any good to look at one size of a hand sample rock on Mars for

411
00:26:42.801 --> 00:26:46.140
one and the other side for another thing and the other side for another thing.

412
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:51.440
You cannot then overcome that logical conundrum of bringing those together to

413
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:56.280
really produce highly,
uh,
trustable,

414
00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:58.950
high quality data that would convince us that it was a lie.

415
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.540
One of the things that may be helping us with this problem is,

416
00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:07.880
is relatively new and it's the idea of not big spacecraft,

417
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.840
but whole fleets of tiny little things.

418
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.350
So here again we've got the cryptic life problem.

419
00:27:13.351 --> 00:27:17.340
Are they even recognizable low biomass.
Again,

420
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:18.810
slow pace of life.

421
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:23.830
You can't invade them with clumsy sample handling because you might suppress

422
00:27:25.351 --> 00:27:26.490
them or destroy them.

423
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.620
And we even have large scale patterns changing on geological timescales are

424
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:33.690
perhaps a little shorter.
And the,

425
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.680
the upper image shows one of the patterns that we've been working in.

426
00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:41.490
If you look,
this is a,
the sulfuric acid cave in Mexico.

427
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.560
If you look at all the dark material,
you can see that it looks like little dots.

428
00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:48.750
It's actually a hieroglyphic like pattern.

429
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.310
And this is something that is a self organizing property of microbial

430
00:27:53.311 --> 00:27:54.144
communities,

431
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:59.540
which helps them distribute fluid flow and the distribution of nutrients and

432
00:28:00.601 --> 00:28:02.850
other limiting,
uh,
other limiting factors.

433
00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:06.990
We've been working on the mathematics of the development of this and then trying

434
00:28:06.991 --> 00:28:10.200
to back what that means out scientifically from that work.

435
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:14.070
So we have all of these complicated things,
um,

436
00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:18.510
the poof ball see which happens to be in a cave in southeast Alaska,
uh,

437
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:23.220
right around freezing.
Uh,
the white stuff that the hand is pointing to,

438
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:26.160
that's actually a shallow pool.

439
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.900
And those poof balls actually,
um,

440
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:34.190
are composed of a previously undescribed filamentous microorganisms that produce

441
00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:37.290
these beautiful finish shaped,
uh,

442
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.540
calcium carbonate crystals that you see in there.

443
00:28:39.541 --> 00:28:44.541
Well we've never seen anything like that before and trained to look for that

444
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:51.800
life signal when you're visual appearance of these poof balls are actually globs

445
00:28:54.751 --> 00:28:55.920
of fluffy minerals.

446
00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:01.550
So I show these pictures just to show you pretty how challenging this is even

447
00:29:02.491 --> 00:29:03.324
here.

448
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:08.780
So we really need longterm monitoring and we are looking at things like small

449
00:29:09.311 --> 00:29:12.480
sats,
smart breadcrumbs,
we don't know.

450
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.530
We need things that are self contained,
they don't have to do a lot,

451
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:21.180
but numerosity can overcome this problem of time,
dimension.

452
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:24.840
And it can also give us the basis for a statistical analysis.

453
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.150
If we can't sit there for 20,000 years,

454
00:29:27.151 --> 00:29:31.560
we can do a statistical analysis of various phenomena and that will give us

455
00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:36.180
insight into some of these.
Well now we get to the robots,
which I love.

456
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:41.990
I have a made a cottage industry before I went back into NASA when was still in

457
00:29:42.041 --> 00:29:45.850
the university environment of essentially being the pet astrobiologist have a

458
00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:47.260
lot of robot groups.

459
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:52.050
So I'm MIT and JPL and uh,

460
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:57.060
various other ones because people who are designing these wonderful robots,

461
00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.220
they need to know what the customer base once.

462
00:30:00.221 --> 00:30:05.090
And I am a customer and a very chatty customer and I love robots.
So,
um,

463
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:09.370
we want to be able to get into these difficult terrains.

464
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:13.420
In my case it's caves and a rock overhangs and things like that,

465
00:30:13.421 --> 00:30:17.590
but even rugged terrain on the surface of the Enceladus for example,

466
00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.730
or Europa,
um,
we have nothing that can do that at this point.

467
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.410
We need to be able to,
uh,

468
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.600
look at features of significance.
So,
uh,

469
00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:33.820
RSLs are these recurring slope Lynnie I these streaky things that come and go on

470
00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:39.550
Mars and appear to be brine or not.
Okay.

471
00:30:39.551 --> 00:30:40.840
We don't even know what they are.

472
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.030
Maybe they're liquid and maybe they're not liquid.

473
00:30:43.031 --> 00:30:47.950
So we have to be able to get up to those with,

474
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.630
um,
robotic devices that we can then remove.
Um,

475
00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.460
and,
and do the analysis.

476
00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:58.600
We want to be able to interrogate tiny environments and huge environments and

477
00:30:58.601 --> 00:30:59.860
sensitive environments.

478
00:30:59.861 --> 00:31:04.660
And the way to do that is with surrogates that are our robotic partners.

479
00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:08.050
Um,
biologically sensitive environments,

480
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.290
even with astronauts on site.
Um,

481
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.570
these planetary protection protocols,

482
00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:18.430
these planetary protection concerns means that it's not going to be like the

483
00:31:18.431 --> 00:31:22.780
Martian where the guy has tromping around on Mars and walking up to things and

484
00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:26.350
practically licking them.
I mean,
I know he was trying to stay alive,

485
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.120
but that's not the way to do science.
So that was a great adventure story,

486
00:31:31.121 --> 00:31:34.630
but it's not the way to do astrobiology on Mars with astronauts.

487
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:37.030
And so we need surrogates to be able to go do that.

488
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:42.040
So one of the frustrations that I have and I know a lot of folks have is that,

489
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.790
um,

490
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:47.790
we really need to enhance the pace of being able to field test these access,

491
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.120
um,

492
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:54.120
robots and other ways of expanding our ability to detect the environment.

493
00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.180
And we need to be able to fly some of these on tech demos.

494
00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:00.850
Space flight is really expensive.

495
00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:05.020
There is intense competition for everything that goes on a spacecraft.

496
00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:10.270
And so it's a big scramble to try to get a new devices that are,

497
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:11.200
um,

498
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:16.000
still untested in terms of actually going to another planet or even flying on a

499
00:32:16.001 --> 00:32:20.320
spacecraft.
And so this is really important,
um,

500
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:25.350
nested multiunit designs where you've essentially got something like we proposed

501
00:32:25.811 --> 00:32:29.890
many years ago.
We called it mother goose and it was a,
a mother robot.

502
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.410
And then we called it the egg crate,

503
00:32:32.411 --> 00:32:37.411
which is where all the little tiny individual robotic units we're going to be

504
00:32:37.511 --> 00:32:41.600
housed.
And at the time we were,
uh,
um,
um,

505
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:46.630
artificial polymer muscle activated hopping mechanism for these little spheres.

506
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.880
That was an MIT collaboration that we did.

507
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.870
But there are many other ways to do this and we have to solve this problem.

508
00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:58.580
One of our big talents as humans is,
um,

509
00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:03.650
seamlessly putting things together and coming up with creative solutions and our

510
00:33:04.161 --> 00:33:07.400
ability to do a sub cognitive pattern recognition.

511
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.000
And we don't even know how we do it.
I know that,
uh,

512
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:15.770
there are a lot of folks in the community at large that are trying to mimic this

513
00:33:15.771 --> 00:33:20.130
or uh,
emulate it,
perhaps is a better word.
Um,

514
00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:21.170
we need this.

515
00:33:21.171 --> 00:33:26.171
And really the direction that we have to go is in machine learning and pattern

516
00:33:26.181 --> 00:33:29.420
recognition and coupling that to our devices.

517
00:33:29.421 --> 00:33:33.830
Being able to make real time decisions in the scientific context.

518
00:33:33.831 --> 00:33:37.010
They have to be our surrogates more than just in mobility.

519
00:33:37.011 --> 00:33:40.880
They have to make decisions about which of their tools to deploy.

520
00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:46.220
We cannot tell them everything.
We can help them.
We can,
um,

521
00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:50.900
be with them as a virtual reality presentation perhaps,

522
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:56.200
but we need them to be us in some of these environments.

523
00:33:56.901 --> 00:33:58.850
And we are,
uh,
not even close.

524
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.730
This is one area that I'm hoping Silicon Valley will magically help with even

525
00:34:04.731 --> 00:34:08.420
though of course we have folks in Nasa who are working on it too.
So this is,
uh,

526
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:10.880
an area of very active interest in,

527
00:34:10.881 --> 00:34:15.881
in collaboration and then things that we can't directly sense magnetic fields,

528
00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.570
chemical gradients,

529
00:34:17.571 --> 00:34:21.650
all of these things that we do not a sense because it's not part of our

530
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.660
particular biological history.

531
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:29.150
So capturing that a pattern recognition and machine learning technology and then

532
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:33.440
really trying it out in some of these environments that I showed you that we

533
00:34:33.441 --> 00:34:37.100
work in here,
that connection is very loose.

534
00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:39.710
It's expensive to do that.
Um,

535
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:43.910
extreme environment expeditions are expensive enough to begin with.

536
00:34:43.911 --> 00:34:46.460
And then when you're taking a prototype,

537
00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:50.960
a technology out there where,
you know,
it's breaking down all the time,

538
00:34:50.961 --> 00:34:52.640
these are very,
very complicated.

539
00:34:52.641 --> 00:34:56.360
And one of the issues is that it's very hard to get enough money to do one of

540
00:34:56.361 --> 00:35:00.830
these projects.
Right?
And then the last problem of course,

541
00:35:00.831 --> 00:35:04.730
is this planetary protection.
If you

542
00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.910
do not do this well,

543
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:13.480
you and enhance the signal to noise problem in terms of looking for,
um,

544
00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:17.090
rare life in an extreme environment on another planet.

545
00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:23.140
If you find it and it's very similar to us in chemistry and you have not done

546
00:35:23.811 --> 00:35:25.640
the planetary protection well,

547
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:30.620
you have broken that logical chain where you can actually cleanly claim that

548
00:35:30.621 --> 00:35:32.510
what you have found is extra terrestrial,

549
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:37.100
maybe it's contamination you took with us,
with you.
Um,

550
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.550
so there is a scientific rationale and then there is a deep ecology rationale,

551
00:35:41.551 --> 00:35:44.970
which is you don't want to threaten another biosphere.

552
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:51.200
Nasa focuses heavily on the science aspect and leaves the ethical aspect to

553
00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:56.820
others.
But many of us within the agency and in the community of course are very

554
00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:59.280
concerned.
We're all conservation minded.

555
00:35:59.281 --> 00:36:02.580
We value our own biosphere as well as everybody else's.

556
00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:08.760
One of the problems that we have is that between the time that we actually flew

557
00:36:08.761 --> 00:36:12.810
the Viking missions to Mars and uh,

558
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:17.990
now we've had fabulous developments in electronics and all kinds of materials

559
00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:19.950
and engineering components.

560
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:25.190
The problem is for space flight to biologically sensitive potential targets.

561
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:31.050
Those have not been developed with an eye to how they can actually be
sterilized.

562
00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.950
You can't stick everything in,
uh,
uh,

563
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:39.020
heat and pressure chamber like an autoclave and have that device survive and

564
00:36:39.301 --> 00:36:40.170
still function.

565
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.870
So we have fundamental incompatibilities between the classic ways that we

566
00:36:45.871 --> 00:36:49.410
sterilize things as microbiologists on earth.

567
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:55.310
And the other aspect is we have to also have ultra clean conditions.

568
00:36:57.541 --> 00:37:00.930
So it's not enough to just kill off anything that is there.

569
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.400
You also have to have your spacecraft scrupulously clean so that here again,

570
00:37:05.401 --> 00:37:08.760
you don't get a signal to noise problem.
You don't get contamination,

571
00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:11.380
even if you're not looking for life.
Even a,

572
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.330
your devices that are looking for the background chemistry,
the mineralogy,
uh,

573
00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:19.050
still cannot be interfered with,
but with,
um,

574
00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:21.450
an unclean spacecraft.
And of course,

575
00:37:21.451 --> 00:37:25.800
I'm sure you know that spacecraft get a cleaned within an inch of their life,

576
00:37:25.801 --> 00:37:27.720
whether they're sterilized or not.
Right?

577
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:32.070
So the ways people do these two things are not compatible.

578
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:37.560
People have said often,
Oh gee,
why don't you just go to the,
uh,
you know,

579
00:37:37.561 --> 00:37:41.680
the BLS for containment facilities that the,
you know,

580
00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:45.870
Center for Disease Control areas where they work on stuff like Ebola and so

581
00:37:45.871 --> 00:37:50.730
forth.
Well that's great for the sterilization and working with,
um,
you know,

582
00:37:50.731 --> 00:37:54.690
organisms,
but it isn't going to clean things up for you at all.

583
00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:59.550
CDC facilities in terms of spacecraft.
Cleanline does our pig sties right?

584
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:03.150
So it's not the same thing.
And these have not been worked together,

585
00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:08.850
so not going to go through these,
but just so you know,
we have a lot of tools,

586
00:38:08.851 --> 00:38:12.460
right?
We have the teat dry heat,
steam,
heat,
uh,

587
00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.360
we can beat the dickens out of things mechanically.

588
00:38:15.361 --> 00:38:19.770
We can use all kinds of gases and so forth,
uh,
to chemically sterilize.

589
00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:22.230
We can smack it with various kinds of radiation.

590
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:27.740
But how do you assure that all of those different things are compatible within

591
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:33.630
subsystems of devices,
a super systems of devices,

592
00:38:33.631 --> 00:38:37.930
or even indeed the whole spacecraft.
So it becomes a massive,

593
00:38:37.931 --> 00:38:42.931
complex systems engineering problem for which we have not tooled up.

594
00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:45.400
And so therefore,

595
00:38:45.401 --> 00:38:49.990
the planetary protection protocols that are implemented now are unreasonably

596
00:38:49.991 --> 00:38:54.550
expensive in many cases.
There really can be an impediment to spacecraft.

597
00:38:55.150 --> 00:39:00.150
We've seen this play out with our upcoming Mars 2020 mission,

598
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:05.760
trying to meet all the demands of a planetary protection while at the same time

599
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:11.240
using components that are of mixed materials,
um,

600
00:39:11.241 --> 00:39:13.210
and trying to put all these things together.

601
00:39:13.211 --> 00:39:18.211
It's very complicated and frankly we're just not masters of the art of this.

602
00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:23.260
And so that has cost consequences,
which means we can go as many places.

603
00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:28.261
So we really need a sea change and this is gradually happening,

604
00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:33.460
but it's very slow because people are used to doing things the way they're used

605
00:39:33.461 --> 00:39:34.360
to doing them.
Right?

606
00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:39.810
So my preferred solution is that we design these planetary protection

607
00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:43.720
requirements in as high level engineering requirements.

608
00:39:43.721 --> 00:39:46.750
You don't add them on at the end where it's really expensive.

609
00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:51.910
It's like if you're building a house and you've got two bathrooms planned and
uh,

610
00:39:51.911 --> 00:39:54.820
when they're about to start putting up the drywall,
you go,
you know,

611
00:39:54.821 --> 00:39:57.310
I really think we need a third guest bathroom.

612
00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.190
That's like the worst way you can build a house.
Right?

613
00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:04.630
And it's precisely analogous to the way we have to put spacecraft together.

614
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.770
There are many things that have not been tried and I list a couple of them down

615
00:40:08.771 --> 00:40:11.590
here.
So,
um,
the cruise phase,

616
00:40:11.591 --> 00:40:14.890
while you're actually in space getting to wherever you're going,

617
00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:19.660
can you have ways to restart ally's those components while you're actually

618
00:40:19.661 --> 00:40:23.770
flying while you in a non biological environment?
Um,

619
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:28.800
use of new materials that might facilitate a either trapping micro organisms and

620
00:40:29.171 --> 00:40:34.171
immobilizing them or killing them and causing them to mineralize to see co two

621
00:40:34.871 --> 00:40:38.260
and water.
Who knows?
Uh,
but those things are uh,

622
00:40:38.261 --> 00:40:42.160
are on the horizon and we need to um,
explore that.

623
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:47.410
So if we are able to stumble our way forward with,
um,

624
00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.440
a measure of a good sense and cleverness,

625
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:55.680
serendipity and a synergy and solve these problems,

626
00:40:55.721 --> 00:41:00.520
then we stand a much better chance of finding life on these missions.

627
00:41:00.521 --> 00:41:01.900
That costs a lot of money.

628
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:06.100
It costs at least a billion dollars just for the bus ticket to get out to the

629
00:41:06.101 --> 00:41:08.050
outer solar system.
That's just to get there.

630
00:41:08.051 --> 00:41:11.500
That's not the payload or anything you're going to do.
Um,

631
00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:15.250
you could send a brick that far and it would cause co cost that much.

632
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:21.380
So let me come back to the original theme.
Uh,

633
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.640
and that's the tricorder.
Can we really develop it?
Well,

634
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:29.670
maybe over time we're willing to settle for something much less developed than

635
00:41:29.711 --> 00:41:34.380
the science fiction version.
Um,
one of the things that,
uh,

636
00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.000
maybe called for in a,

637
00:41:36.001 --> 00:41:41.001
in a proposal call fairly soon is the baby step of taking an imaging capability

638
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:47.500
and a significant chemistry capability and melding those into a conjoined unit

639
00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:54.220
to do two things well without interfering with each other in the same device.

640
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:59.240
So that's the level at which we find ourselves.

641
00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:03.830
I've tried to paint a picture for you of where I think we need to go.

642
00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:08.360
Um,
so are we ready to go find life on Europa?

643
00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.450
We're ready to go look at some of the habitability of properties of Europa,

644
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:15.470
but we are not ready yet for the life detection.

645
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:20.560
So this is the kind of a growth area within technology that provides us with a

646
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:27.041
unique and fascinating problem to have people exercise their brain cells and

647
00:42:27.441 --> 00:42:28.790
come up with solutions.

648
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:33.260
But all of the things that I've described have real world applications.

649
00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:38.260
The ability to detect life obviously has many applications in terms of um,

650
00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:39.201
uh,

651
00:42:39.201 --> 00:42:44.030
detecting pathogens against a background that's biologically rich against the

652
00:42:44.031 --> 00:42:47.030
background,
this biologically poor,
um,

653
00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.840
for a national defense or terrorism,
uh,

654
00:42:50.841 --> 00:42:54.950
circumstances,
um,
epidemics,
things of that sort.

655
00:42:54.951 --> 00:42:59.951
So this is not simply a only devoted to this main,

656
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:04.130
uh,
exciting,
uh,
core function that we have within NASA,

657
00:43:04.131 --> 00:43:07.280
which is exploration of our,
of our universe and the,

658
00:43:07.281 --> 00:43:10.250
and the search for life amongst that exploration.

659
00:43:10.251 --> 00:43:14.540
But it also is something that can act as a,
as a major technology driver.

660
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.550
And with that I'll end.
Thank you.

661
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:21.623
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

662
00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:27.680
<v 2>I'm happy to take questions if,
uh,
if there are any.
Thank you.
Um,</v>

663
00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:33.000
so you've got these painted very broad and diverse picture of what life can be.

664
00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:37.860
And even if we just look at the kind of organic chemistry of life is such a,

665
00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:41.770
such a spectrum from simple,
um,
you know,

666
00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:46.780
the amino acid complex proteins all the way through to complex life and kind of

667
00:43:49.081 --> 00:43:53.520
I guess on a six,
it's been easy in the past to say,
okay,

668
00:43:53.521 --> 00:43:58.090
once it's life that we recognize,
then we can kind of go from there.
That's right.

669
00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:00.340
If,
if we,
if we now kind of broadly now,

670
00:44:00.341 --> 00:44:04.560
do you think there could be life on earth the we haven't recognized as life?

671
00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:08.540
Yeah.
That has been suggested.
I don't know if you're familiar with the,
uh,

672
00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:12.320
the work that Paul Davies who is a physicist at,
um,

673
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:15.200
University of Arizona.
Um,

674
00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:19.340
he's a very creative guy and he has suggested that maybe there's a shadow

675
00:44:19.341 --> 00:44:20.174
biosphere,

676
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:25.930
that we actually have organisms here that we're not detecting because they're so

677
00:44:26.361 --> 00:44:29.480
different from us.
I don't know what to think about that.
I mean,

678
00:44:29.481 --> 00:44:33.840
I can argue it either way.
If it is something very different from us,

679
00:44:33.841 --> 00:44:37.680
our ability to recognize it is clearly a,
we're biased against it.

680
00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:41.820
On the other hand,
there are ecological principles that have been developed.

681
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:45.030
Why observation?
Uh,
you know,

682
00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:48.060
150 years of biological development,

683
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:51.630
one of them is called the competitive exclusion principle.

684
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:58.190
I don't know whether that applies to whole classes of organisms.

685
00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:03.390
I mean,
the idea of that principle is that any two species,

686
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.060
if they're competing for exactly the same niche,

687
00:45:06.061 --> 00:45:10.710
somebody will lose and somebody will win over time.
Is that always true?

688
00:45:10.711 --> 00:45:11.820
Can that be balanced?

689
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:15.630
Are there circumstances where those could be symbiotic relationships?

690
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:21.560
Or is it as if you have a super imposed system that is so different and is not

691
00:45:22.081 --> 00:45:26.520
tapping into the same resources?
So there actually is no interactivity,

692
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:29.550
in which case then maybe,
um,

693
00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:33.750
actually Steve Benner who,
uh,

694
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:39.320
was one of the people who's involved in a national research council study that

695
00:45:39.961 --> 00:45:43.290
was done a number of years ago.
It had a big long official name,

696
00:45:43.291 --> 00:45:47.970
but we all call it the weird life study.
And,
uh,
they were looking at those,

697
00:45:47.971 --> 00:45:49.080
those issues,
you know,

698
00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:54.180
how out there could life be and us still the tactic.

699
00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.430
So could it be made out of silicon?

700
00:45:56.431 --> 00:46:01.410
Could it be organic materials that we know,
but you know,
with uh,

701
00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:06.120
anhydrous ammonia is a solvent,
could it be,
um,
solid state?

702
00:46:06.121 --> 00:46:10.020
Could it be,
you know,
all these other things that,
that,
that we are not.

703
00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:15.150
And um,
and so we're still at the very much speculative stage.

704
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:18.450
So I think actually modeling might,
uh,
you know,

705
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:23.190
ecological modeling might actually give us more insight than what we can

706
00:46:23.191 --> 00:46:27.570
actually observe.
Um,
Paul Davies and Steve Banner,

707
00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:28.733
you know,

708
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:33.430
maybe right about a shadow biosphere or it may be just notion.

709
00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:38.310
Um,
I think that if anybody stands a chance of finding something like that,

710
00:46:38.311 --> 00:46:42.480
it's people like us who are in weird environments where we see things.

711
00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.910
I showed you the weird message stocking thing.

712
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:46.950
We don't know whether that has DNA.

713
00:46:46.951 --> 00:46:50.910
We don't know because we're looking at it against a background of other

714
00:46:50.911 --> 00:46:52.830
organisms.
So when we do the genetics,

715
00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:57.300
we got this long list of strains that are not known to science.

716
00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:01.620
If you can't grow them.
And I've been trying to grow them for a long time,
um,

717
00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:05.640
and have failed.
Uh,
I don't know who they are,
so,
you know,

718
00:47:05.641 --> 00:47:10.260
maybe they're made out of non DNA.
I don't know yet.
So it's a very slow process.

719
00:47:10.261 --> 00:47:12.180
So it was a long winded answer to your question,

720
00:47:12.181 --> 00:47:16.890
but it's a very profound question.
Yeah,
thanks.
Great.
Yeah,

721
00:47:16.891 --> 00:47:17.460
my pleasure.
