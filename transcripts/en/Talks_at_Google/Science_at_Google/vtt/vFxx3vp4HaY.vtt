1
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.890
I pleased introduce Leonard Mlodinow off today.

2
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:11.610
He's a theoretical physicist who is good at making complex scientific topics

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.900
interesting and easy to understand.
He has five New York Times bestsellers,

4
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:17.910
including subliminal and the grand design,

5
00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:21.450
which he wrote together with Stephen Hawking among other TV shows.

6
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:23.430
He wrote First Star Trek,
the next generation.

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.340
He's had numerous contributions to various publications,

8
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:29.370
including the New York Times,
the Wall Street Journal,
Scientific American,

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.780
as well as appearances on a range of TV shows from morning show to through the

10
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.540
wormhole.
Please join me in giving him a warm welcome.

11
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.980
<v 2>[inaudible] thanks for taking your time to come here.</v>

12
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:46.840
Because I had a little tour and I know you could be at the gym,

13
00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:51.000
you could be having Sushi,
could be out walking around and like a nice campus.

14
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.750
So wow.
It's better be good.
David

15
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.790
all depends on how on the moderator.
So if he's good,
it'll be good.

16
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.623
No pressure.

17
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.120
<v 1>So,
um,
your book is about elastic thinking.
What do you mean by elastic thinking?</v>

18
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.350
Well,
I just did

19
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.760
<v 0>Mr between two different types of thinking,
analytical or logical thinking,</v>

20
00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:15.050
which computers are really good at.
Uh,

21
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.070
which you can use to execute algorithms and it's very valued in society,

22
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.810
sat tests for the employers,

23
00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:26.110
your employers maybe not Google because they know better about your employers

24
00:01:26.111 --> 00:01:29.830
generally just look for that.
And then there's a elastic thinking,

25
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.770
which is more of a bottom up process.

26
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.730
It's where ideas come from and it's not how you follow rules,

27
00:01:36.731 --> 00:01:41.600
but it's how you come up with rules,
how you get ideas or imagination,

28
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.910
creativity,
how you're integrating different,
um,

29
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.580
knowledge from different areas,
make new associations.

30
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.340
And so this,

31
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.570
we need both and most of what we do and my book is about how the last tech

32
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.290
thinking arises in your brain and the psychology of and how you can nurture it.

33
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.650
And um,
so you couldn't use your rational,

34
00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:06.940
logical thinking to figure out the best way to go to the groceries to drive to

35
00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:09.340
the grocery store.
But it's the elastic picking deck.

36
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.590
Got Someone's who's been in the car.
So that's how I described.

37
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.130
<v 1>Cool.
Um,
also in the gym,
in,
in addition to elastic thinking,
analytical thinking,</v>

38
00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:22.380
you talk about autopilot and how some of our lives we do on the autopilot.

39
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.223
Can you give some?

40
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.190
<v 0>I say it's not thinking,
it's just a matter of definition,</v>

41
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:30.780
but when I looked in various dictionaries that neuroscience books,

42
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.110
this kind of information processing that the brain does,

43
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:35.970
did not seem to be qualify as thinking,

44
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.930
and it's really a very simple rule base.

45
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.590
Little outgrown that where there's a trigger in your environment that causes you

46
00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:47.190
to do something and then you execute that without even processes.

47
00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:51.630
They get very deeply having any novelty or any kind of flexibility in your
brain.

48
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.500
One example is when you drive to work on autopilot,
your,
your,
your,

49
00:02:55.501 --> 00:03:00.380
your body and your mind are just following the path that you follow every day.

50
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.941
With me,

51
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:05.941
sometimes if I'm going somewhere or if I used to be driving somewhere that was

52
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:07.000
near Caltech,

53
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.080
I would start off on my way to Caltech countryside realize I'm in cal tech,

54
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:13.910
but that's not where I was going to get up because I'm on autopilot and these

55
00:03:13.911 --> 00:03:15.970
triggers,
this stop sign means to turn left.

56
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.940
You know that red light means turn right and then I'm at the wrong place.

57
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.010
And it's been shown that by psychologists that that these kinds of automatic

58
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:28.210
scripts are fixed action patterns of psychologists call them our injustice for

59
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:29.920
trivial things like driving to work.

60
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:34.450
We actually engage in a lot of our social interpersonal reactions that way.

61
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.950
For instance,
people with their significant other or their spouse,

62
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:41.800
sometimes one says something which triggers the other.

63
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:44.740
And pretty soon you're on the same kind of an argument pathway that,

64
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.370
that you have done to way too many times before and you know,

65
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:51.310
you don't want to do what do you keep doing it?
Um,

66
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.610
one other less emotional example was a very famous study done by Ellen Langer,

67
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.730
who is one of my heroes,
psychologists at Harvard.

68
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.180
She stationed someone near a xerox machine.

69
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.110
And when someone came up to use the copier,

70
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.200
this confederate would walk up to the machine and say one of three different

71
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:16.570
things.
So one thing that,

72
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:20.650
that person would say that some of them said was,
excuse me,

73
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.140
can I get in front of you?

74
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.680
I have to xerox five pages and I'm in a hurry.

75
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.020
Another way to say it was,
excuse me,
can I get in front of you?

76
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:35.170
She uses xerox machine and then she compared the,
uh,

77
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.480
the compliance rates of the two.

78
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.970
And the people who gave the reason that they're in a hurry,

79
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:43.630
they got 95% of people allow them to do that.

80
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.410
And the people who didn't give a reason,
it was at 60% pretty agreeable,

81
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:50.800
but it was a big difference.
Then she had done another way.

82
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:54.520
The person would walk up to the,
well,
what she was asking was,

83
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.570
are these people taking into account this reason that this person's in a hurry,

84
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.560
processing it intelligently and then decided,
okay,
they're in a higher rate.

85
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.160
I'm not,
I'll let them in.
Or are they just following some kind of social script?

86
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.710
Well,
she had a person to go up and ask you in another way,
they would say,

87
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.280
excuse me,
can I get in front of you?
And I have,
um,

88
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.260
can I get in front of you because I have five pages to xerox.

89
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.790
So now they're giving a reason,
but it's adding,
it's adding no more information.

90
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.070
So you know it mathematically speaking or in terms of information,
content,

91
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:28.510
it's just like the first way where you just say,

92
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:30.370
can I get in front of you without giving a reason?

93
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.860
So you should get 60% compliance.

94
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.410
But if people are automatically following a script and they'll let someone in,

95
00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:40.930
because the script says if they give a reason,
let them in,

96
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.820
then it would have 90% compliance.

97
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.700
And sure enough they hadn't actually 93% compliance.

98
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:47.950
All you have to say is because I have five pages to xerox,

99
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.990
rather than not saying anything.

100
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.460
So is this an example of people not realizing that they're following a script

101
00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:55.990
and they're in a social interaction?

102
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.620
<v 1>A pro tip that y'all can walk away with?</v>

103
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.590
<v 2>I find that don't want just say,</v>

104
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.190
<v 1>yeah.
Um,
so,
so with respect to generating new ideas and so on,</v>

105
00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:15.160
you talked about,
um,
concept Iran.
What are those?

106
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.840
<v 0>So you store information in the brain and it rob 2005,</v>

107
00:06:21.991 --> 00:06:25.590
there's some very interesting experiments done with people who had electrodes

108
00:06:25.591 --> 00:06:28.370
implanted because they had intractable epilepsy.

109
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.600
So they had to take readings and their brain to see what,

110
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.250
what kind of surgical procedure to do.
And these neuroscientists,
uh,

111
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.460
you,
uh,
piggyback on,

112
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:42.390
on those people did experiments on them and they would show them pictures or

113
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.720
talk,

114
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.160
tell them names and they would see whether it's what would it stimulated within

115
00:06:47.161 --> 00:06:50.700
the brain.
And they found that,
that the,

116
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.030
that the neural patterns for certain concepts or concepts period are,

117
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.660
are very sparse in the brain.

118
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.170
It's not a distributed over millions and millions of neurons,

119
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.560
but there are very specific neurons that respond to very specific concepts.

120
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.980
And they respond not just to the stimulus of let's say if it's a person or the

121
00:07:10.711 --> 00:07:15.020
person's face or their image,
but the same neuron would wood,

122
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.290
that's why they're called constantly.

123
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.570
Neurons would respond to the very idea that person.

124
00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:22.020
So Haley Berry was one you could see Haileybury straight on.

125
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.970
If they would fire from the side,

126
00:07:23.971 --> 00:07:28.860
it would fire trust up in some weird superhero it,

127
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.210
it would fire just her name written up,
it would fire.
So these,

128
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.460
that's why they named concentrators,

129
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.530
they found that that concepts are represented sparsely by in different sets of

130
00:07:37.531 --> 00:07:38.580
neurons in the brain.

131
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.600
And why that's important is when we make associations to get Amanda to

132
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.190
imaginative and creative ideas.

133
00:07:44.191 --> 00:07:48.030
It's when different networks of concept neurons interact with each other and you

134
00:07:48.031 --> 00:07:49.740
get combined to form a new concept.

135
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.330
<v 1>Okay,
that makes sense.
And how it relates to last,
this city and so on.
You also,</v>

136
00:07:55.331 --> 00:07:59.020
um,
later on in the book you talk a little bit how sentences are like puzzles,

137
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.240
how our sentences like puzzles.

138
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.710
<v 0>Well,
when you,
when you hear language,
you're hearing string of words,</v>

139
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:11.240
but each word can have many different meanings depending on the context.

140
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.290
So when you are decoding what I say,

141
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.580
you're not your,
your brain is not translating.
If you,

142
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.760
the idea of what each word means,
as I go through the sentence,

143
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.720
it's actually waiting for the sentence to get finished.
And,

144
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:30.560
or if it's a long sense,
somewhere along the way,
when it has the right context,

145
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.970
it's doing a calculation to figure out for each word which of it's possible

146
00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:37.970
meanings as the correct meeting.
So I'll see if I get the sentence right.

147
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:41.720
I have one in the book it said,
um,
um,

148
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:46.040
the cooking teacher said the children made good snaps.
Okay.

149
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.510
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

150
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.370
<v 0>They're like,
you guys are,
are no,</v>

151
00:08:50.371 --> 00:08:53.910
we're not going to say next because the other sentences the Cannibal said to the

152
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.140
children make good snacks.

153
00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:00.270
So if I had given you that,
uh,
that,
that intro,

154
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:03.070
when you heard the sentence,
the children made good snap the cook.

155
00:09:03.071 --> 00:09:05.850
If you just had the children make good snacks,
as your mind goes a lot,

156
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.000
the word mate came along,
it would have interpreted it one way.

157
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.310
And if I said the cannibal,
who would interpret it another way?

158
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.170
So every sentence like that,

159
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:16.200
it is a puzzle where you have a number of words that are,

160
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:21.180
have some order and each work and have the different possible meanings.

161
00:09:21.181 --> 00:09:24.360
And your brain has to figure out what set of meetings for these words.

162
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:26.130
And you put together to make that sentence.

163
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.620
And should I let you ask another yeah.

164
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.220
<v 2>Sites
just so</v>

165
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:37.930
<v 0>what the reason that's important is that to language researchers</v>

166
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.890
were looking at what happens when people have strokes on,

167
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.800
on the right side of the brain.

168
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.000
And people had traditionally thought that the left side of the brain is

169
00:09:50.001 --> 00:09:50.481
important.

170
00:09:50.481 --> 00:09:54.500
This is Jack until it sort of 1950s and the early sixties and the right side,

171
00:09:54.501 --> 00:09:58.850
they would say it's just a throwaway.
You don't really need it.
It's just there.

172
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.610
I don't know what they were thinking,
but basically that's what they said.
And,

173
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.040
and Roger Sperry,

174
00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:07.910
who you may have heard of thought that that would be ridiculous if you wanted to

175
00:10:07.911 --> 00:10:11.330
know what the real difference was between them.
And he realized that by a jury,

176
00:10:11.331 --> 00:10:12.740
people with stroke,
she couldn't really,

177
00:10:12.741 --> 00:10:14.840
or other brain damage the watch list or the other,

178
00:10:14.841 --> 00:10:16.880
it wasn't controlled enough to really tell.

179
00:10:16.881 --> 00:10:19.860
He started cutting through the Corpus callosum of,
um,

180
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.550
the animals to separate the right and the left brain.

181
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.830
And then he designed experiments,
um,

182
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.800
that would address just the right side or the love.

183
00:10:27.801 --> 00:10:31.640
Just the left side of the brain and you can do that because your sense is also

184
00:10:31.641 --> 00:10:34.730
go through the right there also that arise so that you can,

185
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.710
you can present either auditory signals or visual signals to one side or the

186
00:10:39.711 --> 00:10:43.640
other and then you can make tests to see if I teach the right side of the brain

187
00:10:43.641 --> 00:10:44.630
something cause the left side,

188
00:10:44.631 --> 00:10:48.980
no it and he found that there are basically two independent information

189
00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:49.820
processors,

190
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.590
which was very controversial because might imagine if you believe in a soul,

191
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.190
what does that mean?
You're two souls or two people or what does it mean?

192
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.690
But he ended up getting a Nobel prize for it and yet it didn't have quite the

193
00:11:02.691 --> 00:11:05.670
impact that maybe it should have through the years and people still were,

194
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.530
we're kind of tending to dismiss the right side of the brain and the left side

195
00:11:09.531 --> 00:11:10.730
is the one that's known for language.

196
00:11:10.731 --> 00:11:14.120
But these two researchers who Nielsen Beeman,

197
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.720
we're looking at the deficits that people had who had rights side strokes and

198
00:11:17.721 --> 00:11:19.160
they were very interesting.
They were,

199
00:11:19.161 --> 00:11:23.300
they had trouble understanding metaphors and they had trouble understanding

200
00:11:23.301 --> 00:11:25.760
jokes.
He would tell them a joke today if we didn't think it was funny,

201
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.800
which usually if I told you

202
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.120
<v 2>some fraction of the thought that when you choose whether or not the left.</v>

203
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.920
So what they were saying was,
okay,
okay,

204
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.360
<v 0>well how does this relate to if a language is,
if language is like a puzzle,</v>

205
00:11:43.361 --> 00:11:44.230
what does this mean?

206
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.430
And they eventually through a lot of experimentation and thought,

207
00:11:48.431 --> 00:11:53.431
and they came to the conclusion that when you hear a sentence or when you see a

208
00:11:54.491 --> 00:11:57.880
puzzle,
your brain or when you're at work and you run into a problem,

209
00:11:57.881 --> 00:12:01.750
you have to solve right here with your brain starts throwing up ideas,

210
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:06.250
associations as to how he might approach it herself.
The problem,

211
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.830
and these are all being at first.
Dot.

212
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:12.160
On a subconscious level and not all of them enter your consciousness.

213
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.250
Then there are various filters,

214
00:12:14.251 --> 00:12:17.470
circuits in your brain that work together to determine what reaches your

215
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:21.620
consciousness.
This is also the same way that,
uh,
you,

216
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.800
you have inhibition of your behavior.
So a few,
if you walked by,
um,

217
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.240
the cafeteria and you're hungry and you see a French fries,

218
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.460
your brain is giving you the idea to grab the French,
right?

219
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.590
And your brain is also censoring that idea cause it's probably not,

220
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.700
not a good idea to walk by and grab food from other people's tables.
Right.

221
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:37.991
And in the book,

222
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:41.680
I tell a story about my dad had a stroke and that power of his brain and he

223
00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:44.890
would grab the French fries,
you know,
he would get the idea and you would do it.

224
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.950
Well that's bad because we need these filters.

225
00:12:47.951 --> 00:12:49.960
We need them to keep us from doing stuff like that.

226
00:12:49.961 --> 00:12:54.160
Or if you're on the second floor,
don't just jump out the window,
take the stairs.

227
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.360
And you don't want crazy ideas when you're trying to solve the problem either.

228
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.710
Or you get too many crazy ideas and you get nowhere.

229
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.790
On the other hand,
sometimes the crazy idea is the one that solves the problem.

230
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.900
And if your brain is too conventional,
it filters out all those ideas,

231
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.810
then you're not going to solve a problem.

232
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.330
He never going to have a creative thought.
You never going to innovate.

233
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.770
So it's all a balance in the idea of in the last tick thinking is how to tune

234
00:13:20.771 --> 00:13:22.000
this balance for yourself.

235
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:27.250
So what Cuny Olson Beaman realized was that the right side of your brain,

236
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:31.450
certain structure and the right side of your brain is producing these more odd

237
00:13:31.451 --> 00:13:32.284
ideas.

238
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.680
And on your left side of the brain is bruising in the more conventional ideas.

239
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.780
And then these different structures in your brain are choosing what to bring to

240
00:13:40.781 --> 00:13:41.710
your consciousness.

241
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:47.850
And so a metaphor is based on an interpretation of a word.

242
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.660
You are the light of my life.
Well I don't really mean that I,

243
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:56.710
that I can't see unless you're in the room or if you tell a joke it,

244
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:57.390
it,
it,

245
00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:01.180
it usually does not depend on the literal meaning of what's going on in depends

246
00:14:01.181 --> 00:14:02.200
upon making some jobs.

247
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.360
So your right side of your brain is understanding of proposing these ideas and

248
00:14:06.361 --> 00:14:10.720
your left side of the more conventional ones.
So the people who who had the,
the,

249
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.590
the brain damage on the right side.
We're not getting these more,

250
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:18.320
they call the remote associations only the more usual association.

251
00:14:18.321 --> 00:14:20.140
So they could understand jokes and metaphors,

252
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.470
but they realize this is a part of a much broader theme,

253
00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.410
which is that your ideas in general come that way.

254
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.860
When you're solving any puzzle in life,
not just the sentence in,
in,

255
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.000
in the language.

256
00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.620
You're right inside of their brain is proposing the more I've solutions or ideas

257
00:14:35.621 --> 00:14:37.060
or thoughts in the left side,

258
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.310
the more conventional ones and your filters and your brain,

259
00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.970
different brain structures are sorting through that.

260
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.350
<v 1>Yeah.
Related to the remote associations.</v>

261
00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:48.710
You brought up this instance of these researchers who had compound remote

262
00:14:48.711 --> 00:14:50.330
association problems,
which

263
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.890
<v 0>they didn't quite abbreviated like that,
right?
But</v>

264
00:14:55.380 --> 00:15:00.250
Tom town
today,
they didn't want,
I mean,

265
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.490
a lot of scientific papers have that in them,

266
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.760
but no scientist wants to actually use that word.
So they called him the crs.

267
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.910
Probably a wise move.
I think one example you gave was,
um,

268
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:16.280
pine crab in sauce was one of the examples.
Here's the,

269
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.240
here's the puzzle.
There was another word that goes with each of those.

270
00:15:20.241 --> 00:15:24.950
So if you think of,
um,
conferences,
it's the wrong one,
ones pine cone,

271
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.170
but not so Costco,
right?

272
00:15:27.171 --> 00:15:31.420
So it's pine crap and sauce.
That's one of their puzzles.

273
00:15:31.421 --> 00:15:34.220
So there's two ways to solve that puzzle.
Just like,

274
00:15:34.221 --> 00:15:35.540
just to have the two ways of thinking.

275
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.050
You could analytically start running through words in your mind,

276
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.570
may have some heuristic about what kind of words to run through.

277
00:15:41.571 --> 00:15:46.490
Or You may start with one of them like pine and do those words and then check

278
00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:49.040
each one with the other next word and then checked out the next word.

279
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.640
Or You sit there and you go and then it comes to you,
right?

280
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.240
That's called insight.
They call it said,

281
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:59.180
so what they were studying was it different ways that our brain works doing one

282
00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:01.520
versus the other.
And they also,

283
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.160
one of the ways that they could tell what parts of your brain are doing web is

284
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:07.670
they would,
um,
image your brain while you were doing that.

285
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:12.380
And sometimes they would use something called transcranial stimulation,

286
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.720
which disrupts part of your brain.
So you could actually,

287
00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.840
electronic could disrupt certain structures in your brain.

288
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.570
And southern people are solving these problems a lot better than they than they

289
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:25.580
were when one case there was a very experienced meditator who was so it focus

290
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.070
that he couldn't stop any of these profits if it was kind of embarrassed and

291
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:36.860
that he,
this is very important,
less than the book.

292
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:40.190
He was able to see that and changed his thinking,

293
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:44.530
has changed his approach,
relax and open up his left,

294
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.330
his filters go away and open up his mind.
And then he did.

295
00:16:47.331 --> 00:16:50.900
Southern did better than other people were generally did.

296
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:54.050
And these researchers said in all the years of of presenting these problems,

297
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:55.400
no one ever had a switch like that.

298
00:16:55.401 --> 00:16:59.030
So it's possible to take charge of your brain and the way you think.

299
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.760
And to throw in one more random comment on that,

300
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.840
it's very interesting that they could see in their subjects,
brace through,

301
00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:10.760
through the,
um,
the,
the use both f MRI and EEG.
They could tell,

302
00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:15.470
um,
about five or six seconds before the subject,

303
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:19.640
even south of the,
uh,
the,
the problem.

304
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:24.410
And even before they knew what the problem was,
which way they would do it,

305
00:17:24.411 --> 00:17:27.170
whether it was analytical or or elastic.

306
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:29.890
And the subjects didn't realize that they,

307
00:17:29.891 --> 00:17:32.300
that they have predetermined in their brain what they were going to do,

308
00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:34.400
but they were in one mindset or another.

309
00:17:34.401 --> 00:17:38.690
So they were either in an analytical mindset or an elastic mindset by reading

310
00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:41.300
the brains to the experiments,
can tell which one it was.

311
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.760
And then when they asked him afterwards,
how did you solve the problem,

312
00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:48.761
they were right about whether it was this letting the thing come to you or the

313
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:53.160
analytical thinking.
Has anyone by the way stop?
So was that the words were,

314
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.700
I don't want to say crap time.

315
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.570
<v 1>So to be clear,
you have to cut with one word that pairs with each of these</v>

316
00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:03.190
<v 0>give me be before and after it.
So pine crowd and sauce.</v>

317
00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:07.770
<v 2>And did you get that</v>

318
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:11.400
<v 0>bye logically reasoning or did it just come to you?
Okay.</v>

319
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.290
That's a good way to get.
So we talk about,

320
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.280
I've talked a lot about in the book about the ways that you can,
you know,

321
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:17.881
help that.

322
00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:21.060
And I think that Google having a gym here as a great thing because that's one

323
00:18:21.061 --> 00:18:24.540
way,
you know,
when you're thinking very enough,
very focused manner,

324
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:27.540
you need to get rid of the e that's good to do it,
to analyze a problem,

325
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.830
then you want to let that go and stop thinking about it.
Get on the treadmill,

326
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.040
do something that really,
you know,
takes you away.

327
00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.860
It doesn't let you think about your grocery list or would you have to do at home

328
00:18:37.861 --> 00:18:41.410
or that problem and then things will come to you or the taking the nap.

329
00:18:41.411 --> 00:18:45.220
Do you have a little nap rooms?
That's a great thing.
I see that they,

330
00:18:45.221 --> 00:18:46.950
they understand this here.
So

331
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.570
<v 1>yeah.
I like how you do that.
You talked about,
um,</v>

332
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:53.950
I guess these different modes of thinking and how they can apply to different

333
00:18:53.951 --> 00:18:54.701
situations.

334
00:18:54.701 --> 00:18:57.610
And I think even in the book you talked about how you take advantage of that

335
00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.880
during the day.
Can you tell us a little bit about that?

336
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.630
<v 0>One thing is that,
uh,
your,</v>

337
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:07.490
your filters kind of to relax when you are exhausted,

338
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.900
mentally exhausted.
So you might be a morning person or an evening person,

339
00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.740
but whatever it is,
one of the best times street is two.

340
00:19:15.741 --> 00:19:19.700
Two if you needed to find creative solutions is to do it when,

341
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.820
when your analytical mind is just kept doing anymore.
So they,

342
00:19:23.821 --> 00:19:26.630
they do experiments where they'd have people saw these really boring

343
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.180
analytic thinking problems,

344
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:34.670
a little arithmetic problems or puzzles and,

345
00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:39.080
and afterwards they give them a problem that requires some creativity and they

346
00:19:39.081 --> 00:19:42.270
do better than the people who were relaxing just to go into the TAC.
The,

347
00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.530
you know,
the problem that way.
So that's one thing you can do.
I mean,

348
00:19:45.531 --> 00:19:48.360
another thing is to realize that,
uh,

349
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.570
is to realize that it's good to stop and,
and just take a break.

350
00:19:53.571 --> 00:19:56.960
And when you're taking a break or you know,
like laying on the couch,

351
00:19:56.961 --> 00:19:59.270
staring at the ceiling,
you're not necessarily goofing off.

352
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:04.250
You're legitimately letting your mind works so you can legitimately be working.

353
00:20:04.251 --> 00:20:05.570
I consider yourself at work.

354
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.320
<v 2>You're laying down there.
That's good to know.</v>

355
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.570
I found this great story about on what it,

356
00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.100
<v 0>she,
uh,</v>

357
00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.330
he had his Katrin's who would see him take a break and they were not paying you

358
00:20:17.331 --> 00:20:19.580
all this money.
I want you to keep working.
I wanted to keep working.

359
00:20:19.581 --> 00:20:23.840
He argued with them,
but no,
when I take a break that is working.
So that's a,

360
00:20:23.841 --> 00:20:28.220
that's a good,
you know,
if your supervisor doesn't know that,
but just say,
hey,

361
00:20:28.221 --> 00:20:29.560
you got the an hour working for you now

362
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.270
<v 1>and remember these because just like earlier,
right?</v>

363
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.730
<v 2>Because right.
The couch,
I need to solve this problem.</v>

364
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.860
Not because I'm taking it out.
Um,

365
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.710
<v 1>so I'm going to keep asking questions,</v>

366
00:20:42.711 --> 00:20:46.250
but if any of you have questions related to last to or me how to activate it and

367
00:20:46.251 --> 00:20:46.960
so on,

368
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.170
feel free to line up at the mic and we'll start to mix those in as time goes on.

369
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.120
Um,
and if not,

370
00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:55.180
you'll just get to hear Mike repaired questions the whole time and put all the

371
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:58.580
pressure on me.
Yeah,
so

372
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.620
fortunately I haven't been down,

373
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:05.950
so we've already activated that part in the book.

374
00:21:05.951 --> 00:21:09.650
You also mentioned your collaboration with the late Stephen Hawking.
Um,
what,

375
00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.790
what did he teach you about elastic thinking?
Well,

376
00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:19.610
<v 0>many things.
I think one of the most unusual things was,
uh,</v>

377
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:24.030
because of the way he communicated,
we had to interact in a very unusual manner.

378
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:29.190
So he imposed his sentences.
He had to first,
he would,
uh,

379
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:30.480
when I first started working with them,

380
00:21:30.481 --> 00:21:33.550
he wouldn't use his thumb to click a mouse in later.
Yeah.

381
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:38.490
Emotion sensor on his glasses that would read one his cheek tours and that would

382
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:43.500
be like a mouse click and on his computer screen and cursor was flying around.

383
00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.770
There'd be rolls of letters first row,
second row.

384
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.360
So we capture let's say the second row,

385
00:21:48.361 --> 00:21:51.240
then it will start moving across each letter.
You can capture a letter.

386
00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:52.310
Once he had a letter,

387
00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:56.880
it gave him a choice of words or even do a second letter and then it gets a

388
00:21:56.881 --> 00:21:58.920
choice of words with those two letters,
et cetera.

389
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.860
And it was about six words a minute that he could do that way.

390
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.500
So we were working together even closer to this and be like,
no table there,

391
00:22:07.501 --> 00:22:07.681
you know,

392
00:22:07.681 --> 00:22:12.270
and he would be typing out of sentences and that first time zoning out and I'm

393
00:22:12.271 --> 00:22:15.630
going,
Oh wow,
okay.
I'm,
you know,
I don't know.

394
00:22:15.631 --> 00:22:18.340
I'm daydreaming and um,
but then I,
you know,

395
00:22:18.341 --> 00:22:21.030
I eventually realized that very soon realized I could,
you know,

396
00:22:21.031 --> 00:22:23.920
I could see on his screen what he's writing.
I could,
it would,

397
00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:25.600
it would show and had he had,
he would push,

398
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.770
you would cook something and there with a computer voice would pronounce it,

399
00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.960
but you can watch him composing his,
his senses.
And I would,

400
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.590
you know,

401
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.560
look over her shoulder and I would start thinking about what he was saying.

402
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.980
So it's really interesting.
And sometimes if I knew what what he was saying,

403
00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.320
I wouldn't say,
Oh,
you're saying blah,
blah,
blah.

404
00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.370
But sometimes I was just letting it go even though I knew what it was because I

405
00:22:47.371 --> 00:22:50.790
had that I could think about.
So as we're talking,
I'm not thinking very much.

406
00:22:50.791 --> 00:22:52.980
It was,
it's probably pretty automatic year.

407
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.400
When you say something with a fixed action pattern,

408
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:59.010
you say something that triggers my brain to something in the book and I'm just

409
00:22:59.011 --> 00:23:02.940
reading the book to you guys.
So,
so,
but you know,

410
00:23:02.941 --> 00:23:05.040
but in most conversations it's pretty immediate.

411
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.890
You don't talk to somebody and then you're not going to wait for four minutes

412
00:23:07.891 --> 00:23:10.380
for you with your friends.
Wait for him as for you to say something.

413
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:15.270
I mean it was stolen maybe,
but not juggling.
So this was a,

414
00:23:15.271 --> 00:23:17.930
this was different,
our conversations then,
at least from my side,
right,

415
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.440
very different because I could,

416
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.920
I would think more deeply about what we were talking about also kind of the time

417
00:23:22.921 --> 00:23:26.820
to figure out what it's talking about because it might go pretty fast.

418
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:29.670
But it's,
it's a very,

419
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.020
it's an important thing because quite often we don't think deeply enough where

420
00:23:33.021 --> 00:23:36.700
when you take the first one,
the answer that you get at something,

421
00:23:36.701 --> 00:23:39.280
and that's not the creative answer,
that's let's say the,

422
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.750
it gets their answer,
but not the best answer.
Right.

423
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.700
And if you would only stop and say,
no,

424
00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:51.020
I want something better and not just accept that answer that you would get

425
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:56.030
better ideas.
And there was a good experiment in the book,

426
00:23:56.110 --> 00:24:00.140
but they talking about what's chess players and they give,
so who,
who you get,

427
00:24:00.141 --> 00:24:03.230
who here plays chest?
So the chest playing crowd,

428
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.980
well you know they have these magazines or on our websites,

429
00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:10.820
it could be chess puzzles as a board position.
And they say,
can you know,

430
00:24:10.821 --> 00:24:14.240
how do you check made forest checkmate in three moves or five moves.

431
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.370
So they give you the board position and your,

432
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.000
your problem is to figure out how you can given your white,

433
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:24.560
let's say forced and it's your move force your opponent into a checkmate and

434
00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:25.730
they give a number of moves.

435
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:30.970
So they design a nice situation where there was a easy solution to took five

436
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.840
rules and there was a very clever solution.
It took three moves.

437
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:39.800
That was so that's considered better.
And they,

438
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.030
they gave this to a lot of different chess players to solve and they,

439
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:48.260
and they correlated the,

440
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:52.730
how could the chess player was.
And according to their master points.

441
00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:55.850
So that's something we're rating system they haven't chest to,

442
00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:01.180
to whether they could solve this problem and that there's some of the people

443
00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:06.400
they would,
they would show the the easiest solution first.
Um,
no,

444
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.600
I'm sorry.
Some people will be given the board or the,

445
00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:14.260
or the easiest solution was not present and others would be given the board that

446
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:18.020
the problem where the easy on that Harvard were both present and what they found

447
00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:20.700
was that they were really good.
The,
the,

448
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.920
the experts at solving the hard problem when it UC would stop getting to the

449
00:25:24.921 --> 00:25:27.140
heart solution when the easy one wasn't there.

450
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.170
But one of the easy one was there and they of course would immediately answer
it.

451
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.690
They were a lot worse it,
they would not find that hard one.

452
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:38.680
And they did some statistical correlations and found that it was like a quilted,

453
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.450
I think two 300 master points or something.

454
00:25:41.451 --> 00:25:44.670
So I mean that's a huge different in chefs difference in chess.

455
00:25:44.671 --> 00:25:48.860
I forgot I said in the book it's like an Iq difference between 90 and 120 or

456
00:25:48.861 --> 00:25:50.970
something like that.
I mean it really doesn't.

457
00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:56.090
Knowing knowing the easy answer make people a lot dumber and finding the

458
00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:59.570
creative more creative answers.
So just something to think about.

459
00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:03.220
<v 1>I really liked that aspect of the book that you had in various problems there.</v>

460
00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:06.970
We talked about wowing them with the,
with the crowd,
the pine and the sauce.

461
00:26:06.971 --> 00:26:08.230
We talked about the chess one.

462
00:26:08.231 --> 00:26:11.830
You also have various little quizzes where you can measure how um,

463
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.390
how hoping you are to do experiences in,
in their other quizzes like that.

464
00:26:16.391 --> 00:26:19.240
I liked that aspect of it a lot that you have these various indirect things.

465
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.120
<v 3>Hi,
can you hear me?
Yes.
Cool.</v>

466
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:28.190
I have a question about how to reward elastic thinking because you know,

467
00:26:28.411 --> 00:26:32.040
he means a kind of a reward Trevon animal,

468
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:37.430
but most of our reward system is trying to be really analytical so they track

469
00:26:38.461 --> 00:26:40.110
your performance over time.

470
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:44.640
You can have a metric about it and that's how you get a reward for it because

471
00:26:44.641 --> 00:26:49.641
the metrics showed that you did well but fall creativity or ls to Citi does,

472
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:53.580
it doesn't seem there are.
So at least I don't know,

473
00:26:53.581 --> 00:26:55.110
a good way of saying,

474
00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:00.140
oh you did good in that and therefore I can reward you and hope that you'll

475
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.290
continue to do more elastic thinking.
So yeah,

476
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:03.690
<v 0>that's a great question.</v>

477
00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:06.870
And we could do a whole hour on that and as you can tell him,

478
00:27:06.871 --> 00:27:09.150
my boss tends to keep going.
But um,

479
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:15.020
so there are two kinds of rewards that people who study this talking about

480
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:18.540
extrinsic rewards and intrinsic rewards.

481
00:27:18.541 --> 00:27:22.470
So you bring has a reward system that I talked on the book that rewards you when

482
00:27:22.471 --> 00:27:26.920
you do some certain things.
And those are by definition the things you liked,

483
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.740
right?
To be here.
I haven't seen it.

484
00:27:28.741 --> 00:27:31.830
Does three things you like to do you like to do them because it's rewarding.

485
00:27:31.831 --> 00:27:33.360
It would kind of works together.

486
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.860
And then there's money and um,

487
00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.140
uh,
Bonnie related things that,
you know,
gifts or,

488
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:48.120
I don't want to say praise because praise is kind of in between,
but what they,

489
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:53.150
what psychologists have found is that the extrinsic rewards are not really good

490
00:27:53.661 --> 00:27:58.230
at,
they can eat quite counterproductive.
Now they,

491
00:27:58.231 --> 00:28:03.231
if they tell you you have to finish writing this code by Monday,

492
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:07.020
uh,
and you know,
it's really important to the company,
it will give you 10 grand.

493
00:28:07.021 --> 00:28:11.520
If you do it,
you'll probably do it.
Right.
So for short term,

494
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.860
very well defined things,
it's,
it's,
uh,
it,
it,
you know,
it tends to work.
People,

495
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:22.180
it's your conscious mind takes over and they,
they do it more long term and,

496
00:28:22.181 --> 00:28:24.660
and,
and less define things like,

497
00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:29.690
are you forensics is going to be a better employee if you're rewarded monetarily

498
00:28:30.691 --> 00:28:33.480
that doesn't really follow.
Um,

499
00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:37.770
and the more creative the task you're doing is the last important or even the

500
00:28:37.771 --> 00:28:40.170
more negative.
The monetary reward is,

501
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:44.340
I actually quote Dostoyevsky who wasn't a psychologist,

502
00:28:44.341 --> 00:28:49.230
but he was complaining that he,
what?
This hellish Simon,

503
00:28:49.231 --> 00:28:53.590
he had to write this novel.
Yeah,
I forgot what novel was,
but uh,

504
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:57.960
and um,
and how would I torture it was,
and when you hear that you go,
oh my God,

505
00:28:57.961 --> 00:29:00.330
I didn't realize that he rolled on Spec like that where someone says,

506
00:29:00.331 --> 00:29:03.840
write about,
you know,
and it wasn't at all,
it was just to write a novel.

507
00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:07.490
The assignment was just to write it down,
but he was big payday that,
you know,

508
00:29:07.491 --> 00:29:07.890
being,

509
00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.920
he had a contract to write the novel for him that totally killed his creativity

510
00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.900
as loss.
Maybe an extreme example,
but that's the tendency of what happens.

511
00:29:14.901 --> 00:29:15.661
They send people,

512
00:29:15.661 --> 00:29:20.160
the researchers have found that when you pay people that give her this extrinsic

513
00:29:20.161 --> 00:29:24.090
motivation test to interfere with the creativity,
but the intrinsic motivation,

514
00:29:24.091 --> 00:29:27.270
which comes from you,
which is Google saying to you,
what do you like?

515
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.970
Let's assign you to do that.
Let's,
let's put you in the,
in the area that,

516
00:29:30.971 --> 00:29:31.804
that you'd like to do.

517
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:37.220
And if you later on one change to be open to saying when your mom moved over

518
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:38.150
there,
I do that.

519
00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:41.710
That's intrinsic motivation that comes and it's deeper within from within your

520
00:29:41.711 --> 00:29:45.010
own brain and that that is very important and very effective.

521
00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:50.240
<v 1>Um,
I'm going to call back just a moment ago.</v>

522
00:29:50.241 --> 00:29:53.780
You've mentioned somebody potentially being stoned.
It came up,

523
00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.530
it came up in your book as well being stone.
It's legal in this state.
How does,

524
00:29:57.531 --> 00:29:59.600
how does being stone really to elastic thinking?

525
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:04.840
<v 2>That's the cure for everything.
Um,</v>

526
00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:09.880
<v 0>so marijuana,
well,
okay.
Alcohol also,
uh,</v>

527
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:14.380
and marijuana and certain psychedelic drugs.
Uh,

528
00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.350
I always show,
uh,

529
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:23.820
they act on those filters I was talking about.

530
00:30:23.821 --> 00:30:26.270
So that's just a chemical way of,

531
00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:30.480
of loosening those filters and allowing more creative ideas to go through it.

532
00:30:30.481 --> 00:30:34.110
Now I,
I should say what I do in the book,
so they all have their own downsides.

533
00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:38.850
Uh,
I don't just mean,
you know,
you get drunk and you could walk through a window.

534
00:30:38.851 --> 00:30:40.580
But,
um,
I mean,

535
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:45.590
I mean more objectively that marijuana has other effects on your brain,

536
00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:50.130
your short term memory,
hard to keep things in your working memory.

537
00:30:50.131 --> 00:30:54.630
I don't know if you've ever had that experience where your stone then you forget

538
00:30:54.631 --> 00:30:56.280
what you were saying.
I mean,
I get that,

539
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:04.170
<v 2>not that I ever have [inaudible]</v>

540
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.660
<v 0>so,
so,
um,</v>

541
00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:10.140
so that can compete also for lot of things.

542
00:31:10.141 --> 00:31:14.550
You need that executive function to guide your thinking and so the thoughts are

543
00:31:14.551 --> 00:31:19.390
coming,
but there's no guidance and so you're,
you know,
detached from reality and,

544
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.200
and so there are these different

545
00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.920
aides that you might try a,

546
00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:29.420
the end that many artists and musicians swear by,

547
00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:34.220
they have their plus sides and they're monocytes and you have to use,
uh,

548
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:34.860
you know,

549
00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:38.490
intelligently if you're using it for that purpose if you're not used to anyway

550
00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:39.343
one.

551
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:41.840
<v 1>Yeah,
using,
using,
drinking to help.</v>

552
00:31:41.841 --> 00:31:44.600
The thing thinking reminds me of that quote from the character and game of

553
00:31:44.601 --> 00:31:48.410
Thrones.
That's what I do.
I drink and I know things and it seems,

554
00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:52.730
um,
anyway.
Do we have another question?
I'm curious,

555
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.680
kind of the difference between the,

556
00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.830
I've heard it talked about it was like to subconscious background processing

557
00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:00.800
thinking versus elastic thinking.
Like a,

558
00:32:00.801 --> 00:32:05.150
you read a riddle right before you go to bed and then you wake up and you either

559
00:32:05.151 --> 00:32:08.330
dreamed about the answer or are you just kind of the answer hit you out of

560
00:32:08.331 --> 00:32:08.810
nowhere?

561
00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:13.280
Or is this the same thing as like the shower epiphany that a lot of people have,

562
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:16.910
<v 0>they're all that they're all related swimming when you're,</v>

563
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:20.090
you have a problem that you set up analytically in your head,

564
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:24.560
but the answer is not,
it's not an algorithm bay.

565
00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.210
A product of an algorithm.

566
00:32:26.211 --> 00:32:29.660
The answer is let's say changing your is changing the way you set up the
problem.

567
00:32:29.661 --> 00:32:31.550
For instance,
changing your assumptions

568
00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:38.560
or changing the paradigm where you know it's more like you guys are starting use

569
00:32:39.381 --> 00:32:41.240
these neural nets,
which I think is that the,

570
00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:44.590
the the key to success in computer science.
So,

571
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.880
and I wrote a paper in the eighties so that's elastic thinking,

572
00:32:52.131 --> 00:32:53.100
the neuro nuts with a neuroma,

573
00:32:53.101 --> 00:32:55.870
not so you don't know how it got to the answer right?
You set it up till it,

574
00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:00.880
the computer's doing this crazy stuff and it's learning and at the end you don't

575
00:33:01.431 --> 00:33:04.670
know what algorithm it used in his brain to get the answer.

576
00:33:04.671 --> 00:33:05.990
And that's the same thing with humans.

577
00:33:05.991 --> 00:33:09.020
So when you get these ideas from the bottom up,

578
00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:12.500
it's your neural nets in your brain doing some calculation,

579
00:33:12.501 --> 00:33:15.080
giving you the answer.
It's not some algorithm saying do this,

580
00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:19.940
then do this and then do that.
So yeah,
that's really the big,

581
00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:23.330
big difference is that,
um,
one of the big differences is that I don't look,

582
00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:26.820
but thinking tends to be top down and elastic thing.

583
00:33:26.821 --> 00:33:29.370
He tends to be bottom up calculation

584
00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:34.800
<v 1>talking about the neural nets and so on.</v>

585
00:33:34.801 --> 00:33:39.450
It's kind of interesting because I think it was mentioned that the season or the

586
00:33:39.451 --> 00:33:41.300
time that you wrote for the next generation,
y'all,

587
00:33:41.301 --> 00:33:44.430
we're exploring some things around data and how much she was thinking also.

588
00:33:44.431 --> 00:33:47.280
And that kind of,
it's a similar idea I suppose.

589
00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.090
<v 0>Yeah.
What,
what,
what,</v>

590
00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:53.950
because we have the very naive concept of data that,
you know,

591
00:33:53.951 --> 00:33:56.170
or like Spock was half of like that piece.

592
00:33:56.171 --> 00:34:00.160
So it's kind of the same role where this is totally logical and rational.

593
00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.380
But in reality,

594
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:06.880
somebody who was told or a beat or a thing that's totally like Roshes rational

595
00:34:06.881 --> 00:34:11.460
and logical was never going to solve anything or do,
I mean,
first of all,

596
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:16.210
they won't even get started because if something is rational and logical,

597
00:34:16.211 --> 00:34:19.270
he usually needs to be told to do something and then it can do that task.

598
00:34:19.271 --> 00:34:23.150
But something that that is,
uh,
you know,

599
00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:26.140
bottom up thinking or has emotional content,

600
00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:28.900
which is why you have a reward center in your brain and you have emotions,

601
00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.570
is to get you to realize that you should,
if you start doing something.

602
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.930
So in reality,

603
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:38.070
if data was purely a computer would sit there and wait to be given a problem

604
00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:40.120
then and then he would answer it.
Right.
So

605
00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:44.500
<v 1>I think that,
um,
police in a little bit to,
um,</v>

606
00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.630
to some of the other topics you talk about when you mentioned,
um,

607
00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.800
choice overload,
for example,
what is choice overload?

608
00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.970
<v 0>Well,
so in today's society,</v>

609
00:34:54.971 --> 00:34:59.620
we have a lot of options for everything.

610
00:34:59.621 --> 00:35:04.470
You go to the grocery store and there's 40 different kinds of touch with for or

611
00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.800
cereal.
This one,

612
00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:11.880
a researcher I talked about did a survey reported how many of each different

613
00:35:12.161 --> 00:35:17.160
progress in the grocery store and it was um,
it was,
yeah,

614
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:18.263
yeah.

615
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:21.940
These are the kinds of things that can exhaust your brain and that can get you

616
00:35:21.941 --> 00:35:23.890
on these loops that are not productive.

617
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:27.730
And what psychologists have found was that there's,

618
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:30.820
I don't want to say two kinds of people because that's what my stupid,

619
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:35.920
at least there's two ends of a one dimensional spectrum and one end they call

620
00:35:36.581 --> 00:35:39.600
the maximizers.
These are miserable people

621
00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:46.470
who wants to optimize and maximize the utility on the economics of everything.

622
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:50.220
So when I presented with 40 different kinds of mayonnaise,

623
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:55.410
I will spend an hour analyzing each one.
It's trying to figure out what,
you know,

624
00:35:55.411 --> 00:35:59.130
which one is better than the other one,
even though it really doesn't matter.

625
00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.510
Right.

626
00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:04.440
Or it doesn't matter much at the other end are the Sabbath Spicer's they call up

627
00:36:04.441 --> 00:36:07.680
who as soon as they find the first one that that works,

628
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:12.320
take that one of their and very happily.
So that's,

629
00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.820
that's what I recommend.

630
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:17.550
<v 1>Well let's think about that again.</v>

631
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:25.830
I find it interesting when you were talking about the creative thinking and you

632
00:36:25.831 --> 00:36:30.330
related to schizophrenia,
Schizo typic personality traits.

633
00:36:30.331 --> 00:36:31.120
How are those two

634
00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:31.953
<v 0>intertwined?</v>

635
00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:37.510
So skits people get onto both of schizotypal use or schizo.
Tippy is a,

636
00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:41.650
is a,
uh,
a trait that is related to schizophrenia.

637
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.920
So again,
if you think of a spectrum,

638
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:47.680
there'd be people who are far to one end are schizophrenia.

639
00:36:47.681 --> 00:36:51.280
And then there are people with different traits,
different degrees of that.

640
00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:55.870
And that has to do with how attached you are to reality.

641
00:36:56.410 --> 00:37:00.820
And,
and do you have,
tend to have a tendency toward odd and magical thinking.

642
00:37:00.821 --> 00:37:02.110
So based on what I've said so far,

643
00:37:02.111 --> 00:37:05.410
you can imagine that this has to do with some of the filters in your brain and

644
00:37:05.411 --> 00:37:06.670
to getting new ideas.

645
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:11.170
So people who are near the schizophrenia side can often be extremely creative.

646
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:12.760
Well,
I should say it's not really creative,

647
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
but extremely good at idea generation and generating novel divergent ideas.

648
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.660
They're not really often very creative because that also takes some analytical

649
00:37:22.661 --> 00:37:25.900
thinking to channel and figure out what you need and put everything together.

650
00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.050
So this is an interesting trait to look at.
Cause it's a way,

651
00:37:29.051 --> 00:37:32.020
it's a measure of your filters and when your filters are too low,

652
00:37:32.021 --> 00:37:35.260
then you're detached from reality.
But if it filters are too high,

653
00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.230
then you're so conventional that you'll never have a new idea.

654
00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:41.590
And that still has its place,
um,

655
00:37:41.591 --> 00:37:44.230
more more so than the other side in society.
But,

656
00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:47.260
but it's a very important aspect of the last thinking.

657
00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:51.280
<v 1>Yeah.
And it struck me as kind of tragic.
I mean these people,
some,</v>

658
00:37:51.281 --> 00:37:54.640
some people who are right on the border,
I think you referenced the,
yeah,

659
00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:55.683
<v 0>John Nash,</v>

660
00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.070
he was on the border for years and was,

661
00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:05.110
uh,
enough reality based to the work that got a Nobel prize.

662
00:38:05.111 --> 00:38:09.220
And then he went over the edge and he was schizophrenia for some years and then

663
00:38:09.221 --> 00:38:12.820
he recovered.
Right.
Yeah.
We have another question.

664
00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:17.230
<v 1>Yeah.
So,
um,
I'm actually,
uh,
uh,
an improviser as well.</v>

665
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:21.830
It's somebody here.
And so like it seems to me like in that role,

666
00:38:21.831 --> 00:38:25.300
like I get my own way to practice some of this creative thinking that I wouldn't

667
00:38:25.301 --> 00:38:29.950
get if I just did work.
Um,
are there other ways that you've seen,

668
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:30.833
um,

669
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:35.910
that work to help people get this more creative aspect of themselves or

670
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.430
<v 0>train their brain to be more elastic thinking?
Yeah.</v>

671
00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:42.820
So I talked about different things you can do.

672
00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:47.860
One is meditation and often meditation related exercises that make you more

673
00:38:49.511 --> 00:38:50.111
mindful.

674
00:38:50.111 --> 00:38:53.890
So one of the important things to be as mindful of how are you attacking a

675
00:38:53.891 --> 00:38:58.891
problem and when you're getting to a barrier and once good to stop and take

676
00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:01.630
another approach and,
and,

677
00:39:01.631 --> 00:39:05.640
and to be mindful of yourself and to know what is it that you do that can,

678
00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:09.900
that can help do that.
Um,
uh,

679
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:14.320
another thing is it's very important to overcome the fear of failure.

680
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:16.900
I don't know how Google was about that,
but some companies,

681
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:21.370
if you screw off of the whatever bad review or you know,

682
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:25.840
your project failed or he did something that didn't work and you get criticized

683
00:39:25.841 --> 00:39:28.750
for that and you know,
they,
they,

684
00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.340
they make you afraid to fail,
which is a very,
um,
you know,

685
00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:37.800
it's a creativity killer.
As a theoretical physicist,

686
00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:41.410
I know that almost every idea I have sucks.
And sometimes,
you know,

687
00:39:41.411 --> 00:39:42.131
the only question is,

688
00:39:42.131 --> 00:39:45.730
is it take me five minutes or 50 days to figure out that it sucks,
you know,

689
00:39:45.731 --> 00:39:49.480
and then you go through a lot of those and eventually you get one,
it doesn't,

690
00:39:49.481 --> 00:39:50.890
then you publish something,
you know,
but,

691
00:39:50.891 --> 00:39:55.300
but if you're afraid to make that jump,
or even when I,

692
00:39:55.301 --> 00:39:56.620
when I'm writing as the same way,
I mean,

693
00:39:56.621 --> 00:39:59.080
I write a lot of stuff that's stupid and four,

694
00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:02.080
I just hope that I have noticed that before I publish the book and take it out

695
00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:05.620
and somebody tells me.
But if I was afraid to write something that was stupid,

696
00:40:05.621 --> 00:40:07.420
I would never write anything that was interesting either.

697
00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:10.480
I would just write a textbook.
So,
um,

698
00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:14.830
I think that's another thing and work on your fear of failure and one,
you know,

699
00:40:14.831 --> 00:40:17.800
I know that you have that problem.
I think it's very important to fail.

700
00:40:17.801 --> 00:40:18.890
Talk about how you failed.

701
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:22.720
Think about when you think about what other people failed.
Um,
you know,

702
00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:25.660
open up about it and get used to like write,
learn how to ski.

703
00:40:25.661 --> 00:40:29.570
I realized soon that the first thing I do when I got to this,

704
00:40:29.571 --> 00:40:32.890
he saw this fall over because I was scape really stiff,

705
00:40:32.891 --> 00:40:34.780
but I didn't want to fall over.
And I,
you know,

706
00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:39.160
and I was getting badly because I was afraid to fall.
But if I fall immediately,

707
00:40:39.161 --> 00:40:41.170
I get that over with us.
Not so bad.
I would fall today,

708
00:40:41.171 --> 00:40:44.140
I'm not going to have a fall free date and then I could really scheme.

709
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.720
And it's the same thing with failure.
So it's good to fail it,

710
00:40:46.721 --> 00:40:49.210
used to it and embrace it,
enjoy it.
The more you fail,

711
00:40:49.211 --> 00:40:50.550
the more success you'll have,
right?

712
00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:54.820
Just keep doing it or the more statistically speaking,

713
00:40:54.821 --> 00:40:58.100
I'm not saying that failure is a success.
Um,

714
00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:02.810
so that's another,
another thing you can do.
Oh,

715
00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:07.270
argue with people arguing is very good.

716
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:11.470
Talk to people who totally disagree with you are very different.
If you hate,

717
00:41:11.471 --> 00:41:15.250
you know,
if you're a very confessional,
either go to the weirdest restaurant,

718
00:41:15.251 --> 00:41:16.420
you can travel.

719
00:41:16.421 --> 00:41:20.140
I mean all these things that they've shown you increased your elastic thinking.

720
00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:22.450
They've even shown him that he was an interesting experiment.

721
00:41:22.451 --> 00:41:26.650
They had people in a room and they had these um,
uh,

722
00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:31.740
paint chips and some are red,
some are green and some are blue.
And they had,

723
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:34.280
they'd have like 10 people in the room.
One was a confederate,

724
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:39.370
a associate of the researcher because if you ever in a psych experiment and all

725
00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:40.450
of that,
that's number one.

726
00:41:40.451 --> 00:41:43.580
They tell you that every one speaks to me as a screener blue and they say blue,

727
00:41:43.581 --> 00:41:47.840
blue,
blue,
and then this confront,
it was like green.
I,
it was obviously blue,

728
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:51.110
but he would say,
great.
Okay.
That was the experiment.

729
00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.380
So that they told people we're going to be,

730
00:41:54.381 --> 00:41:56.420
you're going to be the second unrelated experiment.

731
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:58.730
Well if they have a psychotic or it tells you that,

732
00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:04.400
<v 1>just laugh,
laugh in her face,
you know.
And um,</v>

733
00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.070
so the second experiment supposedly unrelated was safe.

734
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:09.670
<v 0>Give you these paint chips to categorize.</v>

735
00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:14.530
Now they're all on the spectrum between blue and green.
So you know,
you could,

736
00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.810
there's what,
there's a continuous spectrum of,
uh,

737
00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.670
of frequencies between blue and green.

738
00:42:18.671 --> 00:42:20.860
And they would give her these paint chips and you have to say what your limits

739
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:24.830
are bringing.
Well,
guess what?
Even though the people who saw the,

740
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:28.770
the guy and that other experiment he called whatever I said,

741
00:42:28.771 --> 00:42:32.320
you called the blue chip green and they thought that was stupid.

742
00:42:32.321 --> 00:42:36.550
It was really blue when they are now categorizing these chips,
you know,

743
00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:40.060
and all the kinds of where you draw a line between green and blue.
Well,

744
00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:44.410
the ones who saw that guy who said that green was blue drew the line,
you know,

745
00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.300
much closer to blue poppy must have made the,

746
00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:50.260
made the blue section much bigger than the ones who didn't,
who weren't in that.

747
00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.810
So,
even though this person's ridiculous statement,

748
00:42:52.811 --> 00:42:54.040
it didn't seem to influence some,

749
00:42:54.041 --> 00:42:57.880
they were influenced suddenly later on their judgements.
So even when you,

750
00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.160
someone says something that you totally disagree with and you go,

751
00:43:00.161 --> 00:43:03.670
that's really stupid.
It can,
it can actually have an effect on your thinking.

752
00:43:03.671 --> 00:43:04.391
But I'm in a positive,

753
00:43:04.391 --> 00:43:07.120
effective can expand your thinking and the kinds of possibilities that you,

754
00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:10.670
that you think about.
So,
um,
yeah,

755
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:13.950
we'll have some more of this raspberries.
Yeah.

756
00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.420
<v 1>Well we'll wrap up with this.
Um,</v>

757
00:43:23.421 --> 00:43:25.820
you have various bits of wisdom from your parents in the book.

758
00:43:25.821 --> 00:43:27.640
I read something about a worm in horseradish.

759
00:43:27.641 --> 00:43:31.460
You'll have to read the book to know more about that.
Um,
and from your mother,

760
00:43:31.461 --> 00:43:33.890
you have the phrase of where there's a will,
there's a way.

761
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.750
How does this relate to being elastic?

762
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:38.310
<v 0>What this has to do with what I was talking about,</v>

763
00:43:38.311 --> 00:43:43.311
failure and about how sometimes the best elastic making comes from when you

764
00:43:47.671 --> 00:43:50.700
don't accept what you see or when you don't accept that you're not going to get

765
00:43:50.701 --> 00:43:52.440
there and you just,
and you just keep trying.

766
00:43:52.441 --> 00:43:57.200
So the idea is that if you broaden your perspective and the amount of the,

767
00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.410
the,
um,

768
00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:03.490
broaden the range of ideas that you find that you'll consider,

769
00:44:03.491 --> 00:44:04.980
or that your brain poses to you,

770
00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:08.160
you have a much greater chance of solving a problem even though you think that

771
00:44:08.161 --> 00:44:12.090
it can't possibly be solved.
Well,
thank you very much.

772
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:17.060
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
