00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.450
Hello and welcome to another Cambridge installation of toxic Google,

2
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.390
a Ted like to welcome professor Sarah Seager,

3
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.660
who's an astrophysicist and planetary scientists at Mit.

4
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.400
Her research focuses on theory,
computation data analysis of exoplanets.

5
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.030
Her research has introduced many new ideas to the field of exoplanet

6
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:24.864
characterization,

7
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.230
including work that led to the first detection of an exoplanet atmosphere.

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.370
Professor Seeger also works in the space instrumentation and space missions for

9
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:37.320
exoplanets,
including cube sats as a coinvestigator on the MIT lead tests,

10
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.600
a NASA explorer mission to be launched in 2017 and chair the NASA science and

11
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:47.490
technology definition team for a probe class star shade and telescope system for

12
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:50.220
direct imaging,
discovery and characterization of earth analogs.

13
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.640
And for that I'd like to welcome professor Seeger.
Thank you.

14
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.240
<v 2>Okay,
thank you.
Well good afternoon and thanks for coming out to my talk.</v>

15
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.950
The book is called Aliens.

16
00:01:02.951 --> 00:01:07.150
I've called my talk something else and sometimes I like to call my talk the real

17
00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:10.330
search for alien life.
So at the outset,
I want to say,

18
00:01:10.331 --> 00:01:14.380
I'm not looking for like little green aliens coming here or I don't know if

19
00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:15.730
anyone here believes in aliens.

20
00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:19.420
But the funny thing is every time a new planet is in the news and people like me

21
00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:22.990
get emails and phone calls,
I actually got this,
the most recent one.

22
00:01:22.991 --> 00:01:25.990
Have any of you heard of the Trappist planets?
About a month ago?

23
00:01:25.991 --> 00:01:29.010
There were these seven planets all or being a very cold star.

24
00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:33.550
We'll talk about those in the bed and I just,
I don't pick up my phone because,

25
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.400
you know,
typically there are these calls about Ufo shows and things,

26
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:40.400
but this one was this lady who was very serious and very nice.
I just wanted to,

27
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.721
but you know,

28
00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:44.080
she's been to this planet and would someone please talk to her about it?

29
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:48.400
And she was not really worked up or anything,
but it's incredible how the,
um,

30
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.270
you know,
the whole fiction of aliens and the movie's really,
uh,

31
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.450
is now coming to reality.
Actually.
Not that we're going to find them again,

32
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.810
but we were taking a very traditional scientific approach.

33
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.230
And so I'm here today to share with you just some of these approaches and I'm

34
00:02:02.231 --> 00:02:05.500
right over at MIT and there's an awful lot of work going on there in this field.

35
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.580
So I'm going to walk you through what an exoplanet is,
where we're at,

36
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.630
and then I was going to tell you a bit about space telescope called Kepler and

37
00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:15.640
the data that it has and how we use that data.

38
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.540
I'm going to funnel through towards how we think we're going to find signs of

39
00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:22.750
life and we're all really excited about it in exoplanets.

40
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.230
I hope it won't be disappointing to you and when you realize what will

41
00:02:26.231 --> 00:02:28.300
constitute,
not evidence,

42
00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:33.130
but suggestion of the fact that there might be life out there for the future

43
00:02:33.131 --> 00:02:35.140
when we get there.
But to start with,

44
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.670
I just have a few simple images and videos to let you know where we're at in

45
00:02:39.671 --> 00:02:44.480
exoplanets.
And I have a movie clip made from this eyes on exoplanet software.
Um,

46
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.240
I do encourage you to download this and fool around with it.
And if you have,
um,

47
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.320
friends were interested or children or anyone like that,
it's really fun.

48
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.700
So this is just a video clip showing you a fake image of what we think our milky

49
00:02:57.701 --> 00:03:02.200
way galaxy looks like.
But it quickly zooms into a real map of the sky.

50
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.960
And each of these highlighted objects is a star with known planets.
Um,

51
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.940
it's showing you some of the planets in our solar system.
If you look closely,

52
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:11.890
it will show you a spacecraft orbiting our son.

53
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.490
Keppler space craft is actually orbiting in our son,
not orbiting our earth.

54
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.920
And if you could zoom into part of earth and here it will click on the west

55
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:24.670
coast of North America and showing you what our spring night sky looks like.

56
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.080
And actually what it's showing you is all the white points are stars and all the

57
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:31.150
highlighted ones are stars with known planets.

58
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.470
There are thousands of stars out there that we know have planets orbiting them.

59
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.620
And we call those exoplanets.
Now,

60
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:41.260
you couldn't see all these stars with your naked eye.

61
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:44.710
You'd probably need by Nok yellers or a telescope to see them and then you

62
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:46.880
wouldn't see the planet or anything.
Um,

63
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.490
and here it's showing you these constellations overlaid and what it will do is

64
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:55.300
take us to a very special patch of the sky with thousands of stars with planets.

65
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.580
Does anyone know what that patch of sky is?

66
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.300
It's actually where a space telescope called Kepler,
um,

67
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:04.930
stared at that part of the sky for four years looking for planets.

68
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:06.820
I'll get to that in a minute.
In the software,

69
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:09.640
you can also type in a name of a star if you happen to know one that has a

70
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:14.510
planet and it will actually zoom into that part of the sky and show you,
um,

71
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.130
a schematic of the planets orbiting that star.

72
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:21.640
And look at this one has five planets orbiting the star and those are the

73
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:23.320
relative spacing of the orbits.

74
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.560
And you can click on this little menu here and here it's showing you a zone

75
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:31.480
around the star that a planet as heated by this star might be not too hot,

76
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.280
not too cold,
but just right for life.
Now here is where it has fine print,

77
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:38.170
which I think is designed so you can't read it,

78
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.200
but it says hypothetical visualization of planet because here we get to a point,

79
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:47.080
we don't have any data on planets like this except those in our own solar
system.

80
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.813
But there you go.

81
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.610
So you can actually use this and explore and you can click on any of these

82
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:52.870
objects and see what they are.

83
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.110
But my purpose was just to convey to you that there are,
you know,

84
00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:57.970
in our night sky,
thousands of stars.

85
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.920
Our galaxy has billions of stars and we think there are hundreds of billions of

86
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:06.280
galaxies.
And so,
wow.
I mean there are planets out there,

87
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:08.050
there have to be aliens out there somewhere.

88
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.040
And here I'm just here to tell you about the very nearest stars and what's going

89
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:14.740
on.
But before I do get started with more technical stuff,

90
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.960
I thought I'd show you these travel posters.

91
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.730
This says Kepler one 86 f where the grass is always red or on the other side.

92
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.710
And that put a star system I just showed you.
It's a small red star,

93
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.540
not a big yellow star like our sun.

94
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.930
So you might imagine that if most of the energy output is coming and red

95
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.470
wavelengths,

96
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.830
maybe the vegetation is a different color to harvest light at a different

97
00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:36.664
wavelength.

98
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.040
This one says experienced the gravity of HD four oh three Oh seven g is super

99
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:46.090
earth and here it's imagining there is a planet called Hg four Oh three Oh seven

100
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:47.680
g and we know it.
Surface gravity.

101
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.310
We know the mass of the planet and the size and we can calculate the gravity.

102
00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:53.470
It's about one and a half times that of earth.
So,

103
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.930
so imagine you go there and you can parachute,

104
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.510
relax on Kepler 16 be the land of two sons.
We are shadow always has company.

105
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.670
So what I like to say is science fiction got somethings right because you know

106
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:09.590
there are planets that orbit to stars.

107
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.990
And this would be like this planet tattooing from Star Wars where you'll see two

108
00:06:13.991 --> 00:06:18.860
sunsets and two sons most of the time.
So what we do here in exoplanets.

109
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:23.510
So to collect our thoughts as we put all the known planets on one plot and hear

110
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:27.410
what it's showing you is um,
planet size in earth radio.

111
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.520
So this is one earth size where it says earth on this horizontal line,

112
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:37.100
and this is orbital period in days.
So our earth,
we have 365 days in our year.

113
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.250
So earth would be somewhere over here.
We don't see planets there,

114
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.080
but what I want to press upon you or emphasizes that this is a log log plot.

115
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.700
So it's showing you a vast range of sizes and orbits.

116
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.190
And what this means actually is that wow,
planets come in all sizes,

117
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:57.020
they actually come in all masses,
all orbits.

118
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.080
It's an incredibly random process of planet formation.

119
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.560
And this was completely not anticipated at all by anybody,

120
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:04.850
pretty much in all of science.

121
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.590
What astronomers and planetary scientists thought was that our solar system with

122
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.860
earth,
mercury,
Venus,
earth,
Mars,

123
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.690
I'll in the inner part of the solar system and Jupiter,
Saturn,
Uranus,
Neptune,

124
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.690
and maybe Pluto and the outer part of the solar system that was established

125
00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:24.050
dogma that that's helped planetary systems are.
And in fact,

126
00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:25.250
you could have had someone like me,

127
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:28.640
even though Google wasn't here 20 years ago here in this location,

128
00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:32.220
you could have had,
um,
some like me here 20 years ago,
30 years ago,

129
00:07:32.221 --> 00:07:35.450
if only people had realized that other planetary systems may be very different

130
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:39.200
from our own on this plot is showing you that some planets,
quite a lot of them,

131
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.470
they have a period of less than one day.

132
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.900
That means their time to get around their star,

133
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:47.510
their year for one complete orbit is less than a day.

134
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.210
And by Kepler's third law,

135
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.180
it tells us that planets closer to the star are moving faster.

136
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:58.070
So these planets are also extremely close.
They're so hot.
Our earth here,

137
00:07:58.071 --> 00:08:00.020
we're about 300 Kelvin.
These stars,

138
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.960
these planets are about 2000 Kelvin hot.
Uh,

139
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.510
we have other planets.
We on the other extreme,
they're so far from the star,

140
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.500
um,
their orbital periods like a hundred thousand days.

141
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.430
So it's incredible how vast the system of plant says.
By the way,

142
00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:18.830
can you see each of the colors is a different technique.

143
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:22.220
I'm not gonna be able to talk about all the ways we can find planets here.

144
00:08:22.221 --> 00:08:25.340
I just wanted to conveyed you the diversity.
But by the way,

145
00:08:25.341 --> 00:08:29.030
can you see by eye what the most common type of planet that we know of today is

146
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.240
you look where like the densest points are.
They're actually here.
See it.

147
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.160
They're all overlapping.

148
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:42.140
That actually for now the most common type of planet we know of is one between

149
00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:43.910
about one to four times the size of earth.

150
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:46.040
Actually it's more like two to three times the size of earth.

151
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.220
And we have no solar system counterpart for those.

152
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.430
So we're kind of scratching our heads here cause we don't even totally

153
00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:54.680
understand how the planets in our solar system formed.

154
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.110
And now we have this whole new type of planet that we don't know know what they

155
00:08:58.111 --> 00:09:00.630
are.
So our solar system,

156
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:03.420
it's hard to find with any current planet finding techniques,

157
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:05.670
but we still think our solar system is somewhat rare.

158
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.590
It's not that common actually.

159
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.920
Although we don't know how common cause we haven't found any copies yet.

160
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:16.250
We can say that something like less than 10 less than about 5% of stars like our

161
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:18.720
sun have a solar system like ours.

162
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.380
And because our son itself is not the most common type of star,

163
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.670
the numbers drop way down.

164
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.750
So now I'm gonna move on to one of the main ways we find planets.

165
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.071
And before I get there,

166
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:31.830
I just wanted to give you some numbers because when we think about the search

167
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:33.360
for aliens and the search for life,

168
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.710
we do want to find planets that are somewhat like our own earth and our earth

169
00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:39.450
itself.
It seems so big here,
right?

170
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.930
If you would imagine traveling to Europe or Australia,
it seems super far away.

171
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:46.740
But in fact our earth is just so tiny when you compare it to any other

172
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.530
astronomical objects like our son for example.

173
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.550
So for our earth it is a hundred times smaller than our sun.

174
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.820
It's also a 100 I think it's,
I think that number might be wrong,

175
00:09:56.821 --> 00:10:00.240
but 100,000 times less massive and 10 billion times fainter than our sun.

176
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.310
So if I was going to ask you,

177
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:04.980
which technique would you pursue to find another earth?

178
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.610
Would it be one that has to do with size or when that has to do with mass or

179
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:09.900
when that has to do with brightness?

180
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:15.710
The size is your best way because it's the best ratio of planet to start.

181
00:10:16.111 --> 00:10:19.770
The problem is that the planet is right next to a big bright,
massive star.

182
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.000
And so all the ways we find planets today,
almost all the ways their ratios,

183
00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:27.960
they're ways of looking at the star and trying to see if a planets there.

184
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.260
So the way we find most planets are found today is with this method called the

185
00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:32.094
transit technique.

186
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.680
Can you see the planet going in front of the star that's supposed to be rough

187
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:38.310
size compared to a sensai star,
but we don't see that.

188
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:41.160
We don't spatially resolve stars except for our own Sun.

189
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:45.360
And so the bottom is showing you what we do find or what we do see rather.

190
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.240
And this kind of idea was,
um,

191
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.730
for planets was actually proposed in the 1950s but look at that.

192
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.870
So what happens is the planet goes in front of the Star and you imagine that

193
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:58.770
we're taking an image of a star every few seconds or every few minutes and just

194
00:10:58.771 --> 00:11:01.410
looking at that star over and over and over again.

195
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.330
And the starlight drops when the planet goes in front of the star and when the

196
00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:10.530
planet finishes going in front of the star,
then the planet,

197
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.700
the Star returns to its normal brightness and all these little wiggles they have

198
00:11:14.701 --> 00:11:18.000
to do with instrumental noise or the star itself isn't purely constant.

199
00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:22.110
Like our own son has sun spots,
for example.
So believe it or not,

200
00:11:22.111 --> 00:11:25.230
this is how most exoplanets have been found today.

201
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.120
Thousands of them with this technique.

202
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.360
And what happened was we have a special telescope.

203
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.090
How many of you have heard of the Kepler space telescope?
Just things here.

204
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.943
We get a lot of,
you have,

205
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.010
we'll Kepler stared at one part of the sky for four years and it looked at about

206
00:11:38.011 --> 00:11:41.760
150,000 stars and the main problem with Kepler,

207
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.280
why couldn't it actually was looking at a field of millions of stars,

208
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:48.030
but the problem was data rate.
We can't,
we don't have a way to downlink data.

209
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.840
A lot of it,
and Kepler is orbiting our son just like earth is.

210
00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:53.160
It's in an earth trailing orbit.

211
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.520
So our earth goes around the sun and Kepler's also orbiting the sun and so it's

212
00:11:57.521 --> 00:11:58.750
getting further and further from Earth.

213
00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:01.930
It's hundreds of millions of miles away right now.
And by the way,

214
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:06.900
just for those people who might still be around and about 60 60 years as cause

215
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.300
Kepler is in a different orbit.
So it's drifting away.
It'll actually return,

216
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.180
but it won't hit us.
So you don't have to worry about that.

217
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.860
Well I thought I'd show you some data and just describe briefly how we do.

218
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.050
People do find planets with Kepler data,

219
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:25.060
and what it's showing you is relative brightness and the top plot is showing you

220
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.770
what we call raw Kepler data.

221
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.830
And the bottom one is showing you what we call process Kepler data.
So FCC,

222
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.970
the one on the top,
I want you to look at the y axis.

223
00:12:33.971 --> 00:12:36.250
You can see even um,
you know,

224
00:12:36.251 --> 00:12:39.280
looking for small planets involves extremely precise,

225
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:42.040
photometry precise measurements of brightness of the star.

226
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.620
But what gets in their way,

227
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:48.010
what gets in our way actually is the fact that we have a lot of noise going on.

228
00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:49.690
Because if you take a detector,

229
00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:53.920
let's say you could open up your phone and shine a laser or an led at the

230
00:12:53.921 --> 00:12:56.920
detector at your camera detector,
and you measured how much comes back at,

231
00:12:56.921 --> 00:13:00.070
you will over one pixel.
That response,

232
00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:02.290
how much light that you're shining on it returns is about,

233
00:13:02.291 --> 00:13:06.760
it can vary by as much as 40%.
And we also have variation between pixels.

234
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.300
So that telescope is not perfectly stable.
If it's moving a little,

235
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.760
then actually we get a different response.

236
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.850
And what we're measuring about the brightness of the star isn't actually the

237
00:13:15.851 --> 00:13:16.780
brightness about the starts.

238
00:13:16.781 --> 00:13:20.080
Really just something that's happening on the detector.
Also,

239
00:13:20.081 --> 00:13:23.260
the temperature control,
the detector really matters.
Now with your phone,

240
00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:25.840
you're not going to notice if you take a picture in the summer or the winter,

241
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.860
but for these um,
very precise measurements that many decimal places,

242
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.490
it actually does really matter.
And so there's a bunch of things going on here,

243
00:13:33.491 --> 00:13:37.270
but sometimes the telescope drifts or it goes into a safe mode.

244
00:13:37.271 --> 00:13:40.630
There's an anomaly that happens and it stops taking data and then when it

245
00:13:40.631 --> 00:13:43.420
returns it's a slightly different temperature or it's moved slightly.

246
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.450
And that's why you're seeing all these different bumps in everything.

247
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.680
And astronomers,
what they do is,
I don't know if those of you who work on any,

248
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.350
you know,
data analysis would find this funny or sad,

249
00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:56.590
but often they don't understand what's happening and why they will do like a

250
00:13:56.591 --> 00:14:00.370
spline fit and just take stuff out.
I always find this astonishing actually.

251
00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:05.620
Ideally you'd like to understand every physical reason about why when your star

252
00:14:05.621 --> 00:14:08.320
is not varying,
the data coming back to you looks crazy.

253
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:12.070
Like perhaps it's battery cycling and your detector was too close to the battery

254
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.770
is there's a lot of reasons,
but it's true and was really just take it out.

255
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.730
And sometimes I think this prevents finding,
um,
finding planets.

256
00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:19.690
Now on the bottom plot,

257
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.540
you see there's a lot of gaps where the telescope was an observing.

258
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.860
But do you see a planet,

259
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:30.280
there's a drop in brightness as the planet goes in front of the star and it's

260
00:14:30.281 --> 00:14:34.510
all compressed because here you're seeing relative brightness and at the bottom

261
00:14:34.511 --> 00:14:38.200
you're seeing time,
which is,
it should have said on here days.

262
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:42.280
So this actually is going from about a hundred to 700 days.
This is 600,

263
00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:44.260
700 days worth of data.
That's incredible.

264
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.180
We have almost no experiments in astronomy that do this.
You can see that,

265
00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:52.820
you can see where it is because there's an arrow pointing to it.
And by the way,

266
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:53.660
um,

267
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:58.660
the way we do find planets is use a simple algorithm is really just like a box

268
00:14:59.541 --> 00:15:00.470
fitting method.

269
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.730
Imagine you just have a box and you take all your data and you run through

270
00:15:04.731 --> 00:15:08.660
different possible periods and you phase hold your data on that period.

271
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.030
And then you literally are just looking for a box.

272
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.290
I mean there's other ways to do it,

273
00:15:12.291 --> 00:15:14.660
but that one proved the most reliable and the most efficient.

274
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.530
Now one funny thing about the that happened earlier on was the Kepler team,

275
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.740
they just cut their period off at three days.
So you know,

276
00:15:21.741 --> 00:15:25.190
you're choosing your algorithm and your boundaries three days to let's say 300

277
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:29.570
days and they didn't find any of those one day period planets that because their

278
00:15:29.571 --> 00:15:30.261
algorithm,
you know,

279
00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:32.720
we always say about computers is it'll do what you tell it to do,

280
00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:34.430
that it won't do what you're not telling it.

281
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.970
So you really want to make sure that you can see all things.

282
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.470
So if you take this data and faithful debt and just show it around the transit

283
00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:46.910
itself,
there it is.
Now there's time and hours and there's relative brightness.

284
00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:49.700
And I just want you to look at that measure precision for a second.

285
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:54.730
Oh 0.9 900 905 and remember I told you that Earth is a hundred times smaller

286
00:15:56.061 --> 00:15:56.960
than our sun,

287
00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.800
but we're measuring area here cause it's the drop and brightness as the planet

288
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.030
blocks out the star light.

289
00:16:02.031 --> 00:16:04.700
So that will be about a part in 10,000 to find an earth sized planet.

290
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.860
It's amazing.
We,
if I'd ask you,

291
00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:09.860
do any of you at any time in your life had you ever made a measurement to four

292
00:16:09.861 --> 00:16:14.240
decimal places?
Um,
unless it's the gravitational wave people,

293
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:15.920
most people have not done the sentence.

294
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:20.660
So it's incredible breathtaking telescope in space and there's just tons and

295
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.560
tons of great data on it.

296
00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.400
I just wanted you to know that different planets have different transits,

297
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.310
their transit light curve looks different and there's a huge amount of

298
00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:29.630
information buried in the light curve.

299
00:16:29.631 --> 00:16:33.530
And so people are busy working away to try to understand what if the planets on

300
00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:35.750
an eccentric orbit,
if the planet might have moons,

301
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.440
some of these planets are massive and close to the star and they literally are

302
00:16:39.441 --> 00:16:43.340
totally distorting the star.
You can see that in the light curve.

303
00:16:43.341 --> 00:16:47.090
And so there's a lot of stuff going on.
And finally,
as part of this introduction,

304
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.090
I wanted to show you this plot,

305
00:16:50.091 --> 00:16:54.270
this bar chart so that you could have a little more quantitative,
um,

306
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.740
just to empathy so that you can walk away with one of the main points I wanted

307
00:16:57.741 --> 00:17:00.230
to convey to you that the most common type of planet we know of,

308
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.630
it's not a big planet like Jupiter.

309
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.110
It's actually these planets about twice the size of earth,

310
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.120
which we have no solar system counterparts.

311
00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:10.970
This is showing you the fraction of stars with planets

312
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:17.390
and it's showing you a bar chart of planet size,
uh,

313
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.680
plant size relative to Earth.

314
00:17:18.681 --> 00:17:21.280
So down on the right you're seeing planets that are the size of Jupiter.

315
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:26.090
Jupiter is about 11 times the size of earth and you're seeing planets that are

316
00:17:26.091 --> 00:17:29.690
between one to three times the size of earth that are literally 10 times more

317
00:17:29.691 --> 00:17:31.730
common than Jupiter sized planets.
Now,

318
00:17:31.731 --> 00:17:34.610
if you don't pay attention to planetary science,
this just might be like,
okay,

319
00:17:34.611 --> 00:17:35.630
here's a cool factoid,

320
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.290
but I want to emphasize one more time that an egg in planetary science,

321
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.290
people assume that Jupiter was the natural end product,

322
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.600
that when a planet starts forming,

323
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:48.260
it eventually gets big enough by rocks and Isis colliding together.

324
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.080
But essentially it acts like a cosmic vacuum cleaner.
It sucks up all the,

325
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.250
all the gas around it,

326
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.210
and I just finished his growing when there's no more material to create.

327
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.460
It's like Luis,
we used to have the joke that's,

328
00:17:59.461 --> 00:18:01.320
I don't know if you find it funny here,
it's like Google,
you know,

329
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.200
Google started and grew and grew and grew and really dominated.

330
00:18:04.201 --> 00:18:06.810
Nothing else could conform as we saw Jupiter.

331
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.890
So the fact that all these other planetary systems not only don't have a
Jupiter,

332
00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:14.040
but they have these smaller planets.
What happened?
The black instead of Google,

333
00:18:14.041 --> 00:18:16.890
you have a hundred different companies all kind of like Google.

334
00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:21.930
So it's not what we expected.
So to summarize that intro,

335
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.880
exoplanets are diverse,

336
00:18:23.881 --> 00:18:27.840
covering nearly all masses sizes and orbits possible and these small planets are

337
00:18:27.841 --> 00:18:28.680
incredibly common.

338
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.060
So now I'm going to move on to the so called habitable zone.

339
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.760
It's a kind of catch phrase that means like the goldilocks zone.

340
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.230
When we search for planets,

341
00:18:37.231 --> 00:18:41.550
we want to find small planets that have a solid surface that might be able to

342
00:18:41.551 --> 00:18:46.020
host life.
And we want planet.
So the right temperature,
not too hot,
not too cold,

343
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:47.130
but just right for life.

344
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.700
So I think some of you said when I said have you heard of the Trappist planets?

345
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:52.650
And it will.
Some people said yes you have.

346
00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:54.680
Well I'm going to show you what's behind those sales.

347
00:18:54.681 --> 00:18:58.710
So instead of like the newspaper article,
just hyping it all,

348
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.640
this is actually the trappist planet discovery and maybe now you have a bit more

349
00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:07.350
tools to to understand what it is it's showing you days just normalized I guess

350
00:19:07.351 --> 00:19:12.351
at one day one to 23 and this is looking at the star Trappist one as a function

351
00:19:12.661 --> 00:19:15.360
of time.
And this was taken by,
not Kepler,

352
00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:18.540
but the Spitzer space telescope and infrared telescope that's about 80

353
00:19:18.541 --> 00:19:23.400
centimeters in diameter and it's also a in an earth trailing heliocentric orbit.

354
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:27.260
And again it has gaps when the telescope was in observing or when it down linked

355
00:19:27.261 --> 00:19:31.140
to earth.
And can you see the transits,

356
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.850
they're all labeled for you.
But look at all these drops and brightness.

357
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:36.840
This is incredible.

358
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.210
They're all these different drops and they're all different sizes.

359
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.910
And some of them,
if you see two letters,
the trans,
that was a double transits,

360
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.330
two planets were transiting the star at the same time.

361
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.440
So this is really interesting and I also want to draw your attention to the

362
00:19:49.441 --> 00:19:53.520
scale here.
Remember the last one?
It was like four decimal places.
This one drop.

363
00:19:53.521 --> 00:19:55.230
And brightness here is only about a percent.

364
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.970
And this system I wanted to tell you about because we're the field now is doing

365
00:19:59.971 --> 00:20:03.120
what's easy,
not what we necessarily wanted to do.

366
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.560
We're just doing the easiest thing to do.

367
00:20:04.561 --> 00:20:07.220
And the particular group who found this,
um,

368
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:11.820
they want purposely after the very smallest stars in existence and this cartoon

369
00:20:11.821 --> 00:20:13.650
here now,
now there's a few things going on here,

370
00:20:13.651 --> 00:20:18.651
but on the left you can browse the face folded data for each planet separated on

371
00:20:18.961 --> 00:20:19.770
its own.

372
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:23.970
And you can see there are seven planets and they're going from close to the star

373
00:20:23.971 --> 00:20:27.150
to further from the star where the further the planet is from the star,

374
00:20:27.151 --> 00:20:29.610
the slower it travels around the star on,

375
00:20:29.611 --> 00:20:32.190
the longer the transit is on the hole.

376
00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:35.400
And on the right it's showing you just some schematics.

377
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.910
This yellow thing here would be our son.
You could draw like a giant,

378
00:20:38.911 --> 00:20:43.860
giant circle.
And this is Jupiter and this is the star Trappist one.

379
00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:49.720
It's so small,
almost the size of Jupiter.
If it were any smaller or colder,

380
00:20:49.721 --> 00:20:53.200
it wouldn't be a star.
It wouldn't be able to fuse hydrogen in the core.

381
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.520
So remember the planets going in front of the star and blocking light,

382
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:02.500
a smaller starts just easier to find planets around.
So there's a lot of uh,

383
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:05.380
their skill and luck involved in exoplanets,
just like any field.

384
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.700
But it was incredible because the team had a pilot program to look at 20 stars

385
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.030
and one of those 20 had this incredible planetary system.

386
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:17.290
And here it's showing you that in our son we have our inner planets,
mercury,

387
00:21:17.291 --> 00:21:21.040
Venus,
Earth,
Mars,
Jupiter has some moons.
And Wow,
this one has all these planets.

388
00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.430
And what's so great about it is that,
um,

389
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.910
there may be a chance that one of them has the right amount of energy hitting it

390
00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:31.210
from the star and could be really the right temperature for life.

391
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.680
So one of the things I do is I make very complicated computer models to work

392
00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:38.770
through all of this based on the atmosphere and the greenhouse gasses and things

393
00:21:38.771 --> 00:21:40.780
like that.
But instead of telling you that,

394
00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.840
I will let me take you on a virtual trip to one of these planets.

395
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.060
And it's not just the Trappist one star,

396
00:21:46.061 --> 00:21:50.110
but there are lots of small stars out there and way more astronomers just

397
00:21:50.111 --> 00:21:51.880
observing small stars for planets.

398
00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:55.930
So let's imagine for a moment we could transport ourselves to one of these,

399
00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.350
not the Trappist ones,
but some planets orbiting a slightly bigger star.

400
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.950
And the first thing you notice is a possibility that that star would be very big

401
00:22:02.951 --> 00:22:03.784
on the sky.

402
00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.950
And the artists here has made it a take the artist's license to make the sky a

403
00:22:08.951 --> 00:22:13.240
different color and to show you other planets in that same system.
Well,

404
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.740
one of the things about these planets,

405
00:22:14.741 --> 00:22:18.250
they're so close to the star that there what were called tidally locked,

406
00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:23.080
just like the moon shows the same face to Earth at all times.
These planets,
um,

407
00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:26.410
should have interacted with their star,
with tides.

408
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:31.150
So that one day,
one rotation is the same as one year,

409
00:22:31.151 --> 00:22:34.840
one revolution.
And that's what our moon does.
If you've,
you know,
the moon,

410
00:22:34.841 --> 00:22:37.990
you only see the same face at all time because the moon,

411
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:42.040
it's only rotating one time for every time it orbits.
And we think the same.

412
00:22:42.041 --> 00:22:43.150
Should be of these planets.

413
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:47.590
So what that means if we could go to that planet is that the sun,
that star,

414
00:22:47.591 --> 00:22:51.100
the sun would be in the same place of the sky at all times.
Yeah.

415
00:22:51.101 --> 00:22:52.990
So you can choose to go where it's always sunny.

416
00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.780
The surround horse could go where it's always night.

417
00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:00.340
And if anything too is because the small stars have very low energy output.

418
00:23:00.341 --> 00:23:03.250
So the planet has to be very close to the star to receive the right amount of

419
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:07.030
energy.
And so it's orbiting the star with short periods.

420
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:11.020
Like these Trappist planets have period on the order of one day to like 10 days.

421
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:15.370
So that's um,
your birthday would be every 10 days.
Um,

422
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.930
so this planet would be interesting for that reason alone,
but in fact,

423
00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:21.850
if you think more carefully about this planet,

424
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.420
it wouldn't be great to visit because these [inaudible] stars have flares.

425
00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.860
They're giving off flares.
Does anyone remember?
I don't know if annual,

426
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:32.110
remember her read about this,
like in the 19,
don't see like the late 1980s,

427
00:23:32.111 --> 00:23:35.650
our son had a giant flare and it knocked out candidates power in Quebec.

428
00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.310
And this is something astronomers actually worry about to or not just

429
00:23:39.311 --> 00:23:39.851
astronomers,

430
00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:44.851
that these big burst of energy could come and like literally destroy our power.

431
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.460
Well on this particular planet that would be happening on a daily basis in much

432
00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:52.880
bigger amounts than,
than what we've seen here.
So if you're on that,

433
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:54.140
if you visited and you don't,

434
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.490
you could get cancer literally just from all these high energy particles

435
00:23:58.491 --> 00:24:01.400
whizzing by.
You flip out your phone,
the electronics will get knocked off.

436
00:24:01.401 --> 00:24:03.950
So maybe it's not such a great planet to visit after all,

437
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:09.170
but I was just trying to convey to you that these small stars that are 10 to 50%

438
00:24:09.171 --> 00:24:10.190
the size of our sun,

439
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.550
they're the ones that are being scoured for habitable planets now.

440
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.640
But will we be able to recognize these planets are life on them.

441
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.520
They're so different from our sun and what we're used to here.

442
00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:20.600
We're not really sure.

443
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:25.340
And I just listed three for those who would read the news or notice that last

444
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.010
summer there was one announced around Proxima Centauri B.

445
00:24:28.011 --> 00:24:32.610
That's our very nearest star to our son.
And the trap is planets.

446
00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.870
There was another one mentioned more recently,
so that's where we're at.

447
00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:40.520
And the habitable zone estimate is actually from very simple energy but energy

448
00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:45.380
budgets.
So I do have one more topic.
I have a couple more topics,

449
00:24:45.381 --> 00:24:50.381
but the next sort of more meaty topic would be is on an exoplanet atmospheres.

450
00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.540
Because the one thing about these so called habitable worlds,

451
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:57.420
we have no idea what they're like.
We know that there,
um,

452
00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.710
size and their mass,
but that's it.
That's why they're colored white hair.

453
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.330
We don't know.
Like in our own earth,

454
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.350
people are worried about parts per million of carbon dioxide,
right?
Remember,

455
00:25:06.351 --> 00:25:10.160
our earth has had a mean of 40 million,
40 parts per million,

456
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:14.210
400 parts per million carbon dioxide.
And before we started out with decades ago,

457
00:25:14.211 --> 00:25:17.240
like three 50.
Now imagine on another planet,

458
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:20.540
we're not just thinking of 50 part per million,
more carbon dioxide,

459
00:25:20.541 --> 00:25:24.590
but maybe double or triple or we have other greenhouse gases.

460
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.270
So we need to understand the atmosphere before we can understand whether the

461
00:25:29.271 --> 00:25:32.210
planet's surface could be good enough for life or whether it's too hot or too

462
00:25:32.211 --> 00:25:36.320
cold.
So the next thing been talking about is atmospheres.
But before I do that,

463
00:25:36.321 --> 00:25:39.350
actually I forgot to show you one thing on here.
Did you look at this data?

464
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.430
Can you see a flare?

465
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.033
<v 3>Okay,</v>

466
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.200
<v 2>look at this is what it looks like.</v>

467
00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.340
The star brightened suddenly and actually happened.
You know,

468
00:25:49.341 --> 00:25:53.840
every few days on this starts getting a flare,
which maybe is not too bad,
right?

469
00:25:53.841 --> 00:25:56.540
If you have ginormous circuit breakers on all your power grid,

470
00:25:56.541 --> 00:25:59.330
but other stars like Proxima Centauri B,

471
00:25:59.331 --> 00:26:03.920
it's flaring like dozens of times a day basically.
So these m stars,

472
00:26:03.921 --> 00:26:07.460
they're just very badly behaved.
They're very active,
just not,
not great.

473
00:26:07.461 --> 00:26:10.190
But I wanted you to see that in the data.
That's a tiny,
tiny flare there.

474
00:26:10.191 --> 00:26:12.080
But at visible wavelengths and ultraviolet,

475
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.680
it would have much more energy compared to the infrared wavelengths where it's

476
00:26:15.681 --> 00:26:17.630
being measured.
So I didn't want to just,

477
00:26:17.631 --> 00:26:19.400
I just have a few slides on this right now,

478
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.460
but I remember when we were talking about the planet going in front of the star,

479
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:27.020
I wanted to convey to you the main way that we study exoplanet atmospheres today

480
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:32.300
and what's showing you on the left is a cartoon showing you a planet going in

481
00:26:32.301 --> 00:26:36.620
front of the star with the atmosphere
highlighted.

482
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.700
I'm exaggerated,

483
00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.700
but the concept is that when the planet goes in front of the star,

484
00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:45.420
some of the star light shines through the atmosphere.
And believe it or not,

485
00:26:45.421 --> 00:26:49.650
we can pick up planet atmosphere signals in that light coming through.

486
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:52.590
And we think about it for a minute.

487
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:56.100
We'll observe the star on its own and then the star during transit and

488
00:26:56.101 --> 00:26:57.060
essentially subtract.

489
00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:02.610
It's kind of hard cause we're subtracting two big numbers and um,

490
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.530
just all modesty aside for a moment,

491
00:27:04.531 --> 00:27:08.490
I invented this technique and when I worked on this,

492
00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:10.830
at the time that I started,
honestly,
I don't know,

493
00:27:10.831 --> 00:27:13.530
I wasn't really thinking like in research,
if you're lucky,

494
00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:14.730
you can kind of do whatever you want.

495
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.330
That doesn't happen as you get older and have a real job.
But um,

496
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.440
I was just working on this and people honestly,
um,

497
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:27.360
didn't understand why people worked on exoplanets because we didn't have that

498
00:27:27.361 --> 00:27:29.490
plot like full of so many,
you can barely count them.

499
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:33.210
They're like maybe two or three or four new planets and they were all in very

500
00:27:33.211 --> 00:27:37.410
short periods and because everybody thought we had our solar system,

501
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.120
no one even believed they were planets and just sort of by kind of good fortune

502
00:27:42.121 --> 00:27:43.260
or just risk taking.

503
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:48.180
I decided to work on exoplanets when I was at Harvard as a graduate student and

504
00:27:48.181 --> 00:27:49.680
my advisor gave me this problem.
He said,

505
00:27:49.681 --> 00:27:51.600
why don't you work on atmospheres of these planets?

506
00:27:51.601 --> 00:27:54.690
Because we know a lot about binary stars.
There's stars that orbit each other.

507
00:27:54.691 --> 00:27:55.800
So just kind of take that.

508
00:27:55.801 --> 00:28:00.780
And he gave me a code in Fortran and like I couldn't use it and he's that good.

509
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:05.520
It was really funny because the code was so old that they had to use a variable

510
00:28:05.521 --> 00:28:09.240
name that had to be reused over and over because they couldn't store a lot of

511
00:28:09.241 --> 00:28:12.810
stuff.
And just,
it was funny the way it was done.
And in stars,

512
00:28:12.811 --> 00:28:16.320
there's a lot of free electrons,
so you use free electrons as it six variable.

513
00:28:16.321 --> 00:28:18.060
But planet atmospheres have molecules.

514
00:28:18.061 --> 00:28:19.800
There's no free electrons cause it's colder.

515
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.900
So in the end I had to throw it out a day,

516
00:28:21.901 --> 00:28:25.440
decided to program in c and later now I adopted python,

517
00:28:25.441 --> 00:28:27.030
which feels a bit lazy to be honest.

518
00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.910
But everybody is doing that and there's a lot of packages and stuff.

519
00:28:29.911 --> 00:28:33.810
So I worked on the atmospheres and then when I finished graduate school,

520
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.270
we didn't have any transiting planets.
But the chance to transit,
um,

521
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:40.080
depends on how close the planet is to the star.
Just like showing it,

522
00:28:40.081 --> 00:28:42.510
throwing darts.
It's not a perfect analogy,

523
00:28:42.511 --> 00:28:44.940
but if you're really close to the screen,
it's really easy to hit it.

524
00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:47.100
If you're further away,
your angle gets such that it's harder.

525
00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:51.890
So when I started my postdoc,
um,
everyone kept asking him,

526
00:28:51.891 --> 00:28:53.880
what's the next big thing?
What's the next big thing?
You know,

527
00:28:53.881 --> 00:28:56.610
if you don't know anything,
those of us who struggle with small talk,

528
00:28:56.611 --> 00:28:59.460
if you don't know,
have a question.
That's the thing.
You can ask someone.

529
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:03.460
What's the next Big Bang?
So looking back,
you see Paul all had problems,

530
00:29:03.461 --> 00:29:07.080
the small talk.
And so I'd say,
you know,
transits,
we have no transiting planets,

531
00:29:07.081 --> 00:29:08.010
but it's going to happen,
right?

532
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:12.460
If the chance to transit for a planet in a four day orbit is about 10% and we

533
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.540
have seven of these now,
like we're not going to get to 10 and get a transit,

534
00:29:15.541 --> 00:29:18.180
but it's going to happen.
It's more and more chance the more we find.

535
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:19.800
So I worked really hard to,

536
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:23.340
this is the thing I've worked on when I got out of Grad school and there it was.

537
00:29:23.341 --> 00:29:26.760
And a couple of years later the observers use Hubble space telescope and use

538
00:29:26.761 --> 00:29:28.650
what I said they should look for and they found it.

539
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.220
And you think that would be great and that after that life would be great.

540
00:29:32.221 --> 00:29:35.250
But people didn't think this would ever go anywhere.
They're thinking,
well,

541
00:29:35.251 --> 00:29:38.400
it's a one object.
When methods success,
it's so hard.

542
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.980
Even I saw a few of you smile when I say,
you know,
we,
this atmosphere,

543
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.060
it's so tiny.

544
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.510
And now we want to subtract two big numbers and see the features and no one

545
00:29:46.511 --> 00:29:47.380
thought it would ever go anywhere.

546
00:29:47.381 --> 00:29:49.120
But now it's actually one of the biggest fields.

547
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:51.970
It's so big and crowded that I barely work on this part now.

548
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.590
So out of all of that,
I'm going to,

549
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.440
I picked one to show you because our data's really horrible actually.

550
00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:01.990
So I just picked one to show you.
I kind of cherry pick the best one,

551
00:30:01.991 --> 00:30:04.900
but I want to make sure that you understand the concept and walk away with it

552
00:30:04.901 --> 00:30:08.410
because it could happen in the summer or next year or five years.

553
00:30:08.411 --> 00:30:10.960
Someone might say,
Oh,
I think I found a sign of life.

554
00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:13.750
And so I was just trying to prepare you to know what that is.

555
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.690
So what I want you to think about promoting is this atmosphere.

556
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.320
And I want you to imagine that if the atmosphere is absorbing strongly,

557
00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:25.210
the planet looks a tiny bit bigger,
then if the planet had no atmosphere,

558
00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:30.130
we're at a wavelength where the planet was not absorbing it all.
Okay?

559
00:30:30.131 --> 00:30:31.690
So think about our earth here.

560
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.780
Like when on a clear day or clear night you can see the sky.

561
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:37.630
So that's like a transparent wavelength.
There's nothing happening there.

562
00:30:37.631 --> 00:30:39.550
But if you actually could look in the infrared,

563
00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.850
we can't see the sky in the infrared for most of the infrared cause we have

564
00:30:42.851 --> 00:30:47.160
carbon dioxide and other gasses absorbing and strongly.
So the question,

565
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.200
so how we try to think of this problem is we think that the planet looks bigger

566
00:30:50.201 --> 00:30:50.860
at a wavelength door.

567
00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:54.460
It's absorbing and smaller at a wavelength where it's more transparent.

568
00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.770
And so here's the data that I chose to show you.

569
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:59.650
And what you see here is the transit depth.

570
00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.820
So this is trying to tell you how big the planet is,
um,

571
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.820
and the wavelength than microns showing you.
Um,
we've lengthened microns.

572
00:31:06.821 --> 00:31:09.580
Visible wavelengths is about 0.2,
2.8 microns.

573
00:31:09.581 --> 00:31:10.870
And then the near infrared is further.

574
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:13.930
Now what you're supposed to see here is look at the black points,

575
00:31:13.931 --> 00:31:17.200
which are real data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope,
with their aerobars.

576
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:22.740
And what you're supposed to do is agree or evaluate for yourself whether or not

577
00:31:22.961 --> 00:31:26.350
this is different from a straight line.
If this was a straight line,

578
00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:29.200
we'd say the planet is not changing size with wavelength and it's no longer,

579
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:30.790
it's not more transparent or less,

580
00:31:30.791 --> 00:31:34.900
more absorbing wavelength with respect to each other and what the red points
are.

581
00:31:34.901 --> 00:31:35.860
Red,
I mean the model,

582
00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:40.360
the curves are models they're generated with computer codes that take libraries

583
00:31:40.361 --> 00:31:44.830
of mullet molecular data ultimately generated from quantum mechanics and putting

584
00:31:44.831 --> 00:31:47.440
it through like an atmosphere model.
And what these,
this,

585
00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:50.260
these big bumps shown by the model or their water vapor,

586
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:53.770
water vapor is even on earth.
Our strongest greenhouse gas,

587
00:31:53.771 --> 00:31:58.771
it's extremely strongly absorbing and that big bump your seam around 1.4 microns

588
00:31:59.471 --> 00:32:03.040
there.
That's from water vapor.
So the model fit,

589
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:06.280
the quantum mechanics tells us water is strongly absorbing there.

590
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.890
We see that our spectrum changes there and Voila,

591
00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.770
we call this a detection of water vapor in an exoplanet atmosphere.

592
00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:15.490
Now you see it,
the shorter wavelengths,
Adidas is not as good.

593
00:32:15.491 --> 00:32:18.190
It's just not really telling us much.
Um,

594
00:32:18.191 --> 00:32:20.470
and this is kind of what we see and this is the best data that we have.

595
00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:24.180
I have another,
I did choose one more plot to show you.
Um,

596
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.020
usually when I show this,
the audience laughs,

597
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:31.240
but this is the same kind of data and it's showing you the absorption and

598
00:32:31.241 --> 00:32:34.450
percent.
So think of that like the planet size and the blue points,

599
00:32:34.451 --> 00:32:38.380
our data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and you're supposed to see if you

600
00:32:38.381 --> 00:32:41.780
know it's different from a straight line or not.
Um,

601
00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:46.550
the one at the bottom not right,
that's just noise or there's,

602
00:32:46.551 --> 00:32:48.660
it's not different from a straight line.
The one on top is,

603
00:32:48.661 --> 00:32:50.420
and the one in the middle is definitely as well.

604
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:53.350
So that's where we're at for exoplanet atmospheres.
And,

605
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:57.020
but just to leave you with one more detail that most of these exoplanets people

606
00:32:57.021 --> 00:33:00.650
are spending a lot of Hubble space telescope time and a lot of models working

607
00:33:00.651 --> 00:33:02.510
really hard.
We're sort of stuck with what we have.

608
00:33:02.511 --> 00:33:06.530
The Hubble Space Telescope is a shared observation observatory and as

609
00:33:06.531 --> 00:33:09.770
instruments that were designed for things not related to exoplanets.

610
00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.640
And we can really only look at this very narrow part in the spectrum.
And most,

611
00:33:13.641 --> 00:33:16.460
um,
most of these exoplanet atmospheres really,

612
00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:20.270
we do just see a straight line and people invoke clouds.

613
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.580
I want you to imagine for a minute you're on a plane.

614
00:33:22.581 --> 00:33:24.230
And you know how when you go through the clouds,

615
00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:28.040
you can't see anything looking down.
It's all that lower atmosphere is blocked.

616
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.160
But that lower atmosphere is what were all the spectral lines are forming.

617
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.070
So we think that what's happening is that the starlight is going through the

618
00:33:34.071 --> 00:33:37.130
atmosphere,
but actually it's not sitting in a cloud and not making it through.

619
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:40.760
So to finish up this part about atmospheres,

620
00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:46.340
what we want to do in the future with new telescopes is look at atmospheres of

621
00:33:46.341 --> 00:33:50.060
small planets.
And we want to look for signs of water vapor on small,

622
00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:50.894
rocky worlds.

623
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:54.830
And we want to look for signs of gases that don't belong that might be

624
00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:58.520
attributed to life.
Now on our own planet,
all of us humans,

625
00:33:58.521 --> 00:34:02.510
we require oxygen to breathe that I think everybody knows.

626
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:07.400
But what people forget is that our atmosphere is composed of 20% by volume

627
00:34:07.401 --> 00:34:11.810
oxygen.
But without life,
without plants and photosynthetic bacteria,

628
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.600
we would actually have no oxygen in our atmosphere

629
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.220
as this is amazing to think about that.
When I think about aliens,

630
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:23.180
I like to think that there are intelligent aliens around some of those planets

631
00:34:23.181 --> 00:34:27.050
orbiting nearby stars and that they're building the kind of telescopes I'm about

632
00:34:27.051 --> 00:34:27.884
to tell you about.

633
00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:31.340
And they look at our planet and they see all this oxygen and they know that

634
00:34:31.341 --> 00:34:33.920
oxygen is a highly reactive gas and that it shouldn't be there.

635
00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.470
And I really hope they're out there,
you know,
scratching their heads,

636
00:34:36.471 --> 00:34:39.140
trying to weigh in on whether or not this means there is life on earth.

637
00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.560
So that's our,
that's overly simplified.

638
00:34:42.561 --> 00:34:46.520
But that actually honestly is where people had been thinking for a long,

639
00:34:46.521 --> 00:34:49.160
long time.
And we're trying to do something different now.

640
00:34:49.161 --> 00:34:50.690
Look at different molecules.

641
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:55.940
And I have this illustration here showing you a sea of molecules that fills

642
00:34:55.941 --> 00:34:56.870
chemical space.

643
00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:00.680
And that if we can work through all these molecules and think about which ones

644
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:05.030
you know might have life on them,
it might might be a signature of life.

645
00:35:05.031 --> 00:35:08.330
It might increase our chances of being able to find an identify life on some of

646
00:35:08.331 --> 00:35:10.640
the planets that were just struggling to observe.

647
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:12.620
So this field is kind of in the future.

648
00:35:12.621 --> 00:35:16.630
But that's in a nutshell what this sort of very next milestone in exoplanets

649
00:35:16.631 --> 00:35:20.120
says.
It's setting small planet atmospheres,
looking for signs of life on them.

650
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:22.650
So to summarize that part,
um,

651
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:27.030
dozens of exoplanet atmospheres have been observed with tiny signals on order to

652
00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:29.180
parts per thousand and oxygen.

653
00:35:29.181 --> 00:35:32.180
And a small planet atmosphere means our favorite way to find signs of life on

654
00:35:32.181 --> 00:35:34.730
another world.
But because it's upcoming,

655
00:35:34.731 --> 00:35:39.270
people are generating all sorts of false positive scenarios.

656
00:35:39.271 --> 00:35:42.420
How could oxygen be generated without it actually being from life?

657
00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:47.310
So this is a TBD stayed tuned kind of topic.
Now for the last part of my talk,

658
00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.060
I will actually just tell you a bit about the telescopes that we're going to use

659
00:35:51.061 --> 00:35:54.720
to study these planets.
This one is the James Webb space telescope.

660
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.600
Initially it was considered like the follow on humble,

661
00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:59.610
but it's actually quite different.
It's far bigger.

662
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:04.410
It's going to orbit a million and a half miles from earth and it's going to work

663
00:36:04.411 --> 00:36:09.120
in the infrared and look how it's um,
on the left as the artist's conception,

664
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:14.150
which shows you the mirror as well as this very large tennis court size solar

665
00:36:14.521 --> 00:36:18.570
shield in each of those layers has a different weave woven pattern.

666
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:22.200
So when energy gets absorbed it will be readmitted in a way that doesn't keep

667
00:36:22.201 --> 00:36:24.900
getting absorbed and readmitted and hitting the telescope and heating it up.

668
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.200
Remember when I told you before about temperature control of the detector will

669
00:36:28.201 --> 00:36:31.590
in this case,
um,
the whole telescope has to operate very,

670
00:36:31.591 --> 00:36:34.500
very cold because it's working at infrared wavelengths where heat from the

671
00:36:34.501 --> 00:36:37.800
instruments and the sun would just destroy observations on the right.

672
00:36:37.801 --> 00:36:40.110
That's actually a real image,
real photograph,

673
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:45.560
real image taken at Goddard Space Flight Center on April 24th,

674
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.050
2017 and there you see all those mirror segments were actually put into place

675
00:36:49.051 --> 00:36:50.970
over the last nine months or so.

676
00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:53.940
Now it has to be shipped to Johnson space flight center.

677
00:36:53.941 --> 00:36:57.090
It actually just arrived.
I got an email like yesterday,
but you know what,

678
00:36:57.091 --> 00:37:01.260
it had to be driven and it was actually put on a plane and flown to Texas and

679
00:37:01.261 --> 00:37:02.940
landed and then put it on another vehicle.

680
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:06.270
And these vehicles are big and they have to drive like they have to drive

681
00:37:06.271 --> 00:37:09.480
through first just to make sure there's clearance and all the roads.
But I dunno,

682
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:13.680
I don't know how much they tell the pilot of this ultimately $8 billion

683
00:37:13.681 --> 00:37:17.290
telescope of what it's actually they're flying and landing.
Um,

684
00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:18.323
I don't know about that.

685
00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.780
So what we're going to do is use the James Webb space telescope to look at

686
00:37:21.781 --> 00:37:25.620
atmospheres in the way I described and were people are busy trying to find

687
00:37:25.621 --> 00:37:30.060
planets like the Trappist planets and other planets to follow up and over at
Mit.

688
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:33.570
We have,
uh,
MIT led NASA mission that we're working on.

689
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:36.120
It's supposed to launch in March,

690
00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.490
2018 and the goal of this space telescope is to find planets,

691
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:42.950
find more transiting planets.
So we'll have that pool of planets orbiting,
um,

692
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:45.090
small stars whose atmospheres we can follow up.

693
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:46.920
And I want to make sure I leave time for questions.

694
00:37:46.921 --> 00:37:48.990
So I'm just going to speed through some photos.

695
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.990
Here's our kind of cardboard model just to show you how big it is.

696
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:56.640
The whole space telescope,
the whole,
um,
I guess spacecraft bus,

697
00:37:56.641 --> 00:37:57.990
it's not really that big actually.

698
00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.990
And inside of it are these four identical cameras.

699
00:38:00.991 --> 00:38:04.440
They're essentially glorified telephoto lenses that are very specially made to

700
00:38:04.441 --> 00:38:08.340
not have any vignetting and that temperature doesn't affect them very much.
Um,

701
00:38:08.341 --> 00:38:12.500
we put our smallest guy with the camera,
so it looks as big as it can.
It's,
um,

702
00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.520
aperture is really only about 10 centimeters.

703
00:38:14.521 --> 00:38:19.521
It has a giant baffle to block out like stray light from the moon or from Venus

704
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.400
or other planets.
And at the bottom there's a Lincoln lab,

705
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:27.180
Mit Lincoln lab made CCD detector.
Um,
I had some numbers.

706
00:38:27.181 --> 00:38:29.010
If you're interested in them,
I can share them with you.

707
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:33.390
But here's some real recent pictures and this is showing you down in Virginia at

708
00:38:33.391 --> 00:38:37.120
a place called orbital STK.
They're the ones making the spacecraft.
Boston.

709
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:39.040
Here you see a solar panel that's been mounted.

710
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:43.090
It's our only deployable and here's an antenna that's going to send data down to

711
00:38:43.091 --> 00:38:47.470
earth.
Over here you see one of the cameras being tested and if it's not being,

712
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:49.540
it's the vacuum chamber is open,

713
00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:54.250
but it's putting in a vacuum chamber to simulate space and it thermal cycles and

714
00:38:54.251 --> 00:38:57.440
later on gets vibration tested to show that it will perform as we expect you to

715
00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:59.440
space.
Because of course you have to build at room temperature.

716
00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:04.330
But in space this camera will be operating at a much colder temperature.
Now,

717
00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.490
um,
in this particular telescope,

718
00:39:06.491 --> 00:39:11.370
what's cool about it is it's going to observe a very big part of the sky.
Um,

719
00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.080
I did just have some simulated data to show you.

720
00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.110
Here's showing you one square degree,
a small patch of the sky.

721
00:39:17.111 --> 00:39:19.570
Like if you put your thumb up like that,
that's about one degree.

722
00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:23.500
And here's one of the CCD cameras that's actually 12 by 12.

723
00:39:23.501 --> 00:39:27.300
So that little one degree patches here and now 12 degrees is more like if you

724
00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.240
stretched your hand.
But each camera will actually have foresee cds.

725
00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:34.150
So now we're here 24 degrees by 24 degrees

726
00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:38.320
field of view from one test cam.

727
00:39:38.321 --> 00:39:41.110
Remember there are four cameras and for those who knows something about

728
00:39:41.111 --> 00:39:44.770
astronomy,
there would be a Ryan.
So now look how many stars were looking at.

729
00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:48.940
So we have a,
I wish we had a big huge data problem on our hands.
We don't though,

730
00:39:48.941 --> 00:39:52.210
because we can't downlink all the data all the time.
We take images,

731
00:39:52.211 --> 00:39:56.170
but we have to stack them on board so we can downlink the data through the deep

732
00:39:56.171 --> 00:40:00.190
space network,
that big radio dishes that received data from NASA missions.

733
00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.680
Each of these cameras now would be one square.

734
00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:06.160
So Ryan would fit in one of these squares and it would line up like this and

735
00:40:06.161 --> 00:40:09.880
we'll look at each patch of the sky and we will actually,
um,
tile it.

736
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.660
Looking at the southern hemisphere in the first year in the northern hemisphere

737
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:16.150
in the second year.
So that's kind of where we're at.

738
00:40:16.151 --> 00:40:19.270
We have this commission there.
And for the very last part of my talk,

739
00:40:19.271 --> 00:40:22.540
I just wanted to give you a glimpse of the future because in exoplanets,

740
00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.050
each ideas crazier than the last 10.
So these trends,

741
00:40:26.051 --> 00:40:29.980
that's our only the first part of a very long story,
right?
It requires,
um,

742
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:33.970
fortuitous alignment.
The planets or orbit has to be lined up.

743
00:40:33.971 --> 00:40:36.910
So the planet is going in front of the Star as seemed from your telescope.

744
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:41.020
But we're thinking as hard as we can tell from theory and observation,

745
00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:42.520
all stars have different alignments.

746
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.920
They're born out of the spherical cloud and they collapse to a desk.

747
00:40:44.921 --> 00:40:48.160
So whether they clap this way or this way or this way,
and the planet's,

748
00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:52.300
most of them are in their equity Loreal plane,
but not all of them.
And so,
yeah,

749
00:40:52.301 --> 00:40:53.650
I mean,
they're not all going to be doing that.

750
00:40:53.651 --> 00:40:58.450
And so we'd really like to be able to study the very nearest stars whose planets

751
00:40:58.451 --> 00:41:00.010
probably aren't translating for our earth.

752
00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:03.490
It's probability to transit would only be one in 200.

753
00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.700
So you'd have to look at 200 stars of all of them had an earth,

754
00:41:06.701 --> 00:41:11.020
you'd see a transiting earth.
So this new one,
this new method I want to end with,

755
00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:15.310
we call it star shade.
It's a giant,
especially shape screen here.

756
00:41:15.311 --> 00:41:18.820
It's showing you that it could launch together with a telescope and it would

757
00:41:18.821 --> 00:41:21.970
have these giant pedals unfurl from a stowed position.

758
00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:27.070
And here you see this thing would be tens of meters in diameter and it would

759
00:41:27.071 --> 00:41:32.071
actually have to fly from the telescope tens of thousands of kilometers and

760
00:41:32.261 --> 00:41:35.240
literally line up perfectly to,
um,

761
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:40.450
block out the star light so we can see the planets directly.
Um,

762
00:41:40.451 --> 00:41:44.500
and this idea actually came about in the 1960s by someone named Lyman Spitzer

763
00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:46.870
and through this weird,
like six degrees of separation thing.

764
00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:51.910
My new neighbor is related to him.
It was his sister's granddaughter.

765
00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:53.541
And yeah,

766
00:41:53.541 --> 00:41:58.240
it's every decade or so this idea has been revisited because it wasn't feasible

767
00:41:58.241 --> 00:42:00.490
in any way before.
In fact what you,
um,

768
00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.520
you can ask me in Q and a if you want to know why it's that shape and
everything.

769
00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:05.620
Cause I will run out of time to explain the details to you.

770
00:42:05.621 --> 00:42:09.850
But here's one of the pedals that would be about seven meters long and it has

771
00:42:09.851 --> 00:42:12.070
this very long shape here.

772
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:16.550
Hope they'll bring it back cause I have some more really cool pictures.

773
00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.540
And here's the star shade lab at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,

774
00:42:20.541 --> 00:42:23.210
California,
where you see they have smaller scale versions.

775
00:42:23.211 --> 00:42:25.400
They're working on what you call membrane management,

776
00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.790
how you can fold this thing up and deployed on.
So,

777
00:42:27.791 --> 00:42:30.230
and you can see they've been working on it a long time with a lot of different

778
00:42:30.231 --> 00:42:34.280
models.
Okay,
I'm going to end my talk with more of this software.

779
00:42:34.281 --> 00:42:39.200
I took another movie clip showing you our earth and all the stars with no

780
00:42:39.201 --> 00:42:42.620
planets around it.
And this is going to start to zoom away from Earth.

781
00:42:42.621 --> 00:42:44.120
I wanted you to,
you know,

782
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.820
to leave you with that thought that they're just so many stars out there,
uh,

783
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:52.110
with planets.
Um,

784
00:42:52.111 --> 00:42:55.680
we think we know of thousands of stars with planets now,
but honestly,

785
00:42:55.681 --> 00:43:00.600
our galaxy has hundreds of millions,
hundreds of billions of stars,

786
00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.380
and it's only the really nearby ones nearest to earth who that we can study

787
00:43:04.381 --> 00:43:08.430
who's atmospheres we can see and who we can really study in detail to find out

788
00:43:08.431 --> 00:43:10.350
whether there are signs of life on other worlds.

789
00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:15.300
And in case any of you wanted to know which part of our galaxy have we observed

790
00:43:15.301 --> 00:43:15.631
so far,

791
00:43:15.631 --> 00:43:19.410
really only the tiniest parts surrounding our own earth and some techniques.

792
00:43:19.411 --> 00:43:20.700
Let us go a little further away.

793
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:22.380
<v 3>Okay.</v>

794
00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:27.060
<v 2>So to summarize,
um,
thousands of planets are known to orbit nearby stars.</v>

795
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:31.890
Most of this information is limited sizes and Orbitz and some masses.

796
00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.550
These earth sized planets in the so called habitable zones of small stars are

797
00:43:35.551 --> 00:43:38.520
being detected like the Trappist ones that I dwelled upon.

798
00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:43.620
And then I gave you a little taste about how most of our exciting,
um,

799
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:47.850
observations remain in the future.
Thank you for your attention.

800
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:53.790
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

801
00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:59.970
<v 2>okay,
we have time for questions.
Thank you for the talk.
That was great.
Um,</v>

802
00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:05.340
my question is about whether you're able to infer the eccentricity of the orbits

803
00:44:05.341 --> 00:44:06.240
of these exoplanets.

804
00:44:06.241 --> 00:44:10.140
Because it strikes me that if you have a highly elliptical orbit that's far less

805
00:44:10.141 --> 00:44:12.900
likely to support life than something that's close to circular.
Yes,

806
00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:15.450
we can detect eccentricities.

807
00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:20.040
It's very hard to do with method I showed you because eccentric planets,

808
00:44:20.041 --> 00:44:20.251
you know,

809
00:44:20.251 --> 00:44:23.430
they'll go slowly and then when their closest sir and they go quickly and people

810
00:44:23.431 --> 00:44:24.660
try to find it based on the

811
00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:28.680
duration of the transit if it's asymmetric.

812
00:44:28.681 --> 00:44:32.010
But there is another method called rate of seat or the method and there are the

813
00:44:32.011 --> 00:44:35.640
planets are orbiting the common center of mass and we can measure actually the

814
00:44:35.641 --> 00:44:36.840
stars line of sight motion.

815
00:44:36.841 --> 00:44:39.450
And that technique does let you determine the centricity of it.

816
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:40.741
But you know what?

817
00:44:40.741 --> 00:44:44.070
It's a good question because we don't have all information for all stars.

818
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.740
Not all stars can we make all those observations for it.

819
00:44:46.741 --> 00:44:49.730
So it's possible that we find another planet and we don't know what sex

820
00:44:49.731 --> 00:44:50.564
centricity.

821
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.870
And so we may not know all the things we want to know to be able to put all the

822
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.480
puzzle pieces together.
But that said,

823
00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.450
people will always try to find a way to make it happen.

824
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.700
So not necessarily measure,
but that's fine.

825
00:45:02.701 --> 00:45:05.880
It can be eccentric and it can still have the right temperature.
Our Ocean,

826
00:45:05.881 --> 00:45:08.670
as you know,
cause we live in Boston,
right?
You know how summer happens.

827
00:45:08.671 --> 00:45:11.850
Well before we get the hottest part of the summer,
right?

828
00:45:11.851 --> 00:45:13.920
Because our ocean is a giant he capacitor.

829
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:17.520
So there's a lot of arguments people can make qualitatively and quantitatively

830
00:45:17.521 --> 00:45:20.460
about why we're not too worried about eccentricity.
Thank you.

831
00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:25.140
So two questions might be naive,
but what are those?
For a long time,

832
00:45:25.141 --> 00:45:27.030
if you watched earth for the longest time,

833
00:45:27.031 --> 00:45:30.780
you wouldn't see any oxygen cause there wasn't any.
Right.
It's only relatively,

834
00:45:30.781 --> 00:45:32.910
you know,
say the recent half of the history of the planet,
there's oxygen.

835
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:37.950
Can you detect the kinds of atmospheres you might have in the early part of

836
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.210
this?
Good question.
No,

837
00:45:39.211 --> 00:45:41.820
it's a great question and I'm glad you asked it because I had to gloss over.

838
00:45:41.821 --> 00:45:42.960
I glossed over a lot of things.
Yes,

839
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:47.490
we've only had oxygen prominent in our atmosphere for about half of our history.

840
00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:48.331
And you know what,

841
00:45:48.331 --> 00:45:50.820
there's some chance we never would have had it at all because there's the

842
00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:52.980
thought that some kind of life makes oxygen,

843
00:45:52.981 --> 00:45:56.010
other life uses it and maybe it should be closer to zero,
right?

844
00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:00.300
Zero leftover people.
Do we do everything we can or through time?

845
00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:03.600
What did it look like?
So we could have seen our earth,

846
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:07.830
we could have identified its atmosphere with the giant water vapor features,

847
00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:10.500
but we might not be able to see signs of life.

848
00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:14.110
Some people think our early earth was covered with antigens,

849
00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:18.330
methane producing bacteria.
Other people have found that,

850
00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:21.450
you know what,
ozone is a nonlinear indicator of oxygen.

851
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.690
You can have a tiny amount of oxygen and like quite a lot of ozone.

852
00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:28.290
So we're doing the best we can.
Um,
in the ideal world,

853
00:46:28.291 --> 00:46:31.140
we'd just look at the whole spectrum.
And then gay,
we'd have tons of data,

854
00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:35.250
but not sure.
So what you're trying to,
what you're not trying to say.

855
00:46:35.251 --> 00:46:38.220
But what I'll use that to communicate is that we could apply this where we just

856
00:46:38.221 --> 00:46:41.670
won't see signs of life even though it's there.
Another quick question,

857
00:46:41.671 --> 00:46:45.750
just so we have interesting ecosystems that are evolving the bottom of the ocean

858
00:46:45.751 --> 00:46:47.880
where you've got,
she'd coming up from the core.

859
00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:50.810
Do we know anything about the course of these planets anyway?
Hey Mike,

860
00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:52.140
try to figure that out.
Okay.

861
00:46:52.141 --> 00:46:55.590
Do we know anything about the course of these planets?
I'm not really actually,

862
00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:59.070
but we do still try to think about it and make models and consider all the

863
00:46:59.071 --> 00:47:03.860
possibilities.
Um,
but it's a little aside to what you're saying.
Um,
you know,

864
00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:06.210
people do think about this.
We try to understand the chorus.

865
00:47:06.211 --> 00:47:11.211
We've motivated high pressure physics experiments with these giant gas guns and

866
00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:15.750
giant other shock experiments that usually they use for,
believe it or not,

867
00:47:15.751 --> 00:47:18.060
arms control.
They usually use it for nuclear studies.

868
00:47:18.061 --> 00:47:20.460
So we are actually trying to understand what might be on the inside,

869
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:23.910
but it doesn't lend its way to a lot of observables.
Yes.

870
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.750
Thanks for speaking with us today.
It's super interesting topic.

871
00:47:27.751 --> 00:47:30.040
I'll never look at that.
Uh,
at your office building

872
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.400
<v 4>the same as I walk around Cambridge knowing what type of research is happening</v>

873
00:47:33.401 --> 00:47:35.650
there.
Um,
so I,

874
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:39.040
I love the concept of preparing us for this finding.
Um,

875
00:47:39.041 --> 00:47:41.290
I think that that's really exciting and it almost feels,
you know,

876
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:44.230
the way that you presented as being a inevitable,
I hope,

877
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:49.570
what type of chain reaction would happen in the scientific community,

878
00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:54.070
um,
really throughout our kind of earth,
uh,

879
00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:55.510
when life is discovered.

880
00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:56.551
<v 2>Well,</v>

881
00:47:56.551 --> 00:48:00.460
I think that question is a tough one and I think most people here would have

882
00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:01.900
their own answer that's different.

883
00:48:01.901 --> 00:48:05.140
But the best way that I see it happening is first of all,

884
00:48:05.141 --> 00:48:09.040
some kind of overhype like if you will Google,
you can Google that,
you know,

885
00:48:09.041 --> 00:48:12.250
the Trappist one discovery and see what it described.
And NASA,

886
00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:15.040
I was part of the presentation is like the independent commentator,

887
00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:18.070
they did a good job and they made it clear why it was exciting,

888
00:48:18.071 --> 00:48:20.980
why we're excited about it.
But sort of if you read all the news articles,

889
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:23.650
there's a bit of broken telephone going on,
right?
So I think that would happen.

890
00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:27.460
We see oxygen,
Yay,
this is great.
We found life.
The aliens are coming,

891
00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.530
but actually really it will take much longer.

892
00:48:29.531 --> 00:48:32.320
This is going to take at least a generation,
maybe two or even three.

893
00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:38.230
And I like to think back to the whole,
um,
the compare to can revolution,

894
00:48:38.231 --> 00:48:42.190
right?
People thought that our earth was the center of the universe and that

895
00:48:42.191 --> 00:48:44.740
everything,
the sun,
the stars,
the planets,
everything revolved around earth.

896
00:48:44.741 --> 00:48:46.090
But comparing because put forth,
no,

897
00:48:46.091 --> 00:48:47.590
actually our son should be the center of the universe.

898
00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:48.850
Everything's relevant around the sun.

899
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:52.630
And it took like 400 years before people finally just accepted that as just

900
00:48:52.631 --> 00:48:56.740
general knowledge because Newton had to come and make Newtonian mechanics and

901
00:48:56.741 --> 00:49:00.310
then Haley came and predicted Haley's comment would return after 75 years.

902
00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:02.380
And I'm not a historian or anything,

903
00:49:02.381 --> 00:49:04.780
but so probably people kind of all believed it eventually.

904
00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:07.960
But when Halley's comet returned 75 years later,
okay,
there it's a slam dunk.

905
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:12.010
Our son,
everything's orbiting the sun.
So I'm not sure what it will be like.

906
00:49:12.011 --> 00:49:14.080
Actually,
I'm not sure if the data will be believable.

907
00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:18.640
If we can rule out every scenario that is not a false positive.

908
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:22.240
So my best guess is we'll find it and there'll be some overhype then that will

909
00:49:22.241 --> 00:49:26.770
die down and then future generations of telescopes will do a better job and

910
00:49:26.771 --> 00:49:27.670
ruling it in her out.

911
00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:32.110
And I hope we'll find eventually lots of planets will receive these signs and we

912
00:49:32.111 --> 00:49:36.580
can put it all together.
Thank you.
It's not like the movie
arrival.

913
00:49:36.581 --> 00:49:38.800
How many of dealing with hearsay rival?
I liked to ride,

914
00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:42.340
I didn't like movies so much itself but I love the concept of the aliens came

915
00:49:42.341 --> 00:49:44.140
and they were so different from anything we could imagine.

916
00:49:44.141 --> 00:49:45.460
So it's not going to be obvious like that.

917
00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:49.130
<v 4>Hello.
Um,
I have a question.</v>

918
00:49:49.131 --> 00:49:51.650
You were talking about the amount of data that you collect versus what you can

919
00:49:51.651 --> 00:49:52.191
ship down.

920
00:49:52.191 --> 00:49:55.940
Can you give us an idea of what that ratio is and is there any possibility to do

921
00:49:55.941 --> 00:49:58.930
processing on the satellite?
The three centers?

922
00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:00.870
<v 2>That one first because that gives us like,</v>

923
00:50:00.871 --> 00:50:03.870
we never want a process on the satellite cause we love looking at all the data.

924
00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.140
And remember when I showed you all those,
it's going up.
It's going down.

925
00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:10.050
Like we love to know what's happened with all of the stars and all the areas of

926
00:50:10.051 --> 00:50:12.390
the data.
So let's see.
Um,

927
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:14.030
<v 4>okay</v>

928
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.863
<v 2>with tests,</v>

929
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:17.570
we're going to be orbiting this highly elliptical orbit and we're going to zoom

930
00:50:17.571 --> 00:50:20.240
by earth for a few days and we can download it at a rate of almost like a

931
00:50:20.241 --> 00:50:24.140
hundred megabytes per second.
But Kepler being that you know,

932
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:26.840
millions of my hundreds million miles away,
it's a lot less,

933
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:28.460
I want to say I know exactly what it like.

934
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.640
<v 5>Okay.</v>

935
00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.100
<v 2>A hundred or a thousand kilobits per second.</v>

936
00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:35.670
So we're just so limited right in the power we have to transmit the data and

937
00:50:35.671 --> 00:50:39.450
receive it.
So we're always trying to do that better.
Now in terms of total data,

938
00:50:39.451 --> 00:50:40.950
I want to say all of the Kepler data,

939
00:50:40.951 --> 00:50:43.530
cause they're not sending down all the images they're sending down postage

940
00:50:43.531 --> 00:50:45.540
stamps.
It might be like on the order of a terabyte.

941
00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:48.600
So really it's not collecting the data and storing it.

942
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:51.030
Sometimes people come up with ways they want to analyze it.
Like,

943
00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:54.060
how do you get rid of variable stars,
star spots?

944
00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.520
They want to use something they call Gaussian processes,

945
00:50:56.521 --> 00:50:58.500
which is extremely computationally intensive.

946
00:50:58.501 --> 00:51:00.150
So we dropped that and do something simpler.

947
00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.940
I don't know if that answers your question but at least it gives you some more

948
00:51:02.941 --> 00:51:03.730
numbers.

949
00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:04.563
<v 5>All right.
Thank you.</v>

950
00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:09.410
<v 6>Are there,
uh,
thank you again for the talk.
Uh,</v>

951
00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:13.030
if people want to get involved,
there's a,
a,

952
00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:18.000
a a citizen science project called project Panoply's that I'm involved with

953
00:51:18.001 --> 00:51:19.270
where uh,

954
00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:24.380
some folks at a k at the Keck telescope and Subaru in Hawaii are organizing this

955
00:51:26.851 --> 00:51:31.530
effort for people to make robotic telescopes that it'll do it ground based

956
00:51:31.531 --> 00:51:34.470
survey.
Nowhere nears deepest tests,
but uh,

957
00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:37.920
to find candidates for further investigation.

958
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:39.110
<v 2>Yeah,
I should have mentioned that.</v>

959
00:51:39.111 --> 00:51:41.090
There's so many ways to get involved if you want to,

960
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:44.580
if you want to get involved with test data and lend some brainpower or

961
00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:46.520
algorithms or something else,
let me know.

962
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:48.650
Just look me up on the internet and send me an email.

963
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:51.810
You can do this other one is amazing,
but Olivia Guianan,

964
00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:54.320
I'm an astronomer in his free time.

965
00:51:54.321 --> 00:51:56.550
He's put together a relatively low cost system.

966
00:51:56.570 --> 00:51:59.210
I want to say it's like $1,000 or something.
5,000 oh my gosh.

967
00:51:59.211 --> 00:52:02.180
It's a little higher than I thought it was going to be.
So you,
yourself or your,

968
00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:04.190
you know,
children's school or your astronomy club,

969
00:52:04.191 --> 00:52:07.400
you can actually get one of these and put it anywhere in your backyard or sent

970
00:52:07.401 --> 00:52:11.030
it to Hawaii and he's going to make this website where you can decide what you

971
00:52:11.031 --> 00:52:14.150
want to observe or he'll decide for you and you send amazing job with software.

972
00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.660
Usually we do aperture photometry,
we plunk a circle around our object,

973
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:21.170
but because of the blurring effects of earth's atmosphere and instruments,

974
00:52:21.171 --> 00:52:23.360
especially widefield ones,
that's not really cool.

975
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:27.320
So he's developed a brand new way to do this and do with software processing way

976
00:52:27.321 --> 00:52:30.980
better.
And he wants,
yeah,
it's a great thing.
I wanted to do this as well,

977
00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:34.200
and if I have enough time,
finally,
if you wanted to do the,
honestly,

978
00:52:34.201 --> 00:52:36.380
I'm not even making this up.
I know you're all at Google and everything,

979
00:52:36.381 --> 00:52:40.670
but the easiest way to get involved as crowdsourcing through planet hunters.org

980
00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:44.330
and you can literally just look through light curves and help crowdsourcing

981
00:52:44.331 --> 00:52:47.030
fashion identify drops in the light curve that are due to a planet.

982
00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:50.120
That's probably the easiest way but probably not as sophisticated as most of you

983
00:52:50.121 --> 00:52:50.954
can handle.

984
00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:56.140
<v 5>Oh,
hi.
I have a kind of nit picky uh,
data analysis question,</v>

985
00:52:56.141 --> 00:53:00.190
so I apologize for that.
When you were describing,
um,
the,

986
00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.560
how you actually go from the raw data to the process data,

987
00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:06.730
it seems to me like naively I would guess the best method to do that would be to

988
00:53:06.731 --> 00:53:11.500
pick a calibration star and just subtract that from it or something or some

989
00:53:11.501 --> 00:53:15.250
average like that as opposed to what you described,

990
00:53:15.251 --> 00:53:17.710
which was kind of sounded like making it up.

991
00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:18.821
<v 2>Well,</v>

992
00:53:18.821 --> 00:53:21.880
people do a lot of different things and I certainly did skip a lot of steps.

993
00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:26.160
There is a calibration processing that goes on based on people know about the

994
00:53:26.161 --> 00:53:27.180
instrument itself.

995
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:30.740
And that happens before usually people like me and other strong receipt.

996
00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:33.990
But I know what you're saying is that traditionally what we would do is we take

997
00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:37.830
an average of all non variant SARS that are behaving well and then we just sort

998
00:53:37.831 --> 00:53:38.521
of subtract out.

999
00:53:38.521 --> 00:53:41.940
But the thing is the detector is so big here and things happening on one part of

1000
00:53:41.941 --> 00:53:44.940
the detector are not necessarily exactly what's happening on the other part of

1001
00:53:44.941 --> 00:53:45.870
the dinner,
the detector.

1002
00:53:45.871 --> 00:53:49.200
So that sort of averaging isn't typically used in this regard.

1003
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.140
But it is a good question and there are lots of ways people are doing it and I

1004
00:53:52.141 --> 00:53:53.370
certainly didn't do it justice.

1005
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:57.400
<v 5>Can I go again?
Sure.
Yeah.
We have 36 seconds.
Okay.</v>

1006
00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:02.640
Uh,
the one that you were talking about at the very end with the shade that would

1007
00:54:02.641 --> 00:54:03.720
block the starshade?
Yeah,

1008
00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:09.360
that seems like it would only work in really specific circumstances.

1009
00:54:09.361 --> 00:54:12.330
Like you could set it up to look at one star.
Yes,
that's it.

1010
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:13.490
<v 2>Star shade itself.</v>

1011
00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:17.930
The star shade has a spacecraft attached to it and it has a lineup with the

1012
00:54:17.931 --> 00:54:21.050
telescope and so it actually has to move across the sky for each one.

1013
00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.080
And so when you think about star shade and what it can do,

1014
00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:27.500
it has a certain number of retargets so it can move around a certain number of

1015
00:54:27.501 --> 00:54:30.050
times,
which may be on the order of a hundred or 300 times.

1016
00:54:30.051 --> 00:54:32.700
And so you need to choose wisely how you're going to move across the sky and

1017
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:33.920
which targets you're going to look at.

1018
00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:35.533
<v 5>Yes.</v>

1019
00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:39.040
<v 2>Okay.
Well,
we're out of time and I just want to thank you for coming to my talk.</v>

1020
00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:43.430
<v 3>Okay.</v>
