1
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.660
It's my pleasure and honor to welcome professor John O'keeffe today.
Uh,

2
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.460
professor O'keefe is a neuroscientist and professor at the University College

3
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.930
London.
And two years ago,

4
00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:21.931
he won the Nobel prize in medicine for his discovery of place cells in the

5
00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:26.650
brain,
what a scientific American and the Nobel Prize Committee themselves,
uh,

6
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.360
referred to as the positioning system or the gps of the brain works at

7
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.500
University College London and being there for,
for many years.
Uh,

8
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.680
and we're very happy to have him in mountain view today to tell us about the

9
00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:40.540
neural basis of navigation.

10
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.890
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

11
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.100
<v 2>um,
so I,
I guess like most other scientists,</v>

12
00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:53.400
I've always wanted to come to Google,
uh,

13
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.390
and I guess we will have the view is that every scientist should visit Google,

14
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.680
uh,
at least once before they die.
So I'm very pleased to be here.

15
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.260
What I've been asked to tell you about,
and,
and,

16
00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:10.210
and of course what I should tell you about is,
is,
is the,

17
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.360
the brain basis of navigation,
how,

18
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.960
how do animals and ourselves,

19
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.310
humans find their way around an environment.
Um,

20
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.730
and what do we know about what mechanisms in the brain or for,

21
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.810
for doing that.
So my title is the hippocampus cognitive map,

22
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.250
neural basis of navigation.

23
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.480
And I'll tell you about how we think humans navigate.

24
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.800
And then I'll tell you about what we know about,
uh,
the areas of the brain,

25
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.870
mostly from work on,
on rodents,
which are involved in,
in this,
in this task.

26
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.580
Well,
let me start with a simple navigation problem.
Um,
it's,

27
00:01:48.581 --> 00:01:52.420
it's based on a,
um,
uh,
uh,
properly enough,

28
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.890
a Google map of the,
uh,
of the area around University College London.

29
00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.030
And,
um,

30
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.640
one problem one might pose is how does one Gash or,
uh,

31
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.110
what strategies can you use to get from,
um,
the closest,
uh,

32
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.820
underground station,
the closest subway station to university college,

33
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.290
which is here.
Um,
um,
how do you even get from there to,
um,

34
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.520
to university college,
London itself.
And,
um,

35
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.230
in,
in essence what we've been proposing for many,

36
00:02:26.231 --> 00:02:30.070
many years now is that there they're really two general brains strategies for

37
00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:33.310
doing this.
There are actually more,
but there are two general brain surgeries.

38
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.050
One is you come,
you use a route.
Um,
so you have a route strategy,

39
00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:42.790
which is essentially a concatenation of stimulus response,
uh,

40
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.320
strategies,
stimulus response behavior,
um,

41
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.780
where you go from one landmark to the next and each and mark you,

42
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:55.781
you perform a very specific behavior primarily coded in terms of what we call

43
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.570
egocentric spatial behavior.

44
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.730
How would turn left or right relative to the body axis.
So for example,

45
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.900
if you wanted to get here,
you might,
um,
go out the station,

46
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.850
walk along Euston road,
um,
and then turn right at Gower Street,

47
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.900
um,

48
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.380
and then go about a hundred meters down Gary Street and you'll see the entrance

49
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:21.770
to UCL and then you enter that.
So that's what we'd call a root strategy.
Um,

50
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.220
and I'm not going to tell you very much more about that.

51
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:26.200
We think that's a coded in a,

52
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:30.040
in a very different part of the brain that we in our colleagues have been

53
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:34.870
studying for many,
many years.
An alternative way of finding your way around,
uh,

54
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.310
the world is to have a kind of a mental representation,

55
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.740
which fulfills all of the properties of having a map,
uh,

56
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.880
in your brain or a gps system.
Um,

57
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.450
and what you would do there is you would have some sort of a grid like
structure,

58
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.870
which would lay out,
uh,
the,
uh,
the,
uh,

59
00:03:55.871 --> 00:04:00.410
the various geography of,
of the local area.
And you would have,
um,

60
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.610
representations of many of the,
the,
the,
the local landmarks.

61
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.850
First thing you probably would have as the Wellcome trust,

62
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:10.900
which is one of the major funders,
uh,
of neurobiological research.

63
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:12.820
You'd have a landmark,

64
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:17.200
you'd have a representation of the college and to tell other various buildings.

65
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:22.120
What that would allow you to do is to then not only take essentially the same

66
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.030
route that you,
um,

67
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.450
that you took before you would want to go from this location in your map to this

68
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:29.980
location.
Um,

69
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.300
and one way to do it will be to follow exactly the same path that you would take

70
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:37.330
if you were using a root strategy.
But importantly,

71
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.890
it gives you a much greater flexible,
uh,
ability to,
to,

72
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.360
to go from one place to another.

73
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.650
So let's say that normally you would use that mapping structure to move along

74
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:51.840
Gow Euston road and then take the right down Gary.

75
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.580
But at this point you find that as,

76
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:59.380
it's not an unusual chemistry has been blocked.
Uh,
they're digging up the,

77
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:02.530
the,
the pavement,
the digging up the street.
Um,

78
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.360
and what the map will allow you to do,

79
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:07.540
which the root system won't allow you to do,
is to say,
oh,

80
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.990
I have an alternative strategy I just carry on along Euston square around Euston

81
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.900
Road,
past Easton Square station.
And then I make a right on Gordon Street,

82
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.200
come down and go in through the backdoor.
So it gives you a map,

83
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:23.290
gives you something that you don't get from a series of roots.

84
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.520
It gives you the ability to go from one place and environment to another

85
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.800
flexibly.
And that's a very,
very powerful,
uh,

86
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.320
ability because it enables you to cope with,
uh,
all sorts of alterations in,

87
00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:38.050
in the environment.
So that's what we're going to tell you about.

88
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.070
I'll tell you about how we think we know which parts of the brain,

89
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.160
a human brain and animal brain are involved in representing that structure and

90
00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:52.220
how they,
uh,
that that representation is used to,
to,
to actually,
um,

91
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.350
to navigate.
So let's start then with a question which was actually very,

92
00:05:57.351 --> 00:06:00.980
very difficult one to solve for for many,
many years.

93
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.430
How do you study navigation in reasonably large scale environments?

94
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.950
Um,
in humans and for many years,
uh,

95
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.920
psychologists would routinely studies spatial representations in spatial memory

96
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.900
by having a desktop,
putting a few objects on it,
and ask the subject,

97
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.990
the person to sort of remember where the objects were,

98
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:26.900
what their relationship was in from our point of view.

99
00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:30.170
That doesn't actually capture the essence of the same system,

100
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:33.820
which is involved from going from one place in the world to another.
Um,

101
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.510
so in order to do that,

102
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.510
we had to essentially wait for two technical developments.

103
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.420
One was the development of imaging technologies,

104
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.850
first pet and then Fmni,

105
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.580
which enabled us to look at active brain activations,
uh,

106
00:06:47.581 --> 00:06:51.050
under controlled circumstances.
And the other,

107
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.790
since people who are in a brain scanner can't actually move around the world,

108
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.450
uh,
was to have some way in which we could allow them to do that.

109
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.000
And that was the development of virtual reality technologies.

110
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.970
And they first became really available to scientists.

111
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.440
They had been around for a long time,

112
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.150
but you had to be in Hollywood or in a big automotive company to be able to

113
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:12.680
afford them.
And it was only in the,

114
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.710
in the middle part of the 1990s that all these first person shoot them up games,

115
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.630
uh,
became available and you could buy one for 10,
20 bucks.

116
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.680
So all of a sudden it became available to us impoverished scientists.
Um,

117
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.350
so we realized that if we could use the basic structure of the game,

118
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.210
and this involves getting rid of a lot of aspects of the game.
In this case,

119
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:43.100
the game game is a Duke Nukem that that would give us a very nice environment,

120
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.390
which will get then use the study,
uh,
to study,
uh,
navigation.

121
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.380
And Neil Burgess,
who is at my close colleague for many,
many years,

122
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:53.600
who has a phd in mathematical physics,

123
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.530
looked at me one day and I looked at him,
he said,
no,
no,

124
00:07:57.531 --> 00:07:58.610
you're not going to ask me to do,

125
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.380
which was to actually essentially take apart the game and get rid of all of the

126
00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:05.750
bits and bobs that we didn't want.
Get rid of the guns,

127
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.280
get rid of all the monsters,

128
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.330
get rid of all the naked women and all those sorts of politically,
uh,

129
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.150
objection of things and leave us with an environment which is actually quite

130
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.920
expensive,
extensive environment.
This is the plan view of the environment.
Um,

131
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.810
and it's about 70 by 70 meters.
People can learn their way around it.

132
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:28.250
It has all sorts of features.
Um,
and,
and it's actually based on a us,

133
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:33.190
a rundown suburb of La.
So you get things like general,

134
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.100
like movie theaters.
Um,
and you can see in the distance here,

135
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:41.840
if you look carefully,
you can see,
uh,
uh,
a burning trash can,
um,
as you'd expect.

136
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:46.600
And there are things like it go inside the cinnamon,
see pictures.
Uh,

137
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:51.800
this is a blinking eye,
uh,
which is very avant garde motion picture.

138
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:56.610
I won't tell you what the original picture was.
Um,
and then if you,
if there's,

139
00:08:56.611 --> 00:08:58.650
there are things for,
to see what everybody's tastes,

140
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:01.920
you can play billiards or pool.
If you're in America,

141
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.010
you can go and get a drink and so on and so forth.
But importantly,

142
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.760
what you have is you have an environment where,
um,

143
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.160
you can move between any two locations by lots of different routes.

144
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.360
So if you want to go from this location and you're told,

145
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.410
showing a picture of the,
uh,
another location,
you can either go directly,

146
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:24.060
you can go secure this way.
There are lots of independent paths you can take.
So,

147
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.980
um,
with that,
uh,
those two technologies,

148
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.950
Eleanor Maguire at the Ucla,
at Queen Square,
um,
and,
and,

149
00:09:33.951 --> 00:09:36.390
and several of us actually ran the experiment,

150
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.400
which is to see what parts of the brain are activated by this,

151
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:45.000
this type of navigation using a cognitive representation.

152
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:48.270
So you let people find their way around,
explore the environment.

153
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.060
An exploration by the way is,
is a,
is,

154
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:54.240
is a strategy for building our cognitive representation.

155
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.650
You don't explore as far as we can see an environment because you're hungry or

156
00:09:58.651 --> 00:09:59.910
thirsty or anything else.

157
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.110
You don't do it because you're trying to re reduce an immediate biological need.

158
00:10:04.111 --> 00:10:08.010
You do to get a representation and a lot of learning in our view,

159
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:12.320
it takes that form.
So once they have this map of the,

160
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:13.770
the environment,

161
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.460
then you can do things like ask them to go from one place to another using that

162
00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:20.670
cognitive representation as opposed to other kinds of representations.

163
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.200
And what we found to our delight,
because as I'll tell you in a minute,

164
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:29.350
we had always suspected that the human hippocampus as with,
uh,

165
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:34.370
the animal hippocampus is involved in this kind of of a navigation is that this

166
00:10:34.561 --> 00:10:38.530
area here,
and I'll show you a little bit more of the anatomy of this area,
um,

167
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.820
was one of the two places in the brain that's activated under those

168
00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:44.940
circumstances.
Um,
and this is,

169
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:49.350
this area here is in effect the hippocampus as I of show you show you.

170
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.910
And the other part of the brain is a part in the parietal cortex up here.

171
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:58.080
Um,
so as you can see,
this part is right inside the temporal lobes here.

172
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.390
We're inside the temples.
The other part was up here,

173
00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:01.680
which is not shown in this slide.

174
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.580
And those are the two areas now which we think are primarily involved in

175
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:09.090
navigating in,
in,
in,
in,
in,
uh,
in,
in environments.

176
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.560
Interesting.
Um,
it's not just that that part of the brain is activated,

177
00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:18.420
but the degree of activation,
in this case it was a,
a pet scan.

178
00:11:18.421 --> 00:11:22.170
So it's the amount of blood flow to that part correlates with how good the

179
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:25.770
navigation is.
So if you have a,
for example,

180
00:11:25.771 --> 00:11:28.250
if you asked the subject to go from ATB,

181
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:32.910
then of course they can go directly or they can go buy this very long circuitous

182
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:35.190
route or they can actually get lost.

183
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.470
And if you then take that path and quantify it,

184
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.050
it essentially,
in terms of heading direction,

185
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.870
some Dover over a whole bunch of headings,

186
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:47.880
directions or do you find is there is a very good correlation between the

187
00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:50.640
activation of this part of the brain,
the hippocampus,

188
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.650
and how good the navigation is.

189
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:57.190
So it looks as though people who are using their hippocampus and working harder,

190
00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:01.860
uh,
are,
are,
are better at navigating.
Um,
as a follow on from that,
uh,

191
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.830
Eleanor and her,
uh,
her,
uh,
student,
uh,
you go spears,
um,

192
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.400
started to think about what are their,

193
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:13.630
any navigators around natural navigators and can we use them for our experiments

194
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:14.920
and are there any other games?

195
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:20.130
So they came up with a newly developed game which was developed I think by Sony,

196
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.550
um,
in which they could actually,
um,
you can navigate,

197
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:28.480
you can drive a taxi cab around,
uh,
around all of London.

198
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.240
So it's a represent very,
very graphic representation of,

199
00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:33.490
of most of the streets of,
at least in a London.

200
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.950
And here are a couple of screenshots from that.

201
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:38.680
And you can see that if you ask somebody to navigate,

202
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.110
I start from this part of London and go to the tense on a certain part of the

203
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:48.400
Thames,
you get a path that looks something like this.
Interestingly enough,

204
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:54.070
um,
what you can ask then the,
the,
the subject,
in this case,
the taxicab driver,

205
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.010
um,
is to actually,
uh,
uh,

206
00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.270
w you can ask which parts of the brain are,

207
00:12:59.271 --> 00:13:02.520
have become active at certain parts of that navigation.
Um,

208
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.520
and you can effectively read their mind or flying.

209
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:08.710
So what you do is you re you record the,
the,
the,

210
00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:13.280
the behavior that they're driving from one place to another.
And then,
um,

211
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.240
after that and you look at the,

212
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:20.300
the brain activations and after that you replay the video of their,

213
00:13:20.981 --> 00:13:24.010
of their,
um,
of their route and you say,
okay,

214
00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:27.840
what were you thinking at the time in which you are dislocation?

215
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.270
And very interesting,
Lee,

216
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.960
it turns out that having a spatial framework,
uh,

217
00:13:34.961 --> 00:13:39.250
on which to lay down memories makes it very easy,
at least in the short term,

218
00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:42.130
to recall those memories.
So the cab driver would say,
boom,

219
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.610
I was thinking about where am I going to go?

220
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:49.240
So I was planning my route at the bit and then he's driving.
He said,
well,

221
00:13:49.241 --> 00:13:52.630
I'm driving along one of the main routes so I don't need to think too hard about

222
00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:56.320
that.
Uh,
and I'll look,
this guys is coming out of the side corner here.

223
00:13:56.321 --> 00:13:58.630
I Better Watch out.
Oh,
I didn't expect to see that.

224
00:13:58.631 --> 00:14:01.780
So there's a whole narrative that goes with it and they can remember that

225
00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:03.700
narrative with extreme detail.

226
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.420
And then so you can then use that to map onto the activation.
Not only that,

227
00:14:07.421 --> 00:14:10.350
it became this part of the whole brain and see which parts of the brain are,

228
00:14:10.351 --> 00:14:13.210
are actually activate.
And to make a long story short,

229
00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:16.720
what you see is that they have a campus,
at least in these circumstances,

230
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.960
is actually activated maximumly when the Cabbie is actually planning the road.

231
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.180
So when you get into the cab and say,
I want to go here,

232
00:14:25.181 --> 00:14:29.740
he plans the roof and then he doesn't need to work the hippocampus so hard.

233
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.380
And as I say,
you can look at all sorts of other things,

234
00:14:32.381 --> 00:14:35.620
which part of the brain is activated when you're actually seeing somebody coming

235
00:14:35.621 --> 00:14:38.220
out or something unexpected.
Anyway,

236
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:43.230
that of course leads onto one of Eleanor Maguire is most famous studies was

237
00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:48.730
realizing that you got expert navigators in the form of London.

238
00:14:48.731 --> 00:14:52.940
Taxi cab drivers means that you could do things like say,
well,

239
00:14:52.941 --> 00:14:57.290
is there any part of their brain which is actually particularly involved in this

240
00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:00.870
expertise?
And it is an expertise.
Uh,
uh,

241
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:05.780
the Google is putting,
its changing as it's doing this.

242
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:07.640
Lots of things.
It's changing landscape.

243
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.000
But until recently to become a London taxi cab driver,

244
00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:16.510
you had to actually learn all about 25,000 streets in London and how you went

245
00:15:17.391 --> 00:15:21.810
from one street to another.
Um,
which is quite a formidable,
um,
uh,

246
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.390
mental representation.

247
00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:26.840
It takes about three years on average to acquire what's called the knowledge.

248
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.630
And these people really can do that and they cannot only do that,

249
00:15:29.631 --> 00:15:34.250
but they can actually modify their route on the basis of a daily information,

250
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:38.810
uh,
traffic,
uh,
information and things like that.
Um,

251
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.780
I don't want to say anything about my original hometown,

252
00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:45.230
but I was a cab driver in New York and I can assure you I didn't have anything

253
00:15:45.231 --> 00:15:48.860
like that,
uh,
knowledge of,
of,
of New York at the time.

254
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.720
And when you do that,

255
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:55.490
what you find interestingly enough is that if you look at this part of the
brain,

256
00:15:55.491 --> 00:15:59.060
the hippocampus,
it's larger in taxicabs,
particularly the posterior part,

257
00:15:59.061 --> 00:16:03.650
the part towards the back,
which is the part where we think is very,
very,

258
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.150
uh,
importantly engage in,
in navigation is larger in,
in,

259
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:13.130
in cab drivers than it is in,
in,
in,
in,
uh,
average people,
uh,
in the,

260
00:16:13.131 --> 00:16:17.390
uh,
in the population.
And SPUs interestingly enough,
both larger than you,

261
00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:21.810
like you find in,
in,
in,
in bus drivers,
um,

262
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.970
who of course go around city streets but don't have to exercise this,

263
00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.300
this complex cognitive ability.
Um,

264
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:35.630
and interesting that the longer someone has been a cab driver,

265
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.110
the larger the part of the brain becomes.

266
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.750
So it's not as though you're born,
um,

267
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.580
with a large hippocampus and then you become a cab driver.

268
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.580
It actually is that you're using it in some aspect of this.

269
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:53.300
We're not sure exactly what aspect of the hippocampus represented in these,

270
00:16:53.301 --> 00:16:57.590
in these,
uh,
anatomical studies.
And when people stop being cab drivers,

271
00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:02.600
then it relaxes back to through the average average size.
Uh,

272
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:07.370
and that that's shown here.
Time is cab driver in months and,
and,

273
00:17:07.371 --> 00:17:11.000
and the the size here.
Okay.
So,
um,

274
00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:16.460
we're pretty sure this part of the brain in humans is essential for the kind of

275
00:17:16.461 --> 00:17:18.230
cognitive navigation that were interested in.

276
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:20.630
It looks as though it's doing other things as well.

277
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:25.050
And I'll come back to that if,
if,
if we want to discuss that at the end.
Eh,

278
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.610
it looks as though it's more generally involved in what we call episodic memory,

279
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.940
the ability you have for remembering what you do in a particular location at a

280
00:17:34.371 --> 00:17:38.000
particular time,
uh,
in,
in the past and,

281
00:17:38.001 --> 00:17:41.690
and so you can see what we're,
what the relationship is.

282
00:17:41.691 --> 00:17:44.510
If you had a spatial memory system and then you add it in,

283
00:17:44.511 --> 00:17:46.430
say time and a few other things,

284
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.560
that would be the way in which you would build up a more general memory system.

285
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:54.480
Okay.
So let me tell you a little bit about anatomy.
This is the hippocampus,

286
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:59.210
the,
uh,
the old anatomists in the 16th centuries.

287
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.420
What this looked like a sea horse,
and that's why they call it the hippocampus.

288
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:08.670
Uh,
some of them thought it looked like a worm on its back.
Uh,
it's,

289
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:12.390
uh,
as you know,
most anatomical structures were named,
uh,

290
00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:16.380
with the Latin or Greek,
um,
uh,
name for the,

291
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.870
what the structure looked like in gross anatomy.
Um,

292
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:25.270
this is the hippocampus in humans.
This is the hippocampus in,

293
00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:29.650
in animals.
Um,
and interestingly enough,
if you look at the,
the,

294
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:30.420
uh,

295
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.230
the structure of the self cellular structure of Sido architect tonic structure

296
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.640
of the,
uh,
the,
uh,
this area in lots of different animals,

297
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.780
it looks more or less the same.
We are sure that it does.

298
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.500
There are additional things that it does,
but at least on the first pass,

299
00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:50.140
it looks like it has the same structure.
So you can look at it in a,
in a,

300
00:18:50.141 --> 00:18:53.490
in a rodent or in a,
in a primate or,
or in human beings.

301
00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:57.570
And it has the same structure.
And we know quite a bit,
uh,

302
00:18:57.571 --> 00:19:00.840
about the detailed structure of it.
I won't go into any detail.

303
00:19:00.841 --> 00:19:05.430
We know about the cells that make up the,
the,
the,
the cell layers.
Um,

304
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:08.520
and,
uh,
we know about the interconnections with the,

305
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.640
between those cells and also between those cells and other areas in the brain,

306
00:19:14.191 --> 00:19:18.330
which are afferent to the,
um,
to the hippocampus.
And specifically,

307
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:23.290
if we look at this area here,
this color coded map,
uh,
this is the,
uh,

308
00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.460
the hippocampus.
And interestingly enough,

309
00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:29.840
there are a whole bunch of structures around the hippocampus.
Um,

310
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.540
the antiviral Cortex,
the speculum Prisa Bacon,

311
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.460
which primarily in send information into the hippocampus and they'll be relevant

312
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.790
in a second.
As I tell you what the cells in these different parts of the brain,

313
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:42.810
um,
do.

314
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:49.560
So how do we go about finding out what sells in a part of the brain?
Uh,
do,

315
00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.550
um,
in rodents,
well,
um,
for many years now we in many,

316
00:19:53.551 --> 00:19:57.160
many others have been using the following techniques.
Um,

317
00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:02.300
what we do is we place electrodes into a part of the structure under deep

318
00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:07.830
anesthesia and then allow the animal to recover from the anesthetic.

319
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.490
And the electrodes are such that we can place them,

320
00:20:11.491 --> 00:20:16.491
we can move them into areas of the cell cell structure of the neuro structure so

321
00:20:18.121 --> 00:20:22.050
that we can record the activity of single cells,
um,

322
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.730
as the animal is engaging in lots of different behaviors.
Um,

323
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:31.810
and what we find,
this is a typical exam experiment,
um,

324
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:35.850
and the animals running around in a very simple box.
In this case a square box.

325
00:20:35.851 --> 00:20:37.380
It could be a circle of acts.
Uh,

326
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:40.890
we were watching where the animal is with an overhead camera so that we can

327
00:20:40.891 --> 00:20:43.050
locate its position,
say 10 times per second.

328
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:47.010
And we can also say where the animal is when the cell becomes active.

329
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.530
And what we find is that it sells in various parts of the hippocampus,

330
00:20:53.531 --> 00:20:58.430
but particularly in this what's called the ca one subfield,
um,

331
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.350
become active when the animal goes to a specific location.

332
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:07.390
And that really interested in why the animal goes there so much or even what it

333
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:10.530
does there,
they're interested in where he does this thing.

334
00:21:10.531 --> 00:21:15.250
So if you record in Sean Black here,
all of the,

335
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:19.720
so if you record in a situation like this where the animal is foraging around

336
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:23.710
looking for bits of food thrown into the environment,
uh,
randomly,

337
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.450
what you get behaviorally is a coverage of the entire environment.

338
00:21:28.451 --> 00:21:29.860
So as shown in the black years,

339
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.560
and we're talking about 10 minutes worth of recording,

340
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.800
and what you find is that these cells are of silent most of the time,

341
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.760
but that when the animal goes to a particular part of the box,

342
00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:40.780
the cell becomes active,

343
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:45.760
it wakes up and it shows this standard activation patterns.

344
00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:50.270
And you can use a heat map that represent that activation where the,
the,
the,

345
00:21:50.271 --> 00:21:54.340
the horror colors represent the higher levels of activation.
So this,
for example,

346
00:21:54.341 --> 00:21:59.341
is a cell which fires doesn't become active in most of the box but then becomes

347
00:21:59.951 --> 00:22:03.370
active when the animal goes here and particularly when it goes to this location

348
00:22:03.371 --> 00:22:04.204
here.

349
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:09.300
So when you see that immediately strikes you that this is a cell which is

350
00:22:10.151 --> 00:22:13.690
telling the rest of the nervous system where the animal is.

351
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.690
Interestingly enough,
um,
it was very obvious right from the beginning,

352
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.830
even in the 1970s that,
uh,

353
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.840
the cells had very interesting properties.
So for example,

354
00:22:25.841 --> 00:22:26.860
if you take a cell here,

355
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.980
recording this cylinder and you record it and you see where the cell fires,

356
00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.950
if the fire's here virtually in the center of the cylinder,

357
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:41.210
if you then break apart that Dataset so that it,
uh,

358
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:46.630
you represent what the cell does when the animal is heading north or South or

359
00:22:46.661 --> 00:22:51.160
east or west through that particular area,
then you get these pictures here.

360
00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.360
In other words,

361
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.590
it cell is quite happy to fire if the animal is running north or south or east

362
00:22:56.591 --> 00:22:59.590
or west.
From a,
in an environment like this,

363
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.990
it varies a bit with the environment in an environment like this.

364
00:23:01.991 --> 00:23:06.640
It looks as though the sales representing the location and not,
uh,

365
00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:11.320
something about,
uh,
some particular stimulus in the external world.

366
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.520
Um,
equally importantly,

367
00:23:15.521 --> 00:23:19.690
if you record from that one,
but lots of these cells,
in this case,

368
00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:24.010
32 of them at the same time and ask how did they differ from each other?

369
00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:29.011
What you find is that each one has one or sometimes two preferred locations,

370
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.600
but they're all different.

371
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:36.600
So if you just look at the activity of 32 cells and then we're talking about a

372
00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:39.560
small subsection of,
uh,

373
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.130
hundreds of thousands of cells in this part of the brain

374
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:47.060
and you line up the fields,
they're not lined up in the brain,

375
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:50.900
but if you wind them up,
uh,
in,
in,
in,
in,
in the representation,

376
00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.550
would you see,
is that wherever the animal is,
if it's,
for example,

377
00:23:55.551 --> 00:23:59.960
in the northwest corner on the northeast corner or running between the two
areas,

378
00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:04.100
there is a cell which represent that location.
And similarly coming down the,

379
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.400
the west side or the east side or their wrongs and even in the center.

380
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.880
So very quickly you get the impression that the ensemble of cell activity is

381
00:24:14.001 --> 00:24:16.010
actually representing the whole of an environment.

382
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.730
And that's duplicated over and over again across many,

383
00:24:19.731 --> 00:24:24.710
many cells in the hippocampus.
Well,
if you see that it's,

384
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:29.090
I guess in retrospect,
it doesn't take a lot of imagination to say,
well,

385
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:34.190
maybe this is the part of the brain which forms a map like representation of the

386
00:24:34.191 --> 00:24:39.110
salt that I told you about right at right at the beginning.
Um,
and so,
um,

387
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:44.000
uh,
looking at lots of the early literature on the effects of damage in the

388
00:24:44.001 --> 00:24:48.800
hippocampus and,
and other,
uh,
things that we knew back in the 1970s,

389
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.960
um,
a chap called Lynch,

390
00:24:50.961 --> 00:24:54.800
a Dell who is now in Arizona and myself suggested just that at this part of the

391
00:24:54.801 --> 00:24:58.350
brain is in some sense a cognitive map.
Um,

392
00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:03.520
now it turns out if you think about it having a bunch of place representation's

393
00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:08.270
having a bunch of representations of the sort,
I just showed you where the,
the,

394
00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.030
the,
the brain is sorta signaling where the animal is,

395
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.580
isn't enough to produce a map.
A map requires something more.
Uh,

396
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:20.010
and specifically the map requires not only information about places but also the

397
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.170
distances and directions.

398
00:25:21.171 --> 00:25:26.171
It needs to have in one representation a set of vectors which actually called

399
00:25:27.951 --> 00:25:32.360
not for just the location of the animal is currently,
uh,
occupying.

400
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:33.650
But what,

401
00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:38.030
how that location is related to other locations in the environment.

402
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:42.560
You need to know the distance and direction between different places to have a

403
00:25:42.561 --> 00:25:46.550
map.
And it's that it's second type of representation,

404
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.530
which is what gives the system the power,

405
00:25:48.531 --> 00:25:53.400
which enables you to move from one place to another.
So for example,
um,

406
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.160
if you had a representation of,

407
00:25:55.161 --> 00:25:59.900
of a place a and you knew that you wanted to go to place B,

408
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.510
perhaps you have stored memory that there was food there,

409
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:07.280
then the system should be able to generate this,
this factory and that,

410
00:26:07.281 --> 00:26:10.400
send that to the motor system and drive the system,
uh,
in the,

411
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:13.670
in the right direction.
However,
if this path is blocked,

412
00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:19.030
then the system should equally well be able to generate any set of vectors which

413
00:26:19.731 --> 00:26:20.960
would get you to the right plate.

414
00:26:20.961 --> 00:26:25.961
So you will be able to do simple vector Algebra and know that Ac plus CB catch

415
00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.650
you back to the same place.

416
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:31.610
So that was the idea and that's the idea that we and many others have been

417
00:26:31.611 --> 00:26:33.290
pursuing for a long time now.

418
00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.580
And I'll show you the evidence from at least behavioral studies,

419
00:26:37.581 --> 00:26:39.920
which suggests that that might be the right thing.
Okay,

420
00:26:39.921 --> 00:26:43.680
well if you make a specific prediction about uh,

421
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:48.000
the fact that an area has these kinds of properties and the first thing you do

422
00:26:48.001 --> 00:26:51.630
is you go looking for the other kinds of cells.
So if you think that the,

423
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.070
in addition to places,

424
00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.280
there should be representations of distances and directions,

425
00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.900
then you should go look for them.

426
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:03.180
And I spent a lot of time looking for these other cells in the hippocampus,

427
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.640
the place that I've just in hippocampus proper and didn't find them or at least

428
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.600
only found little slight hints of it.

429
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.200
Some other people in particularly a man called Jim Rohn in,
in,

430
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:18.570
in New York went looking in those other areas,

431
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:23.040
those areas that are associated with the hippocampus and are very tightly

432
00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:27.870
connected.
And found both,
uh,
he found the first kind of representation,

433
00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.870
which is a direction representation of directions.

434
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:35.100
And now recently the Moses have found representations of what we originally

435
00:27:35.101 --> 00:27:36.060
thought was distance.

436
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.060
So I'll tell you a little bit about those and then I'll tell you a little bit

437
00:27:39.061 --> 00:27:43.080
about how we use behavioral studies to try to understand how the system works.

438
00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:49.200
So I've shown you this map already and what we now know on the basis of some of

439
00:27:49.201 --> 00:27:54.201
our work but mostly work in other laboratories is that these place cells that

440
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:59.490
coming up,
um,
which are found mostly in the hippocampus here,
um,

441
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.653
uh,

442
00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:05.580
and which are representing the animals location or showing the heat map and

443
00:28:05.581 --> 00:28:07.420
don't care as shown in this polar plot,

444
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:12.150
which represents how the cell responds to heading direction.
Um,

445
00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:15.450
they're found mostly in,
in,
in the hippocampus proper.

446
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.650
But if you want these other cells and you have to look at outside the

447
00:28:19.651 --> 00:28:23.940
hippocampus proper and these associated areas here,
um,
and when you do that,

448
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.790
if you look for example in this area here,
the pre speculum,

449
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.300
then you find these head direction cells.
You find cells here,

450
00:28:30.301 --> 00:28:33.930
which don't particularly care as shown in heat map where the animal is,

451
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:38.430
but care very,
very,
uh,
very much about the,
the,
the heading direction.

452
00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:42.930
So that is a cells which fire whenever the animal is looking in a particular

453
00:28:42.931 --> 00:28:47.100
direction,
regardless of where it is an environment.
And uh,

454
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:52.490
and another kind of cell that was discovered by the Moses and Moses lab,
uh,

455
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:57.500
are these grid cells which have not just a single location where the cell fires

456
00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:01.520
but are a multiple set of locations.
And interestingly,
those,

457
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:05.720
the peaks of those firing pattern are located in what looks like,
um,

458
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.180
either depending on your,
your,
uh,
predilection,

459
00:29:09.181 --> 00:29:14.130
either a hexagonal structure or a,
an equal lateral triangular structure.

460
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:16.800
So if you look at it as structure of firing like that,

461
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.140
whereas the animal goes around the environment,
the cell goes Burp,

462
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:26.370
burp at equally spaced locations.
Then your first,

463
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.330
and I have to say,

464
00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:32.540
our first assumption was that this is something telling the brain and the animal

465
00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.880
about the actual distances.
It's going in a particular direction.
I,
it's a,

466
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.680
it's a metric system for cognitive map.

467
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.450
We think that recent work in our own lab and other labs are probably going to

468
00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:50.410
modify that overall impression of bitch because we see we can distort this,

469
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:55.380
this grid structure,
um,
in,
in ways that won't have time to tell you.
Um,

470
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.970
but you will,
that means in their other selves,

471
00:29:57.971 --> 00:30:01.840
I won't go into the boundary cells,
which more or less signal lead the distance,

472
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.760
the distance from walls of the environment.

473
00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:08.620
But we think now that we have all of the types of representations that we need

474
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:12.850
to create a cognitive mapping structure.
Okay.

475
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:18.030
And I just want to now spend the next five minutes or so telling you about just

476
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.140
how we go about addressing some of the other questions about,
about these cells.

477
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.670
So for example,
um,
as frank said,
I spent,
uh,

478
00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:31.470
quite a bit of time at Grumman aircraft making,
making airplanes.
Really,

479
00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.630
I wouldn't make too much,
but I was kind of a junior engineer at the time.

480
00:30:34.631 --> 00:30:38.000
It was early in my career.
I was studying engineering at Nyu.
Um,

481
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.380
but even then we knew that for example,
um,

482
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.360
in addition to using the,
the,

483
00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:48.940
the environmental cues that you can see from a low flying airplanes you can use,

484
00:30:48.941 --> 00:30:53.941
you can use inertial navigation systems to calculate how far in a particular

485
00:30:53.981 --> 00:30:56.500
direction that the plane has gone.
And uh,

486
00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.830
and there are all kinds of sensors on the plane.
Uh,
so for example,

487
00:30:59.831 --> 00:31:04.490
their thing of tubes and things like that,
which will it actually monitor that,

488
00:31:04.491 --> 00:31:08.830
that uh,
those in as it were self generated movement signals.

489
00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:12.760
So when we got to the point of studying this cognitive navigation system,

490
00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.820
it was pretty natural for us to start thinking,
well,

491
00:31:15.821 --> 00:31:17.890
maybe there are two systems in the brain but doing that.

492
00:31:17.891 --> 00:31:22.891
So the idea is that each one of these place cells has two ways of knowing where

493
00:31:24.731 --> 00:31:27.100
the animal is.
The one is look around,

494
00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:32.110
see the cues and calculate on the basis of triangulation of queues,
where,

495
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.010
where the animal is.

496
00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.330
But the other is once the animal knows it's in a particular location and it has

497
00:31:37.331 --> 00:31:39.700
a representation of that environment,

498
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:45.030
it can then use these internally generated internal inertial navigation signals.

499
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:50.470
How far the animal has gone in a particular direction to calculate an update the

500
00:31:50.471 --> 00:31:52.990
map.
So I can say,
okay,
I know where I am,

501
00:31:52.991 --> 00:31:56.080
I turn around and walk in a certain direction that should activate.

502
00:31:56.081 --> 00:32:00.040
So the internals system,
the internal,
what we call the path integration system,

503
00:32:00.041 --> 00:32:03.670
should also be capable of activating the system.

504
00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:08.320
So how do you study those two inputs into,
into this,

505
00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:09.340
these cells?
Well,

506
00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.310
you can try lots of things like putting the armor on treadmills and things like

507
00:32:12.311 --> 00:32:15.720
that and it's really quite hard to pull apart the,

508
00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:19.870
those two sources of information,
particularly because one of them,
the,
the,
the,

509
00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:21.980
the system which uses as it were,

510
00:32:21.981 --> 00:32:26.200
self generated motion signals involves things like uptick flow.

511
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.700
And so you,
you,
you're,

512
00:32:27.701 --> 00:32:32.050
you're getting signals opticals visual signals or contributed to about six.

513
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.540
So this is a famous painting.
Um,
uh,

514
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.850
I think it's 15th century by period.
Della Francesca and uh,

515
00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:42.140
it's about the creation of price.
Who's is back here,
um,

516
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:46.130
being a flagellated in,
in the,
um,
in the presence of,
of,

517
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:47.300
of punches pilot.

518
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:52.600
And there are three Tuscan noblemen who are completely ignoring this scene,

519
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.790
standing here,
probably talking about the price of,

520
00:32:55.791 --> 00:33:00.350
of wishing or wine more likely,
uh,
in the local markets.

521
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:04.190
Then what I use it to show is,
is how,
um,

522
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.970
they can represent their location in this environment using these two,

523
00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:12.530
two different strategies.
So for example,
this chap can say,
well,

524
00:33:12.531 --> 00:33:14.010
I know where I am here.
Um,

525
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.860
because I can look at all these different objects and I can see where I am

526
00:33:18.861 --> 00:33:20.810
relative to those,
to those objects.

527
00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:25.690
And we're pretty sure that's one of the ways in which humans and animals,
uh,

528
00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.860
make it.
But in addition to that,

529
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:32.390
once he knows where he is and say he wants to go over to a another place,

530
00:33:32.391 --> 00:33:37.190
he wants to get closer to the scene and actually see,
uh,
what,
what is going on.

531
00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.430
A while he could just move until he gets,
uh,
uh,

532
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:45.290
the same signals from the same landmarks,
uh,
which represent that location.

533
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:48.380
But you could also use this path integration system.

534
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:50.570
He could turn around 180 degrees.

535
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:55.290
Then Piro is made a little easier for them by laying a tile and grid structure

536
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:59.750
on the,
on the floor so that he could follow that and turn it around 180 degrees,

537
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:01.940
walk a certain distance,
turn right and go to the,

538
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:05.640
so you'd use this internal signals to update his location.
And,
and,

539
00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.580
and I'll show you right now that we think that that's what,

540
00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:10.250
what animals are doing as well.

541
00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.670
So over the years,

542
00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:17.720
Neil Burgess and other people who were working with me using virtual reality

543
00:34:17.721 --> 00:34:22.610
test the system in humans,
I said,
why can't we just do this with rats?
I mean,

544
00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.800
we've been running around all environments and everything.

545
00:34:24.801 --> 00:34:28.490
Why do we have to do all last fall out?

546
00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:32.750
Why can't we just use virtual reality to sort of present the world to them?
Uh,

547
00:34:32.751 --> 00:34:37.190
and uh,
and uh,
and then study the system.
And I have to say,

548
00:34:37.191 --> 00:34:40.310
I was a naysayer,
I said for many,
many years,
it's not gonna work.

549
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:43.910
They are like the having a heads fix they don't like.

550
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.410
And it certainly is true that rats don't,
but it turns out the mice too.

551
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:51.290
They don't mind having a heads fact as long as they have something to run on.

552
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.380
So if you put a my view looking at it and have a pet mouse,

553
00:34:54.381 --> 00:34:56.660
what the mouse does is he spends all his time running on,

554
00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:59.780
on running wheels important and you need to give them that in order to keep them

555
00:34:59.781 --> 00:35:01.550
happy when you got them.
Um,

556
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000
and so a chap called David tank who was originally at bell labs but it's now

557
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.400
been at Princeton for some time.
Uh,

558
00:35:09.401 --> 00:35:13.610
and his students device a rash or mouse version is really,

559
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.640
really for mice.
I have to be careful here because that's really,

560
00:35:16.641 --> 00:35:21.641
nobody's done it properly for rats yet a mouse virtual reality environment where

561
00:35:22.461 --> 00:35:25.490
the animals had is fixed.
It runs on a styrofoam ball,

562
00:35:25.491 --> 00:35:29.060
which is floating on a cushion of air so that the ball turns almost

563
00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:33.740
frictionlessly.
Um,
and the world is presented to the animal,

564
00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.680
um,
on this,
on these two video screens.

565
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:39.810
And this is a screenshot of what it looks like and I'll show you as you run into

566
00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.560
it.
Essentially what we're looking at is a one dimensional environment.

567
00:35:43.561 --> 00:35:47.280
In this situation we haven't really been able to get the animal to navigate in

568
00:35:47.281 --> 00:35:49.550
two dimensions very well.
Um,

569
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:52.980
and we know where he's going because there's a simple computer mouse which

570
00:35:52.981 --> 00:35:57.040
distracts the movement of the ball.
So here is the animal is placed down.
Yeah.
Uh,

571
00:35:57.041 --> 00:35:59.490
and,
and this is work done by Griffin Chen and John King.

572
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:01.440
He's placed at the start of this,

573
00:36:01.441 --> 00:36:04.800
this track here and their cues on the side and the accused at the end.

574
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:09.180
And his job is just to run to the end and get food and then he's teleported back

575
00:36:09.181 --> 00:36:12.660
to the start again and runs again and back to the start again.
So in from,

576
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.600
from point of view of collecting a lot of data,
it's very nice.

577
00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.580
And also he tells us where it is.

578
00:36:17.581 --> 00:36:21.150
We can do things like not only have food at the end where we get halfway down

579
00:36:21.151 --> 00:36:23.700
and show that he knows where the location of the food is.

580
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.410
And this is what the representation,

581
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.960
easy way of representing this whole environment is.

582
00:36:27.961 --> 00:36:32.430
You have a yellow track here and then they're accused dotted around the crap

583
00:36:32.431 --> 00:36:34.320
track.
So this is what it looks like,

584
00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:36.630
<v 1>uh,
on a,</v>

585
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:42.750
<v 2>this is a screenshot at the start and here's what it looks like as he runs down</v>

586
00:36:42.751 --> 00:36:43.860
from the animal's point of view.

587
00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:48.300
So he stands there and now he starts to run and you'll hear one of these place

588
00:36:48.301 --> 00:36:52.630
cells fire as it gets to about halfway down.
Okay?
So that's a,

589
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:55.680
a bunch of clicks which are standing in for the firing it.

590
00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:59.610
He's then teleport back to the beginning of the Po,
the amaze again,

591
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:04.510
and he runs again.
And the sellers,
you'll see fires in the same place.

592
00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:07.563
<v 1>Okay?</v>

593
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.940
<v 2>Okay.
So we can get,</v>

594
00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:18.420
we can essentially show that these cells treat this artificial virtual world as

595
00:37:19.451 --> 00:37:23.320
the adult were real world.
And we can do a lot of experiments.

596
00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:26.930
Let me tell you a few on this.
We can find cells that fire,
uh,

597
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:31.140
some way down the track in this case at the beginning in this case,
um,
uh,

598
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:32.263
in the middle.

599
00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.470
And we can record from new for several days under the best circumstances.

600
00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:40.800
And we get ask things like,
well,
which Kuser the,
the,
uh,

601
00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.970
the cells using.
Um,

602
00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.600
so we can show that a cell which fires in the middle if you take those visual

603
00:37:46.601 --> 00:37:49.330
cues away.
And of course we've created this world.

604
00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.100
It's an artificial world that's only has,

605
00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:55.720
so we'd be a bit surprised that he's still new and a bit unhappy if he still

606
00:37:55.721 --> 00:37:58.990
knew where the NSL knew where to fire,
but they don't.

607
00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.130
And it turns out it's of cues on the side and not the cute that is approaching

608
00:38:03.131 --> 00:38:07.850
her or,
or leaving,
which are the important cues.
Um,
and interesting enough on a,

609
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.580
for some of the cells,
about a quarter of them,

610
00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:14.170
we can pass a renewed the animal down the environment and the sales so far.

611
00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:19.660
So he doesn't act that we have to,
uh,
write down three quarters them.

612
00:38:19.661 --> 00:38:23.110
He has to actively run down.
But for some of them it's just passive movement.

613
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:27.820
Now the ones that are actively very actively runs down are interesting because

614
00:38:27.821 --> 00:38:31.660
what we'd like to study is how these two sources of information,

615
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:37.580
information given by the visual world and the given by his own path and his own,

616
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:42.040
uh,
movements,
which essentially you're telling him how,
when to expect the cues,

617
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:45.320
how they integrate,
integrate with each other.
And one way is,

618
00:38:45.321 --> 00:38:49.390
is shown on this slide.
If he knows where he is,
you show them the cues.

619
00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.980
Then Ken,
this is internal movement system,

620
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.970
update the representation after the case had been removed.

621
00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:01.030
So we show them the cues and then the minute he starts to move,

622
00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:03.460
we take the keys away and see what the cell does.

623
00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.000
And for about half of the cells they show this kind of behavior.

624
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.290
We put them down on the stock and he runs down in the cell fires again in the

625
00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:13.420
middle if we take the cubes away.

626
00:39:13.421 --> 00:39:17.290
So he has no clue as to where he is even at the start and the cells don't fire.

627
00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:19.720
But if we put him down at the beginning of the,

628
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:22.780
the track and then as he starts to move,
we turned the lights off,

629
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:27.550
then the cells still fires in a bike place showing that these two sources of

630
00:39:27.551 --> 00:39:29.620
information are actually integrating.

631
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.560
We have a sensory signal.

632
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:37.570
The visual cues is being integrated with information coming from the vestibular

633
00:39:37.571 --> 00:39:40.750
system and the proprioceptive system in the motor system.

634
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.070
Okay.
So,
um,
that's the end of my story.
Um,

635
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:49.780
we think there's a very strong information in this story has been going for

636
00:39:49.781 --> 00:39:51.780
about 40 years now.
Uh,

637
00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:55.300
that the part of the brain called the hippocampus or the hippocampal formation.

638
00:39:55.301 --> 00:39:58.600
You provide something like a cognitive map in,

639
00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:02.710
in animals and it can be used to identify their location and to navigate.

640
00:40:02.711 --> 00:40:07.160
And we think there,
the system does the same thing in humans.
Uh,
it's used,
uh,

641
00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:11.700
actually,
uh,
as a basis for a broader memory system.
Uh,

642
00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:16.630
an episodic memory system.
Um,
and there are two strategies for locating places.

643
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:20.080
One is to use the cues.
It's not just visual.

644
00:40:20.081 --> 00:40:24.140
We tend to use visual envision tends to be the strongest.
Q,
a,

645
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.880
if you pick different modalities against each other,
the animal,

646
00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:33.020
even though it's visual system is,
is,
is much,
uh,
less,
uh,
uh,

647
00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:35.470
he has a much less accuracy than a,

648
00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.460
an acuity then then you would get in primates,
they still use that.

649
00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:43.450
So a bad visual system if you're trying to navigate is better than a good

650
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:47.890
auditory system I guess.
Um,
uh,
and then,
uh,

651
00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:52.100
the other system is this path integration system,
which is,
um,
which is uh,

652
00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.010
using information about movements,

653
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:58.690
primarily vestibular and probably we think,
uh,

654
00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.170
information from the motor system of predicting what the actual movements are

655
00:41:02.171 --> 00:41:06.220
going to be.
And these are the people who have funded us.
The,
uh,

656
00:41:06.221 --> 00:41:10.570
I met Ucl Gatsby foundation and the Wellcome trust has been funding is for many

657
00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:14.170
years and together they've gotten together in Builtin a new center for the study

658
00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:18.890
of,
of systems neuroscience for the study of how cells integrate.
Yeah.
Selten,

659
00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.770
not only the hippocampus but other parts of brain,

660
00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:24.190
how they integrate and talk to each other to form these,
these representations.

661
00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.690
So thank you for your attention.
Thank you for your,

662
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.310
<v 3>I was interested in the density of spacial memory.</v>

663
00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:41.180
So given the size of the cells and the size of hippocratic campus,

664
00:41:41.181 --> 00:41:45.980
can you predict how many places we can remember or recognize?

665
00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:49.970
And I guess with the taxi driver growing the hippocampus,
you know,
is,

666
00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:52.640
is that an indication as well?
So I think that

667
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:58.210
<v 2>problem is we don't really know how many cells you need to represent any,</v>

668
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.760
any,
anything.
Uh,
cognitively.
Um,

669
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:04.200
the other problem which I,

670
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:09.230
I kind of didn't go into is that both in the hippocampus and the place cells in

671
00:42:10.221 --> 00:42:14.060
the hippocampus and also the grid cells in the [inaudible] Cortex,
um,

672
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:18.710
they're not all representing things at the same scale.
And in fact it's,

673
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:23.460
there's a systematic change in scale as you go from one end of the hippocampus

674
00:42:23.461 --> 00:42:24.600
and [inaudible] Cortex to deal.

675
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:29.750
And it looks like there were four or five levels of,
of,

676
00:42:29.751 --> 00:42:34.390
of uh,
scale.
So it's a quantum jump in scale.
Uh,

677
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:37.280
and there are five of those as you go from one entity,
the next,

678
00:42:37.281 --> 00:42:41.540
particularly in the grid cells where we know more about it.
So,
and,
and,
and,

679
00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:45.350
and the scale actually gets fairly large.
So that,
for example,

680
00:42:45.351 --> 00:42:49.700
we usually use boxes of a couple of meters by a couple of minutes,

681
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:53.260
but some of the cells in the,
in the,
um,
in the,
uh,

682
00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:57.770
far down in the,
uh,
in this,
in this level where the scales are quite big,

683
00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:02.300
might represent an entire room.
So this,
so in terms of,

684
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:06.470
we would have to think about it in terms of each of these different mapping

685
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:09.990
systems to get that answer.
But it looks as though the,

686
00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:15.260
the representations are actually quite local and small in one end.

687
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.460
And then they get quite large and global and the other end.

688
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:22.550
And presumably these parts of the brain are talking to each other.

689
00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:26.880
So the computation is,
is a little more difficult than just asking how many,
uh,

690
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.390
environment or,
or what's a dent.
The acuity.

691
00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.060
The other thing is we don't have any good right now.

692
00:43:32.061 --> 00:43:35.960
Any good methodology for assessing acuity,
special acuity.

693
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:40.720
We don't know how good an animal can tell behaviorally,
uh,

694
00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:43.400
tell us how,
how,
how,
how,

695
00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:47.600
how well you can identify this location as opposed to the neighboring location.

696
00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:49.250
So until we have that information,

697
00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.380
it's going to be difficult to do that calculation.

698
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:55.960
<v 4>You,
you showed a picture of the hippocampus,
kind of a structurally,</v>

699
00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:59.860
can you say anything about how the structure of the hippocampus in the brain

700
00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:05.010
differs from maybe other parts of the brain and any ideas on why that might mean

701
00:44:05.561 --> 00:44:07.210
that's where place cells occur?

702
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:11.220
<v 2>Yeah,
that's a very good question.
Um,</v>

703
00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:16.730
so many people have tried to do a function structure relationships for,

704
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:20.730
uh,
for many years.
The hippocampus is a form of cortex.

705
00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:25.200
It's a form of primitive cortex.
It doesn't have all the layers.

706
00:44:25.201 --> 00:44:28.680
And the intermodal cortex doesn't have all of the layers with cells in it that

707
00:44:28.681 --> 00:44:30.790
you would get in the neocortex.
Um,

708
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:35.940
what's nice about it is the unanimous had been studying it for many as have the

709
00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:37.440
physiologists been studying it for many,

710
00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:40.450
many years because it's such a beautifully simple structure.

711
00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:44.340
So the cells that we record from,
uh,
the,
uh,

712
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:49.370
the place cells are almost definitely pyramidal cells in the hippocampus.

713
00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:54.240
And that's probably the most studied a brain cell.

714
00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:57.540
And it's the most studied cell in the brain and others.
And if so,

715
00:44:57.541 --> 00:45:01.560
if you're a physiologist and you want to look at a membrane potentials are you

716
00:45:01.561 --> 00:45:06.030
want this look at transmitters you quite often we'll go to the hippocampus cause

717
00:45:06.031 --> 00:45:08.400
it's got a very nice simple structure.
Um,

718
00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:11.220
one of the things in terms of the question you ask is,
um,

719
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:15.420
is there anything about it that would give us some clues?

720
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:17.130
And it,

721
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:21.390
if you were a computational neuroscientists and you looked at the structure as

722
00:45:21.391 --> 00:45:23.540
somebody like David Moore did in the 19th sentence,

723
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.040
you will almost automatically say,
look,

724
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:31.041
this looks like some sort of a continuous attractor network because of what you

725
00:45:31.291 --> 00:45:33.610
get is a huge density of,

726
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:37.080
of interconnections between the principal cell types.

727
00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.870
So not only do they have inputs coming in from the outside,

728
00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.150
but they actually talk to each other and,
and they,
they,

729
00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:47.010
the structure is such as it looks as though each cell talks to lots.

730
00:45:47.011 --> 00:45:48.030
And lots of other cells.

731
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:53.510
So it looks as though there is a lot of communication within the structure and

732
00:45:53.551 --> 00:45:57.690
the other kind of structural feature,
which seems to implicate,
uh,

733
00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.950
something like a,

734
00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.960
an associate network is that each fiber as it comes in runs along lots and lots

735
00:46:05.731 --> 00:46:10.320
of cells.
So it provides information for,
for many,
many of the cells,

736
00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:11.880
uh,
at the same time.

737
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:16.770
And in some way the cells sought out the fact that they have many,

738
00:46:16.771 --> 00:46:21.210
many inputs in common by using an inhibitory network and his like a first past

739
00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:23.340
the post inhibitory network where the,

740
00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:28.610
whoever gets the fire first uses the local inhibitory inhibitory network tech

741
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.290
suppress the activity of all the,
all the neighbors.

742
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:35.700
So it's only the cells who are,
uh,
as it were at a certain distance,

743
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.090
uh,
which can also fire in the same place because the local,

744
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.190
and that's some extent,

745
00:46:40.191 --> 00:46:43.830
we explains that map that I showed you where all the cells of which are in a

746
00:46:43.831 --> 00:46:48.780
local environment seem to have sort of space themselves out optimally to,
to,
to,

747
00:46:48.781 --> 00:46:52.950
to,
to get the,
the right.
Uh,
it's a fire across the whole environment.

748
00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:55.560
So there are lots of hints,
uh,

749
00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:58.370
if you just came from the other direction in the anatomical direction,

750
00:46:58.371 --> 00:47:00.380
and I don't think you would necessarily think that there,

751
00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:03.390
that would lead you to think they were a spatial system.

752
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.750
You can only do that on the basis of the physiology.
Right.

753
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:11.120
I wonder if you've looked at the correlation between,
um,

754
00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:15.670
direction of gravity versus the resolution of locationing,
uh,

755
00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:19.370
like for example,
doing the same experiment with tilted platform,

756
00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:23.160
different angles.
Yeah,
that's,
that's a good question too.
So,
um,
it,

757
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:24.940
it's clear that gravity is,
is,
is,

758
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:29.950
is operating here and mostly on the cells which are involved in a setting up the

759
00:47:30.311 --> 00:47:35.010
head direction,
a signal,
and we know a bit about that.
And,

760
00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:39.670
and,
um,
it,
uh,
if you turn the animal side down in the signal is lost.

761
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:44.530
So there has to be something which,
which tells says the direction of gravity.

762
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:50.160
Um,
other than that,
I'm not so sure that we know much more about that.
We,
um,

763
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.820
we know that most of our work is in two dimensions.
Uh,

764
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:57.250
so we don't explore that very much.
Kate,
Jeffrey,

765
00:47:57.290 --> 00:48:01.900
one of my colleagues at Ucl has tried to look at the third dimension by having

766
00:48:01.901 --> 00:48:03.760
animals,
climbing towers and things like that.

767
00:48:03.761 --> 00:48:08.740
The best way to do it is to have an animal that actually naturally,
uh,

768
00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.530
behaves in a three dimensional environment.

769
00:48:11.531 --> 00:48:16.440
And the best example of that is working in Israel,
um,
where they,
uh,

770
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:20.680
by a chap called and ask and his colleagues where they have that's flying around

771
00:48:20.681 --> 00:48:24.340
in three dimensional environments.
And so there we see the same,

772
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:27.320
more or less the same thing except you get a three dimensional thing.

773
00:48:27.321 --> 00:48:31.810
So in addition to,
um,
the,
uh,
say one of these head direction cells,

774
00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:36.270
uh,
pointing towards the Asmis and sort of giving you the,
the,

775
00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:41.050
that uh,
um,
that,
that single,
they also show pitch.

776
00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:44.230
They don't seem to care too much about your and things like that.

777
00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:47.980
So there is a gravity signal,
but it hasn't been studied very much.

778
00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:52.480
<v 0>We're involved in doing machine navigation and locations.</v>

779
00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:57.520
Do you think there's anything that we can learn from like how the brain does it

780
00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:03.500
as how we should approach it or should we maybe rely on on intelligent design

781
00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:07.040
analytically instead of organically?
I guess that's it.

782
00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:12.170
<v 2>A more general question then the relationship between brains and how brains do</v>

783
00:49:12.181 --> 00:49:16.680
it in artificial intelligence.
And there are a lot of similar questions.

784
00:49:16.681 --> 00:49:21.130
Invasion for example.
And um,
I remember once when the,
in the,

785
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:26.230
in the early days I'm talking to one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence

786
00:49:26.371 --> 00:49:28.380
and,
and he said,
well,

787
00:49:28.381 --> 00:49:33.150
we're going to come up with a way of solving this problem,
uh,
algorithmically.

788
00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:35.730
And I said,
well,
I don't really care about that.

789
00:49:35.731 --> 00:49:38.430
I want to know how the brain does it.
He said,
well,
actually made,

790
00:49:38.431 --> 00:49:42.420
they may not be a lot of ways of doing this.
So if you had one way of doing it,

791
00:49:42.421 --> 00:49:44.730
that would give you a lot of hints about how to do it.

792
00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:49.470
So I guess that if you accept what I've been telling you that I'm having sort of

793
00:49:49.471 --> 00:49:53.220
one good example of how you can do it.
There probably are other ways of doing it,

794
00:49:53.221 --> 00:49:58.050
but,
uh,
and they probably probably a ways which are very different,

795
00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:02.530
but having one good way,
uh,
and especially in terms of the flexibility of the,

796
00:50:02.531 --> 00:50:05.460
of the,
of the structure might,
might,
uh,

797
00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:08.070
might actually give you clues as to how to do it yet.

798
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:09.500
<v 1>So thanks very much.
So.</v>

799
00:50:09.501 --> 00:50:14.501
[inaudible].
