00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.700
Hi,
welcome to toxic Google and Cambridge,
Massachusetts.
And,
uh,

2
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.890
not today.
I'm delighted to introduce a two for one topic.
Um,

3
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.950
first,
uh,
is,
uh,
Abraham Flexner,

4
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.150
who was the person that I think we should all know better.
Uh,
the first,
uh,

5
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.870
director of the institute at Princeton and one of the people responsible for

6
00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:30.290
bringing a Albert Einstein to this country among many other things,

7
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.800
a very famous in his time,
a front page of which were the New York Times.

8
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.240
And we seem to have forgotten about him.
Fascinating person,

9
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.780
the author of the original classic essay and here to comment and expand on that.

10
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.190
Uh,
Robert Diagraph,

11
00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:50.750
the current Director Institute an advanced studies at Princeton,
um,
certainly,
uh,

12
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.610
accomplished scientist and,
uh,
and there's an own right,
um,

13
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.840
director and Leon [inaudible] professor at the Institute since 2012.

14
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.610
Mathematical physicist,
well known for,
uh,

15
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.470
a string theory and also the advancement of,
of scientific education.
And,
uh,

16
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.771
so he's,

17
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:14.771
I'm a past president of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in

18
00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:18.720
that capacity,
uh,
an advisor to the,
uh,
the Dutch government,
um,

19
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.170
advocate for the science and the arts.
Um,

20
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.690
he has received the spinosa price prize,

21
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.110
the highest scientific award in the Netherlands,

22
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.380
and has been named a night to the order of the Netherlands lion member of the

23
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.390
American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American philosophical society.
Um,

24
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.660
so a heartfelt welcome Robert.

25
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.263
<v 0>Thank you so much.</v>

26
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.550
<v 2>Thank you Richard.
And a great pleasure to talk here.
A about a very small book.</v>

27
00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:51.880
So a,
it take you,
I think only an hour to read,

28
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.800
but I think it's a small book on a very large topic,
namely the,
uh,

29
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.680
the role that basic research place in our lives.
And,
uh,

30
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.580
in some sense on deeper themes like curiosity and imagination.
Um,

31
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.870
it's great to be a coauthor with Abraham Flexner who indeed needs,

32
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.220
I think in some sense we have to resurrect his legacy.
And in indeed,

33
00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:19.780
he was famous for bringing Albert Einstein to the,
uh,
to the institute.
So,
uh,

34
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.673
when,
uh,

35
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.980
this book came out and thought it would be good idea to see where we can have a

36
00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:28.510
blurb for Mine Stein about to book because they must have known Flexner well.

37
00:02:28.511 --> 00:02:30.400
So I was a visioning Einstein.

38
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.970
I really recommend that book I think was perfect occasion to do so.

39
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.810
So then I looked in the ultimate quotable Einstein,

40
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.950
which has almost 600 pages of Einstein quotations on everything,

41
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.130
but it was heading think about Flexner and it was one quotation and it said,
uh,

42
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.950
one of my few enemies.

43
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.850
So I that I've lost my proposal to have on the book ethic,
but,
uh,

44
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.160
we didn't go there.
Um,
Flexner wrote this essay,

45
00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:01.500
the usefulness of useless knowledge,
which has a catching title.
Um,
uh,

46
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.840
you worked on it for many years,
in fact,
almost two decades.

47
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.920
It was finally published in October,
1939 in Harper's magazine.

48
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.000
And it's interesting just to see what was relevant in October 39.
You see,
uh,

49
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.460
uh,

50
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.460
one of the issues here where all the bus a article about conscious and more

51
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:20.051
time,

52
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:25.051
but it was also equally important article and why can't we have perfect teeth or

53
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:28.940
old people arising natural problems.
So,
uh,
it's,
uh,

54
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.180
the world was in crisis,

55
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:36.160
but in some sense it's still remarkable that he was writing about the use of

56
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:40.330
basic research,
the usefulness of basic research in that time.
And in this book,

57
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.871
I actually,

58
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:45.190
I started to boot by explaining the 39 were special too because it was actually

59
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.880
the year when the world's fair came to New York.

60
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.830
And the theme was the world of tomorrow,
in fact,
that we've turned the 1964.

61
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.090
Um,
but it wasn't queens and it really,

62
00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:01.210
it was a wave where many people could meet new technology.
For instance,

63
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:05.290
the first television broadcast was there at that point that were 200 television

64
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:09.820
sets.
And the first live broadcast was the opening speech of President Roosevelt,

65
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.400
the dishwasher,
the fax machine.

66
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.780
They were all introduced to the American audience for the first time.
Uh,

67
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.520
on the other hand,
the was things of days long past,
for instance,

68
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.340
kind of a beauty pageant of steam engines.
Um,
and another thing,

69
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:30.820
the first robot was introduced,
it's nameless electro.

70
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.530
He could smoke a cigarette and he had a little,
uh,
robot.

71
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.450
A dog sparky did a could play with and he would see him,
uh,
performing or,
yeah,

72
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.620
not that impressive,
but I think it was actually his,
the voice,
uh,

73
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.770
walls by playing a gramophone records.

74
00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.680
So all this was 1939 technology,

75
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.820
but actually it was the second opening speech and that was by Albert Einstein.

76
00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:08.870
Albert Einstein decided to talk about cosmic rays and,
um,

77
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.100
it has been described as a comedy of error because the trick was that the cosmic

78
00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:19.310
rays particles coming from the universe were captured in the Hayden Planetarium

79
00:05:19.311 --> 00:05:21.830
in Manhattan,
then sent by telephone,

80
00:05:21.831 --> 00:05:25.040
whatever that mean to the fairgrounds.

81
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.800
And when the 10th cosmic ray was captured,

82
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.070
a big switch were thrown and then the fuse blew and the whole room turned pitch

83
00:05:33.411 --> 00:05:36.800
dark.
Uh,
and the New York Times then report the next day.
Dot.

84
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.480
The audience left this kind of exposition about science to apply to go to

85
00:05:41.481 --> 00:05:46.130
something they could applaud.
So it was kind of not a great success.
Um,

86
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.200
but,
uh,
I think it's an amazing,

87
00:05:48.201 --> 00:05:50.930
because Einstein was talking about the world of tomorrow,

88
00:05:50.931 --> 00:05:55.190
but he didn't mention two topics.
It didn't mention nuclear power,

89
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.150
nuclear energy,
and he didn't mention computers.

90
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.690
And both of them actually where I death point really developed under his own

91
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.950
eyes in the Institute for Advanced Study,
uh,
that was set up by Abraham Flexner.

92
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:14.780
So the institute was set up and founded the 1930 to first professors came in

93
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:19.640
1933,
a as a kind of an island of paradise for scholars,

94
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.650
uh,
as this New York Times magazine article describes seeking internal truth in a

95
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:27.550
world of chaos.
Um,
but,
uh,

96
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.000
little did Einstein or Flexner,

97
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.970
who was the first director realized that he was actually creating these kind of

98
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.030
terrific developments that would totally change the world.

99
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.390
So only a few months later,
the opening of the world's fair was,

100
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:43.280
I think in April and August 39,

101
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.840
Einstein would write his famous letter to get together with Leo Szilard,

102
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.190
uh,
asking President Roosevelt to develop the atomic bomb.

103
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.100
And the Manhattan project basically come,

104
00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:00.190
got underway in October 39 flection essay do this referred bleakly to,

105
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.660
uh,
atomic power.
But he wasn't aware.
I think that this was kind of happening.

106
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.430
Uh,
another development in the 1930s was that Princeton became a center for

107
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:15.650
mathematical logic church.

108
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.730
Vernoy Mun girdle Turing of course was a Grad student there.

109
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.520
And for Norman actually,
uh,

110
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:27.521
working on the abstract computing machine proving mathematical theorems realized

111
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.120
a few years later that,
uh,
building,
uh,
an electronic computer as you know,

112
00:07:32.121 --> 00:07:32.954
very well,

113
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.440
it's much more efficient using the [inaudible] architecture that is to say

114
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.450
allowed to compute it to be programmable.

115
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:43.670
And he built actually the first a prototype of that at the institute.

116
00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:47.690
Here you see him with Oppenheimer and the integration of the ias machine,

117
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.380
it's quite remarkable thing.
It has a 30 by 32 memory.

118
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:56.830
It was built for more surplus material because of course you are not going to

119
00:07:56.961 --> 00:08:01.670
spend this,
uh,
real money on,
uh,
on,
on building this computer.

120
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.841
And in fact,

121
00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:07.841
it was a triple helix efforts because it was supported both by philanthropy by,

122
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.230
uh,
the war effort and,
uh,

123
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.440
by companies RCA and later IBM.
In fact,

124
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.040
the norm on that only did huge simulations of the hydrogen bomb.

125
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.630
He also used that computer to do the first electronic weather forecast.

126
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.390
This and the other,
the machine and pen.

127
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:31.430
So this is the first computerized weather prediction from January,

128
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.290
1949 you'd like to indicate it took that these days,

129
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.520
48 hours to predict tomorrow's wetter.
So,
um,

130
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.280
it was yesterday's retro actually,

131
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:45.281
whichever is pretty good to on the 30 by 32 bit machine and this institute,

132
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:51.310
which was supposed to be as far removed from reality as possible hats.

133
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:52.110
You know,

134
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:57.110
here's the floor plan in 1948 that Einstein being the father of the peace

135
00:08:57.481 --> 00:08:58.314
movement,

136
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.770
it had [inaudible] and being a part of your role model for doctor strange

137
00:09:02.771 --> 00:09:04.920
Strangelove and you know,
uh,

138
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:09.780
building the coldest of cold warriors and Oppenheimer who was kind of caught in

139
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:14.130
between.
So it's the perfect case to demonstrate the title,

140
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:16.560
a Flexner that,
you know,
this is kind of useless knowledge,

141
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:21.030
whether it's abstract mathematical logic or understanding the quantum mechanics

142
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:25.830
of atomic new fly could have incredible useful and also dangerous consequences.

143
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.600
So who was Abraham Flexner does men that we basically forgot about it.

144
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:34.230
So he was born in a poor Jewish family,

145
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:38.820
immigrant family in 1866 and saint Louis.
He had nine siblings.

146
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.670
Three brothers became pretty famous.
Simon Flexner,

147
00:09:42.671 --> 00:09:45.240
who was the first director of the Rockefeller Institute,

148
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:47.580
now Rockefeller University,
it was a medical doctor.

149
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.680
Bernard flexible is very seriously involved in politics and Abraham Flexner.

150
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.750
He was the one who was able to go to Johns Hopkins University at a very young

151
00:09:57.751 --> 00:10:01.410
age at age 17.
Graduated in classics in two years.

152
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.270
Went to start back to Saint Louis,
created but became a high school teacher.

153
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:07.260
Uh,

154
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:12.260
became notorious because he was failing at one year is full class,

155
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.760
which actually made the headlines in the local newspaper.

156
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.910
Started when he was age 23 years old in high school,

157
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:23.330
and then became famous by the so-called Flexner report report.

158
00:10:23.521 --> 00:10:28.521
He issued in 1910 that looked at all 155 medical schools in the u s and

159
00:10:29.491 --> 00:10:34.491
effectively led to the closure of 120 of them medical education.

160
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.620
That time was a disaster.
It was for profit.
Uh,
it's,

161
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.440
that wasn't an undergraduate course.

162
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:44.940
Students would not see any patients ever.
Just basically a scam.

163
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.150
And,
uh,
he,
uh,
minces no words.

164
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:52.380
I think Chicago is described as the plague spots of the country,

165
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.040
but even very established medical schools like here at Harvard,

166
00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:59.520
they essentially closed down and started again Johns Hopkins,

167
00:10:59.521 --> 00:11:02.130
which was the first modern research university.
It was the only one,

168
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.150
one of the few,

169
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:07.620
I think that also lighting example and then flex and start to think about a

170
00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:08.580
universities too.

171
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:13.850
And it became a very influential thinker about modern American universities,
uh,

172
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.820
criticizing.

173
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:19.700
They're kind of shallowness the lack of research culture in uh,

174
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.980
universities in 1920s and thirties.
He's,
he,
for instance,

175
00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:27.080
describing Columbia and uh,
telling that,
you know,

176
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:31.320
we can see that Columbia,
that point offered courses impractical poultry raising.

177
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.390
So this was the early thirties.

178
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.960
This was a time that they know are people really looking for jobs.

179
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.790
And then came the moment,
which really made him,
uh,
uh,

180
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:46.560
move from an abstract theoretical critique to actually do something.

181
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:51.030
He was able to start the institute for advanced study thanks to a wonderful

182
00:11:51.031 --> 00:11:54.760
grant by the Bamberger family who sold the department store.

183
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:59.761
They had in Newark Department Store in 1929 a few weeks before the Wall Street

184
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:04.150
crash.
So they were one of the few philanthropies that had actually had cash.

185
00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.373
Um,

186
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:11.410
and that actually the institute became quite influential because geopolitics

187
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:16.411
intervenes of course 1933 certainly there's this wonderful group of German

188
00:12:16.631 --> 00:12:18.060
scholars,
Jewish Germans,
callers,

189
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:23.070
political refugees who were in search of the home and the institute became kind

190
00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:27.220
of an Ellis Island,
uh,
attracting scholars from across the world.

191
00:12:27.221 --> 00:12:28.300
Here you see some of the,

192
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:33.301
it's difficult to read very small grants we're giving to these great names.

193
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.400
So you could kind of by,
so to say,

194
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.640
but could girdle a think for $1,200 or the greatest logicians from the last 2000

195
00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:45.850
years or stand Tulum,
the Polish mathematician who designed the hydrogen bomb.

196
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.750
I think he has an 800 and the joke is that there was something there where
again,

197
00:12:49.751 --> 00:12:52.540
the Bamberger family that had this department store was again,

198
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:57.280
a dealing in distressed merchandise.
But now it's us.

199
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.750
And,
uh,
Flexner,
he writes in 1939,

200
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.480
I think very perceptively.
There's 50 years from now,

201
00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:06.130
historians looking backwards,
we'll,

202
00:13:06.131 --> 00:13:11.070
if we act with courage and imagination report that during our time the center of

203
00:13:11.071 --> 00:13:14.980
gravity is scholarship,
moved across the Atlantic to the United States.

204
00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:19.360
And it's good to remind ourselves that the centers of scholarship have moved

205
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.200
across the globe,
uh,
through the centuries.
Um,

206
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.880
he makes a perfect argument and as I said,
you know,
in the,

207
00:13:25.881 --> 00:13:29.200
as a setting interdiction,
when he dies in 1959,

208
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:34.340
the New York Times writes actually,
uh,
that,
uh,

209
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:41.370
no other American of his time has contributed more to the welfare of this

210
00:13:41.471 --> 00:13:43.750
country and humanity in general.

211
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.100
So a quite remarkable to see that somebody was central arch reputation.

212
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.600
Um,
it's in some sense for government and I think he should not be because the

213
00:13:52.601 --> 00:13:54.520
argument he makes is timeless.

214
00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:57.760
It's the argument about the usefulness of useless knowledge.

215
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.640
He spends a lot of time arguing for,
it's about electromagnetism,

216
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.940
Faraday and Maxwell,
uh,
this,
this famous quote of sure.

217
00:14:03.941 --> 00:14:08.410
But it's true that when the British Chancellor of the exchequer visited Ferriday

218
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.980
days lap and ask her what this good a professor Ferriday oldest electricity's

219
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:16.600
had,
I've no idea,
but one day,
sure you will tax it.
And he was right.

220
00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.810
Uh,
you could say that these days,
electricity,

221
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:25.480
everything is governed by electricity.
Um,
another example,

222
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.260
uh,
quantum mechanics.
So if you think of the birth of quantum mechanics,

223
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:33.070
so muck Splunk famously said that there was an act of desperation.

224
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:38.250
You really want to save the laws of physics and he had to do this crazy thing.

225
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.580
He wants to be willing to make any offer to the principals in physics that I

226
00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:44.010
then held.
Uh,

227
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:47.770
it doesn't to esoteric subject for just a handful of people.

228
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:52.520
And of course these days it's estimate that 30% of GDP,

229
00:14:52.521 --> 00:14:53.540
but it could be higher,

230
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.070
isn't some sense directly connected to the results of quantum mechanics where

231
00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:01.400
it's integrated circuits,
nanomaterials,
lasers.

232
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.820
And of course with the advent of quantum computing,

233
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.770
this only will increase this percentage,
uh,
the life sciences.

234
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.760
Oh,
I think any breakthrough we have seen in life sciences,

235
00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:17.100
whether it's the discovery of the structure of DNA,
uh,

236
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.800
of gene genetic code,

237
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.570
a gene editing at all was curiosity driven research.

238
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.320
And perhaps the biggest story in the last few hundred years has been a

239
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:29.960
tremendous progress in a health.

240
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:35.230
So the fact that lifespan life expectancy in the west basically tripled in 250

241
00:15:37.581 --> 00:15:39.590
years.
It's amazing fact of history.

242
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.190
It's not sure where it's taught in history causes because it's something that

243
00:15:43.191 --> 00:15:44.630
takes place over centuries.

244
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:49.340
But because of hygiene and medical research that actually made a tremendous

245
00:15:49.341 --> 00:15:52.640
impact on the lives of everyone.
Uh,

246
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.730
and in fact there was another thing which I,

247
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:59.870
that will be the next book would be about the uselessness of the usefulness of

248
00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:02.360
useless knowledge because it's like a third order effect.

249
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.720
And that this very practical thing get give rise again to basic research.

250
00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:11.900
And my favorite example is super conductivity superconductivity was discovered

251
00:16:11.901 --> 00:16:12.770
in 1911.

252
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.800
If you cool materials very called electric current starts to go basically at no

253
00:16:18.321 --> 00:16:19.540
cost.
Uh,

254
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.990
which means that you can build very strong magnets while the strong magnets of

255
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:28.520
course are used in transportation,
but they also used in Fmri scanners.

256
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.110
And you could think of the whole field of neuroscience only could develop

257
00:16:33.111 --> 00:16:35.780
because of these incredible progress in magnets.

258
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:41.380
And these days or many quantum computer elements also of course really use these

259
00:16:42.441 --> 00:16:46.460
magnets and he's very kind of low temperatures.
But the best example,
the lowest,

260
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:47.070
the,

261
00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:51.370
the place we think in the universe that is the coldest place in the universe and

262
00:16:51.371 --> 00:16:54.020
it has the largest magnet is uh,

263
00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:58.280
actually the large Hadron collider in certain Geneva.
And,

264
00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.210
um,

265
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:03.830
it's because of the magnet technology and the superconductivity being used there

266
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:08.090
that actually led to the discovery of the Higgs Boson.
And remarkable,

267
00:17:08.091 --> 00:17:11.920
the theory behind the Higgs Boson is a very close relatives to the theory of,

268
00:17:11.921 --> 00:17:13.380
of the Sucre conductivity.

269
00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:18.020
So in some sense we went through a full cycle from an abstract physical

270
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:21.830
discovery through applications back to fundamental physics.

271
00:17:21.831 --> 00:17:25.610
And it's good to remind that Peter Higgs,
uh,
even in,

272
00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.220
in physics itself,
there are long timeline snow.

273
00:17:28.221 --> 00:17:33.221
It took 50 years from the original idea to the Nobel prize.

274
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.830
So the first 10,
first decade,
he was totally ignored.

275
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.920
Then it was a decade where people really read the paper and we've got an

276
00:17:39.921 --> 00:17:43.040
interested then another decade designing the machine,

277
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:46.340
a decade building the machine and a decade running the machine.

278
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.710
And when Peter Higgs at the announcement said,

279
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.690
with tears in his eyes that he was happy to see the discovery in his lifetime,

280
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:59.690
um,
I think it was 84 at that time,
that he was very serious.
I was,

281
00:17:59.691 --> 00:18:03.850
could easily have took another decade or decade or two.
Uh,

282
00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:07.830
another good example is the discovery of gravitational waves that we will have

283
00:18:07.831 --> 00:18:12.260
witnessed.
Uh,
uh,
uh,
roughly,
uh,
was announced a year ago a,

284
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.940
but the discovery was in September,
2015.

285
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.700
That was a hundred year prediction where Albert Einstein,

286
00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:22.500
so he didn't leave live to actually see this.
But of course we as a,

287
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:26.740
as a,
as a,
as a human society we did.
I always like to think,
you know,

288
00:18:26.741 --> 00:18:31.320
in some sense cosmologists are a good framework because they know exactly what

289
00:18:31.321 --> 00:18:33.150
they don't know.
As you know,
in cosmology,

290
00:18:33.151 --> 00:18:38.151
we know that roughly 5% of the contents of the universe is known as exists,

291
00:18:40.081 --> 00:18:42.840
have no material,
there's 95% still to be discovered.

292
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:48.210
And I think this is exactly,
uh,
what,
uh,
cosmologies want to do.
So I feel,

293
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.310
I mean in basic science we are a little bit like the old explorers.

294
00:18:52.311 --> 00:18:55.230
If it has these kind of wonderful maps,
part of it was covered,

295
00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.630
but then it was a large part which was unknown.

296
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:02.100
And these cartographers would draw these kind of sea monsters in it,
right?

297
00:19:02.101 --> 00:19:05.190
Because that's,
you know,
I am imagination fills that empty space.

298
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:09.930
But the role of basic science is to explore this.
And I could actually,

299
00:19:09.931 --> 00:19:13.230
I want to argue,
and I think you are probably preaching to the choir here,

300
00:19:13.231 --> 00:19:18.120
but it's that we are in some sense more exciting moment in a time of basic

301
00:19:18.121 --> 00:19:21.330
research because you know,
off,
you could frame it like this.

302
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:24.750
What is the most important thing ever discovered in science?

303
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.070
And one way to phrase this about the world would kind of disappear and you're

304
00:19:29.071 --> 00:19:32.130
still able to communicate one line,

305
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.670
say one Twitter message to the next generation.

306
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.370
What would the hint you would give to the next generation of,

307
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:43.020
of budding scientist?
And my line would actually be a this,

308
00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:46.560
that all matter of the earth and the cosmos consist of particles a billion times

309
00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:47.820
smaller than everyday object.

310
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.290
The fact that we have discovered the building blocks of matter of life is

311
00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:56.940
incredibly important.
Uh,
I was thinking,
I suppose you give a child a toy,

312
00:19:56.941 --> 00:20:00.570
you can give it a metal car or one made of Lego blocks.

313
00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:06.170
And if you go back to the child to two children a few weeks later,

314
00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:11.190
the one who was getting the,
the legal actually would build something else.

315
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:15.200
So I think actually we are now in a phase where it's really a matter of our,

316
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.720
what are we going to build now that we discovered the building blocks of nature.

317
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.630
And we see this,
you know,
in,
in,

318
00:20:20.631 --> 00:20:25.140
in the material sciences where now we can basically build materials atom by
atom.

319
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.930
You see this in life sciences where we have,
uh,

320
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:34.130
synthetic biology can produce things that no only imagination can think of.

321
00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:36.120
So would like to say,
you know,

322
00:20:36.121 --> 00:20:41.121
in the old model where the sciences are exploring nature and we kind of know

323
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.910
what we don't know.
So we want to cover the whole map.
Uh,

324
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.860
we are now in a stage of development where we are not looking at nature,

325
00:20:48.861 --> 00:20:50.380
what we building nature ourselves.

326
00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:54.850
So it's basically the space of everything we can make and how we find our ways

327
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:56.410
in this kind of vast space.

328
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.450
And I think that that is the exciting moment where basic research is.

329
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.230
So why would you have basic research?
And I think we can raise,

330
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.100
revisit flexing his argument.
Well,

331
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:13.240
I think the first and foremost thing to say is that clearly we want to argue

332
00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:14.950
that knowledge,
you know,

333
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:18.980
in an office itself is incredibly important.
Uh,

334
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.970
and that's true for the sciences.
That's true for the humanities.

335
00:21:21.971 --> 00:21:25.150
It's true for the arts,
but there are some extra layers.

336
00:21:25.151 --> 00:21:30.151
And that's exactly where Flexner and I'm trying to add to it is we know that's a

337
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:34.030
basic science,
develops new tools and techniques.
As a particle physicist,

338
00:21:34.031 --> 00:21:39.031
I'm a oblige then to say that the worldwide web was developed in terms of Co

339
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.840
could we facilitate the communications through thousands and thousands of

340
00:21:43.841 --> 00:21:46.880
particle physicist to an original?

341
00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:48.700
When are they able to read each other's rap pages,

342
00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:52.210
but also right on the cheaters on,
on the web pages.
Uh,

343
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:57.010
then of course it's attracting the best minds who then can go out again here I

344
00:21:57.011 --> 00:22:01.030
have to say the theoretical physicists went into the financial markets and

345
00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.910
basically destroyed the world.
I think so it should be giving credit to death.

346
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:10.900
Um,
also important to realize is certainly here.
I think as,
as you know,

347
00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:16.020
it's very difficult to capture the full profits of basic research because they

348
00:22:16.361 --> 00:22:20.200
will flow across disciplines.
They flow across regions,
across countries,

349
00:22:20.201 --> 00:22:24.880
across generations.
And so in many ways it's a true public boot,

350
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:29.950
uh,
ecommerce to have not done a good job.
It putting the right numbers there.

351
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.860
So if you ask any economist,
what is the investment,

352
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.060
the return on investment of a dollar spent on basic research,

353
00:22:37.061 --> 00:22:41.980
you get all kinds of numbers between four and 15.
But it's a big multiplier.

354
00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:46.000
And I would wish that some,
since we could argue more particular,

355
00:22:46.001 --> 00:22:48.940
I think because it's without a doubt,
as I said,

356
00:22:48.941 --> 00:22:52.990
it's a public good and it's something that in the end I think needs to be

357
00:22:52.991 --> 00:22:57.880
publicly supportive.
And of course it leads to plenty of innovation startups.

358
00:22:57.881 --> 00:23:02.770
And you know,
here in MIT,
close to MIT,
we are some sense that,
uh,
kind of the,

359
00:23:02.771 --> 00:23:07.630
the,
the,
the very epicenter of this tremendous effort.
And,

360
00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.940
uh,
and you,
you are some sentence,
the embodiment,

361
00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:14.500
this Google is of course an embodiment of this.
Um,
but if you see,
you know,

362
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.410
how federal and,
uh,
for instance,

363
00:23:17.411 --> 00:23:22.411
support for research has developed and I can imagine a Flexner coming back and

364
00:23:22.421 --> 00:23:25.450
tell us,
okay,
tell us what happened in the,
in the intervening years.

365
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.190
And the first part of my story would be best.
Very positive.
Of course.
No,

366
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:34.030
he has seen that after World War Two,
uh,
there was this terrific,
uh,

367
00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.700
current and of support.
Uh,

368
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.700
there was the famous report by Vulva Bush Science,

369
00:23:39.701 --> 00:23:41.480
the endless frontier that led to the,

370
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.530
to the creation to national science foundation,

371
00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.210
not only in this country but across the world,
uh,

372
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.900
and currently increase in basic research,
uh,

373
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:55.580
with and not that many strings attached.
And that kind of peaked as a,

374
00:23:55.581 --> 00:24:00.560
as you see on this graph as a percentage of GDP around 64,

375
00:24:00.561 --> 00:24:04.130
which was the height both of the Cold War and the space race.

376
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.030
And then it went down and it has been basically a steady decline.

377
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.880
It's something even no,
uh,

378
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:15.830
only vaguely correlated with the political color of the administration.

379
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.170
And we see this,
uh,
and you see that in some sense the,
uh,

380
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.690
the defense and non defense components have been roughly in balance.

381
00:24:23.691 --> 00:24:28.190
So roughly 50% of what this country spends on research and development will be

382
00:24:28.191 --> 00:24:31.820
defense oriented.
The other one is not.
If you look,
for instance,

383
00:24:31.821 --> 00:24:34.160
at the National Institute of Health in real dollars,

384
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:37.160
apart from the stimulus money in 2009,

385
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.770
it had basically declined by roughly 20,

386
00:24:39.771 --> 00:24:42.950
25% over the last 15 years.

387
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:47.230
And of course this point as you know very well,
uh,
it's,

388
00:24:47.231 --> 00:24:51.200
it's threatened by even more severe cuts,
uh,
with the,
uh,
the presence,

389
00:24:51.201 --> 00:24:54.230
so called skinny budget of the current administration.

390
00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.290
But this had been Maureen trends.
Uh,

391
00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:02.380
if you look at the share of r and d expenditure by the various resources you see

392
00:25:04.101 --> 00:25:07.950
also that,
you know,
uh,
uh,
the corporate world,
uh,

393
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.520
in some sense has never been a very,

394
00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.250
very strongly supportive with roughly now Spence,

395
00:25:13.251 --> 00:25:18.251
I think 6% of all r and d money on basic research.

396
00:25:18.291 --> 00:25:20.110
So it's typically something that,
uh,

397
00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:25.150
where public funding and philanthropy and universities play an incredible role.

398
00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:29.450
And if you talk to the next generation young scientist,

399
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:34.080
there's a lot of complaint end.
They are worrying about job,
uh,

400
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.930
about grants,
about jobs.

401
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:41.230
It turns out that the kind of success rates for grant application for young

402
00:25:41.361 --> 00:25:45.440
scientists at this time is roughly half of what it was,

403
00:25:45.441 --> 00:25:48.110
what it was in the early eighties.
So,
uh,

404
00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:52.330
in some sense the senior scientist around in academia and elsewhere,
uh,

405
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:56.450
we're living in a much better time and are still in a much better position I

406
00:25:56.451 --> 00:26:00.770
think in terms of the next generations.
So why,
uh,

407
00:26:00.771 --> 00:26:02.540
this kind of lack of success,

408
00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:07.541
while the arguments that Flexner makes it so powerful and I think it's good to

409
00:26:08.181 --> 00:26:11.660
have a conversation about this,
there are many forces that are,
uh,

410
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:15.200
I think at fault.
Uh,
definitely I think,
you know,

411
00:26:15.201 --> 00:26:19.970
this shorter attention span of politicians of company is driving this.

412
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.360
But also there's a thing that I would like to call the knowledge paradox because

413
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.180
how does science interacts with society?
And you know,

414
00:26:26.181 --> 00:26:29.840
this is kind of a paradox that whatever we do in research,

415
00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.050
we can dig deeper and some,

416
00:26:32.051 --> 00:26:36.190
so the results of research are more difficult to understand.
Now,

417
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.390
if you really want to understand what's happening,
you know,

418
00:26:38.391 --> 00:26:42.380
in electronic a appliance or in a new drug,

419
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:47.370
you have to know a lot of detail.
So in some sense it moves infinitely far away.

420
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.780
On the other hand,
the products of science are everywhere around us,
no in,
uh,

421
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.490
in our pockets,
in our phones,
in our medicines,
everywhere.

422
00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:01.530
So I feel this kind of interface between science and society becomes this kind

423
00:27:01.531 --> 00:27:04.910
of fractal thing.
It's kind of signs being atomized there.

424
00:27:04.911 --> 00:27:07.260
This is kind of little pockets of knowledge,

425
00:27:07.261 --> 00:27:10.110
very specialized and they're everywhere around us,

426
00:27:10.111 --> 00:27:13.500
but they become basically invisible and it's much more difficult to make the

427
00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:17.940
case,
I think these days.
Um,
and this is something that,
you know,

428
00:27:17.941 --> 00:27:19.070
a Flexner,
uh,

429
00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:23.610
was very much aware of it and I think the most important point that he makes in

430
00:27:23.611 --> 00:27:26.550
the book,
and I want to kind of finish on that,
on that note,

431
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.620
on that theme is curiosity.
Uh,
you know,

432
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.280
he makes basically another point.
He says,

433
00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:37.290
this is wonderful ability of human beings to see things that are in there,

434
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:42.800
to imagine things that aren't easily to imagine for most of us.

435
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.410
And it's this ability that,
uh,

436
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:51.180
is so powerful and it actually is being used,
whether it be used in companies,

437
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.060
in,
in,
in,
in academic world or an education.

438
00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.370
I think that actually I feel is in some sense,

439
00:27:56.371 --> 00:28:00.360
perhaps the most important argument why we have to create these kind of

440
00:28:00.361 --> 00:28:03.570
environments as Flexner writes,
curiosity,

441
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:08.430
which may or may not eventually,
uh,
eventually there's something useful,

442
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.640
although it's good to,
somebody said,
you know,
you have,

443
00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:16.641
we have to distinguish applied research and not yet applied research because how

444
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:21.660
can you argue that something is totally useless and will be forever useless?

445
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.590
Uh,
you never know.
For instance,
a hundred years ago,

446
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.490
number theorists,
we're very proud to,
their field was totally useless.

447
00:28:29.491 --> 00:28:31.230
And the beauty of the prime numbers.

448
00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:35.790
And now because of coding actually number theories at the very center of

449
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.170
Cybersecurity,
et Cetera.

450
00:28:37.171 --> 00:28:40.470
I have one colleague who says he wants to improve some big math theorem

451
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:45.960
factorization of prime numbers so that he can liberate his subjects from the

452
00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:50.940
chains of applicability and make it again,
useless.
Uh,

453
00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:55.620
so you never know,
but curiosity is Flexner writes,
it goes back,
you know,

454
00:28:55.621 --> 00:28:59.370
it's outstanding characteristic of more than thinking.
It goes back to Galileo,

455
00:28:59.371 --> 00:29:03.420
Bacon,
Newton,
and as much as we absolutely unhampered and have a little anecdote,

456
00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:07.440
uh,
this is,
uh,
Jacobi was fun at half.

457
00:29:07.441 --> 00:29:09.150
He was a chemist.
In fact,

458
00:29:09.151 --> 00:29:12.360
he was the first one to win the Nobel prize in Chemistry.

459
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:14.250
He was Dutch show at that point.

460
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:19.230
The Dutch totally cornered the market of Nobel prizes in chemistry.
And in fact,

461
00:29:19.231 --> 00:29:22.830
his big insight was that molecules per three dimensional.

462
00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.080
Now this will say if you take a molecule,

463
00:29:25.081 --> 00:29:29.100
you look at this mirror image might be different molecule and it might have

464
00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:32.700
different chemical reactions.
That's,
that's kind of a new concept.
In fact,

465
00:29:32.701 --> 00:29:35.490
you'll see some someone's,
the models in which he was kind of demonstrating this.

466
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.090
Um,
and uh,
he was pretty famous.

467
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.860
I actually went to a high school which has a big statue to him,

468
00:29:41.861 --> 00:29:46.550
so I've passed that,
that statue,
uh,
uh,
every day I think you were be,

469
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.590
we are not,
uh,
you know,
uh,

470
00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.380
honoring our scientific heroes in that fashion anymore.
Um,

471
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.500
and she would just kind of chiral molecules was a very important thing.

472
00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:57.251
It's to know,
as you know,

473
00:29:57.251 --> 00:30:01.570
all of life sciences depends on the current reality of these molecules from DNA

474
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:06.700
down.
But the point was,
dad,
you know,
he was criticized as,
as,
as a scientist,

475
00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.110
but as a Jew,

476
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:13.110
young scientist by his seniors that he didn't use too much imagination.

477
00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.590
I think he is at that point,

478
00:30:14.591 --> 00:30:18.340
he was working at the veterinary school and one colleague said,
well,

479
00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:23.490
you just consider it more comfortable to Mount Pegosys you to flying horse and

480
00:30:23.981 --> 00:30:28.570
just go and fly to the Mount Parnassus and just declare of things.

481
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:31.960
Or instead of the painstaking me,
the riving do results.

482
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.460
And from his whole for so upset by the criticism that the money was finally made

483
00:30:36.461 --> 00:30:37.270
a professor,

484
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:42.270
his inaugural lecture was about imagination in science and he approached the

485
00:30:42.671 --> 00:30:43.840
subject scientifically.

486
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:49.200
So we took a sample off the 200 most famous scientist of last 200 years and put

487
00:30:50.141 --> 00:30:51.370
them in three categories.

488
00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:55.240
The first category was scientist with imagine it without imagination,

489
00:30:55.241 --> 00:30:59.350
so no interest in the arts and poetry and painting music.

490
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:05.020
The second was those with imagination and there was a third category,

491
00:31:05.021 --> 00:31:09.850
but he called scientists with perverse imagination.
That is,
uh,
uh,

492
00:31:09.851 --> 00:31:13.930
the wanted to go to al comedian wants to do metaphysical stuff,
et cetera.

493
00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.730
And if fact in that category,
it's a,

494
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:21.600
contains a deck cards like needs Newton on pair a Wallace.

495
00:31:21.601 --> 00:31:22.434
So,
uh,

496
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:27.100
actually it's the real famous scientists are in death and that buckets and you

497
00:31:27.101 --> 00:31:31.660
know,
a Newton famously became an alchemist.
Then you can perhaps understand why,

498
00:31:31.661 --> 00:31:34.120
you know,
because he,
he,
uh,
somebody sat,

499
00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.870
Newton must have been the happiest person,

500
00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:42.430
whoever lifts in the history of the planet because only one person can be the

501
00:31:42.431 --> 00:31:47.380
first to discover that there was a system in the world.
Uh,

502
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.350
and uh,
of course he some sense invented modern,

503
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:54.280
deterministic science and the fact that you,

504
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:59.630
if you have unified the laws of gravity for the heavenly bodies and on earth and

505
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.600
funded fundamental laws of mechanics,
why not also fun?

506
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:08.770
Find a fundamental laws of history,
of religion,
of alchemy.

507
00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.900
Uh,
and you know,
you can make gold out of lads.
It only takes a nuclear reactions.

508
00:32:13.901 --> 00:32:18.280
Those of us done done 10 years ago.
So,
um,
it's uh,

509
00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:23.110
clearly,
you know,
he,
his Emma imagination reached further than a,

510
00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:28.000
that the science of his time would allow an Einstein also famous sent you that

511
00:32:28.001 --> 00:32:32.520
imagination is more important than knowledge for knowledge is limited to all we

512
00:32:32.521 --> 00:32:36.340
know and understandable image generation embraces the entire world.

513
00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.530
Put a picture of a mechanism of a young eyes said here,

514
00:32:38.531 --> 00:32:41.410
because you all know the story that Einstein,
I think it was five year olds,

515
00:32:41.411 --> 00:32:44.330
it was given a mechanism and he was fascinated.

516
00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:48.200
Well a Kompass fascinated that the needle was always pointing in the right

517
00:32:48.201 --> 00:32:49.034
direction.

518
00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:53.750
But then he also describes that he walked with the compass through the room and

519
00:32:53.751 --> 00:32:57.920
you know,
to wait a moment,
there must be something that the steering the compass.

520
00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:02.060
So as a five year old,
he was basically in discovering the magnetic fields.

521
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:03.410
And of course,
you know,

522
00:33:03.411 --> 00:33:07.130
in some sense it's great contribution to science was discovered the

523
00:33:07.131 --> 00:33:11.540
gravitational fields and think of it as something permeating all space.

524
00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.990
Uh,
so he clearly had a very,

525
00:33:14.991 --> 00:33:17.180
very bright imagination at a young age.

526
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:22.280
And I think we not doing enough to stimulate imagination and creativity.
This,

527
00:33:22.281 --> 00:33:25.700
this famous test you have undoubtedly read about it,

528
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:30.710
which a test that's done with a NASA engineers and you know,

529
00:33:30.711 --> 00:33:34.190
2% of them pass the test.
And then it was one person who said,
well,

530
00:33:34.191 --> 00:33:36.620
let's take the test to five year olds and see how they do.

531
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:40.610
And the 90th 98% pass at 10 year old,

532
00:33:40.611 --> 00:33:44.570
only 30% of 15 years,
12%.
So I think actually,

533
00:33:44.571 --> 00:33:48.860
I mean one instruction we should give to people in the education fields don't

534
00:33:48.861 --> 00:33:50.080
touch that button.
You know,

535
00:33:50.081 --> 00:33:53.450
at the end the imagination properties turned on at the very beginning.

536
00:33:53.451 --> 00:33:54.190
And we are,

537
00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:59.190
we put a lot of effort in and learning skills to imagine and create and often

538
00:34:00.441 --> 00:34:03.650
then at universities and other research institutes,

539
00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:07.280
we work very hard to relearn these kinds of qualities.

540
00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:12.500
And this might be something I feel that,
uh,
the only point where I,
when my defer,

541
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.580
my points differ.

542
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:18.730
This Flexner Flexner felt that basic research scholarship is good as it is.

543
00:34:19.890 --> 00:34:23.420
So scientists who rewarded and just let them do whatever they will do.

544
00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.100
In some sense he was an [inaudible].
No.
When,
uh,

545
00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:29.810
Einstein came to the institute in 1933,

546
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.020
he was invited by President Roosevelt to the White House.

547
00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:38.180
A Flexner intercepted that letter and he wrote back,
well,
uh,

548
00:34:38.181 --> 00:34:41.270
you will understand professor Einstein is a very important scientist.

549
00:34:41.271 --> 00:34:45.440
He's very busy and he has to focus on this research.
Uh,
I signed,

550
00:34:45.441 --> 00:34:49.790
was very upset when this happens and made himself be reinvited.

551
00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:51.620
He also then opened his own meal.

552
00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:55.900
And this might actually be the reason why we have the slightly negative,
uh,

553
00:34:56.030 --> 00:35:00.440
quotes about Flexner.
Uh,
so it didn't go along very well.

554
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.830
And I think Einstein actually,
it wasn't in some sense a perfect example,

555
00:35:03.831 --> 00:35:08.780
somebody who was able to reach a large audience and spoke when he became the

556
00:35:08.781 --> 00:35:12.080
canonical scientists,
not only because of the scientific work,

557
00:35:12.081 --> 00:35:16.890
but also think has moral compass and how we,
uh,
one thing I learned,
uh,

558
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:17.840
to my surprise,

559
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:22.340
but being in Princeton is that he spent a lot of time on this wonderful

560
00:35:22.341 --> 00:35:25.730
quotations.
You might think,
oh,
it just came up with that,
you know,

561
00:35:25.731 --> 00:35:27.640
he thought about it and he,
he,

562
00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.160
he's coped with them just as the sculpted his mathematical equations and what

563
00:35:31.161 --> 00:35:35.060
are you were done,
you would cut them out and put them in a wooden box.

564
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:40.200
So I would like to say he was actually using Twitter,
uh,
50 years before,
uh,

565
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:44.340
before it was discovered.
And I think this is something that we can know.

566
00:35:44.341 --> 00:35:49.200
I think there's a,
a large audience that we can reach out to and,

567
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:54.100
um,
want to close with one final anecdote,
which is that,
uh,

568
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:59.370
now a few years ago I wasn't on Dutch television and,
uh,
it just had loans,

569
00:35:59.371 --> 00:36:03.290
a website with experiments for young children.
And,
uh,

570
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:08.130
it's such a pretty popular website.
And,
uh,
and they asked me,

571
00:36:08.131 --> 00:36:10.380
can you do an experiment?
So I should have brought it here,

572
00:36:10.381 --> 00:36:11.880
but it's an experiment.
You can do it at home.

573
00:36:11.881 --> 00:36:16.881
She would take a balloon filled with water and then hold it a above somebody,

574
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:21.810
uh,
hats and then take a lighter or a match and tried to burn a hole in it,
uh,

575
00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.820
and will not work.
Uh,
and I did it and then I explained why.

576
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:29.790
He said,
well,
you know,
if you have an empty kettle on the stove,

577
00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:34.170
it gets hot very fast.
If it's filled with water,
it takes a lot of time,

578
00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:38.550
has to do with thermodynamic properties of water.
He'd capacity.

579
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.850
That's why if you live close to the sea,
and if a moderate climate,

580
00:36:41.851 --> 00:36:44.310
so I had my little spiel and explain some basic physics.

581
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:48.300
So I felt very happy with that.
And the next morning get an email from a very,

582
00:36:48.301 --> 00:36:51.020
very distinguished that physicists,
they said,
rob,
Robert,
I liked,

583
00:36:51.021 --> 00:36:52.920
I saw you on television.
I like the experiments,

584
00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.410
but you explanation was of course,
totally wrong.
So I get this sinking feeling,

585
00:36:58.411 --> 00:37:02.070
you know,
you know,
uh,
he never,
he'll never speak out.
And then he said,
no,
no,
no.

586
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.550
You didn't show the experiments to explain sermon and attics.

587
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:11.630
You did shogi experiments to explain the phenomena of a law of nature.

588
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:17.160
This is scientific principle that's for beat you to burn the whole.

589
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:21.450
And uh,
that's why you know that this party trick works.

590
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:24.840
And that actually is something that you should have said.

591
00:37:24.841 --> 00:37:28.680
And I think it's right now if you ask me if this month thing,

592
00:37:28.681 --> 00:37:33.240
if I could wave a magic wand and make everybody in the world understand one

593
00:37:33.241 --> 00:37:36.450
thing from signs,
what would you pick?
Um,

594
00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:39.450
I'm probably wouldn't be able to do within the one tweet,

595
00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:44.190
but I would like to have everybody understand the scientific method to fact that

596
00:37:44.191 --> 00:37:48.990
are,
you can do experiments,
you can learn about facts,
you can have some idea.

597
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.350
It can disprove it.
You learn again,
you do another experiment.

598
00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:55.210
You've again and uh,
and that's,
uh,

599
00:37:55.290 --> 00:38:00.290
has been incredibly successful method and I think that's something that we can

600
00:38:00.331 --> 00:38:02.820
spread and it's something that people should know.

601
00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:07.630
So I feel this perhaps the way to kind of bridge this gap that I've,

602
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:11.460
I worry about that we have this terrific research.
And I said,

603
00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:14.130
I don't think they're an Afa had been more opportunities there.

604
00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:18.210
Now I think every scientist and every time the history of science has said this

605
00:38:18.211 --> 00:38:20.760
and they were all right because it's just a growing,

606
00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.320
it's an exponential growth in function.

607
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:25.680
So it's getting better and better and better.
We are in this terrific moment,

608
00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:27.990
but we aren't able to make the case.

609
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:33.590
And in some sense society is kind of starting to decouple and I think we have to

610
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:38.800
cross bridge and again make the case that uh,

611
00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:43.300
that Flexner makes,
uh,
an extremely powerful way.

612
00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:44.950
And um,

613
00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:50.310
so perhaps I want to kind of end by just because we are a kind of a complicated

614
00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:54.220
political situation here and across the world,

615
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:59.200
but it reminds you to flex and wrote about all of this in October 39,
which was,

616
00:38:59.201 --> 00:39:04.000
as I said,
not the best of times.
So this is the way he opens the essay.

617
00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:09.610
Is it not a curious fact that in a world steeped and in racial hatred with

618
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.760
threatened civilization itself,
men and women,

619
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:18.060
old and young detach themselves wholly or partly from the Aaron Greek current of

620
00:39:18.581 --> 00:39:22.150
daily life to devote themselves to the cultivation of beauty,

621
00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.300
to the extension of knowledge,
to the cure of disease,

622
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.480
to remuneration of suffering.
Just as though fanatics,

623
00:39:28.481 --> 00:39:32.980
we're not simultaneously engaged in spreading pain in,

624
00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:35.380
uh,
ugliness and suffering.

625
00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.850
The world has always been a sorry and confused sort of place.

626
00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:45.210
Yet poets and artists and scientists have ignored the factors that woot if

627
00:39:45.371 --> 00:39:50.290
attended to paralyze them.
So I think these are very wise words.
They are,

628
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.310
they should be right again.

629
00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:54.850
So I'm very happy that I'm now on this kind of book tour.

630
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:58.600
[inaudible] a famous or coauthor Abraham Flexner.
Thank you very much.

631
00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:09.980
<v 4>Hmm.
Thank you very much.
Wonderful talk and the questions.</v>

632
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:13.730
Thank you for the fascinating talk.
As you say,

633
00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.240
you're preaching to the choir here.
Yes,

634
00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:20.120
we all came through one or another higher institute of Education.

635
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:24.530
We've been propagandized about this quite successfully.
We all believe it.

636
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:27.320
And I'm not saying I don't.
Um,

637
00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.990
but one question that's unclear,

638
00:40:29.991 --> 00:40:33.050
it's clear that the curiosity is a driver for many things,

639
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:36.740
but in modern society,

640
00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:41.240
research including basic research has become an industry and flexor in some

641
00:40:41.241 --> 00:40:45.290
sense in invented that.
Yeah.
Street,
uh,
with one small institute.

642
00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.580
So when we now have,
I don't know what it is,

643
00:40:49.581 --> 00:40:53.330
millions of people engaged in basic and not so basic research.

644
00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.020
How do we as a society decide how to spend,

645
00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:59.420
how much money to spend on that research?

646
00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:04.370
Why do we believe that distinguished professors of physics should have upper

647
00:41:04.371 --> 00:41:09.371
middle class lifestyles and not just be driven by their curiosity and maybe a

648
00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:13.120
funding for their equipment?
Uh,
how do we think about these things?
And I,

649
00:41:13.121 --> 00:41:16.940
and I say this as a member of,
of the class that benefits from all this.

650
00:41:16.941 --> 00:41:17.580
Of course.

651
00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:21.200
<v 2>No,
it's a very good question.
And it's,
I mean,
in,
in in some sense in,
in,</v>

652
00:41:21.201 --> 00:41:26.201
in its basic form would be indeed how much time and money and energy should be

653
00:41:27.121 --> 00:41:28.200
spent on these efforts.

654
00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:32.730
And one thing I found kind of surprising is that I know even as a society,

655
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:38.280
uh,
nope going,
we made lots of progress.
You said No.

656
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:43.130
Some sense we've seen this whole architecture of the scientific enterprise being

657
00:41:43.131 --> 00:41:43.964
built.

658
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:48.320
We didn't spend that much time arguing about why this particular architecture.

659
00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:52.700
Now what are the economic arguments,
uh,
how are we,
uh,

660
00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:56.990
I'm advocating in the book of what you need is a kind of a well balanced

661
00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:00.620
portfolio of research projects.
How do we look at this?
I think actually,

662
00:42:00.621 --> 00:42:05.621
honestly we look in a more deliberate and sensible way at financial investments

663
00:42:08.031 --> 00:42:10.610
and how they are.
How much risk do you want to take?

664
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:14.300
How much correlation do you want between the various issues?
How much long term,

665
00:42:14.301 --> 00:42:18.350
how much shorter than we do in research.
Because in some sense it's,
no,
it's a,

666
00:42:18.351 --> 00:42:21.620
it's a little bit fly by your pants and intuitive.
Uh,

667
00:42:21.621 --> 00:42:25.760
one thing we see is that these days there are a lot of quantify the quantifiable

668
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:30.650
metrics,
but they have serious problems because what we see is that what they do,

669
00:42:30.651 --> 00:42:35.240
they drive research around the world all to the same spots.

670
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:39.560
So we get this kind of regression to the mean and a lot of boring research is

671
00:42:39.561 --> 00:42:42.980
being done.
So I don't have the answer,

672
00:42:42.981 --> 00:42:46.400
but I think we should have a serious conversation about these issues also about

673
00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:50.210
now what is the percentage,
so to say,
what is the right percentage to spend?

674
00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:55.400
I know in this company you're can,
if you want,
spend 20% on other projects,

675
00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.530
at least it's a number.
So I think society's haven't put a number there.
They,

676
00:43:00.531 --> 00:43:04.550
I think the first approximation good is to take the world average or something.

677
00:43:04.551 --> 00:43:09.551
And that's often how we argue are we behind or a ahead of our competitors.

678
00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:13.970
But I think we need a serious discussion about this.
And I think,
you know,

679
00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:17.090
in certain enterprises,
I think particularly in the life sciences,

680
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.130
the current architecture is totally unsustainable.
No,
if you have a,

681
00:43:22.131 --> 00:43:23.300
it's been indicated they've,

682
00:43:23.301 --> 00:43:27.580
every researcher kind of breeds 10 more that then have their own,

683
00:43:27.581 --> 00:43:31.280
their research group.
You get an exponential function.
That's clearly these days.

684
00:43:31.281 --> 00:43:35.330
If you are life scientists who are in your mid thirties forties when you get

685
00:43:35.331 --> 00:43:37.790
your first,
typically your first NIH grant,

686
00:43:37.791 --> 00:43:42.791
so you basically reach independence at age 45 that's not a very attractive.

687
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:48.470
Uh,
and so I think that we need more research about that.

688
00:43:48.471 --> 00:43:50.060
We have sharp thinking,

689
00:43:50.061 --> 00:43:55.061
what is the role of corporations or philanthropy who can do what and why as a

690
00:43:56.841 --> 00:43:59.150
society do we value this?
And I said,
you know,

691
00:43:59.151 --> 00:44:04.151
I'm kind of disappointed that economists have had such great difficulty putting

692
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:05.391
kind of numbers.

693
00:44:05.391 --> 00:44:09.710
They're asked by the way they have in the more broader field of education,

694
00:44:09.711 --> 00:44:12.200
it's very difficult to make the case there.
What,

695
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.090
how does an investment in your education,

696
00:44:14.091 --> 00:44:18.230
and they were kind of education lead to,
uh,
for instance your personal gains.

697
00:44:18.231 --> 00:44:22.070
But I think here it's really as a society that we have to have and it's a

698
00:44:22.071 --> 00:44:26.710
running target,
so to say,
because,
uh,
science itself,
if developing it's,

699
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:29.480
it's grown and become more international.
Uh,

700
00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:34.540
some of the costs of the experiments are really becoming very large.

701
00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:36.750
And,
uh,

702
00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:41.250
and I feel that we spent very little time discussing this.

703
00:44:41.251 --> 00:44:43.980
We also spend very little time arguing for science.

704
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:48.690
Somebody once told me that the commercial product with the smallest advertising

705
00:44:48.691 --> 00:44:53.580
budgets is kitchen salt.
Now,
I've never seen a commercial about kitchen salt.

706
00:44:53.581 --> 00:44:57.750
I think,
uh,
but at science spends less in advertising.

707
00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:02.310
Uh,
and again,
if you think that we spend 30 billion,

708
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:06.810
uh,
uh,
from frontal money each year on basic research,
you know,

709
00:45:06.811 --> 00:45:09.240
how much of death is used to kind of spread the word.

710
00:45:09.241 --> 00:45:13.890
I think we were just assumed that by diffusion some of it will,
uh,
will flow.

711
00:45:13.891 --> 00:45:14.521
And I think so.

712
00:45:14.521 --> 00:45:18.480
So the best thing I can hope is that at least we have a serious discussion to

713
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:23.430
give answers.
Ideally quantifiable answers to the question.

714
00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:27.660
Very good question that you raised.
So I'll do something a little different.

715
00:45:27.661 --> 00:45:31.530
So I noticed a part of your biography that you're also a trained artist.

716
00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:37.120
Think about that.
Well,
I'm a field artist.
Uh,
so,
uh,
so I,
uh,

717
00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:41.480
I got my undergraduate in physics and then,
uh,
uh,

718
00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:46.110
as my PC at Pfizer here to host a Nobel Prize winner said to Robert,

719
00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:48.630
went to physics,
get board,
went into art school,

720
00:45:48.631 --> 00:45:52.260
got even more bored and went back.
But if you're,
there's a little anecdote,

721
00:45:52.261 --> 00:45:55.860
which I just think for me it was useful because I usually make the case that

722
00:45:55.861 --> 00:45:57.780
actually suspend two years in art school does.

723
00:45:57.810 --> 00:46:01.350
I learned how to do research and article because,
you know,

724
00:46:01.351 --> 00:46:06.060
when I was a teenager,
I was the kind of,
uh,
the character that he,

725
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:09.960
perhaps many of you had similar.
And I've got to discover it,

726
00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:13.080
the whole field of science and would take books and read and you know,

727
00:46:13.081 --> 00:46:16.530
do the calculations myself and make drawings and everything.
And I went to,

728
00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:19.530
to college and then of course you do the standard courses.

729
00:46:19.531 --> 00:46:21.930
And I had very good grades,

730
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:27.200
but I was basically just focus on getting good grades and passing the test.

731
00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:31.920
And that kind of lost interest in the field.
Uh,
I started painting,

732
00:46:31.921 --> 00:46:34.110
then I went to art school.
I was very serious about that.

733
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:38.520
I think that's my career.
But when in art school,
I shouldn't been felt liberated.

734
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:41.460
I still remember the moment I walked into the bookstore,

735
00:46:41.461 --> 00:46:45.120
I felt now I can buy a physics book again.
Uh,

736
00:46:45.121 --> 00:46:48.870
so I bought Fiskville start reading it.
So it was like,
okay,
just this is for fun.

737
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.140
And then I felt,
wait a moment.
So there was something there.

738
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:55.140
But the nice thing in art school is that,
you know,

739
00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:59.730
successful's not passing a test successful's at the end of the week if you had a

740
00:46:59.731 --> 00:47:04.080
big stack of sketches and materials,
if you have just explored.

741
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:09.320
And so I made kind of a deal with myself and go back into physics because of us,

742
00:47:09.321 --> 00:47:10.830
my first law.
Uh,

743
00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:15.890
but I will try to conserve or preserve that approach of the artists at this to

744
00:47:17.161 --> 00:47:20.820
say,
at the end of the week I wanted a big stack,

745
00:47:20.821 --> 00:47:24.720
not have sketches but of calculations and just for fun you might get home,

746
00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.390
tell my students always,
you just can't,
if you learn something,

747
00:47:27.391 --> 00:47:32.140
trying to derive it yourself.
Finding a way to kind of internalize the result.

748
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.500
I do some crazy calculation.
Uh,

749
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.100
the thing I like best in art school was that you were forced to do things that

750
00:47:39.101 --> 00:47:40.600
you didn't like.
You know,

751
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:44.820
I like to paint and I suddenly you have to do photography or printing actually

752
00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.740
was fun.
It was liberating.
So,
um,

753
00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:50.230
in some sense for me going this,

754
00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:54.370
spending these two years in art was a shortcut to a research career.

755
00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:59.260
And,
uh,
so I think that might be a lesson again that,
uh,

756
00:47:59.680 --> 00:47:59.980
uh,

757
00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:04.980
we are not always putting the right emphasis also in the way in which we educate

758
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:06.550
generations.

759
00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:11.050
I think particularly in the sciences because now it feels like math and physics

760
00:48:11.051 --> 00:48:15.820
and computer science,
it's so easy to a device,

761
00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:17.410
a perfect test,
uh,

762
00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:21.100
because it's so clear what the right and the wrong answers are.
Uh,

763
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:23.700
so we focus a lot about the right or wrong answers.

764
00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:26.110
I think we should focus more on the right and the wrong questions.

765
00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.650
So given the current political climate,
yes.

766
00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:34.720
Where do you think the center of learning is right now?

767
00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:37.760
Well,
it's clearly,
um,

768
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:44.530
there are lots of forces on it and I think it's not obvious that this country

769
00:48:44.531 --> 00:48:47.850
will be to center.
So let's first think about,
you notice clearly there's a,

770
00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:52.210
if you think of like research at this point is roughly equally distributed,

771
00:48:52.211 --> 00:48:56.890
I think,
uh,
between North America,
Europe and Asia.

772
00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:00.300
But a lot of things are happening,
but I would say to vary.

773
00:49:00.301 --> 00:49:02.950
The top segment is still skewed.

774
00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:05.080
It's still a large percentage is here in this country.

775
00:49:05.081 --> 00:49:07.930
And I think what I feel about the United States has,

776
00:49:07.931 --> 00:49:11.290
it has these kind of two wonderful characteristics that first of all,
a long,

777
00:49:11.291 --> 00:49:14.500
long history of being open to other cultures,

778
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:19.150
other nationalities and other ideas.
Uh,

779
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:23.020
it's one of the few countries that's based on a very abstract principle and the

780
00:49:23.021 --> 00:49:24.400
second ingredient is freedom.

781
00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:28.900
So autonomy of individuals but also of institutions.
Um,

782
00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:33.930
so both have been actually blossoming and no in some sense it's remarkable.

783
00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:35.680
Uh,
flexing.

784
00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:39.520
It was very critical about American universities and he predicted he had a very

785
00:49:39.521 --> 00:49:43.510
dire future and he was like totally wrong because the,

786
00:49:43.511 --> 00:49:46.270
these American universities will blossom and in the forties,
50s,

787
00:49:46.271 --> 00:49:50.020
60s and now they're everywhere.
So he was wrong about that.

788
00:49:50.021 --> 00:49:51.160
He was also wrong about,

789
00:49:51.161 --> 00:49:54.400
that's large institutions couldn't be excellent because we have some,

790
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.960
we had places like Berkeley,
which were public institutions,
huge and you know,

791
00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:03.740
top rank.
So,
uh,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the,

792
00:50:03.741 --> 00:50:08.050
the local environment I would say in this country is really very well
positioned.

793
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:11.710
Also with a kind of a pragmatic,
empirical attitudes,

794
00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:13.000
particularly for the sciences.

795
00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:16.810
I think these days it's definitely is at risk because these two fundamental

796
00:50:16.811 --> 00:50:21.811
points open to other ideas and other cultures and this kind of know this kind of

797
00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:28.170
generous financial environment that's kind of makes institutions as we have here

798
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:30.890
in the Boston area,

799
00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:34.820
a remarkable world leading institutions possible.

800
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:36.530
And um,

801
00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:41.330
know the competition is eyeing these possibilities.
And you know,

802
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:46.400
we all know that Asia is rapidly growing.
Um,
and uh,

803
00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:47.481
it's,
it's,

804
00:50:47.481 --> 00:50:52.160
it's one of the most fundamental lessons of history to see that no commercial

805
00:50:52.161 --> 00:50:54.000
centers and centers of learning,
they move,

806
00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:57.740
they typically move on the scale of a century.
Uh,

807
00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:01.640
I know that,
you know,
if you'd like to commercial center and I got some point,

808
00:51:01.641 --> 00:51:06.170
it was in Venice and then it moved north to like Antwerp,
Amsterdam,

809
00:51:06.171 --> 00:51:07.820
London,
and across the Atlantic.

810
00:51:07.821 --> 00:51:12.821
So there you can see these movements on this kind of a scale of decades and

811
00:51:13.461 --> 00:51:17.710
century.
And I think this country was both the beneficiary of a,

812
00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:20.810
of geopolitics and,
uh,

813
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:25.070
and of course of this kind of a terrific financial support.

814
00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.920
And both of these,
I think are at risk.

815
00:51:27.921 --> 00:51:32.560
So I feel this is a very dangerous time because you're really,
uh,

816
00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.930
no,
there,
there are many,
many,
many interventions can do,

817
00:51:35.931 --> 00:51:39.780
but this is really kind of a,
something like open heart surgery.
You know,

818
00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:42.710
this is really the crucial,
the crucial element that's kind of,
I think,

819
00:51:42.711 --> 00:51:45.810
kind of pumps,
uh,
both the,
uh,

820
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:48.650
both the commercial and intellectual heart of this country.

821
00:51:48.651 --> 00:51:52.490
And I think it's at risk.
And I wouldn't be surprised.
So in that sense,

822
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:57.170
even for Flexneri,
it wasn't obvious as he didn't write that it moved,

823
00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:01.710
he said,
might move if you have a strength and,
and,
and,

824
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:03.230
and will to do so.

825
00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:06.550
So I think it's at risk and I think that's something that we should,
uh,

826
00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:08.600
we should make that case very powerfully.

827
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:12.750
<v 0>Yeah.
Thank you.</v>

828
00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:16.490
[inaudible].
