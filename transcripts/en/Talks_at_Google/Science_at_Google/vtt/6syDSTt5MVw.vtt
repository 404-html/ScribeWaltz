1
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.420
It's great to be here in Singapore.
I've been really overwhelmed,
uh,
with the uh,

2
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.650
reception and those he has him that I've observed and all the different venues

3
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:19.350
that we've been in so far.
So thank you for your interest in the space.

4
00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:22.380
When I would like to hope to do tonight is maybe personalize it,

5
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:23.670
humanize it a little bit,

6
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.680
and give you an ID had vicariously when it's like to go to space and to

7
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:33.450
participate in,
in the current chapter of human exploration,

8
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.030
uh,
what we call the international space station.

9
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.380
This is the view they have up there and we're all inspired by that,
right?

10
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.560
We love space.
All of us do.
Uh,
there's,

11
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.420
I don't meet anybody that's not inspired by the vantage point that,

12
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.230
uh,

13
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.230
you have to view it as an example to look back on the earth and see the details

14
00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:58.790
of the earth like this.
In a few minutes,

15
00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:02.630
I'm going to show a video and give me some more examples of,
of a zoomed up,

16
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.750
a detail or a zoomed in detailed of a,
of the earth.

17
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.900
What you can see from this vantage point,

18
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.930
which is the international space station and how many here have seen the space

19
00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:18.440
station fly over?
Quite a few of you.
Good.

20
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.830
The a homework assignment for the rest of you is to,
uh,

21
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.060
is to go get one of those apps that are out there or go to a website on the

22
00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:30.470
Internet,
uh,
that will give you the predictions on when you'd be able to see the,

23
00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:34.010
uh,
the,
the space station fly over if you haven't done it.

24
00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:35.630
Those of you that have done it,
you know,

25
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.600
it's very inspiring to be able to see it fly over.

26
00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:42.410
It's the brightest thing in the night sky with the exception of the moon.

27
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.680
And to know that there are people on board currently six crew of six,

28
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:51.200
which is the standard crew size and international crew.
Uh,

29
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.910
we live in and working up there.
And if you get involved in,
in,
uh,

30
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.480
get on the NASA website and follow the activities along and either the NASA site

31
00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:03.710
or other sites out there that then you get engaged actually with the activities

32
00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:05.420
that are currently going on.
Uh,

33
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.780
and then to see it fly over his is really inspirational.

34
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:12.170
So I encourage you to do that if you haven't done it before.
Of course,

35
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:16.340
the challenge here in Singapore,
it is finding a cloudless night,

36
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.930
right when you do see it fly over is uh,

37
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.030
usually right after sun set or right before sunrise when it stark here and the

38
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:30.450
surface of the earth and the light is still shining on the space station.
Uh,

39
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.740
and it's so bright because of the size of it in those solar rays,

40
00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:35.840
the wings out and the the left and right,

41
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:39.950
which reflect the Sun's light and make it a bright object.

42
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.380
The unit from the surface of the earth.

43
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.390
The space station is an incredible accomplishment in and of itself.

44
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.620
Uh,
the first element was launched in 1998.

45
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.730
We finished it in 2011.

46
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.940
My first visit there was in 2000.
It was just modules,
a very small,

47
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:02.860
it was before the first,
uh,

48
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.060
expedition launched to the space station.

49
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.120
We use that term expedition to refer to the crews that go there and live there

50
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:11.320
for a long period of time.

51
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.910
The standard length of time nowadays is about six months.
Uh,

52
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.210
we launched expedition one in the fall of 2000 and a lot of people around the

53
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:25.060
world don't realize that since the fall of 2000,

54
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:28.630
we've had continuous human presence in space.
Uh,

55
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.760
currently a crew of six in the early years.

56
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:35.761
We had crews of three or two after the Columbia accident,

57
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:37.370
which of course delayed the,
uh,

58
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.930
the assembly of the space station after the loss of Columbia.

59
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.590
And our friends that were on the crew of the space shuttle was grounded for

60
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:45.550
about three years.

61
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.770
We had a very limited way to supply the space station without being able to fly

62
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:55.420
the space shuttle.
Uh,
so we reduced the crew size from three to two.

63
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:58.420
So my second flight was about halfway through assembly.

64
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.720
During that time when the shuttle was grounded and we were approved to and there

65
00:04:02.721 --> 00:04:04.060
was a six month long flight.

66
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.270
My Russian cosmic not mate and I launched about halfway through that day,

67
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.500
the shuttle started flying again.
Um,
we got added to our crew,

68
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:16.510
to my rider who had German astronaut,

69
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.910
and then we picked up assembly the space station and then finished it up.
Uh,

70
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.240
when I was there again in 2009 and 10,

71
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.530
it took about a 37,
as I recall,

72
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:34.531
shuttle flights to assemble the space station and then also support it during

73
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:37.900
the assembly.
And after that time,
we,
uh,
we,
uh,

74
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.090
of course retired the shuttle,

75
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.260
but it accomplished its primary purpose that it was designed for to put up the

76
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:48.940
space station.
And along with those 37,
a shuttle launches,
uh,

77
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.530
came about 40 Russian launches as well to put up the space station.

78
00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:55.640
So it was a huge effort.
When you think of it,

79
00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.370
the number of rocket launches it took to put it up there piece by piece over

80
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:05.371
many years from 1998 to 2011 and result is what you see here in the screen.

81
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.970
It's very big.
It didn't just appear there.

82
00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:13.320
It took a lot of work and effort piece by piece to put it up.
Uh,

83
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.700
it went together very well.
Uh,

84
00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:20.380
it's quite an impressive achievement in technology and engineering and

85
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:24.340
integration at the international level where we had elements of the space

86
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:28.810
station meet and be integrated the first time,
not on paper,

87
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.800
on paper,
on the ground,
and it was integrated on paper.
But,
uh,

88
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.500
to take a physical components of the space station in integrated minor,

89
00:05:36.501 --> 00:05:40.020
but physically for the first time in space is pretty impressive when you're

90
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.600
launching some elements from the U S and other elements from Russia.

91
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.730
I in Japanese elements from,

92
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.930
from yet another location and designed and all around the world.

93
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:51.280
So it's quite an accomplishment.

94
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.680
If you could lay the space station on the ground,

95
00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:55.510
it would be bigger than a football field.

96
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.950
If you could put it on a scale and weigh it,

97
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.320
it would weigh almost a million pounds.

98
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.490
So that gives you an idea of the size of the scope of the,

99
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:08.150
of the assembly of the space station itself,
uh,

100
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.360
on the inside where the crew lives in work,

101
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:15.020
which is the center of what you see here in the view,

102
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.410
the stack of cylinders,
if you will,
pressurized modules.
Um,

103
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.950
it's has the volume equivalent to about a 5,000 square foot house.

104
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.660
Uh,
so it's very roomy inside,
spread out,
over multiple modules.

105
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.800
The crew of six then is you think we're,
uh,
we're all,
uh,
uh,

106
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.150
living and working tied in a cluster for six months.
That's not true.

107
00:06:39.151 --> 00:06:42.620
Who we're spread out every day working in different parts of the space station.

108
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:46.570
We typically gather together for meals and whatnot.
Um,

109
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.760
but it is a huge facility,
a lot of potential ladder,

110
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.430
great history already.

111
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.960
It's got a great operation ongoing right now and it's got a very promising

112
00:06:56.961 --> 00:06:58.160
future,
uh,

113
00:06:58.161 --> 00:07:02.990
with doors that will continue to open to get on board even through things that

114
00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:07.250
were talked about earlier that the produce she talked about in other venues to

115
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:11.270
get experiments and a new technology onboard the space station.

116
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:15.110
So it's got a lot of potential,
a lot of applicability for you all here.

117
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.760
The space station itself has it in an orbit inclined to the equator if 51.6

118
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:26.620
degrees.
So the,
the,
that means as it orbits the earth,

119
00:07:26.621 --> 00:07:27.860
it crosses the equator,

120
00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:31.880
say going from south to north and goes up to 51.6 degrees.

121
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:36.110
North latitude comes back,
the other side crosses the equator down to 51,
six.

122
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.020
So a latitude,
and then,
and then back up,
uh,

123
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.250
each time it crosses the equator after a one orbit,

124
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:48.590
the Earth of course in a 24 hour rotation has rotated so that you cross the

125
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:52.340
equator about 1500 miles or so to the west of the previous orbit.

126
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.600
What that means is it's near ideal orbit,
uh,

127
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.720
to for the longterm to do observations of the earth's surface.

128
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:04.640
So it's a great platform for those studies.
You see the entire globe,

129
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.480
except for the Poles,
north and south pole.
Um,
and,

130
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.100
and the,

131
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:15.100
the phasing of the orbit means that over days and weeks you see all those

132
00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:18.230
locations on the earth in different lighting conditions,
day,
night,

133
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:20.480
different sun angles during daytime,
uh,

134
00:08:20.481 --> 00:08:23.210
you watch weather patterns go by and over weeks and months,

135
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.210
you see seasons go by.
Uh,

136
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:30.170
so it's a great platform for observing the earth.
Um,

137
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.820
backing up a little bit,
the space shuttle,
I said 37 lunches to uh,

138
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:39.530
to get anybody here see a space shuttle launch.
Quite a few of you.
Yeah,

139
00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:42.400
it was pretty impressive,
right?
Very humbling to go there.

140
00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.820
You're three miles away and then you have the power of the main engines and the

141
00:08:46.821 --> 00:08:49.610
solid rocket boosters that shook your whole body.

142
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.760
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

143
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.220
<v 1>very impressive to see us a space shuttle launch.</v>

144
00:09:16.221 --> 00:09:20.300
Very impressive to see any rocket launch and you're going to go here in a couple

145
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.000
of weeks and see the space x launch down in Florida.

146
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.630
It is a humbling experience to see one of those.

147
00:09:26.631 --> 00:09:31.631
You realize we're reminded when we see that access to space is not easy.

148
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.630
It's a very difficult,
uh,

149
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.490
but when a rocket launches to go to orbit that the,

150
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:41.510
particularly in low earth orbit,
while we call where the space station is,

151
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.720
you're in orbit and less than nine minutes and then that nine minutes,

152
00:09:44.721 --> 00:09:49.220
you're going 17,500 miles an hour,
that's orbital velocity.

153
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:54.140
Uh,
roughly think 250 miles above the earth's surface.

154
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:58.820
That means you are a bit the earth every 90 minutes or 16 times a day.
Uh,

155
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.350
so it's a lot of physics involved.
It is rocket science.

156
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:04.723
Um,

157
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.040
what I wanted to do now is that when they give you a sense of the rhythm of life

158
00:10:10.041 --> 00:10:14.660
on the space station program by showing you a video that's about 15,

159
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.910
if our tech supports us anyway,

160
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.240
showing you a video that a is about 15 minutes line that highlights the last

161
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:27.810
year is mission that I was a participant on,
uh,
across,
uh,

162
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:32.390
the time of what we called expedition 47 and 48.
It'll start.

163
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.680
Um,
and at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan,

164
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.400
which is the location that was developed in the late fifties,

165
00:10:40.401 --> 00:10:44.570
early sixties by the Soviet Union,
the beginning of the space race.

166
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:49.680
And we launched from the same lunch pad and all crews now rotating on Russian.

167
00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:54.650
So use rockets to the space station lunch and the same launchpad that Yuri

168
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.340
Gagarin launched from the first human in space,
uh,

169
00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.600
many over 50 years ago now.
Um,
so a lot of history there.

170
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.220
I'll talk a little bit more later,

171
00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:08.420
perhaps in the Q and a about the international partnership,
uh,
of all of this.

172
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.730
So expedition 47,
48,
uh,
this was a,
as I said,

173
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.360
the last flight I was on last year,

174
00:11:14.361 --> 00:11:19.361
so march of 2016 we completed our training and I was a crude up at two Russian

175
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.770
nuts.
Um,
Alexei and,
uh,
[inaudible].
And uh,

176
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.940
we went down to the Kazak stand from Moscow,

177
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.900
the Moscow region about 12 days prior to lunch.

178
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.600
I spent some time doing her final preparations there in Kazakhstan.
And then,
uh,

179
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.060
they got the rocket on the launch pad two days before lift,
uh,

180
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.680
our launch day.
And then we unlaunched morning,
we got in our suits,

181
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.280
took the ride out to the launchpad,
did the traditional way here,

182
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:51.580
and then got on the elevator to get to the top of the rocket and strap in about

183
00:11:52.251 --> 00:11:55.810
two and a half hours before liftoff.
Uh,
is,

184
00:11:55.811 --> 00:11:58.780
he is coming in through this a hatch.
If you're claustrophobic,

185
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:03.620
you're in the wrong business.
I get that question a lot.
So none of us are,
uh,

186
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:07.330
we actually get into the seats on our back in the fetal position and I liken it

187
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:09.070
to triplets in the womb,

188
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.250
like say old in was the commander of the,
so he is,

189
00:12:13.251 --> 00:12:17.440
that was his daughter's little stuffed animal there that he flew for her as a

190
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:18.250
souvenir.

191
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:22.570
We also call it the zero g meter hangs on the string until we get to orbit.

192
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.820
Um,
and then it bounces all over in the video.
And some of you have seen that,
uh,

193
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.740
on,
uh,
launches of,

194
00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:34.570
so use takes less than nine minutes to get to orbit just like the space shuttle

195
00:12:34.571 --> 00:12:36.130
after which you're going 70,000,

196
00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:39.720
500 miles an hour or about 25,000 kilometers per hour.
Uh,

197
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.810
and then we set up the rendezvous,
uh,

198
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.490
to rendezvous with the space station less than six hours later after lunch.

199
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.170
This is what the space station looked like as we approached it.
Uh,
and,
uh,

200
00:12:50.171 --> 00:12:53.260
this is what we look like as we approached the space station.

201
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:58.030
The final moments of approach as after we lined up with this docking port and

202
00:12:58.031 --> 00:12:59.910
then successfully docked,
uh,

203
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.130
after which we did a leak checks between the two vehicles,

204
00:13:03.131 --> 00:13:07.570
got the hatches open and we were welcomed on board,
uh,
by Tim,

205
00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:12.280
Tim and Uri,
Tim Kopra,
American astronaut,
10 peak,
uh,
British astronaut,

206
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.860
the first and today the only British astronaut.

207
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.990
And then you're a millennial Russian Cosmin so that we rounded out the crew of

208
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:25.060
expedition 47 in annex.
Got Us underway,
uh,
in that,
uh,

209
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:30.130
crew combination of six,
uh,
here's the,
a shot of the inside of the space station.

210
00:13:30.131 --> 00:13:34.120
Here we are in the US segment and going to the u s laboratory into the unity

211
00:13:34.121 --> 00:13:38.140
module,
which is the place that we typically have our crew meals.
So we have our,

212
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:42.070
all our food there and we gather,
run a typically as a crew of six,

213
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:44.350
at least a couple times a week.
Other than that,

214
00:13:44.351 --> 00:13:47.260
we're kind of busy a spread to the four winds,
but,
uh,

215
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:51.570
we tried to do that to maintain crew cohesion.
You can see it's very easy to,
uh,

216
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:56.000
to move around there.
You just get yourself moving in the right direction,
um,

217
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.610
and get there and then stop.

218
00:13:57.611 --> 00:14:02.080
We had a very busy first few weeks after we had arrived.

219
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.740
It seemed like in every major activity was on a weekend.

220
00:14:05.741 --> 00:14:10.210
We had three supply ships,
uh,
show up the first three weekends we were there.

221
00:14:10.211 --> 00:14:14.110
The first one was a Russian progress and then we had this orbital sciences

222
00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:18.940
sickness,
uh,
bring up,
uh,
uh,
almost 6,000 pounds of cargo and supplies.

223
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:23.650
Um,
and then a week later we had a space x dragon show up.

224
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:28.870
Uh,
and you'll see from after this video that logistically supply in the space

225
00:14:28.871 --> 00:14:31.380
station is a,
is a very,
uh,

226
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.850
intensive activity that's ongoing for,

227
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.500
for obvious reasons and other reasons that maybe aren't so obvious that

228
00:14:38.501 --> 00:14:43.180
particular space x had a unique cargo on board.
It was called the beam module.

229
00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.970
[inaudible] is the acronym it stood for or stands for,

230
00:14:46.971 --> 00:14:50.050
the big low experimental activity module.

231
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:54.560
It's the first inflatable module that we've integrated onto the space station.

232
00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:59.520
<v 3>So we got it attached to the space station and then a few weeks after that and</v>

233
00:14:59.521 --> 00:15:04.370
we got around to inflating it,
just,
uh,
allowing air from the inside of the,

234
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.890
uh,
where we are in the space station into this new module.

235
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.660
And it was designed them too

236
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.780
<v 1>to,
uh,
to inflate,
to expand and increase its internal volume.
Uh,</v>

237
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:18.100
and it's a great example of technology development,
uh,

238
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:22.060
that the space station is intended to be a platform for,
uh,

239
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:27.130
to develop new technologies for future application and inflatable modules can be

240
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.790
there volumetrically efficient to launch under a rocket fairing and then get to

241
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.930
where you need it.
Uh,
so it's a very promising technology.
Uh,

242
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.400
and here's the moment of celebrating that milestone in our state.
Uh,

243
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:45.230
last year it'll stay on board the space station for several years because it

244
00:15:45.231 --> 00:15:48.520
proves out it's tech runaways,
Jeff Williams.

245
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.590
We fast forward into June and I,
expedition 47 comes to an end.

246
00:15:55.591 --> 00:15:58.050
We transitioned the expedition 48 we have a,

247
00:15:58.051 --> 00:16:02.490
an old navy tradition up there where we ring the bell for the change of command.

248
00:16:02.491 --> 00:16:05.820
So I took command from Tim Cobra and uh,
Tim,

249
00:16:05.821 --> 00:16:08.510
Tim and Uri then got ready to,
uh,
to uh,

250
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:13.000
return home to get back into their soil use.
We got that hatches clothes.

251
00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:14.870
They got in their space suits,
uh,

252
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:18.930
strapped into their seats and then undocked from the space station after their

253
00:16:18.931 --> 00:16:22.890
six months day.
This was about three months into our state,
uh,

254
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.440
after their six months stay in,
they returned to earth.

255
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:30.150
So now for about three weeks there just three of us on board and I liken it to,

256
00:16:30.151 --> 00:16:30.640
um,

257
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.370
it's a great time that when you go down to a crew of three have a little fun.

258
00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:39.720
I liken it to when your family comes for a holiday and they stay for a week or

259
00:16:39.721 --> 00:16:42.150
two,
you know,
it's a great day when they arrive and it's a great day.

260
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:46.110
When they leave
for that three weeks,

261
00:16:46.111 --> 00:16:49.290
it was a very quiet,
the place on board,
the space station.
We just,

262
00:16:49.291 --> 00:16:53.540
three of us spread out doing our own thing.
But the work continued,
uh,
both,
uh,

263
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.190
in categories of maintaining the space station,
running it,

264
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.580
repairing the things that break,
which were prepared to do a,

265
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.300
as well as the science and research that's ongoing.
In the meantime,

266
00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.470
there are three others,
uh,

267
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.300
again at the Baikonur Cosmodrome and caustic stand prepared to launch after

268
00:17:09.301 --> 00:17:11.790
they've completed their training.
And in this case,

269
00:17:11.791 --> 00:17:16.170
we got a rookie astronaut Kate Rubens,
a first time flyer from NASA,

270
00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.060
a rookie astronaut to Kusha to Kuya,

271
00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:24.810
a Nishi Japanese astronauts his first time and then it totally over Nisha,

272
00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:29.610
a second time flyer from Russia or Russian cosmonaut.
So,
uh,

273
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.800
I've given you a sense of the international flavor of this as well.
Uh,

274
00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:38.370
among Cruz.
Uh,
so two days after they launched,
they docked to the space station.

275
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:43.020
We got the hatches open and welcome them on board and they rounded out what

276
00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:47.270
became expedition 48.
Uh,
and,
uh,

277
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.610
so that was in June,
I'm sorry,

278
00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:53.650
early July of last year.
Uh,

279
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.340
and it's always fun to welcome,

280
00:17:56.341 --> 00:18:00.150
especially rookies on board so you can share the experiences,

281
00:18:00.151 --> 00:18:02.550
all the highlights and experiences of space.

282
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.800
We do a lot of science and research on board.

283
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:09.000
This is a shots of an example of one of those,
it's called spheres.

284
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.540
Um,
which is an acronym.
It's a,
it's a,
uh,

285
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.600
technology development program of a,

286
00:18:15.601 --> 00:18:20.601
of a control system development for satellites and a w w it's been on board for

287
00:18:21.241 --> 00:18:21.991
11 years now.

288
00:18:21.991 --> 00:18:26.190
I think the first time I executed the spirits experiment was in 2006.

289
00:18:26.191 --> 00:18:30.420
It's also used for student activities.
Here's another experiment.

290
00:18:30.421 --> 00:18:32.130
Very a unique,
the,
this,

291
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.830
these are human heart cells grown from stem cells that,
uh,

292
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:39.600
and I learned for the first time that cells or heart cells beat at the cellular

293
00:18:39.601 --> 00:18:44.370
level.
It's not the muscle tissue.
It's the cells that talk to each other.
Um,

294
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.960
and beat in unison to study the human body is a major category of the activity

295
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.460
that goes on up here.
And here's,
uh,

296
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:55.560
some shots of ELIC saying I participated in an experiment called fluid shifts to

297
00:18:55.561 --> 00:18:59.970
better understand the impacts on the human body in that weightless environment

298
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.833
of space,

299
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:05.400
primarily to prevent or to Peru to produce counter measures for those adverse

300
00:19:05.401 --> 00:19:07.320
effects.
So for future exploration,

301
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.960
we have a very unique facility on board the space station.
Uh,

302
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:15.540
and in the Japanese module it's an air lock that allows us to put experiments

303
00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:16.920
and cargo outside,

304
00:19:16.921 --> 00:19:21.921
grab it with a robotic arm and either deployed for long duration outside or

305
00:19:21.991 --> 00:19:24.000
deployed from the space station itself,

306
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.670
such as these cube sets that were put up by the company name or racks,
uh,

307
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.220
which we pointed the robotic arm out into deep space.

308
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:37.220
And then they were commanded to be jettisoned a one or a pair at a time.

309
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:38.610
Uh,
so that's a,

310
00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:43.200
an example of a deployable payload that you would have the potential to get into

311
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.550
and participate in.

312
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:50.860
Fast forward into the end of July now and it's time to receive another,

313
00:19:50.861 --> 00:19:55.740
a space x dragon capsule,
which was launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida.

314
00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:00.030
Again,
bringing up a additional load of supplies,
equipment,
uh,

315
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.750
and the new round of experiments,
research activities,

316
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.090
but also a very unique special cargo.

317
00:20:06.091 --> 00:20:10.230
We called the international documented after which you see here being plucked up

318
00:20:10.231 --> 00:20:11.940
by the robotic arm.
Uh,

319
00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:14.970
that was to be attached at the very front end of the space station.

320
00:20:14.971 --> 00:20:19.810
It also meant that Kate and I needed to get ready for two spacewalks uh,

321
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.730
to go outside because we needed to do a spacewalk to integrate that document

322
00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:26.850
adapter.
I ended the very front end of the space station.

323
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.120
A spacewalk is definitely a highlight of the experience.

324
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.590
It's a long day activity,
getting ready to get out the door.

325
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.470
Uh,
and then we,
when we go outside,

326
00:20:37.471 --> 00:20:42.471
we stay up for about six and a half hours is the typical plan time for a space

327
00:20:43.601 --> 00:20:47.190
walk.
It's a very challenging environment to work in a,

328
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.000
it's physically and mentally.
It's the most demanding thing that we do.
Uh,

329
00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.080
but it's also the,

330
00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:57.370
one of the more rewarding things to do and memorable day memorable things to do.

331
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.360
Uh,
it's one of the thing obviously to be in space and the spacecraft,

332
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:05.170
it's quite another thing to get into suit and go outside and climb around the

333
00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:09.520
outside of the spacecraft.
The a two space walks that we did,

334
00:21:09.521 --> 00:21:11.410
one to integrate the DAC and adapter,

335
00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:15.970
and then two weeks later we went back outside to do a variety of other tasks

336
00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:19.930
were very successful.
Um,
and it was a,
that's one of those highlights,

337
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:24.850
Kate being the rookie on the crew to take her through that experience for the

338
00:21:24.851 --> 00:21:28.600
first time.
And she did very well.
I'm very proud of her.
It also occurred to me,

339
00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:30.820
space station has been flying along time.

340
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:35.110
Kate is just a couple of years older than my older son.
So we're,
we're on.

341
00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:39.910
Uh,
the space station is a multigenerational program,

342
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.780
which still a bright future ahead of it.
Uh,
years.
Uh,

343
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.570
one of the favorite places on the space station is what we call the Cupela.

344
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.170
I call it the window on the world.

345
00:21:50.171 --> 00:21:54.250
This was integrated on the station in the spring of 2010.

346
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.570
It's the one place where you have six radio windows and then a center window

347
00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:03.400
Sorta Lake,
a hemisphere of windows where he can see the entire globe from us.
Uh,

348
00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:05.060
one vantage point.
Uh,

349
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.700
so it quickly becomes a favorite place for everybody to go during their free

350
00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:13.030
time.
And of course,
I took a lot of photography up there,

351
00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.760
not only from the Cuculla,
but from all the windows.

352
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:19.600
I'm the space station to capture the details of the earth's surface.

353
00:22:19.601 --> 00:22:24.601
Like this plankton bloom off the coast of South America or this horizon shot.

354
00:22:24.821 --> 00:22:28.900
We see the thin atmosphere and then these beautiful cloud formations.

355
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:33.220
The Western us was central valley just right of center.
They're coming into view.

356
00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:38.560
We see this a Sahara.
And um,
and the,
the place where so much has grown,
uh,

357
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:42.850
for food.
Here's a,
uh,
the largest coral reef in The Bahamas,

358
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:47.770
one of the most beautiful reefs in the world,
in my opinion.
Uh,

359
00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.320
ice flows off the coast of Canada.

360
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.960
Early Spring 2016 last year.

361
00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:57.790
Here you see irrigation circles in the river bed in the arid land around it,
uh,

362
00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.990
in the state of New Mexico,
the southern tip of South America,

363
00:23:01.991 --> 00:23:06.991
and the Patagonia ice shelves in the beautiful glaciers that occurred there.

364
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.530
And the rugged land forms around it.
Uh,

365
00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:15.570
this is in the great salt desert sand domes that are called in your Ron,

366
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:19.540
uh,
very unique geology in the world.

367
00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:22.480
Here's a shot of the horizon right after sunset.

368
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.710
So the orange is from the sun producing the silhouette from the weather,
uh,

369
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:30.580
in cloud formations are just absolutely beautiful,

370
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:33.790
incredible examples of what you can see from that vantage point.

371
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.160
Here are the elps and southern Europe.

372
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:41.890
I looking straight down through an 800 millimeter lens into the Grand Canyon and

373
00:23:41.891 --> 00:23:46.220
the Colorado River here,
the Teton National Park,
the state of Wyoming,

374
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:51.560
very unique.
A shot of it,
what we call noctilucent clouds over the Poles.

375
00:23:51.561 --> 00:23:54.920
Very rarely seen.
Typically in the summertime,

376
00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:58.100
you see it over the north and our winter time,
see it over the South Pole.

377
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:01.090
But very mysterious formations.
We theorize,

378
00:24:01.091 --> 00:24:04.820
or ice crystals and well above the altitudes that we see in normal.

379
00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.380
When I relinquished the command,

380
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:10.880
and it totally takes to say that early September of last year,

381
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.240
and now you're getting the rhythm of life,
right.
Uh,

382
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:19.520
so we're at the end of our stay.
I hated over command to Anatolio Venetian.

383
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.770
Uh,
yeah.
Uh,
he didn't enjoy it.

384
00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:26.900
The time is spent together as expedition and 48 on the international space

385
00:24:26.901 --> 00:24:31.030
station and that milestone began expedition 14,

386
00:24:31.031 --> 00:24:36.031
nine and also mark our rate time to return to the planet that we call home.

387
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.920
So three of us said goodbye to the other three I got in our soil who's got back

388
00:24:42.291 --> 00:24:46.890
into those space suits that we launched in strapped into our seats and prepare

389
00:24:46.891 --> 00:24:51.410
to undocked from the space station.
The time from undocking to uh,

390
00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:52.650
uh,

391
00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:57.650
touchdown in central Kazakhstan is typically about three hours and 15 or 20

392
00:24:57.981 --> 00:25:00.830
minutes.
So the whole process happens fairly quickly.

393
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.810
We undocked from the station,

394
00:25:02.811 --> 00:25:07.040
fire the engines to separate to get a safe distance from the space station.

395
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.030
Then a couple of hours later flying over the southern tip of South America to

396
00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:15.200
Landon guys extent.
We fired the main engine for little over four minutes.

397
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.410
That sets us up to now reenter the atmosphere,

398
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.790
literally entering in a fireball.

399
00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.790
That's what you see looking at the porthole window there and experience it in

400
00:25:25.791 --> 00:25:29.600
about four times the force of gravity.
And then the main parachute opens,

401
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:34.290
which I like to say is the most significant event of the entire flight.
Um,

402
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.920
and then you drift down under the parachute for about 12 minutes,
uh,
and touched,

403
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:42.670
um,
in what I like and to be a car wreck.
Um,

404
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:47.420
uh,
in central cosmic stand,
in our case search and rescue forces,

405
00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:51.700
it's spotted as soon as the main parachute opened and they had a side of the
cap.

406
00:25:51.701 --> 00:25:56.480
So within 30 minutes or so,
um,
we did some medical experiments there at the land,

407
00:25:56.481 --> 00:25:59.090
each side along with the standard medical checks.

408
00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.950
And then each of us got in a helicopter and flew about two and a half hours back

409
00:26:03.951 --> 00:26:06.680
to the airfield that they were based out of.

410
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:11.060
And then my Russian crew mates got on an airplane and went to Moscow and I got

411
00:26:11.061 --> 00:26:16.061
on another airplane here and did a three legs back to Houston and I was back at

412
00:26:17.061 --> 00:26:17.421
home,

413
00:26:17.421 --> 00:26:22.421
reunited with my family in Houston about 24 hours after landing in central

414
00:26:22.911 --> 00:26:24.620
Kazakhstan.
Incidentally,

415
00:26:24.621 --> 00:26:29.030
I earlier today I told the story about we all have experience of travel,

416
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.290
certain distances,

417
00:26:30.291 --> 00:26:34.400
maybe even if it's around the block or halfway around the world.
We go on a trip,

418
00:26:34.401 --> 00:26:35.234
we come back,

419
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:40.130
we might pull into a pull up in front of our house and we feel like,
oh,

420
00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:44.070
we're home.
Or we might fly in from somewhere from another country

421
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.910
<v 3>and land land at Chang.
And you feel like I'm home in this case.</v>

422
00:26:47.911 --> 00:26:52.220
As soon as the motion stops,
after you impact the ground and central Kazakhstan,

423
00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:53.790
you get tumbled,
enroll,

424
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:57.090
and then you're hanging in the straps and you're feeling that relentless force

425
00:26:57.091 --> 00:26:58.050
of gravity again.

426
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:02.400
You feel like we're home even though it's in the middle of nowhere and the other

427
00:27:02.401 --> 00:27:06.670
side of the planet.
So,
um,
very interesting.
Um,

428
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.240
psychological detail I guess.

429
00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.500
<v 2>Okay.</v>

430
00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:21.320
<v 4>Thank you so much commander Williams.</v>

431
00:27:21.321 --> 00:27:26.150
I just love seeing these videos each and every time.
It's just so inspiring.
Um,

432
00:27:26.151 --> 00:27:29.750
so we wanted to get started by asking you a couple of questions and then opening

433
00:27:29.751 --> 00:27:32.900
it up to the audience because I'm sure you guys have questions too.

434
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:37.130
So what I'm basing this on is some questions that were submitted submitted by

435
00:27:37.131 --> 00:27:41.350
some of you guys.
I'm earlier.
So,
um,
since we are talking about products here,

436
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:46.370
can you list some examples of well designed products that you use daily in space

437
00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:49.580
and were there any products that you thought could possibly be improved?

438
00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.410
<v 3>Just divide.
Everything we use can be improved,
right?</v>

439
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:58.590
<v 1>You guys work in the business where,
you know,
you got users</v>

440
00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:59.011
<v 3>there,</v>

441
00:27:59.011 --> 00:28:03.660
you got developers and producers of products and then your users give you a

442
00:28:03.661 --> 00:28:07.670
feedback and say,
hey,
we don't like this.
And if you've been in development,
you,

443
00:28:07.671 --> 00:28:10.410
you or you do anything,
you put anything.

444
00:28:10.411 --> 00:28:13.730
Nowadays I'm in social media and the Internet,
you get comments back,
right?

445
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:17.310
Not all the comments are positive.
So there,
yeah,
I mean,

446
00:28:17.311 --> 00:28:20.220
we can always make improvement and everything and that's certainly true with

447
00:28:20.221 --> 00:28:22.740
what we do.
Um,
it's,
uh,
you know,

448
00:28:22.741 --> 00:28:27.040
there are a lot of moving parts to the operation up there.
Um,
and there's,
uh,

449
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:31.800
a great team of folks,
um,
not only at NASA,

450
00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:35.220
but in all the,
the entire partnership,
uh,
that work

451
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:41.580
24,
seven,
three 65,
they're working all the time in mission control in Houston,

452
00:28:41.581 --> 00:28:45.750
in the mission control in Moscow in a control center and Scuba Japan,

453
00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:48.280
another one in Munich,
Germany.
Um,

454
00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.740
and those folks are working all the details overnight playing in the,

455
00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.610
the day's activities.
Of course they've been planning for months.
Uh,
but,
uh,
they,

456
00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.610
they refine the plane right up until when we,

457
00:28:59.611 --> 00:29:02.020
when we go to bed at night overnight,
uh,

458
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:05.730
they've finalize the plans for the next day.
There's a lot of details in that.

459
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:10.530
A lot of what we call ops products,
operational products,
just like procedures,
um,

460
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:15.120
and other,
uh,
resources that we need to execute the day's plan.

461
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.270
Um,
and overall we do a very good job,

462
00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:22.830
but we're always in need of making that process more efficient and more

463
00:29:22.831 --> 00:29:23.970
effective.
So that would be,

464
00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:28.220
<v 4>so I'm sure there are ways we could streamline a lot of stuff.</v>

465
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.510
So how about a product that you wish existed that when you were up there,

466
00:29:32.511 --> 00:29:34.730
what would you have loved to have that you didn't have?

467
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:38.010
<v 3>The ability,
the ability,
that beam home for the weekend?</v>

468
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:45.150
Actually,
I'm kind of a minimalist by nature and the,

469
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.880
I've spent my whole career in the army so I can eat a,

470
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:54.120
a ration and sitting in a foxhole in the pouring rain.
Um,
uh,

471
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.520
so there wasn't a whole lot that I personally missed up there.
I mean,

472
00:29:57.521 --> 00:29:58.630
I went there like it was a,

473
00:29:58.631 --> 00:30:02.850
it was going to be a trip where you don't have a lot of luxuries take for

474
00:30:02.851 --> 00:30:05.720
granted,
but you know,
we,
we need,
uh,

475
00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:09.190
we always need the equipment to do the job right,
to accomplish the mission.

476
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.410
So that's where the key comes in hot.

477
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.750
How can we improve all the different elements that are involved in accomplishing

478
00:30:16.751 --> 00:30:21.490
the mission to make it more effective,
more efficient and safe.

479
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:27.580
<v 4>So then let's touch on one of the points that I brought up with regard to</v>

480
00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:28.660
asteroid mining.

481
00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:33.610
What are your thoughts on orbital vehicle assembly from asteroids sought sourced

482
00:30:33.611 --> 00:30:34.444
material?

483
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:40.130
<v 3>Well,
frankly,
I haven't taken the time to see what kind of material or um,</v>

484
00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.710
asteroids,
uh,

485
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:47.330
but just answering the question in a more generic way.
Uh,

486
00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:52.320
let's say,
hey,
they go on to Mars for example.
Um,
you,

487
00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:56.250
you mentioned earlier that,
uh,
we have to,
uh,

488
00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:58.750
take a lot of things from earth.
We have to support it from Earth,

489
00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.650
the space station.
You saw supply ships.

490
00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:05.520
I'm going to go and continually just to supply and support everything that was

491
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:08.570
required to not only do the work on the space station,

492
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:13.580
but to purport to support the life of the crew.
We all eat every day.

493
00:31:13.581 --> 00:31:17.010
We,
uh,
we breathe the air.
Uh,

494
00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:18.620
that has to be maintained.

495
00:31:18.621 --> 00:31:22.760
That all of the things that we take for granted here in the surface CD era,
uh,

496
00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:26.300
that provide support for life have to be duplicated there.

497
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:30.560
So you have to supply that.
You have to sustain it.
You have to have the,
the,
uh,

498
00:31:30.561 --> 00:31:35.300
the equipment that has the reliability and the performance necessary to do so.

499
00:31:35.301 --> 00:31:36.530
When we go to Mars,

500
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:42.050
that's going to be orders of magnitude more critical because we won't have easy

501
00:31:42.051 --> 00:31:46.790
access to send a spare part to send a replacement part,
uh,

502
00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.910
to,
um,
uh,

503
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:53.150
compensate for a lack of performance or reliability and those systems.

504
00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:58.790
So that means there's going to be a huge requirement to send a lot of stuff

505
00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:03.040
ahead of time,
uh,
before crew,
whoever goes to get there.
Now,

506
00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:08.080
if you can reduce that requirement of up mash of lodge and stuff from Earth,

507
00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:13.190
if he can reduce it by tapping into whatever resources you find there,

508
00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:17.300
and then have automated systems that can then turn those resources into the

509
00:32:17.301 --> 00:32:20.460
commodities,
I indeed,
uh,
to uh,

510
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:25.510
do the operation on the surface and or provide the means to return to Earth,

511
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.720
then you've cut down on the recording.

512
00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:30.801
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

513
00:32:30.801 --> 00:32:34.340
And so that's actually one of the biggest expenses is moved the launch itself.

514
00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:39.110
So this is where you guys come in three d printed space parts from asteroid.

515
00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:42.340
<v 3>I think about that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think that would be cool.</v>

516
00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:47.110
And we have a off the shelf three d printers on board the space station right

517
00:32:47.111 --> 00:32:51.160
now.
So we're basically developing the operation,

518
00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.500
proven out the operation that we can do it,

519
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:59.070
whether it be a design of something that gives up linked from the ground and a,

520
00:32:59.681 --> 00:33:04.270
and the crew just supports the printer itself and,
and um,
and does,
uh,

521
00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:09.190
the inspection of the product or if the crew's interactively designed something

522
00:33:09.191 --> 00:33:11.380
on board.
But that's going to be a key component.

523
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:14.590
And that's a great example of Ben drawing from the raw materials.

524
00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:22.000
<v 4>So,
um,
we had another question as we often do,
um,
about movies.</v>

525
00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:26.230
So,
which is your favorite space movie and which one is your least favorite?

526
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:31.400
<v 3>Yeah,
somebody said gravity.</v>

527
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.810
I got so many questions when that movie came out after in the weeks afterwards,

528
00:33:35.811 --> 00:33:39.260
you know,
every time I had run into somebody and if they learned what I did,

529
00:33:39.261 --> 00:33:42.650
you know,
well,
I would just see the movie,
you just see the movie.
I said,
no,

530
00:33:42.651 --> 00:33:45.500
I haven't had time to watch the movie.
And I,
and I,
it was,

531
00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:49.640
was that a three d movie?
I forget.
It could be right on a big screen.

532
00:33:49.641 --> 00:33:52.780
Of course they had all the special effects and,
and whatnot.
Well,

533
00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:55.640
I finally watched it,
but,
uh,
I'm going to disappoint you.

534
00:33:55.641 --> 00:33:59.780
I know I saw it on a little strain on Singapore Airlines on a direct flight

535
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.690
between Houston and Moscow.
Oh.

536
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.320
Because I was going there for one of the training trips and I had,

537
00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.660
I had other things to do,
but I thought,
well,

538
00:34:08.661 --> 00:34:11.800
I'm going to watch this movie so I can answer the question.
Um,

539
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.200
so I mean it was entertainment,

540
00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:19.890
although I gotta be careful because this is going out.
Right.
Um,

541
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:23.440
but you know,
I didn't have much of a storyline.
It had the,

542
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:29.810
and the guy at the beginning saying,
you know,
doing the space walk,

543
00:34:29.811 --> 00:34:33.620
like you saw their individual flying around in a jet pack that we don't do that.

544
00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.040
And of course the collision,

545
00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:41.420
that catastrophe that they experience is nothing like a real physics.
So there,

546
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:45.800
there's a lot of liberties taken in that movie,
but I suppose it was,

547
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:49.670
it was entertainment.
So I would say,
uh,
I mentioned that one,

548
00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.650
I'll mention the Martian.
Uh,

549
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.320
cause that it's another one that comes up all the time.

550
00:34:55.321 --> 00:34:58.700
And I think I saw that one on an airplane to actually,

551
00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:02.150
I haven't get to the theater very often.
Uh,

552
00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:07.730
it was a actually a pretty good movie to watch.
Of course they did.

553
00:35:07.731 --> 00:35:12.140
They took some liberties like you're always doing and movies.
Uh,
but it's,
uh,

554
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:15.110
it's one of those examples I think that,
uh,

555
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:19.190
can help the public be inspired about,
hey,

556
00:35:19.191 --> 00:35:23.690
this is possible right now.
It might be science fiction.
And there was a lot of,

557
00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.240
uh,
liberty taken in that movie.
Uh,

558
00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.900
but this is something that's actually possible.
You know,
and,

559
00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:32.000
and you can go back into this early is the thirties

560
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:34.460
that I recall.

561
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:38.940
And there were movies that were made about up people in space,

562
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.040
in space stations.
Uh,

563
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:45.630
von Braun had a great vision that was articulated through the fifties with the

564
00:35:45.631 --> 00:35:48.330
help of Disney and whatnot.

565
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:53.190
And we are still in the process by the way of executing the vision.

566
00:35:53.191 --> 00:35:55.050
He articulated in the mid fifties,

567
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:59.850
which was let's get into space,
into orbit,

568
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.120
lodge people into orbit,
build a space station,

569
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.540
going to the moon and to Mars.
That was his order.

570
00:36:06.541 --> 00:36:10.290
Of course we did it in a little bit different order.
Uh,
so anyway,

571
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:15.150
back to the movies.
Those movies are fine.
The best movie,

572
00:36:15.151 --> 00:36:17.220
if you want to know when I get the question,

573
00:36:17.221 --> 00:36:22.221
what's my best space movie and which is the one I liked the best.

574
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:27.510
It's Apollo 13.
Cause they did an excellent job of telling the story,

575
00:36:27.511 --> 00:36:29.450
a true story and uh,

576
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:34.200
tell him that in a way that was representative of the real world.
Uh,

577
00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:36.980
so Apollo 13 is one that I really appreciate it.

578
00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:40.840
<v 4>Well,
yeah,
that was a good movie.
So I'll just say for me,</v>

579
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:44.440
the Martian is my favorite movie because they made scientists look really cool.

580
00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:48.160
But they also did take liberties because I'm,

581
00:36:48.161 --> 00:36:53.050
when they showed JPL from the outside,
it was a shiny new structures,

582
00:36:53.051 --> 00:36:54.460
stainless steel and glass.

583
00:36:54.461 --> 00:36:57.700
And when you went inside they had all the sleeping pods and really cool places.

584
00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:02.940
I had a World War II desk that you couldn't really open the doors on.

585
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:05.140
We had the latest and greatest in spacecraft hardware,

586
00:37:05.141 --> 00:37:06.730
but this being a government agency,

587
00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:10.600
the inside was not as shiny and I didn't know anybody who drove a Mercedes.

588
00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:13.270
So,
um,

589
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:17.260
let me just ask one more question if I might before we open it up to the floor.

590
00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.710
Um,
you mentioned the movie gravity and you talked about debris.

591
00:37:20.711 --> 00:37:24.130
So I'm in the context of the ISS.
Um,

592
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:28.240
how does the station deal with debris and what kind of issues do you typically

593
00:37:28.241 --> 00:37:29.074
face?

594
00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:33.630
<v 3>Uh,
well I think most folks are aware of the issue of space debris.
Uh,</v>

595
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:38.460
there is a lot of it up there.
Of course the,
the space is big,
um,

596
00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:43.190
but there's a finite probability of,
uh,
at risk,

597
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:48.560
uh,
produced by the debris at the altitudes,
at the space station flies.

598
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.490
The larger objects are tracked and kept track of.
And if,

599
00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:56.180
if the predictive models show that,
um,

600
00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.680
an object or a single object is going to approach within a certain sphere of the

601
00:38:00.681 --> 00:38:05.390
space station in advance,
we'll even do a maneuver the space station.
Okay.

602
00:38:05.391 --> 00:38:09.700
Usually the predictive models don't pop up that,
uh,

603
00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:13.820
uh,
that intersection if you will,
at Joe's too late to do them and over.

604
00:38:13.821 --> 00:38:18.100
And then the crew will do a,
uh,
uh,
uh,

605
00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:21.950
go into a safe haven,
which is the Soyuz capsule hang out in there.

606
00:38:21.951 --> 00:38:26.570
So use captioning Jill,
that object dispatch.
So we prepare for those,

607
00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.220
uh,
those,
uh,
real risks that are out there.
Uh,

608
00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:34.160
but that's how we mitigate at least the larger objects.
And when I say larger,

609
00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:37.880
those are objects than say like this just a few inches long.

610
00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:42.990
It's the smaller objects that we can't track and we can't predict.
Uh,
uh,

611
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:47.720
and there is a finite probability of impact with a station.
Uh,

612
00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:51.320
we have several emergencies that we prepared for him to space station and the

613
00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:54.540
number one and the one that I think that,
uh,
um,

614
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.990
we need to take most seriously because of the consequences and the probability

615
00:38:58.991 --> 00:38:59.770
of occurring,

616
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:03.550
especially when you consider the years and years that space station it has been

617
00:39:03.551 --> 00:39:03.941
flying,

618
00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:08.410
it will be fine is an impact by a small object which would produce a course,

619
00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.350
a depressurization.
Uh,
so we,
uh,

620
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.990
developed the procedures to respond to that,
uh,

621
00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:18.800
in all the crews are trained with the first priority of course the safety of the

622
00:39:18.801 --> 00:39:22.240
crew.
And the second priority is to save the space station.

623
00:39:22.241 --> 00:39:24.350
So we have procedures that would,
uh,

624
00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:27.370
that would isolate the location of the leak and then isolate that,

625
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:29.950
saved the rest of the station.

626
00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:36.420
<v 4>So,
um,
I'm wondering if anybody in the audience might have any questions.</v>

627
00:39:36.421 --> 00:39:41.280
We have a mic up there somewhere.
Okay.
My name is uncle Lupita.

628
00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:45.330
Uh,
I wanted to ask a question that when you're in space,

629
00:39:45.331 --> 00:39:50.190
does your sense of time and perception slow down or does it stay the same?

630
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.930
Because everything is moving so slow.

631
00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.950
<v 3>The perception of time,</v>

632
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:58.760
just like on the planet is driven by how busy we are,
right?

633
00:39:58.761 --> 00:40:02.780
We can get bored and not be very busy occupied with things and it seems like

634
00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.590
time drags on a,

635
00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:09.020
but if we're under a lot of pressure to get some things done and we stay busy,

636
00:40:09.021 --> 00:40:11.500
then it seemed like the day flies by.
Uh,

637
00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:14.990
so you have the same thing up there except that we don't get bored up there.

638
00:40:14.991 --> 00:40:19.370
We have the latter case,
uh,
because the,
the schedule is filled.

639
00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:21.080
Now what we don't have,

640
00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:24.290
and I think this might be what you're pulling that a little bit in the question,

641
00:40:24.291 --> 00:40:28.750
we don't have the day night cycle and the cues of the Sun rising,
uh,

642
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.023
uh,

643
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:35.390
prompting us to get up to wake up and get up and get busy for the day and then

644
00:40:35.391 --> 00:40:39.590
it gets dark again.
And we know shortly after that,
typically for most of us,

645
00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.800
time to go to bed,
we don't have that up there.
We don't have those cues.

646
00:40:42.801 --> 00:40:47.630
So everything is worked off the clock.
Uh,
so we've got,

647
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:48.880
um,

648
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:53.150
a look Oregon network spread throughout the space station with a laptop,

649
00:40:53.151 --> 00:40:57.050
computers and I,
those laptop computers,
uh,
are many products.

650
00:40:57.051 --> 00:41:00.350
One of them being the schedule for the day in each crew member has assigned

651
00:41:00.351 --> 00:41:05.180
tasks to do with all of the materials necessary to accomplish those tasks.

652
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:10.240
And it's got a little vertical line across this window that has a schedule on

653
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:15.250
the vertical line is the current time and hit marches across the day's schedule.

654
00:41:15.441 --> 00:41:19.910
So you find yourself chasing that light all day long to stay ahead of schedule.

655
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:24.590
Uh,
but it,
you're,
you're tracking,
okay,
wait,
what are you doing next?

656
00:41:24.591 --> 00:41:27.800
And some continually setting the alarm on my watch,
uh,

657
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:29.750
to make sure I meet those milestones.

658
00:41:29.751 --> 00:41:34.600
Now I'm pretty good now after spending time up there work and getting ahead and

659
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:39.380
stay in the head.
So my alarm was always going off.
Uh,
so that,
okay,

660
00:41:39.381 --> 00:41:41.750
one minute from now I've got to be in the window,
the date,

661
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:45.380
take a picture of this term.
So that's what,
uh,
what I was dragging.

662
00:41:45.381 --> 00:41:49.160
And we have those tools on board to,
to,
to predict.
For example,

663
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:51.560
when we're going to fly over at the precise second,

664
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.780
Singapore or anywhere else in the world.

665
00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.530
<v 4>So,
um,
you talked about the lack of day night cycles.</v>

666
00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.340
You guys orbit the earth every 90 minutes,
right?
Yeah.

667
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:02.780
So you're seeing sunset and sunrise throughout the day.

668
00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:07.380
<v 3>Yeah.
16 Times a day.
You can see a sunrise if you,</v>

669
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.520
if you have the time to go to the window and watch it.

670
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.270
<v 4>We have another question from the audience.</v>

671
00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:17.150
<v 5>Hi,
my name is Jill from Google.
I'm curious to find out how you stay fit.</v>

672
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:20.820
I'm not only physically,
but spiritually,
mentally,
all of it.
Yeah,

673
00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.580
<v 3>great question.
Uh,</v>

674
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:26.030
physical fitness is very important that there be for obvious reasons.

675
00:42:26.031 --> 00:42:29.270
We all use our muscles just to support our bodies.

676
00:42:29.271 --> 00:42:32.370
Even sitting in chairs like we are right now.
Uh,

677
00:42:32.371 --> 00:42:33.950
and when you're in a weightless environment,

678
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.740
the muscles don't have to do any work.
Uh,

679
00:42:36.741 --> 00:42:38.900
so they will atrophy and not only the muscles,

680
00:42:38.901 --> 00:42:42.770
but our bonds will atrophy as well.
Our bone strength and density of our bones,

681
00:42:42.771 --> 00:42:46.190
calcium density is dependent upon exercise.

682
00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:50.660
That's why exercise is so important.
It's emphasizes children grow up,
et cetera.

683
00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:55.370
Uh,
so we have countermeasures on board.
We exercise every day.
Uh,

684
00:42:55.400 --> 00:43:00.140
and we'll do aerobic and anaerobic exercise.
Your aerobics exercise,
uh,

685
00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.960
includes running on a treadmill and you say,

686
00:43:02.961 --> 00:43:07.580
how do you run on a treadmill without gravity?
Good question.
We wear a harness.

687
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:12.280
Uh,
each person has their own harness and then then we have bungees that,
uh,
uh,

688
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:14.990
are attached to the harness down into the treadmill.

689
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:18.650
We can vary the load and the speed of the treadmill.

690
00:43:18.651 --> 00:43:23.300
And I typically ran for 30 minutes for four miles or so,
uh,
every day.

691
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:28.160
Um,
if you didn't want to run,
you could a cycle on a or governor,

692
00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:32.690
uh,
and get your aerobics exercise that way.
In addition to that,
uh,

693
00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:37.700
we had the equivalent of weightlifting,
we called it resistive exercise,
uh,

694
00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:42.760
and we used the vacuum cylinders to provide the force that to replace a weights,

695
00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:46.970
you know,
with weightlifting.
And,
um,

696
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.250
that is a very important counter measure,
uh,

697
00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.310
to keep the main muscle groups,
the,
the,
the,

698
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:57.140
the core of our body

699
00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:02.590
and support,
you know,
legs,
um,
and whatnot.

700
00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:07.200
Back a strong and also to keep the bone density up.
Uh,

701
00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:10.510
so,
uh,
every day we lifted.
Uh,

702
00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:15.520
and then when it glued things like a body or a squats or dead lifts and then

703
00:44:15.681 --> 00:44:20.440
other kinds of exercises as well.
So that was,
uh,
how we,
uh,
made Jane or fitness,

704
00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.260
uh,
and the equipment we have on board now is very effective,

705
00:44:24.261 --> 00:44:29.120
more effective than we had in earlier years.
Um,
and it,
it's,
uh,

706
00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:34.250
uh,
does a couple of things that tells us a couple of things.
One is it a,

707
00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.850
it tells us how important,
um,

708
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.320
the study of the human body is up there so that when we leave earth orbit,

709
00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:43.890
we have the counter measures developed,
uh,
to,
uh,

710
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:48.630
to counter those adverse effects and maintain a healthy proof or the duration of

711
00:44:48.631 --> 00:44:52.410
the mission as well as your,
the rest of your life when you get that kind of,
um,

712
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:53.400
uh,

713
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.420
and it also is a great example of what the primary purpose of the space station

714
00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:00.600
that is developing those technologies,

715
00:45:00.601 --> 00:45:05.190
developing the operations to enable us to leave Earth orbit,
uh,

716
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:10.410
psychologically,
spiritually.
I supported.
Of course.
That's very important as well.

717
00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:11.340
Uh,

718
00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:16.340
one of the primary ways that we're able to maintain our psychological support.

719
00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:20.280
Uh,
and we all can relate to this.
We all have relationships.

720
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:24.060
Human beings are relational beings.
We are,

721
00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:28.050
whether we might think of ourselves as being very independent,

722
00:45:28.051 --> 00:45:31.410
but we're all dependent and having relationships with others.

723
00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:34.750
And it's important up there as well.
Uh,
in that respect,

724
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.980
you can get very isolated,
even though you're on a crew of six,

725
00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:42.870
being separated from the family and perhaps more significantly,
we're up there.

726
00:45:42.871 --> 00:45:45.840
We're very busy,
we're focused,
we're doing our jobs,

727
00:45:45.841 --> 00:45:49.130
but our families are back home and,
and they,
uh,

728
00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:52.050
for my wife in particular,
uh,

729
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:54.690
what I'm doing is completely out of her control.

730
00:45:54.691 --> 00:45:58.830
So the endurance that she has to go through is I think,

731
00:45:58.831 --> 00:46:01.290
much more challenging than what I had to go through.

732
00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:04.690
A that requires support both ways.
Uh,

733
00:46:04.691 --> 00:46:07.440
a key element of that support is just communication,

734
00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:09.330
which goes back to the relationship.

735
00:46:09.331 --> 00:46:13.230
So we have great kind of activity up there in terms of being able to make voice

736
00:46:13.231 --> 00:46:17.020
phone calls once a week,
uh,
to uh,
assets.
Uh,

737
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.790
mission control in Houston.
We would have a video conference,

738
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:25.800
two way video conference.
So that was the one time a week that I could see,
um,

739
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.710
a friends and family from the ground.
Uh,

740
00:46:28.711 --> 00:46:33.200
we also have the opportunity to make contacts with other friends and family,
uh,

741
00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:38.310
throughout the world.
Uh,
limited.
Obviously we have internet connectivity,

742
00:46:38.311 --> 00:46:43.200
very limited.
Uh,
you can't stream even audio on that kind of activity we have,

743
00:46:43.201 --> 00:46:47.970
it's like the old dial up days for those of you old enough to remember that.
Um,

744
00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:53.030
but we've got a team of folks on the ground that uh,
that helps support us,
uh,

745
00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.140
in that respect and they do a very good job.

746
00:46:55.141 --> 00:46:58.140
So we've spent a lot of time thinking through those requirements.

747
00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:02.130
<v 6>So I just wanted you to understand,
uh,
two questions I have,</v>

748
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.580
what research or things you are doing on space station,

749
00:47:05.581 --> 00:47:09.110
which can have immediate relevance seat will problem on earth.
So,

750
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:10.290
which she can solve on earth,

751
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.800
but we are doing something in space which we bring back to earth and solve a

752
00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:17.850
significant problem over here.
That's part one of the questions.

753
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.430
Part of the question is if things start going wrong over there,

754
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.160
what are the things you have in place to correct them?

755
00:47:23.161 --> 00:47:26.580
That suddenly things are going haywire on the space station.

756
00:47:26.581 --> 00:47:29.860
So what are the measures you have to bring them back into control?

757
00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:34.770
<v 3>We train for years to prepare for flying out.
Take your second question first.
Um,</v>

758
00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:35.840
and uh,

759
00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:40.780
much of that training it has to do with dealing with things that go wrong.

760
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:44.770
Something breaks as uh,
an emergency on the space station.

761
00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:49.990
We have a oh,
a caution and warning Annunciation,
uh,

762
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:54.200
because some system failure or,
or what have you.
Uh,

763
00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:57.070
so we're trained to respond to that.
The,

764
00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:02.790
the minor failures that we have are covered by the redundancy and the design of

765
00:48:02.981 --> 00:48:03.521
the system.

766
00:48:03.521 --> 00:48:08.521
So you have a say a relatively minor and this is all relative,

767
00:48:09.461 --> 00:48:10.900
right?
But something fails.

768
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:15.260
I redundance system automatically comes up and picks up the function,
uh,

769
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:18.460
where that system,
but there are other major ones where,
uh,

770
00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:22.330
we can have significant failures where the crew has to get involved in and it

771
00:48:22.331 --> 00:48:25.000
has to be trained to,
uh,
to respond to that.

772
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:30.030
Our mission control centers around the world also are key in that a response.

773
00:48:30.341 --> 00:48:35.200
And as long as we have a telemetry and communication between the ground and the

774
00:48:35.201 --> 00:48:38.120
space station,
they're there looking over our shoulders and,

775
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:43.150
and perhaps in many cases their prime and the response to it.

776
00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:44.140
So we,

777
00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:48.250
we trained for all the possibilities of all the things that might go wrong and,

778
00:48:48.251 --> 00:48:50.800
uh,
we have the procedures in place.
Um,

779
00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:55.010
and of course from the training execute those procedures.
Uh,
uh,

780
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:59.800
so I think that covers in general that the second question,
the first question,

781
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:04.630
uh,
a direct application where immediately it was applied to the ground.

782
00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:10.150
That's a really broad question.
Uh,
we have,

783
00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.090
uh,
of course what we call spinoff.
And you can go,

784
00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.000
I'll point you to the NASA website where you get your,

785
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:18.550
somebody said you're two clicks away from the Bolivian,

786
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:21.640
but you guys weren't here.
We're here at Google.
We're all,

787
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:24.970
we all can relate to that,
right?
When you get out into the Internet,

788
00:49:24.971 --> 00:49:29.560
there's so much information out there,
but you can find an endless list of,

789
00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:32.260
of a spinoff technologies.

790
00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:36.370
A lot of the things we take for granted that can be traced back either directly

791
00:49:36.371 --> 00:49:39.860
or indirectly to space exploration.
Uh,

792
00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:44.610
and then that includes the course examples across the spectrum.

793
00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:48.130
Uh,
a lot of the science and research that takes place,

794
00:49:48.131 --> 00:49:51.610
it's like research anywhere,
right?
It's really hard to take a,

795
00:49:51.611 --> 00:49:55.930
a specific narrow scope of research activity and say,
hey,

796
00:49:55.931 --> 00:49:59.710
how does this make a difference?
You know,
out in the real world.
Well,

797
00:49:59.711 --> 00:50:03.340
it doesn't necessarily make a difference tomorrow or the next day or whatnot,

798
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.780
but it contributes to a,

799
00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:09.820
to a broader and a deeper body of knowledge that then it develops into a

800
00:50:09.821 --> 00:50:13.690
technology or a capability that has a direct impact of the world.

801
00:50:13.691 --> 00:50:16.540
So that's how I would generically answer it.

802
00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:20.970
<v 4>So,
yeah,
so I got a little excited there and interrupted you.
Sorry.
Um,</v>

803
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:24.680
so one of the things that we do is we actively look at the research that's

804
00:50:24.681 --> 00:50:26.780
currently being done to be able to build on it.

805
00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.900
And the cool thing is this is all very new.
So anything,

806
00:50:29.901 --> 00:50:34.160
any ideas that you come up with have not really been tested to the full degree.

807
00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:37.310
So even high school students were able to put experiments up there.

808
00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:41.690
One really nice example I like to think about is,
um,

809
00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:45.720
so commander were referred to bone loss osteoporosis.
There,
um,

810
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.650
is a bone loss drug that's an injectable that's in common use.

811
00:50:48.651 --> 00:50:53.630
Now they have $700 million of revenue a quarter.
It's,
it's crazy.

812
00:50:53.631 --> 00:50:57.530
They're so successful.
But in order to test the drug,

813
00:50:57.531 --> 00:50:59.420
they had to go through animal clinical trials.

814
00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:03.620
And what they did was they sent up a bunch of mice up into space,

815
00:51:03.621 --> 00:51:05.690
onto the space station.
And then,
um,
and before that,

816
00:51:05.691 --> 00:51:10.160
even on the shuttle induced osteoporosis in these mice very quickly and then

817
00:51:10.161 --> 00:51:15.020
tried the drug on them and they were able to reduce the time to market by

818
00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:19.220
shortening the clinical trial period from two or three years down to something

819
00:51:19.221 --> 00:51:21.890
like a three or four months.
So if you do the math,

820
00:51:21.891 --> 00:51:23.630
you think about how much quicker it went to market,

821
00:51:23.631 --> 00:51:24.980
that's a huge savings for them.

822
00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:28.550
And that was the kind of thing that they could only do in space,

823
00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:31.160
something that was not possible to do here on earth.

824
00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:33.920
And there are lots of other examples like that too.
So as,

825
00:51:33.921 --> 00:51:36.710
as as commander suggested,
you can go and look on the websites

826
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:42.800
<v 7>when,
regarding what a recycling capabilities of a space station,</v>

827
00:51:42.801 --> 00:51:46.550
what can be recycled here or what needs to be brought from Earth.

828
00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:51.470
And the second question is how do either,
so after you smell something,

829
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:55.580
it reached to your stomach because it's foreign because the gravity and ours do

830
00:51:55.581 --> 00:51:59.250
need to do special maneuver for cause it to happen.

831
00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.251
<v 3>Actually the,</v>

832
00:52:00.251 --> 00:52:04.240
I'll take the second first and then hopefully I'll remember the first question.

833
00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:06.370
Uh,
but your,

834
00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:10.810
your ability to chew,
swallow,

835
00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:12.940
all of that doesn't change up there.

836
00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:18.120
So you could probably stand out in your head and swallow your food.
I,
I'm not,

837
00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:22.720
I wouldn't recommend doing.
Yeah,
but it doesn't,

838
00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:25.630
it's not impacted at all.
I will say that,
uh,

839
00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:29.920
on occasion I've had a sense of heartburn.

840
00:52:29.921 --> 00:52:32.990
I've woken up in the middle of the night with a sense of heartburn,
uh,

841
00:52:32.991 --> 00:52:36.190
that might have been unique to the environment there.
But even up there,

842
00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:41.110
it was very rare for me.
I remembered at Kareena my first flight.

843
00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:44.000
I don't remember it after that.
Um,

844
00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:48.190
so those functions stay pretty much the same.

845
00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:52.210
So you asked the first question you had to do with recycling,
right?

846
00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:59.150
Uh,
on the space station,
of course,
we're maintaining the atmosphere.
Uh,

847
00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:00.513
and uh,

848
00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:05.640
that means feeding oxygen into the atmosphere as it's consumed and our

849
00:53:06.431 --> 00:53:07.264
breathing,

850
00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:12.430
it means removing carbon dioxide is exhaled and builds up because he can't

851
00:53:12.431 --> 00:53:17.431
tolerate a very high level of co two in the atmosphere.

852
00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:22.360
Uh,
it means removing the humidity,
um,
eh,

853
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:25.920
that we breathe out or it turns into a rain forest shortly.

854
00:53:25.921 --> 00:53:30.040
So you have to remove that.
Well,
all of those products that you,

855
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:34.770
you're either while removing,
if you can recycle them,
of course,

856
00:53:34.771 --> 00:53:39.480
you and prove the closed loop efficiency of the system.
So we've got,

857
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:44.880
uh,
for example,
we read,
we recover all of the humidity.
Uh,

858
00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:50.210
we recover the vast majority of the human liquid waste urine and all of that is

859
00:53:51.421 --> 00:53:55.950
collected and put through a,
uh,
uh,
a process,
uh,

860
00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:59.520
to recycle it.
And I,
I don't remember the exact number,

861
00:53:59.521 --> 00:54:03.330
but I want to say we're not in the order of 70 to 80% efficiency,

862
00:54:03.331 --> 00:54:07.010
somewhere in that range of recycling water.
Uh,

863
00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:11.070
the carbon dioxide.
Uh,
let's see,
some of,

864
00:54:11.071 --> 00:54:14.340
I'm trying to remember what,
where we're currently at.

865
00:54:14.341 --> 00:54:18.240
Some of that has dumped overboard.
Some of it is reclaimed.

866
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:23.190
We're adding technologies to what we were previously dumping overboard,

867
00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:27.720
uh,
that where we can try to recover that as well.
And eventually,
you know,

868
00:54:27.721 --> 00:54:31.950
you want to get too close to 100% efficiency as possible in the closed loop

869
00:54:31.951 --> 00:54:36.930
system.
Uh,
we're not there yet.
Uh,
and we have a long ways to go both in the,

870
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:37.580
in the,

871
00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:42.480
in increasing that efficiency as well as increasing the performance of each

872
00:54:42.481 --> 00:54:47.481
component of recycling and perhaps more significantly the reliability of those

873
00:54:49.321 --> 00:54:51.450
components.
Uh,

874
00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:56.190
access to space is difficult.
I mentioned that before,
but,
uh,

875
00:54:56.191 --> 00:54:59.970
access to the space station to lower earth orbit is relatively easy.

876
00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:03.930
So we in the space station is huge as I described.

877
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:08.250
So we have spare parts for just about everything up there and we can turn

878
00:55:08.251 --> 00:55:12.780
something around in the ground and maybe get a spare part up there and within at

879
00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:15.420
least a couple of months.
Uh,
but when we leave earth orbit,

880
00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:16.980
even gone back to the mode,

881
00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:21.930
access is going to be an order of magnitude more difficult.

882
00:55:21.931 --> 00:55:25.380
And then when we go to Mars,
it's going to be orders of magnitude more difficult,

883
00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:30.780
uh,
to be able to respond to a failure of a system or a loss of redundancy.

884
00:55:30.781 --> 00:55:35.130
Or we won't be,
we won't have the capacity to take a bunch of spare parts.

885
00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:40.410
So reliability system as well as the performance needs to be vastly improved

886
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:42.990
before to do that.

887
00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:48.660
