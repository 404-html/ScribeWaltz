1
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.680
Today.
We welcome Dr. John Medina who has actually we're bucketing and back.

2
00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:13.520
He has been here in 2008 and 2010.
Um,
welcome back John.

3
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.000
And uh,

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.190
he's a professor of bioengineering at the University of Washington School of

5
00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:22.790
medicine.
Uh,
his books includes brain roles,

6
00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:25.280
brain rules for the baby brain rules for aging well,

7
00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:27.530
which is the one that he's going to talk to you today,

8
00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:32.050
which I think could apply to everybody in this room.
And um,
so yeah,

9
00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:34.430
so let me welcome Dr. Medina.

10
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.530
<v 1>Well,
it's great to be back.</v>

11
00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:42.980
I've done the last two over in the California office as the San Francisco,

12
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.430
so I appreciate the invitation to come back here and thank you for taking part

13
00:00:46.431 --> 00:00:50.690
of your afternoon to spend with a developmental molecular biologist.

14
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.320
We are not known for giving compelling speeches and you've just had lunch.

15
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.280
So I will put the professor perfectly understands if you need to kind of roll

16
00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:00.890
over and take a nap while it as I'm talking.
But if you're not,

17
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.960
we're going to be talking about this guy.
So third one in the series a,

18
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.200
a brain rules for baby brain rules.

19
00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:09.020
We kind of in the middle and then brain rules for aging.
Well,
so birth,

20
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:13.490
life and death all at once at the same time and do so in about 50 minutes

21
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.250
specifically.
I'm going to be dividing this talking to three parts.

22
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.790
I'm going to introduce buy in.
So doing introduce the newest member of the trio.

23
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.490
Uh,
the title of the talk is the importance of friends learning.

24
00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:26.690
And this is weird nostalgia and we're going to talk about some from brain

25
00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:27.620
science to behavior.

26
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.530
My research interests are the genetics of psychiatric disorders.

27
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.680
I spent a long time thinking about how the brain develops in the womb at the

28
00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:34.790
level of cell and gene.

29
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.370
And then what happens when things screw up in years later,

30
00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:39.200
you get a psychiatric disorder.

31
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.990
So I have to speak three dialects of brain science,
the,
uh,

32
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.380
have to be at home in the behavioral world and in the cellular world and my home

33
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:50.020
base,
which is on the Helix,
uh,
the world of biochemistry and uh,
um,
and uh,

34
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.570
neurobiology.
So on the basis of some of that experience.

35
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:56.870
I'm going to divide this introduction to the book brain rules for aging.

36
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.040
Well do three parts,
part one.

37
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.250
I'll talk to you a little bit about the origin of the book and then I can't do

38
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:01.791
the whole thing.

39
00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:04.340
So when I thought I would do is that I would talk about the first chapter,

40
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.870
which is the important of friendships,

41
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.150
part three of the last chapter of the power of reminiscing.

42
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:09.950
And if there's any time left at all,

43
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.380
I'll give a few comments about the middle of the chapter.

44
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.950
We'll have a hard stop certainly at two o'clock and I'll try and finish a little

45
00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:19.460
before then so that there's some time for Q and a and the microphones.
Okay.

46
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.140
So this book is all about human behavior as most of my books are,

47
00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:28.460
which means it's a discussion about nature and nurture and for all ages as I

48
00:02:28.461 --> 00:02:29.294
hope to show.

49
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.230
But I'd like to give you an example of how nature and nurture work together in

50
00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:35.690
this subject.
And then so illustrate the beginnings of the book.

51
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.410
What I have here is a list of lyrics in their day.

52
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.600
They were the number one song of their time.

53
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.580
I'm going to keep telling you the lyrics and I'm not going to sing them.

54
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.700
You see why I went in the molecular sciences?
If I am,
I tried to say,
well,

55
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:52.550
he didn't marry a musician.
If you recognize the melody though,

56
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:55.310
I want you to slip up your hand.
If you don't mind everybody else,

57
00:02:55.311 --> 00:02:58.490
I would like you to look at the person who just slipped up their hand and assess

58
00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:01.960
their relative.
Okay?
Ready?
Here's the first one.

59
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.470
If there's a bustle in your hedge row,
don't be alarmed.

60
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.990
Now it's just a spring clean for the May Queen.
Yes,

61
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:10.930
there are two paths you can go buy,
but in the long run,
what is that song?

62
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.630
Stairway to heaven,
1971 album for him.
1975 as a single released.
Okay.

63
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.580
Number two,
a traffic jam.
When you're already late.

64
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.240
I no smoking sign on your cigarette break.

65
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.300
It's like 10,000 spoons with all you need is a knife.

66
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:33.010
It's like meeting the man of your dreams and then meeting his beautiful wife

67
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:36.580
Alanis Morissette off the album,
jagged little pill,
1991 very good.

68
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.730
Lyric number three we break up.
You call me,
I love you.

69
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.720
Ooh,
we called it off again last night,
but Ooh,

70
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:51.340
this time I'm telling you,
I'm telling you we are never ever,

71
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:55.570
ever getting back together.
Yes,
and Dee Taylor Swift,

72
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:59.470
2012 for that three quarters of you that did not raise your hand.

73
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.400
This is an example of nature and nurture and here's how that works and what

74
00:04:05.931 --> 00:04:09.250
we're going to be talking about today,
which is the gyro sciences nature.

75
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:11.330
You may have heard some of these songs in your tween.

76
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.580
Certainly they were a well established and they sold lots of a copy in their

77
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:19.600
time.
What year you were a teen dependent upon when you were born.

78
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:21.790
I can't think of anything more nature than that,

79
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.710
but there's a nurture component too.

80
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.710
You didn't all hear the same songs as a teenager.

81
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.980
Some of you were 18 in 1971 when stairway to heaven was hitting the airwaves.

82
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.440
Some of you were 18 in 1991 when Alannis Morissette was entering the the

83
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.580
airwaves and some of you were 18 and 2012 when Taylor swift was busy making her

84
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:45.850
mark.
Even within a single country like this,

85
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.590
the cultures are different so we have nature when you were born and nurture the

86
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:53.920
cultural impact on your life and all of a sudden we have the book there.

87
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:57.280
It is in a nutshell,
nature and nurture and aging.

88
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.190
Now there were two origins about this book.

89
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.610
My task was to write a book about aging brains and still keep nature and nurture

90
00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:07.990
in sight.
There was both a relational origin and a quantitative origin.

91
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.981
The relational,

92
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:13.840
I think you'd be described by talking about Tom Hanks that informed the audience

93
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:15.970
I wished to try to address as I was writing the book,

94
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.070
but the quantitative origins were percentages,

95
00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:21.460
the relative contributions of nature and nurture to the whole process of aging,

96
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:22.990
which is actually something you can measure.

97
00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:25.930
So we're going to do Tom Hanks first and they'll do the quantitative and then

98
00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:29.020
we'll do the law,
the first chapter,
the last chapter,
and then we'll be done.
Okay,

99
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.920
so Tom Hanks,

100
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.600
Tom Hanks and I are the same age and so as you might expect,

101
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.340
I would be writing for Tom Hanks in his night.
I'm 61 years old.

102
00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:42.100
Tom Hanks in his late fifties early sixties incarnation for sure.

103
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.400
And part of the audience is for this because we're asking questions about what

104
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:49.390
you can do given that your brain,
the cognitive components of uh,

105
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:53.080
of brain processing is changing and so on.
So that would be make some sense.

106
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.290
What might not be too obvious though was the fact that I also this book for 24

107
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:05.141
year olds and 30 year olds and there's a very specific reason why I bracketed

108
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:07.520
that age group.
It's a younger audience.

109
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.780
This is because of the evolutionary considerations of our past history,

110
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.360
which was inspired by a quote from Thomas Hobbs.

111
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.260
How many of you remember Thomas Hobbes?
Great Caveman quote,
cave person quote,

112
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.910
the natural state of men was solitary,
poor,
nasty,

113
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.090
brutish and short for hundreds of thousands ne millions of years,

114
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:33.530
depending upon where you put homo erectus these days,

115
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.780
most of us died before our 30th birthday.
We didn't have a 40th birthday,

116
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.580
we didn't have a 50th birthday.

117
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:43.550
There was no such thing as grandparents for millions of years,

118
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:44.870
hundreds of thousands of years.

119
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.560
It was all over by 30 and Darwin agrees with Thomas.

120
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:50.750
Hobbs shows up lots of different ways.

121
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.960
Most of the metabolic processes that that make you functional have piqued by age

122
00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:58.940
30 and then there's a slow decline after that.

123
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.690
Many of us think that selective pressure on our bunnies peaking at 30 that's

124
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:08.090
enough to give your kids and then have your kids give kids and then you become

125
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:10.670
irrelevant.
And if you're going to live longer than that,

126
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.400
it's going to be genetic freefall.

127
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.730
So if we agree with Tom Hobbs at the hard world of Darwin,

128
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:17.990
is there an average age?

129
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:22.160
Selective pressure on fitness is only going to occur for us to about here before

130
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:25.520
the Upper Paleolithic early humans really did die young most for their 30th

131
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:29.190
birthday.
That's a an anthropologist out of Michigan,
but you have many,

132
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.390
many metabolic processes which start their failures here.

133
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.720
The brain peaks even earlier.
I'm going to show that in just a second,

134
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.460
but that simply means there's genetic freefall past the age of 24 to 30 if I'm

135
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:42.440
going to write a book about human aging,

136
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.280
I'm not going to be addressing 65 year olds and expect to capture all of our

137
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:47.720
evolutionary history.

138
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.870
I need to write to 30 year olds because after 30 you're already aging,

139
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:56.920
you're already declining and your brain's peaked.

140
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.580
We're going to show this by series of Wexler.

141
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:03.610
A approximations peaked at age 24 so congratulations.

142
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:07.010
For most of you in this room,
it's all over,

143
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.250
mostly by age 24 if you take a look at the standard Wexler scores,
and this is,

144
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.840
and it took actually quite a while ago,
here's the reference for it.

145
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.170
What we're going to do is we're going to take a look at what you'll see is that

146
00:08:18.171 --> 00:08:21.390
peak cognitive talents,
uh,
it's kind of asynchronous.

147
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.330
There are some that peak early,
there are some of the peak lake,

148
00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:28.060
but the vast majority of them peak your brain peaks at very specific,
uh,

149
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:32.000
windows depending on how you've a few about feel about a Wexxar psychometric

150
00:08:32.001 --> 00:08:36.230
assays.
Here's the year that peak is achieved from zero to 60.
Uh,

151
00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:37.670
and the type of cognitive abilities,

152
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.230
a short term memory word pairs at peaked at 13.
Okay.
Similarity profiles,

153
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:44.690
which is a form of pattern matching peaks at age 40.

154
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:50.020
Your vocabulary peaks at age 50 and say goodbye to everything else because

155
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:53.600
everything else was in the middle.
Digital symbol and encoding,
long term visual,

156
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.240
visual processing,
picture block design,
object assembly,

157
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.050
digital spans a backwards,

158
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.740
a spatial longterm memory faces reverse list and about a thousand more that I

159
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:05.130
can put average them.
It's 23.96.

160
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.180
That's when you peak and everything else declines in the median is actually

161
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:11.100
quite close to this.
So even though it's a synchronous,

162
00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:15.900
there really is a cluster right around there.
So it's a research question.

163
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.650
If I were to write an audience write for an audience of 65 year olds,

164
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:22.590
but I really could be writing for an audience of 24 year olds,

165
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.640
is there such a thing as a cognitive four o one k for the mind?

166
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:35.210
Should you be starting to do some things now when you are earlier investing now

167
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.530
that will pay dividends later when you do get to 65 and you actually can feel

168
00:09:40.531 --> 00:09:45.420
the effects of accumulative longterm erosion that actually began at 24 25 I will

169
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:48.510
call that mostly a research idea because the real question is we don't know.

170
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.450
But another way of thinking about aging would be to think of it not at,

171
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:56.030
not in terms of Aa RP land,
but in terms of when you're just busy,
uh,

172
00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:00.180
getting rid of your student loans.
So most metabolic processes fail here.

173
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:05.190
Your cognitive decline fails.
They're investing in age friendly behaviors here.

174
00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:06.030
Does that make sense?

175
00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:09.810
And think of the idea as a cognitive 401k for these ages such that by the time

176
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:12.480
your post 30 there's some things you really want to be doing.

177
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:16.860
If you really want to keep your mind fresh and lively up to what we think is the

178
00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:20.430
genetic maximum of anywhere between hundred and 15 in the hundred and 22 years.

179
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:25.800
That means my audience for this book wasn't just Tom Hanks in his sixties it's

180
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:30.801
also Tom Hanks in his twenties and thirties so that's my audience.

181
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.510
Okay.
Second origin,
I told you there was a quantitative origin.

182
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.840
This is a quantitative relationship between nature and nurture.

183
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.220
To understand some numbers though,

184
00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:43.830
I have to define a few terms for you when we talk about,

185
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.920
you've heard the term longevity and then acts as a formal definition in,
in uh,

186
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.773
in my world,

187
00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:53.310
a longevity simply means the amount of time you could spend on the planet if the

188
00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:57.570
conditions were perfect.
Okay.
How much time?
It's probably genetic in origin,

189
00:10:57.571 --> 00:11:00.970
mostly genetic.
How much time do you have?
If the conditions are perfect,

190
00:11:00.971 --> 00:11:04.740
you don't break a leg,
you know,
get into a war.
You don't a year,
it's perfect.

191
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.700
Okay.
Between 150 to 922 years is what we think it is.

192
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.790
That's different from the concept of lifespan.

193
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.150
Lifespan is the number of years you can survive on the planet given the

194
00:11:16.151 --> 00:11:19.590
conditions are hardly perfect,
okay?
You might be in a war,

195
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.330
you might be in the Serengeti and then gargle or Craner for a million years.
Uh,

196
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.840
the lifespan for most of us was around right around age 30,
as I said,

197
00:11:27.841 --> 00:11:32.820
and it really didn't start accelerating much until a turn of the last century in

198
00:11:32.821 --> 00:11:36.990
the United States where you could actually increase your lifespan to between 39

199
00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:40.350
and 40 years of age.
Now it's double that.
It's almost 80 years of age,

200
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:45.380
but heading towards the idea of how can you make your lifespan equal,

201
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:51.600
your longevity and how can you transit through that and keep your brain healthy.

202
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:56.440
Inhale being as how you live to 115 to 122 if you did certain things.

203
00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:00.040
Well that's actually been quantitative as quantitatively assessed.

204
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:05.041
Here's what is a quote from the book all told anywhere between 25 and 33% of the

205
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:07.120
variants in life expectancy,

206
00:12:07.121 --> 00:12:10.720
there's your life expectancy can be explained by how well you chose your
parents,

207
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.740
so there's a strong genetic component to how long you're going to live,

208
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.220
but only strong in the,

209
00:12:16.221 --> 00:12:20.020
in the sense of you think that between 25 and 33% is strong because the rest of

210
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:24.970
it is not nature at all.
The rest of it's that guy.
The rest of it's nurture,

211
00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:26.890
so this much is going to be up to your helix.

212
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.410
This much is going to be up to your lifestyle.

213
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.160
What do we know about this that could transform a lifespan which really isn't

214
00:12:36.251 --> 00:12:41.230
geared for much selective pressure much be on 24 to 30 and make it last an

215
00:12:41.231 --> 00:12:46.231
additional 70 years being as how that's what most of your life is going to be.

216
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.600
Well,
there's the book,
we know 10 things.

217
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.440
There are 10 things well subscribed and anchored in the peer reviewed literature

218
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:01.300
that can change this number to the affirmative and increase your lifespan so

219
00:13:01.301 --> 00:13:04.090
that life span and longevity begin to approach something of parody.

220
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.830
I'm not going to go through all of them,
I can't,

221
00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:08.740
but the rest of the book is about that.
There are 10 of them.
Relationships,

222
00:13:08.741 --> 00:13:12.160
gratitude,
mindfulness,
learning video games.
Yet by just said video games,

223
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.100
Alzheimer's diet,
sleep,
lifespan and retirement.

224
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.740
We're going to go through relationships that we're going to go through and

225
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:20.770
finally get into retirement,
so if you're taking notes,

226
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.060
I advise you not to because as you can see,
I speak nearly at the speed of light,

227
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.120
but that's okay because I'll tell you where I am at any one part of the lecture.

228
00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:30.170
We're going to talk about the first chapter Sunday.

229
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.200
That's going to sound really squishy at first,

230
00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:36.100
but actually isn't very squishy at all and have something very powerful to say

231
00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:39.340
to people that are still in the process of navigating their social
relationships.

232
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.700
Here is the first rule.
We've got 10 of them to go by.

233
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.960
We're going to get to that guy,

234
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.770
be a friend to others and that others be a friend to you.

235
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.040
I'm going to start with a negative illustration of this principle.

236
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.890
If I say the word,
what am I going to show my age?

237
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.540
How many of you remember dear Abby,

238
00:13:55.541 --> 00:13:57.910
does anybody remembered your heavy from way back when and about half of you?

239
00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.800
Okay.
For those of you who did not raise your hand,

240
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:04.060
dear Abby was though an advice columnist from way back when.
Uh,
and uh,

241
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.020
she had a monozygotic,

242
00:14:05.021 --> 00:14:08.680
twin Derren and lamb and lenders who also was an advice columnist and they hated

243
00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:10.510
each other's guts for most of their lives.

244
00:14:10.511 --> 00:14:14.170
Yet they both wrote and Abby wrote a book about some of her favorite letters of

245
00:14:14.171 --> 00:14:14.980
all time.

246
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.550
Here I've got a great illustration of the friends you do not want to be.

247
00:14:18.551 --> 00:14:22.090
This is not something that's going to get you to your 115 year maximum.

248
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:26.320
Dear Abby,
I'm an Italian men age 34.

249
00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:30.040
I am of medium build and I'm told that I am good looking.

250
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.090
I drive a sightseeing bus by day.
So I speak a little English.

251
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:38.920
I am single and would like to correspond with an American woman between the ages

252
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:43.900
of 30 and 65.
She doesn't have to be beautiful,

253
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:47.650
but I want one who has a steady income and owns a late model.

254
00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:52.490
American automobile.
If you know of a woman who like to correspond with me,

255
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:57.580
please ask her to send a picture of the automobile job.

256
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.350
Not particularly socially competent,
more to the experience of the elderly.

257
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:05.720
This is a,
an anecdote I actually have in the book.

258
00:15:05.721 --> 00:15:07.160
It's on the subject of loneliness will,

259
00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:08.600
when we start out with a relational chapter,

260
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.420
a journalist was interviewing a woman is a quote from the book.

261
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.750
A journalist was interviewing a woman named Molly Holderness on her hundred and

262
00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:17.210
third birthday.
Tell us Mrs Holderness,

263
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.690
what do you think is the best thing about being 103?

264
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.920
The journalist asked Mrs Holderness look,
the journalists straight in the eye,

265
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:28.820
her response was quick and good humored.
No peer pressure.

266
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:30.763
She said simply,

267
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.210
the reason why I leave with that anecdote is something that actually was a

268
00:15:35.211 --> 00:15:37.250
little heartbreaking and going through is I,
uh,

269
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.980
I've known certainly about the molecules and have been invested in,

270
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.390
in my career for almost 35,
40 years now.
Uh,

271
00:15:44.391 --> 00:15:46.280
but what I went through when I was writing this book,

272
00:15:46.281 --> 00:15:48.830
I went to go visit a system learning living,
uh,
facilities,

273
00:15:48.831 --> 00:15:50.480
what used to be called nursing homes and whatnot.

274
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.410
And I would ask people about how they felt about growing old [inaudible] 75.

275
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:58.100
There are 80,
85 years old and almost universally,

276
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:02.420
and maybe it was just as hardly as it was,
not a randomized,
blinded anything.

277
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.390
They used one word and they set it all the time.

278
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.170
They felt like increasingly they were invisible

279
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.400
people stop touching him.

280
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.720
<v 2>Okay.</v>

281
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.590
<v 1>When they talked to them,</v>

282
00:16:15.591 --> 00:16:19.580
they would talk to them like children and they would raise the amplitude of

283
00:16:19.581 --> 00:16:21.920
their voices if they could not there,

284
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.430
except if they were invisible
in the literature.

285
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.210
About 40% of American seniors feel that way.

286
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:38.360
And we are only in the beginning stages of understanding how toxic those

287
00:16:38.361 --> 00:16:40.460
feelings are to the brain.

288
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.390
It hurts somatic tissue and it hurts neural cells.

289
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.330
Lowliness can even increase the probability of death.

290
00:16:47.331 --> 00:16:50.360
And if you're in the throes of it where you're starting to get what we call f

291
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:53.930
three three.one depressions or anxiety disorders,
you've got some issues.

292
00:16:53.931 --> 00:16:56.540
There are some physiological effects of loneliness that are worth going through.

293
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:59.540
Any roads,
cognitive function,
increased memory dysfunction,

294
00:16:59.541 --> 00:17:02.410
and perceptual speed decreases is what you can measure.

295
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.390
The laboratory erodes immune function.
If you feel lonely,

296
00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:08.990
increased risk for viral infections and we have a greater risk for cancer,
uh,

297
00:17:08.991 --> 00:17:10.820
it will also elevate your stress hormone levels.

298
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:13.220
You have an increased risk for hypertension,
increased risk for stroke,

299
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.380
increased risk for heart disease.
And here's the biggie.

300
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.900
Probability of death is 45%.

301
00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:21.860
If you feel invisible then for seniors that are socially active,

302
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:28.310
why those loneliness do that to seniors?
We actually think we know why.

303
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.460
And there are two concepts you would need to understand in order to,
I mean,

304
00:17:31.461 --> 00:17:35.900
still in camera range there.
The,
uh,
um,
in order for us to understand it,

305
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:39.500
one of them is that you need to know that your body can undergo systemic

306
00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:41.180
inflammation,
low level inflammation.

307
00:17:41.181 --> 00:17:42.740
It's just like the information you get when you get cut,

308
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.410
but you can get it throughout your body and your body does not like it.

309
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.170
And I'll show you how much it doesn't like it because the brain doesn't like it.

310
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:53.040
Um,
you probably know neurons,
about 10% of the brain is filled with neurons.

311
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:57.180
And in order for a neuron to work well,
it needs to be insulated.
Okay?

312
00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.000
Just like the plastic on a copper wire needs to be insulated.

313
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:04.440
If a neuron is insulated,
it's insulated with something we call white matter.

314
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.950
So it looks white under,
under the observing conditions that we make.

315
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.550
If a neuron is insulated with white matter,
it can click along.

316
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.760
A signal can be propagated about a hundred meters per second,

317
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:18.360
but if you remove the Myelin sheaving,
that's what that white matter is called.

318
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.650
If you remove the Myelin,

319
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.280
now the signal can only propagate it about one meter per second and it's usually

320
00:18:23.281 --> 00:18:27.300
scattered in diffuse.
You do not want your installation gone,

321
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:31.080
but that's exactly what systemic inflammation does.

322
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.750
It attacks white matter in the brain

323
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:40.040
hobbles cognitive function simply because you feel invisible.

324
00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:43.830
<v 2>It looks like this.</v>

325
00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:45.461
<v 1>In fact,</v>

326
00:18:45.461 --> 00:18:48.610
we can think of it as kind of a four stage process of it because it actually

327
00:18:48.611 --> 00:18:51.490
repeats itself because when you feel chronically lonely,
an invisible,

328
00:18:51.491 --> 00:18:54.010
does that make you more gregarious or less?
What do you think?

329
00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.990
Do you think that makes you want to go,
oh,

330
00:18:55.991 --> 00:18:59.740
well it's so good to see you and then no one sees you.

331
00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:04.950
And so you call out step one chronic loneliness is experience.

332
00:19:05.531 --> 00:19:06.820
Yep,
I'm chronically lonely.

333
00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:12.060
This is such a big deal that the systemic inflammation that's going to occur is

334
00:19:12.191 --> 00:19:15.910
this gets you the same numbers as if you were smoking two packs a day regularly,

335
00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.700
or if you were morbidly obese.
So loneliness,

336
00:19:18.701 --> 00:19:22.050
induce systemic inflammation is as at comparable levels to people who smoke or

337
00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.750
are morbidly obese.
Step three,
inflammation damages,
white matter into the brain,

338
00:19:25.751 --> 00:19:26.860
that's for sure what it does.

339
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.400
And that leads to increased withdrawing behavior and the cycle just repeats

340
00:19:30.401 --> 00:19:30.791
itself.

341
00:19:30.791 --> 00:19:35.791
So it's not a small thing to say that having friends and being able to be

342
00:19:36.311 --> 00:19:39.190
socially competent,
it's an extraordinarily vital,

343
00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.940
I would say precarious thing for an elderly brain.

344
00:19:41.941 --> 00:19:46.240
And if elderly brains feel shut in in your and your mom and your dad feels like

345
00:19:46.241 --> 00:19:49.450
nobody is visiting them and they get systemic inflammation,

346
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.050
you can hobble their ability to think,

347
00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.060
<v 2>okay.</v>

348
00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.990
<v 1>And if you socialize them,
I'll show you how we measure socialization.</v>

349
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:04.580
You can reverse all that bad stuff I just said.
Hence the rule,

350
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:09.380
socialization and brain function.
Okay.
How will we measure socialization?

351
00:20:09.381 --> 00:20:12.830
We measured these what are called social integration scores.
Uh,

352
00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.870
and the measurements actually simple and straight forward.

353
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.050
What you'll do is you'll look at marital status,
we look at volunteer activities,

354
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.140
frequency of contact with family,
frequency of contact with neighbors.

355
00:20:21.141 --> 00:20:24.350
And then we assign you a poorly integrated or a highly integrated score.

356
00:20:24.351 --> 00:20:25.790
And you're somewhere around there.

357
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.510
So when we take a look at people that are socially integrated versus not,

358
00:20:29.511 --> 00:20:33.170
and we're looking at their brain function,
here's what we find chiefly.

359
00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.110
There is both a positive and a negative component to this,

360
00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:40.970
but the higher your social integration score here,
the better your brain resists.

361
00:20:40.971 --> 00:20:44.960
The cognitive effects of aging and buffers against the effects of loneliness.

362
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.120
Okay.
The more friends you have,

363
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.440
the more you can buffer against all that bad stuff or the more highly integrated

364
00:20:50.441 --> 00:20:53.530
you are.
Like I said,
there's both a negative and a positive to this.

365
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.740
Memory decline occurs at twice the rate for seniors that score here than

366
00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:04.390
seniors.
That score here measured over a 12 year period.

367
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.920
Socially isolated seniors,
global memory scores.
A memory is a,

368
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.950
is a multifaceted gadgets.
We have to kind of think of gross domestic product,

369
00:21:11.951 --> 00:21:15.310
but you can get at it.
A global memory score falls at twice the rate,

370
00:21:15.311 --> 00:21:17.080
so socializing effects of memory.

371
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.380
One of the things you can do is that for people that are becoming increasingly

372
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.640
isolated socially,

373
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.110
they begin to forget things at about twice the rate of an interactive senior,

374
00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:29.710
so that's the negative part.
There's a positive component to this too.

375
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.140
Global cognitive decline,

376
00:21:32.141 --> 00:21:35.890
which is a measure of processing speed and executive function in a whole range

377
00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:38.800
of really good things.
Global cognitive decline,

378
00:21:38.801 --> 00:21:43.030
which occurs naturally when you age is 70% less,

379
00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:48.210
77 0% less if you score in the highly integrated range than if you score in the

380
00:21:49.511 --> 00:21:53.170
poorly integrated range.
So,
uh,
if that's the,
if that's the negative effects,

381
00:21:53.171 --> 00:21:54.850
the positive effects are going to be something like this.

382
00:21:54.851 --> 00:21:58.270
A high socialization score versus a low socialization score,

383
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.190
a 70% reduction in the rate of general global cognitive decline compared to low.

384
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.500
We even have some neuro anatomy.
We can work with this.
We now know what it does.

385
00:22:08.501 --> 00:22:12.160
Once you stop the de Myelination of the brain,
we'll get it nice and insulated.

386
00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:17.110
You also actually promote growth if you are regularly interacting with people.

387
00:22:17.111 --> 00:22:21.130
So here's a quote from the journal Nature.
As Chelsea Waltz,
a quote,

388
00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:25.330
researchers suspect that the cognitively demanding act of socializing can

389
00:22:25.331 --> 00:22:28.210
actually build up the brain,
like exercising builds up muscle.

390
00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.330
This brain reserve may then act as a buffer against functional loss,

391
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.940
even in the face of conditions as Alzheimer's disease.

392
00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.510
Here's what we think is going on with the brain in particular,
the frontal lobe,

393
00:22:37.511 --> 00:22:40.240
particularly the prefrontal lobe,
you see gray matter volume increases.

394
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.360
The more socialized you have somebody that's involved in decision making,

395
00:22:43.361 --> 00:22:45.130
attentional states executive function,

396
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.740
which is a measure of impulse control and cognitive control.

397
00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.550
People have good executive functioning often really terrific at math.
Okay,

398
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.630
so the ability to understand that the loneliness can actually change in math

399
00:22:55.631 --> 00:22:58.780
score is probably where that data goes and I'm not making that up.

400
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:04.060
Amygdala volume doubles involved in emotion generation and emotional memory.

401
00:23:04.061 --> 00:23:08.110
So your ability actually to feel things except at something besides being

402
00:23:08.111 --> 00:23:10.090
invisible.
Can is something that's available.

403
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.580
And then something in the enter Renal Cortex,
the underwriter,

404
00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.070
the cortex is how many of you've heard of the hippocampus before?

405
00:23:15.071 --> 00:23:16.420
Have you heard of that before?
Okay.

406
00:23:16.421 --> 00:23:19.330
You can think of the NRL cortex is kind of a gateway into the hippocampus

407
00:23:19.331 --> 00:23:22.420
because it's involved in memory and that gray matter volume also increases.

408
00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.330
The more you socialize.
It's involved in memory formation and storage.

409
00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:30.490
And so I have a piece of advice for you.
The first of two in this lecture.

410
00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:34.540
Number one,
become socially competent

411
00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:42.320
at age 24 because the erosion has already started at 25 cultivate friendships,

412
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.030
learn how to become a friend,

413
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:54.800
then have lots of them and sustain them over a long period of time.

414
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:59.000
Number two,
cultivate family ties.

415
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.520
It's actually a much more predictive of social interactions,

416
00:24:01.521 --> 00:24:03.080
mostly because you're stuck with your family.

417
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.240
So if you have problems with your family,

418
00:24:05.241 --> 00:24:06.950
one of the best things you can start doing it.

419
00:24:06.951 --> 00:24:11.120
Start repairing your relationships now because it's already declining and you're

420
00:24:11.121 --> 00:24:15.440
going to depend on them later.
And finally,
if you've got elderly loved ones,

421
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:19.490
do the same thing for them as recommendations.
Number one,

422
00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:22.670
become a friend and recommendation.
Number two,
repair your family life.

423
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.650
So I have some pieces of advice that's probably anchored fairly well in the Peer

424
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:31.250
Review Literature after age 24 learn to cultivate and maintain an active base of

425
00:24:31.251 --> 00:24:33.950
friends.
Interact with them often.
24 is not too early to start.

426
00:24:33.951 --> 00:24:37.400
Neither is 65 recommendation number two,
actively cultivate,

427
00:24:37.401 --> 00:24:41.390
maintain and repair familial relationships.
24 is not too early to start,

428
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.130
neither is 65.
And then finally,

429
00:24:43.131 --> 00:24:45.860
recommendation number three for your elderly loved ones.

430
00:24:45.861 --> 00:24:49.160
Make sure they follow recommendation number one.
Then recommendation number two,

431
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.300
not for any other reason.
If you well,
then self survival.

432
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:58.040
But the more you do that for others,
the more you will help yourself.

433
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:02.810
Let's go the last part of the book,
the last chapter,
the power of reminiscing.

434
00:25:02.811 --> 00:25:06.650
And then if we have some time,
I will go towards the middle.
Uh,
this is unusual.

435
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.380
I think there's a lot of people are not familiar with Ellen.

436
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.910
Langer is great work,
but here's the brain will,

437
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:14.120
I'm going to focus on the last sentence of this brain rule in retirement.

438
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.660
Never retire and be sure to reminisce.
Doesn't mean you can't leave your job.

439
00:25:17.661 --> 00:25:20.060
It just means that you have to keep your brain active for a long,
long time.

440
00:25:20.061 --> 00:25:23.300
So the more you can get an active now and you're engaged in an act,

441
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:26.690
in a brain active job as your profession,
the better off you're going to be.

442
00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:31.230
If you continue that,
even when you,
uh,
start collecting pensions or whatever,
uh,

443
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.460
withdrawing from your 401k looks like to you.
We're going to focus on this.

444
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.070
We're not gonna focus on retirement that we're going to focus on the be sure to

445
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:38.090
reminisce.
Now,

446
00:25:38.091 --> 00:25:41.090
what I mean by reminiscence actually it can be fairly well defined,

447
00:25:41.091 --> 00:25:43.610
but I'll give the subjective example.
Does anybody know who that is?

448
00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:46.880
Some of you are probably familiar.

449
00:25:46.881 --> 00:25:51.050
If you've ever gone to a grocery store and been buy baby food products.

450
00:25:51.051 --> 00:25:54.260
You already know who this is.
She's Anna Turner Cook.

451
00:25:55.100 --> 00:26:00.020
This is her
when she was six months old.

452
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.000
This is an Turner Cook.

453
00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.860
He's the original Gerber baby at age seven and 87 and I heard some awes in there

454
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:12.190
that is a dopamine lollipop and you are beginning to react to the idea of

455
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.150
reminiscing.
Okay?

456
00:26:14.151 --> 00:26:17.480
For those of you who raised your hands when you knew the lyrics to stairway to

457
00:26:17.481 --> 00:26:20.510
heaven,
folks who's that

458
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.090
look familiar to them.

459
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:25.670
This could be a whole bunch of people here that are just not going to get this,

460
00:26:25.671 --> 00:26:30.340
but about half of you will,
you have seen these people before.
If you've,

461
00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.550
you've seen these people before.

462
00:26:31.551 --> 00:26:36.470
If you were eight years old back in the 60s because this is the gang from Eddie

463
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.471
Haskell,

464
00:26:36.471 --> 00:26:41.180
beaver and Wally from an old television show called leave it to beaver only.

465
00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.040
This is now,
they were all eight and 10 and,

466
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.150
and six years old back then and now they're not.

467
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:49.320
So if you have any pattern matching here at all and you have a reminiscence bump

468
00:26:49.321 --> 00:26:53.820
at it and you reacted to those or react to whatever the leave it to beavers are

469
00:26:53.821 --> 00:26:57.270
in your life,
we actually can measure that reaction.

470
00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.970
And we have found some extraordinary things and I want to tell you about Ellen

471
00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:05.310
Langer is work to talk about it.
We begin with a puzzling headline.
Uh,

472
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.260
what's interesting about this is for the New York Times,

473
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:12.470
this was published this year and in it in May reliving communist past helps east

474
00:27:14.251 --> 00:27:18.450
German dementia patients.
Okay.

475
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:21.900
Most of you probably did not read this scintillating article.

476
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.150
What is the world does that mean?

477
00:27:24.151 --> 00:27:26.550
And what is there any brain science underneath that?

478
00:27:26.551 --> 00:27:29.640
Dementia is certainly going to be reactive to that.
Well,
there is,

479
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.160
there is an ability to explain this and I'm gonna show you the person who can

480
00:27:32.161 --> 00:27:34.650
explain it the best.
Her name is Ellen Langer.

481
00:27:34.651 --> 00:27:37.800
She is the first woman to be tenured at psychology at Harvard.

482
00:27:37.801 --> 00:27:41.730
She's still there and she's very famous for doing something called the counter

483
00:27:41.731 --> 00:27:43.650
clockwise experiment.

484
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.070
It's a very famous experiment in my world and I want to talk to you about the

485
00:27:47.071 --> 00:27:48.750
counterclockwise experiment a little bit,

486
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.960
but it won't make much sense unless we first talk about some background

487
00:27:51.961 --> 00:27:55.380
information that let Helen to design the experiment the way she did.

488
00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.170
She looked at the effects of the style dish.

489
00:27:57.171 --> 00:28:00.180
He looked at that dopamine lollipop you gave yourselves when you saw the Gerber

490
00:28:00.181 --> 00:28:04.230
baby,
if you did,
and she also looked at something that we call retrieval bias.

491
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.670
So the ability to look at a power reminisces and retrieval bias gives us our

492
00:28:08.671 --> 00:28:11.430
counterclockwise experiments.
So let's do,

493
00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:15.120
let's unpack each of those first nostalgia and then the a retrieval bias.

494
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:17.340
I'm going to say something surprising.

495
00:28:17.341 --> 00:28:22.341
I use the word weird and the title of this talk nostalgia is good for you.

496
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.290
We used to not think that.

497
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.190
And if you have a take the American value of let's push the forward,

498
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.440
let's put them all forward.
Let's,
let's do some new things.

499
00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:33.900
And I've been in research land virtually,
uh,

500
00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.760
like I say three or four decades now.

501
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.580
I'm used to loving the new and hating the old,
that's for sure.

502
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:42.420
We used to think that dwelling on the past was universally bad.
Uh,

503
00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:45.270
the turns out that that's not right,

504
00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:51.020
that a regular dose of healthy nostalgia actually does extraordinary things for

505
00:28:52.081 --> 00:28:54.150
the brain.
And I want to show it to you.
First of all,

506
00:28:54.151 --> 00:28:56.700
it's a psychometric evidence.
When people reminisce,

507
00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.640
three things happen that you can measure first their social connected to scores

508
00:28:59.641 --> 00:29:01.230
go up.
It's that stuff we were talking about.

509
00:29:01.231 --> 00:29:03.380
We are looking at highly integrated versus low integrated.

510
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:08.160
Number two eudemonic wellbeing scores go up.
This is a sense of,
uh,

511
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.340
the closest I can give it to you is the idea of fulfillment.

512
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.940
So if you love what you do here at Google,
you are fulfilled by your job.

513
00:29:14.941 --> 00:29:17.220
If you love what you do outside in somewhere else,

514
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.970
usually it measured by the absence of depression,
absence of anxiety disorders,

515
00:29:20.971 --> 00:29:21.804
but we'll be,

516
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:25.800
your feeling of wellbeing goes up with a more reminiscence and you have a

517
00:29:25.801 --> 00:29:29.250
greater frequency of positive memories.
The more you reminisce,

518
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:32.730
the more positive memories you start percolating up into your brain and the more

519
00:29:32.731 --> 00:29:34.350
positive you become.
No kidding.

520
00:29:34.351 --> 00:29:38.880
So the idea that nostalgic could actually be forward thinking can actually do

521
00:29:38.881 --> 00:29:40.770
something to an exposure to an astounding experience.

522
00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:43.510
There's an objective psychometric assessment.
There's also a subjective one.

523
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.290
Social connectedness scores go up,
you demonic wellbeing increases.

524
00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:50.980
That's that sense of fulfillment and greater frequency of positive memories.

525
00:29:50.981 --> 00:29:54.670
You're looking on the study side.
You have an optimum bias,
optimism bias towards,

526
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.130
uh,
uh,
recalled experience.
That's terrific.

527
00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:02.140
We also now know that most of the people that regularly dig into their nostalgia

528
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.330
that regularly dig into the things that were the leave it to beaver,

529
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.540
the Gerber baby,
whatever that is to your world,

530
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:11.020
certain perspectives change that you can also measure.
Number one,

531
00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.620
your death related anxiety decreases.

532
00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:16.600
<v 2>Okay?</v>

533
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.750
<v 1>The more nostalgic you become,
the less you are afraid of death.</v>

534
00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:24.560
Number two,
feelings of intimacy.

535
00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:28.730
Increase with the people that are around you,
your friends,
your family,

536
00:30:28.731 --> 00:30:32.150
and your friends,
feelings of feeling close to them do.
And number three,

537
00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.520
this is the most extraordinary of all your greater tolerance.

538
00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.870
You have a greater tolerance for outsiders.

539
00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.970
You get a greater tolerance for outsiders.

540
00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:47.240
The more you reflect on your own experience,

541
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:50.510
especially with when there are perceived social differences,

542
00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.850
which is the fracture that usually hits most of this country.

543
00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:55.310
So subjective behavioral assessments are strong.

544
00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.310
Death related anxiety decreases intimacy,

545
00:30:58.311 --> 00:31:00.200
increases feeling emotionally close to loved ones,

546
00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.820
and a greater tolerance of outsiders,

547
00:31:01.821 --> 00:31:04.100
especially ones with perceived social differences.

548
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:08.930
So it's a big old thing to say that there is a power of nostalgia.
It's one that,

549
00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.920
uh,
Ellen Langer could take in spades when she's designing her counterclockwise

550
00:31:12.921 --> 00:31:13.670
experiment.

551
00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:16.880
We also know that there are a neurophysiological changes that you can measure.

552
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.850
The more you have a,
um,
uh,

553
00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:23.030
a nostalgic experiences and more irregularly traffic in nostalgia.

554
00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:24.920
And the reason why that we know about this,

555
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:28.100
every time you have an astrologer experience,

556
00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.130
your brain gives you a little bit of dopamine and this is really good when

557
00:31:31.131 --> 00:31:34.550
you're 65 because you're,
your dopamine levels are naturally decreasing.

558
00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:35.750
That naturally happens.

559
00:31:35.751 --> 00:31:40.751
Gonna happen to everybody in this room unless you keep that kite blowing up,

560
00:31:40.791 --> 00:31:44.000
unless you keep it upward,
dopamine levels are going to continue to go down.

561
00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:47.810
You want as much dopamine as you can get.
Don't.
Amit is your reward center.

562
00:31:47.811 --> 00:31:49.850
When you feel good about something,
you're getting dopamine.

563
00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.100
When dopamine is also involved in motor control,

564
00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.700
kill off the substantia Nigra and other areas that are involved in a dope m

565
00:31:55.701 --> 00:31:57.890
energic responses and you'll get a Parkinson's disease.

566
00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.190
Parkinson's disease is the absence of a dope dope,
I mean smart,

567
00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.410
so it's involved in motor a motor control.

568
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:05.810
It's also involved in learning when you feel like you're learning better,

569
00:32:05.811 --> 00:32:08.720
so what you want is as much dopamine as you can get.

570
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:11.930
What happens when you become the static is it's your buddy gets warmer and the

571
00:32:11.931 --> 00:32:15.260
dope m energy system is stimulated in two specific areas.

572
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.420
This is a mid sagittal section through the brand.

573
00:32:17.421 --> 00:32:20.810
You cut it like it's a Bagel and we're going to see in green here it's only

574
00:32:20.811 --> 00:32:24.290
about eighty thousand ninety thousand neurons of the dope energic system was

575
00:32:24.291 --> 00:32:25.124
actually a pretty small,

576
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:29.450
but we're going to focus on two specific areas right here that whenever you get

577
00:32:29.451 --> 00:32:33.440
under style,
just spike these things light as if it were the 4th of July,

578
00:32:33.441 --> 00:32:35.420
so you get an exposure to an established,

579
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:39.860
you experience the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental areas light up as

580
00:32:39.861 --> 00:32:42.950
if it were the 4th of July,
and the more nostalgia you get,

581
00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.560
the more dopamine you pump into the system.

582
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:47.520
<v 2>Okay,</v>

583
00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.530
<v 1>so ms style,</v>

584
00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:53.240
Joe was the first great peer that Ellen Langer was using to design her counter

585
00:32:53.241 --> 00:32:55.050
clockwise.
Now to the next one,

586
00:32:55.770 --> 00:33:00.770
retrieval bias was the other great peer that she utilized in creating the con.

587
00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:05.400
The counterclockwise experiment put simply retrievable bias is that memory

588
00:33:05.401 --> 00:33:09.720
retrieval across your lifespan is uneven.
We call one a reminiscence bump.

589
00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.870
You retrieve events that occurred at some ages better than others.

590
00:33:12.871 --> 00:33:15.480
Do you know what your best age at retrieval is?

591
00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:23.650
Ages 24 to 30 if you're 80 years old and I measured the number of memories that

592
00:33:24.861 --> 00:33:26.630
you both get right and even the sequence of it,
right?

593
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:30.440
You Spike at that magic age at the place where the system appears to have been

594
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:32.570
optimized,
it's less than your thirties and forties.

595
00:33:32.571 --> 00:33:34.500
You need a little spike what's coming up.
Um,

596
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:36.950
most of you will age out of culture before you age out of brain,

597
00:33:36.951 --> 00:33:39.230
but give you an idea of how that can actually work with,

598
00:33:39.231 --> 00:33:42.860
I'll show you the graph in a second.
How many of you remember that phone numbers

599
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:47.170
use to have alphabets associate?
In fact,

600
00:33:47.171 --> 00:33:49.820
they were the Alpha numeric proposition for a long time.
You remember that?

601
00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:53.450
You might remember the census.
We're keeping music as our theme here.

602
00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:57.520
There were some phone numbers that were given as pop songs that were actually

603
00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:01.670
the name of the pop sockets self and showing that you can age out of culture

604
00:34:01.671 --> 00:34:03.500
before you age out of Britain.
You might still remember these.

605
00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.050
Anybody remember this?
Pennsylvania six,

606
00:34:06.051 --> 00:34:09.800
5,000 some of you are already humming it along like three of you.

607
00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:13.640
That was something.
Glenn Miller Orchestra.
The 1940s how about this one?

608
00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:17.870
Beachwood four five seven,
eight nine.

609
00:34:17.871 --> 00:34:20.330
Does anybody remember beach with four five,
seven,
eight,
nine.

610
00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:23.720
There is one person who has raised their hand besides me and here.
Okay.

611
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.190
That's the Marvelettes in 1962 but here is an ear worm that I'll bet some of you

612
00:34:28.191 --> 00:34:32.510
have because her name is Jenny.
What phone number am I describing it?

613
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:35.640
I just heard it at six dammit.

614
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.840
Five three Oh nine you met Tommy to tone.

615
00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:44.060
You have a bias for retrieval at a specific age.

616
00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:47.780
The reminiscence bump on average,
it's been measured with six different inputs.

617
00:34:47.781 --> 00:34:49.790
I'll show you.
I'll show you.
One of them will do the music one,

618
00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:53.060
but the reminiscence effect after age 80 this has been measured with 80 year

619
00:34:53.061 --> 00:34:54.800
olds.
So what you're going to see here is this.

620
00:34:54.801 --> 00:34:57.950
This is the percentage of memories that you recall that are both accurate in

621
00:34:57.951 --> 00:35:01.770
terms of the content as well as the sequence.
So there's both an ordinal and a,

622
00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:05.990
a a content component of this chronic,
illogical age at time of encoding.

623
00:35:05.991 --> 00:35:08.690
It looks like that you pink right around here.
Look at that.

624
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:10.850
24 25 and it's bigger as your,

625
00:35:10.851 --> 00:35:12.860
there's your cognitive decline that's speeding to occur.

626
00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.720
So you can figure it as three.
The first hill is the reminiscence bump.

627
00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:19.310
That's what we call it.
The middle aged valley is right here.

628
00:35:19.311 --> 00:35:21.770
And then finally the Second Hill,
which are the recency effect.

629
00:35:21.771 --> 00:35:25.720
You can see they're five categories of memory,
have been tested six altogether.

630
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:29.570
And I'll show you one books,
political events,
films,
autobiographical events,

631
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.290
music.
In fact,
they were originally counts before it got a little more rigorous.

632
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.440
They would couch it with things like when re tell the name of a book that meant

633
00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:41.250
the most to you.
Now tell me when you read it,

634
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:46.830
tell me a film you saw that meant the most to you.
Tell me when you saw it.

635
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:52.170
Tell me the music that meant the most to you and tell me when you heard it and

636
00:35:52.171 --> 00:35:55.020
so on and so forth.
So you'll see these things,
books,
political events,
films,

637
00:35:55.021 --> 00:35:56.610
autobiographical memories and music.

638
00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:58.680
Let's do just do the music cause we're staying with that theme.

639
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:01.890
When did you encounter the best popular music you ever listened to?

640
00:36:01.891 --> 00:36:06.390
And the answer is right there through the ages of 15 to 25 in fact,

641
00:36:06.391 --> 00:36:09.900
after about 25 or so,
you no longer think music is any good.
You know,

642
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:12.000
it's all good way back when,
and there's a great quote,

643
00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.820
what people regard as the music of my generation.

644
00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.580
This is actually from a peer of your literature because it around it and then a

645
00:36:17.581 --> 00:36:21.210
book begins at around the time they're 14 or 15 then ends in their late twenties

646
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:23.340
a graph of the preferences can be summarized very simply.

647
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:27.480
Pop Music was at its best when I was around 20 and went and went downhill

648
00:36:27.481 --> 00:36:30.720
rapidly from then on.
Okay?

649
00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:36.260
That is retrieval by us and retrieval bias was selling because not only do you

650
00:36:36.391 --> 00:36:39.570
remember it better,
you apparently also prefer it better,

651
00:36:39.571 --> 00:36:42.060
which tells me there's going to be a dopamine tag of some kind.

652
00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:45.240
So what's going to happen is that right around the age when you are at your

653
00:36:45.241 --> 00:36:47.910
cognitive maximum,
the best books you've ever read,

654
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.300
the best music you've ever heard,
the best political speeches,

655
00:36:51.301 --> 00:36:54.210
we didn't talk about political,
a ideologies and inputs to it,

656
00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:57.360
but the best films that you ever saw and certainly your life events.

657
00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.430
And here's the Biggie here.
Not only do you remember them,

658
00:36:59.431 --> 00:37:01.980
you seem to prefer that.
And with that in mind,

659
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.760
I can talk to you about Ellen Langer's powerful counterclockwise experiment.

660
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.850
Here she is,
and here's a reference.

661
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:16.950
It's written up the New York Times a couple years ago,
what it is.

662
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:22.520
She took a bunch of old men in their seventies and eighties some of them were

663
00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:28.080
not very ambulatory and she knew the power of reminiscence and she knew the

664
00:37:28.081 --> 00:37:32.610
power of retrieval bias.
She rented out a monastery,
a little west of Cambridge,

665
00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:38.070
and fitted out the monastery with postdocs and graduate students and turned the

666
00:37:38.071 --> 00:37:41.850
monastery into 1959

667
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:48.270
closed circuit TV.
President Eisenhower is busy on there.
Yeah,

668
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.500
you want to watch a football game?

669
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:54.390
It's going to be Johnny Unitas and the Frickin Baltimore Colts and the

670
00:37:54.391 --> 00:37:57.330
Minneapolis Lakers and food.

671
00:37:57.331 --> 00:38:00.930
That was going to be reminiscence of what w what you could see in 1959 they

672
00:38:00.931 --> 00:38:04.080
weren't allowed to bring any pictures except if it was them in their

673
00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:07.500
reminiscence bump in there.
24 hours and 25 and 30 years old.

674
00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.780
No mirrors were allowed and the staff,

675
00:38:09.781 --> 00:38:11.970
there were certainly physicians on staff to watch this,

676
00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:16.980
but the staff would not let them act like they were 80 if they have problems

677
00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:21.270
bringing up their suitcase up the stairs because there was no elevator tough.

678
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.720
You open up the suitcase in the lobby and you brought up the the shirt one at a

679
00:38:24.721 --> 00:38:29.721
time because for the next week it's going to be 1959

680
00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:36.220
and what happened was amazing because of course you did the bass lines.

681
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:37.450
She's just going to get it all the,

682
00:38:37.451 --> 00:38:40.540
all the motor skills and all the cognitive skills and somatic skills of what was

683
00:38:40.541 --> 00:38:42.100
happening and then watch.

684
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:46.990
And the only thing I can tell you is I'm going to use the word magic occurred or

685
00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:51.220
if you've seen the movie cocoon of the cocoon occurred because things began to

686
00:38:51.221 --> 00:38:55.300
change.
She noticed almost immediately that they were becoming more ambulatory.

687
00:38:55.301 --> 00:38:57.100
There were walking more,
they were laughing more.

688
00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:00.640
They're seem to be more cool things that were occurring to them as in their

689
00:39:00.641 --> 00:39:05.110
interactions per se.
She began to notice something that was really strange there.

690
00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:07.750
Um,
fingers,
we're lengthening,

691
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:13.840
their fingers were lengthening,
their eyesight was changing,

692
00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.620
their hearing was changing.
In fact,
if you measure all these,

693
00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:21.090
the somatic means hearing sensitivity as best at threshold intensities of the

694
00:39:21.091 --> 00:39:24.910
thousand and 6,000 hertz was just better vision near point.
Vision improved,

695
00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:28.390
especially in the right I oddly enough manual dexterity because they were now

696
00:39:28.391 --> 00:39:30.580
moving more.
It seemed like we were interacting,

697
00:39:30.581 --> 00:39:34.480
at least they were back in 1959 so their bodies thought they were back in 1959

698
00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.510
we're beginning to stretch.
Whole body dexterity improved too.
In fact,

699
00:39:37.511 --> 00:39:41.920
one subject threw away his cane at the very end she gives another cognitive

700
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.820
testifies if there's a 37% increase in what's called the digital civil asset,

701
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.020
which is a powerful cognitive gadget that can actually measure both memory and

702
00:39:50.021 --> 00:39:51.790
processing speed.
You guys,

703
00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:56.650
they changed because she took the reminiscence at the reminiscence bump.

704
00:39:56.651 --> 00:39:59.800
So pre post measures after a monastery experience hearing sensitivity improves

705
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.170
near point vision improves manual dexterity,

706
00:40:02.171 --> 00:40:06.190
improves whole body dexterity scores improved one subject throughway his cane

707
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.430
and in the New York Times this was mentioned.
Oh yeah,

708
00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.740
the cod cognition and memory and processing speed improved as measured by the

709
00:40:11.741 --> 00:40:14.640
digital symbol assay.
Um,

710
00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:19.090
Bruce Grierson eventually wrote about this in the New York Times article and

711
00:40:19.091 --> 00:40:23.590
here's what he said though,
she and her students would write up the experiment.

712
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.230
They left out a lot of the tantalizing color,

713
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:30.180
like the spontaneous touch football game that erupted between here to fort

714
00:40:30.181 --> 00:40:33.880
creaky seniors as they waited for the bus back to Cambridge

715
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:40.810
just by flooding their heads with dopamine on a sustained level with a continual

716
00:40:40.811 --> 00:40:44.650
spike towards a retrieval bias.
You've got to change in brain.

717
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:50.110
You got to change in body and now this New York Times headline can make more

718
00:40:50.111 --> 00:40:55.111
sense because what they did was a repetition of the counterclockwise experiment.

719
00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:59.160
Professionals created an east German living area according environments and

720
00:40:59.161 --> 00:41:03.460
Dresden for the mid 1960s after the wall fell,
and what they did is it,

721
00:41:03.461 --> 00:41:07.360
the food was and Gary and salad of the 1960s which was sausage and bell peppers

722
00:41:07.361 --> 00:41:09.640
and tomatoes,
the kitchen that the dishes were watching,

723
00:41:09.641 --> 00:41:12.580
the original 1960s East German middle sink,
salt and pepper vent,

724
00:41:12.581 --> 00:41:16.420
vintage plastic east German shakers from an old cal follow supermarket laundry

725
00:41:16.421 --> 00:41:19.690
clothes were washed with old East Germans Bay and follow laundry detergents.

726
00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:21.790
This is going to be smell.
Okay,

727
00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:24.010
so we're going to get an all factory spike that's coming.

728
00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:26.540
Clothes were ironed with mid 20th century pressing ironed,

729
00:41:26.541 --> 00:41:28.450
so you're going to get the feel of what it was,

730
00:41:28.451 --> 00:41:31.450
what it would be to be like if that detergent were soaked into the cloth and

731
00:41:31.451 --> 00:41:34.400
then you iron it out and then finally you've got your magazines and you've got

732
00:41:34.401 --> 00:41:37.370
your music.
You had all kinds of things.
All of a sudden,

733
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.550
I have another piece of advice for you.
I told you there were two.

734
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:44.420
Here's my second.
The second piece of advice would be this.

735
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:49.370
It's another set harness.
The power of nostalgia.
Step number one,

736
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:51.170
this is for your loved ones.

737
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:56.810
Designate a living area as a nostalgia room for your loved one's brain.
Mom,

738
00:41:56.811 --> 00:42:00.140
dad,
Grandpa,
uncle,
loved beloved mentor.

739
00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:05.090
Step number to calculate your loved ones,
reminiscence,
bump years.

740
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:06.410
And step number three,

741
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:11.010
fill the nostalgia room with objects and experiences from the calculated and

742
00:42:11.011 --> 00:42:13.910
spoke years.
Make sure it is multisensory.
The better you can get it,

743
00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.190
the more multisensory you can make it,
the better.

744
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:20.750
And for you in the 24 to 30 30 year old,
I have another piece of advice.

745
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.940
Start collecting objects,

746
00:42:22.941 --> 00:42:26.030
Tokens and experiences from your own reminiscence bump years.

747
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:29.540
Put them in storage to get ready to make your own freaking room

748
00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:35.810
if you want to change in memory and finger length and executive function and all

749
00:42:35.811 --> 00:42:40.250
the things that come by are routine re [inaudible] of your brain to a dope.

750
00:42:40.251 --> 00:42:42.480
Emma needs a dopamine metabolism.

751
00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:46.070
I am my own reminiscence bump and I'll close with this and want to take some

752
00:42:46.071 --> 00:42:50.510
questions.
Um,
how many read?
Anybody remember this guy?
You know who that is?

753
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:54.020
Yeah,
I just heard it.
Who is it?
Art Linkletter.

754
00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:57.980
For those of you who don't know who art Linkletter is,
he uh,
was in 1912,
2010.

755
00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:00.470
I remember seeing this heat for those who don't know,

756
00:43:00.471 --> 00:43:05.090
he had a variety show in the early sixties with uh,
uh,
the last 10 minutes.

757
00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.360
If I swear you guys,
if it had been done now you,

758
00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:11.990
that would be probably a third most traffic youtube channel.

759
00:43:11.991 --> 00:43:16.510
That would be because he had kids say the darndest thing last 10,
10 segment,

760
00:43:16.511 --> 00:43:17.780
this 10 minute segments he put,

761
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:21.080
I'll put the kids on the stool and then he would go around and ask them

762
00:43:21.081 --> 00:43:24.680
interesting questions and remember this is live television and I will never

763
00:43:24.681 --> 00:43:28.430
forget this as long as I live because I actually saw this and asked my mom about

764
00:43:28.431 --> 00:43:31.310
it.
Uh,
I can't show it to you cause it doesn't exist,
but there is a,

765
00:43:31.311 --> 00:43:35.740
there is this about it.
Okay.
Remember this is live television.
Uh,

766
00:43:35.741 --> 00:43:39.920
last 10 minute segment art asked a boy his favorite question,
Tami,

767
00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:41.210
what would make you happy?

768
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:45.560
The boy replied a bed of my own that would make me happy,

769
00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:49.880
aren't asked him,
concerned,
don't chew,
sleep in a bed.

770
00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:54.410
The boy replied.
I usually sleep with my mommy and my daddy,

771
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:58.010
but when my daddy has gone,
mommy sleeps with Uncle Bob

772
00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:03.550
and I have to sleep on the couch.
And anyway,
he's not really my uncle and go,

773
00:44:03.551 --> 00:44:04.384
I got to cover herself.

774
00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:12.170
It's funny when you look back at life,
I've never been 61 before.

775
00:44:12.171 --> 00:44:14.030
I'm going to be 62 but about two months.

776
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:18.590
But what are the great joys in writing this book is that there was a tremendous

777
00:44:18.591 --> 00:44:21.890
amount of hope and powerful things that you can do practically at any age.

778
00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:26.900
If you want to be enjoying art Linkletter way into your hundred and 15,
122.

779
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:28.180
Uh,
it's probably the,

780
00:44:28.181 --> 00:44:32.010
one of the biggest reasons I wrote the book was to show that even if you're 24

781
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.480
or 30,
or 62 or 80,
there's a heck of a lot of things you can do out there.

782
00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:39.133
<v 2>Thank you very much.</v>

783
00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.700
<v 0>I was actually curious,
um,
rather than having a room,</v>

784
00:44:44.701 --> 00:44:49.701
if one of those people were ironing their shorts with the super old irony,

785
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:53.270
et Cetera,
et Cetera,
um,
just on a daily basis,
just one object rather than,

786
00:44:53.271 --> 00:44:55.700
than a room,
would it still work or does it have to be emerging?

787
00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:59.290
<v 1>Well,
if you want,
I don't know.
That's a good question to ask.</v>

788
00:44:59.291 --> 00:45:01.510
I don't know how you can titrate that.
Uh,
but you could,

789
00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:02.710
you could put it this way,

790
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:07.030
that if it is true that this is working because you're continually asking Dopa

791
00:45:07.031 --> 00:45:08.590
mean to being re squirted into the environment.

792
00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:12.040
And when you were aging that dopamine levels are always already going,

793
00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:16.780
always going down.
The more you can,
it's like puffs of air onto a cake.

794
00:45:16.781 --> 00:45:18.760
The more you can keep that tight up into the air,

795
00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:22.660
probably the higher it's gonna fly.
And if you don't regularly sustain it,

796
00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:26.080
the dope and manager system is no friend to you.
It's actually going down still.

797
00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:27.520
So it's like you have to keep it up,

798
00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:31.240
which is why I asked it to be perhaps a room that you can regularly visit.

799
00:45:31.241 --> 00:45:32.890
And because you're smart,
you're going to get bored.

800
00:45:32.891 --> 00:45:35.890
So swap it out and change things and what not,
but keep it there.

801
00:45:35.891 --> 00:45:38.220
So the dopamine spike can be regular and sustained it.

802
00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:40.953
<v 2>Yes,
sir.</v>

803
00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:43.150
<v 3>Hi,
great talk.
Um,</v>

804
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.920
just one comment and then one question about the reminiscence bump.
Uh,

805
00:45:46.921 --> 00:45:50.430
the comment is there's a great movie called Goodbye Lennon from West Germany

806
00:45:50.431 --> 00:45:54.480
about a family trying to basically do that East German experiment with their

807
00:45:54.481 --> 00:45:57.870
mother.
Um,
check it out.
But then the question is,

808
00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:01.800
especially you said at the start that people tend,
I used to dye a lot earlier.

809
00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:05.820
Yes.
So from an evolutionary genetic point of view,

810
00:46:05.821 --> 00:46:08.970
what is the genetic advantage of the reminiscence bump?

811
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:11.410
If you're going to be dead by the time you're 30 anyway.

812
00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:13.750
<v 1>All right.
Do you think the Webinar was Bob started factual?</v>

813
00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:19.060
All it's showing is that the system is really aligned and pumping at ages 24 to

814
00:46:19.061 --> 00:46:22.240
30,
but that there's no distinct advantage to having it at all.

815
00:46:22.241 --> 00:46:24.640
It's just that that is a,
I would think of it as a shadow,

816
00:46:24.641 --> 00:46:28.150
as an echo of something we used to have because after 30 gets genetic free fall,

817
00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:31.540
there's no selective pressure or better to say it's now random.

818
00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:35.320
And for those of you who have really good cardiovascular grandparents,

819
00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:39.650
now we'll also have cardiovascular,
a good cardiovascular health for you.
Oh,

820
00:46:39.651 --> 00:46:41.230
that's just totally genetic and random.

821
00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:42.643
<v 2>Thank you.</v>

822
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:50.530
<v 4>Thank you.
I had a question regarding the 24 year old peak that you mentioned.</v>

823
00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:54.880
A couple of,
uh,
two,
two parts of the question.
One,
the first part is,
um,

824
00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:58.150
when is the derivative,
the maximum.
Um,

825
00:46:58.151 --> 00:47:01.540
so do you have a flat plateau for a while,
uh,
and then really start to fall off.

826
00:47:01.541 --> 00:47:06.310
And then the second part of that question is for let's say a certain category of

827
00:47:06.311 --> 00:47:09.490
folks,
maybe the hobby capable sort of according to the kids' definition.

828
00:47:09.491 --> 00:47:11.970
Is there a different peak potentially?
Is Qp for them?

829
00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:16.330
<v 1>Yes,
that's very good question.
Uh,
the flat is probably around 25,
26 years of age.</v>

830
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:20.860
The peak
for highly capable kids.

831
00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:24.940
That is a tough one because it was not segregated for this work that I'm aware.

832
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:30.390
But I do know that there is an extraordinary piece of data that might hit edit

833
00:47:31.871 --> 00:47:36.280
eventually,
but we'd have to go to an Alzheimer's.
Let's do it.
The,
uh,
um,
uh,

834
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:41.590
if the more highly educated you are,
the less likely you are to get Alzheimer's.

835
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.520
But when you do get Alzheimer's,
the higher educated you are,

836
00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:48.730
the faster your collapses,
you'll go.
Like in two years,

837
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:52.420
three years as opposed to the normal 7.8 with dribbles out.

838
00:47:52.421 --> 00:47:55.180
So that's about as close to,
it's tangential.
That's about as close as I can get.

839
00:47:55.181 --> 00:47:56.390
But a great question.
Yeah.

840
00:47:56.910 --> 00:48:00.520
<v 5>So I guess this is a followup question to the all counterclockwise experiment</v>

841
00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:01.970
people were put back into their old beard.

842
00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.640
Has there been any follow up experiments on people of like religious orders

843
00:48:05.641 --> 00:48:07.980
where they maintain the same environment for many,

844
00:48:07.981 --> 00:48:12.060
many years of their life and how they affect aging compared to other more?

845
00:48:12.061 --> 00:48:14.070
Number one was more normal members of society.

846
00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:15.751
<v 1>There is,</v>

847
00:48:15.751 --> 00:48:18.230
it's nothing that would make it into a peer review that I would respectively

848
00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:19.740
because you can't randomize the population.

849
00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:22.620
So they're all going to be in one spot and they all have maybe have a particular

850
00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:24.960
view towards their experience.

851
00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:28.560
You can't say this though because they're kept well track of,

852
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:33.270
are you guys familiar with the Wisconsin or Minnesota Alzheimer's?

853
00:48:33.271 --> 00:48:35.640
None experiment.
Do you know about this?
And if you heard this before,

854
00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:39.810
this is will.
Again,
it's tangential because the answer is we don't know the uh,

855
00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.820
but here it is.
What they have found,

856
00:48:41.821 --> 00:48:43.770
and this is really gives a confounder to Alzheimer's.

857
00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:48.450
A group whole convent in Minnesota decided to donate their brains to science

858
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:51.720
because they're dying off.
There's going to be anyone else coming in.

859
00:48:51.721 --> 00:48:54.630
And as soon as they were all dying off would donate their brains to science,

860
00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:56.920
to the University of Minnesota where they would do brain slices,

861
00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:00.000
pop up in the cranial vault and take a look and see because they were interested

862
00:49:00.001 --> 00:49:03.900
in Alzheimer's.
And even in that close community where it is not randomized,

863
00:49:03.901 --> 00:49:08.460
that's for sure.
And that's a,
that's a confounder here.
Um,
Alzheimer's disease,

864
00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:13.640
there was a woman named Marie Marie was 94 years old when she died and she was

865
00:49:14.821 --> 00:49:16.770
teaching as a teaching order,
so it'd been addictive.

866
00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:19.470
So she was teaching it all the time.
It had lots of students and whatnot.

867
00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:24.180
When you cracked open her brain,
when she was dead and look at it,

868
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:29.610
it looked like someone had taken a 12 gauge shotgun and blew it away.

869
00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:30.490
It was finished.

870
00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:33.000
It had lots of those amyloid plaques familiar with amyloid plaques,

871
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:36.130
neurofibrillary deposits,
things that are all Alzheimer's like get,

872
00:49:36.131 --> 00:49:39.270
she showed no signs of Alzheimer's at all.
There is another woman,

873
00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:43.230
other women who had died who had what I call screaming at the walls,

874
00:49:43.231 --> 00:49:47.070
Alzheimer's in the tertiary,
uh,
portions of this and they are truly catastrophic,

875
00:49:47.071 --> 00:49:50.310
really sick and I have a full on dementia and the memory,

876
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:53.400
it's a normal 7.8 years.
When you open up their brains,

877
00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:58.170
it looks like your brain or my brain without Alzheimer's wasn't fenestrated.

878
00:49:58.171 --> 00:50:00.700
There were no fibrillary ta,
tangles,
there was no whatever.

879
00:50:00.701 --> 00:50:04.890
So the only the closed in populations for things like a religious order you can

880
00:50:04.891 --> 00:50:09.210
get some data from,
but that's as close as it gets.
Otherwise.
Yeah.
Thank you.

881
00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:15.260
Regarding the social relationships to terms social media pets,

882
00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:19.290
I do know pets for certain amounts of loneliness,
that's for sure.

883
00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:21.780
Pets are very powerful and can work really,

884
00:50:21.781 --> 00:50:24.090
really well and people transfer all kinds of things to them and so,

885
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:28.070
or there's even a pet therapy that can be utilized to a gate.

886
00:50:28.071 --> 00:50:31.520
It's not as good as a human interaction because even though pets are adaptive

887
00:50:31.521 --> 00:50:32.780
and there's lots of cool things you can do,

888
00:50:32.781 --> 00:50:34.430
you can get more interactions with petsmart.

889
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:40.150
Social media has been tested and by God if it doesn't work,

890
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:45.260
it's not as good as a full flush on blood.

891
00:50:45.261 --> 00:50:46.880
You're not going to get the pressure differential that you know,

892
00:50:46.881 --> 00:50:50.450
the brain is so good at to get even detect a micro changes in air pressure and

893
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:51.650
all that other stuff.

894
00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:55.610
But it has been tested and it will actually rescue certain types of loneliness.

895
00:50:55.611 --> 00:50:59.240
So if they're shut in and there's nothing else that can be done,
by Golly,

896
00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:02.990
social media is a friend and it has been tested.
Great question.
Yes sir.

897
00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:06.650
<v 6>My mom was a extremely passionate about her work her entire career.</v>

898
00:51:06.651 --> 00:51:11.310
She is about to retire but doesn't have any hobbies.
Is there anything,
uh,

899
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:15.140
that you didn't get a chance to put in the book in regards to retirement?
Uh,

900
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:17.140
two things to look out for.

901
00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:17.961
<v 1>Well,</v>

902
00:51:17.961 --> 00:51:20.450
let's see if we can address that one specifically because if she doesn't have

903
00:51:20.451 --> 00:51:21.284
any hobbies,

904
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:25.790
then she has to do a full on search for the next six months to get one.
Okay.

905
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.980
In fact,
it gets several,
but I will,

906
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:31.520
I will counsel this if I don't know them at all.
But statistically,

907
00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:32.930
this will be the work of Marty Seligman.

908
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:38.650
One of the best things you can do when you retire is to get out of yourself

909
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:41.600
enough to begin volunteering on a regular basis.

910
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:47.540
The more you volunteer making that part of that a hobby,
you know,
when you read,

911
00:51:47.541 --> 00:51:50.450
if you read through that book,
you'll,
you'll notice a constant theme.

912
00:51:50.451 --> 00:51:53.120
And the constant theme is continually getting out of yourself for the benefit of

913
00:51:53.121 --> 00:51:56.060
your brand.
The more you can exercise your brain,
the better it is.
In fact,

914
00:51:56.061 --> 00:51:58.370
one of the best things that can be done that she can start doing now,

915
00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:02.870
and you can too.
This is from Marty Seligman's,
uh,
uh,
great work.
It's,

916
00:52:02.871 --> 00:52:05.630
they're called letters of gratitude.
Here's what you do.

917
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:10.100
You'll find somebody that was a mentor to you that meant a great deal to you and

918
00:52:10.101 --> 00:52:14.780
for your mom.
Just draw a list of all the people that meant something to,

919
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:18.800
and you know what you're gonna do.
You're gonna write them a 300 word letter.

920
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:23.330
That's what you're gonna do.
And then if they're in town or even in the area,

921
00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:27.770
you're going to take that letter and you're going to sit there and read it to

922
00:52:27.771 --> 00:52:31.360
them
and try not to cry.

923
00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:38.110
What you will find and what Marty found was that the more you got out of

924
00:52:38.111 --> 00:52:41.570
yourself and your own experiences and started going back into it,

925
00:52:41.571 --> 00:52:44.340
here's the nostalgia bump.
Am I talking about nostalgia?
But here,
startup,

926
00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:48.760
you better.
I am.
When you start getting out of yourself and into other people,

927
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:51.850
you begin to change rates of anxiety and depressive disorders.

928
00:52:51.851 --> 00:52:55.870
And since at great risk you are when you retire for anxiety and depressive

929
00:52:55.871 --> 00:52:57.520
disorders and you get that up and running.

930
00:52:57.790 --> 00:53:01.090
One of the first things you can do would be what I would call the alternate name

931
00:53:01.091 --> 00:53:02.590
for this book.
You don't have the alternate name.

932
00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:05.050
For my book should be quit being so self centered.

933
00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:08.430
Do we know

934
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:10.080
<v 6>what effect,
if any,</v>

935
00:53:10.081 --> 00:53:15.081
there is on the nostalgia bump and and how bumpy it is now that in say the past

936
00:53:16.111 --> 00:53:20.640
15 years,
we have so many more recordings,
pictures,
videos,
Facebook telling you,

937
00:53:20.641 --> 00:53:23.490
here's the thing you posted five years ago.
Do you want to post it again?

938
00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:25.500
That sort of stuff.
Yeah,
good question.
Don't know.

939
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:26.521
<v 1>Absolutely.</v>

940
00:53:26.521 --> 00:53:29.700
It's possible that that could get fussed or it's possible that you will begin

941
00:53:29.701 --> 00:53:34.560
reinserting more fake memories because you have more access points to begin

942
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:36.210
because you,
with retrieval bias,

943
00:53:36.211 --> 00:53:39.690
there's also optimism bias as we discussed and you begin remembering more of the

944
00:53:39.691 --> 00:53:42.180
good stuff and so they're more access points to that.
Other than that,

945
00:53:42.181 --> 00:53:42.570
we're not sure.
