1
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.180
Today,
we have Dan Andrews who is trying to find water on the moon.

2
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.100
He's the project manager of the resource prospector program at NASA ames.

3
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.930
Without further ado,
here's Dan

4
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.890
<v 1>[inaudible] for it to</v>

5
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.870
<v 0>be here.
I've been looking forward to this talk for some time.
Um,</v>

6
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.700
a little quick note,
uh,

7
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.320
I was just at a conference in the UK and there was a whole bunch of discussions

8
00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:35.210
about,
uh,
data analytics associated with Cubesat missions and,

9
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.940
and just in general.
And one of the,
um,

10
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.070
companies that was there was talking about the ability to judge how an economy

11
00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:48.071
is doing based on the relative fill of a parking lot in an area or parking lots.

12
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.720
Uh,
you guys are doing just fine here.
It's tough to find parking.
All right,

13
00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:56.390
so I'm here as a married indicated,
uh,

14
00:00:56.391 --> 00:00:58.400
to tell you about the resource prospector mission.

15
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.280
It's a follow on mission to l cross,
uh,

16
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.040
which is a mission that it did indeed definitively.
Um,

17
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.780
note that there's water on the polar regions of the moon.

18
00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:12.980
And I'll tell you a little bit about that,
a little bit about the whole Isr.

19
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.800
You Institute Resource Utilization Topic.
And then I'd like to,
uh,

20
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.010
focus probably about half the presentation on our status as a mission and some

21
00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:26.240
of the cool development work that we're doing.
So,
first of all,
uh,

22
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.450
with respect to linear volatiles,
this has been a topic,
uh,

23
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.990
that has existed for a few decades,

24
00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:37.850
but I'm featuring some of the notable missions that really helped to steer where

25
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:41.030
we are today.
The clementine mission,
which was not a mission,

26
00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:44.600
trying to look for volatiles on the moon,
it actually had other,
uh,

27
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.840
multiple purposes,
but by static,
great.

28
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.960
Our testing of the polar regions of the mood indicated that,
wow,
there's,

29
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.610
there's some real high hydrogen concentrations in these polar regions.
Um,

30
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:56.690
and it was,

31
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.620
I think where some of the first thought went into could that actually be water?

32
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:03.800
Not that can't be water.
It's bone dry up there.
There's no way that can be water.

33
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.340
Lunar prospector,
which came around about four years later,
uh,

34
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.810
actually confirmed and measured the hydrogen levels.
But again,

35
00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:16.700
the question persisted.
Is it elemental hydrogen is a hydrogen bound in the soil,

36
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:20.630
or is it hydrogen bound in water?
Uh,
you couldn't quite tell.

37
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.430
So what was needed was a mission like oh cross and we are co manifested with the

38
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:26.560
uh,
uh,

39
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.160
lunar reconnaissance orbiter mission that actually went in,
uh,

40
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.900
landed with vigor as we'd like to say,
uh,

41
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.500
with an impact or that went into a polar region.

42
00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:39.170
Crater kicked up the soil that was there,

43
00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:42.230
whatever's there was kicking it up into the sunlight and we had a shepherd in

44
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:47.231
spacecraft following behind it and measure what was in the soil.

45
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.580
And we were able to confirm,
uh,
quite a bit of water.
Ice.
Now on earth scale,

46
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:56.300
it's not quite a bit of water ice,
it's maybe of the scale of the Mojave desert,

47
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.580
lots of water.
However,
on a scale of both poles,

48
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:04.750
all the craters and all this truly trillions and trillions of gallons of water

49
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:08.470
potentially,
they're so great.
We answered the big question,

50
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:13.471
but so what the next step is to actually understand it on more human scales.

51
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.610
And that's where resource prospector comes in on the scale of maybe meters as

52
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:22.420
opposed to kilometers.
What's the nature of the soil,
uh,
of,

53
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.020
of the volatiles in the soil?
Is it ice and blocky form?

54
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.290
Is it instead fine like sand in there?
Is it,

55
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.730
is it higher concentrations here,
but lower concentrations there.

56
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:35.650
What about the role of the son plays?

57
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.830
So emission to go in there and actually understand the nature of the volatiles

58
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:43.000
is essential in the obvious next step.

59
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.690
So on the evolvable a Mars campaign,

60
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.170
and you could see a resource prospector right here,

61
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:52.480
the idea is that the big goal is Mars.

62
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.320
The big goal is to get boots on the ground in Mars.
However,

63
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:59.950
that's a very tough task and there's much that we could learn along the way.

64
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:02.550
And using the moon to our advantage,
um,

65
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.620
wound to our advantage can mean on a human scale,
uh,

66
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:09.610
what it's like to live and operate in a,
in a certain environment,

67
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:12.520
although the moon looks very different than,
than Mars.
Uh,

68
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.620
but it also can mean from a resource point of view,

69
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:18.550
which is really where my interest lies and where resource prospector comes in.

70
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.740
So I'm going to show you a mission,
a animation.
Um,

71
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.830
our original design is to go on say a [inaudible] and ELV say a Falcon nine

72
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:34.920
style to rocket.
This is us taking off from the Cape.
Um,

73
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.670
as an illustration Ferrin pops off for now on our way to the moon.

74
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.890
That's why he could see the lander and the rover there.

75
00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:43.270
We just separated from the rocket.

76
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.490
We have a solid rocket motor on the bottom of the,
uh,
of the lander,

77
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:50.740
which is firing right here,
just finished.

78
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:53.950
And the whole point of that was to be captured by the moon,

79
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:58.930
right to not fly right by it.
So we use that to head in our,
uh,

80
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.610
critical descent trajectory.

81
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.030
I think at this point you're going to see the solid rocket motor kickoff.

82
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.060
We're done with that and now we start to reorient ourselves for the descent.

83
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.440
One thing of note here,

84
00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:16.441
this looks probably like no other lander that you've seen before and that's one

85
00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:19.990
of the key thrust of this mission that I'll get into in a little bit.

86
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:22.120
And that is we're trying to be very simple,

87
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.930
very risk tolerant and very cost effective.
Uh,

88
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.160
that's what El Cross was across the row,

89
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.900
rewrote the books on the moon for 79 million bucks.
Uh,

90
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.830
which on an Essa scales incredibly cheap for how important that mission was.

91
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.460
We're trying to extend some of that to a much bigger mission like resource

92
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:43.540
prospector.
So we go in,
we trim out our descent,

93
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.320
we get down to a slow fall rate and you can see here rover's ready to go.

94
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.640
The lander actually has two different ways that you can regress cause we don't

95
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:57.980
know that we might land partially on a rock,
um,

96
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.050
in some sort of obstacle away.

97
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:02.300
So we want to be able to double our chances to get off.

98
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.610
Now this is the resource prospector,
a surface segment we call it.

99
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:11.180
That means it's the rover and the payload system together because it can move in

100
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:12.650
all directions.
It can crab walk.

101
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.220
We immediately get on the sun to be power positive and then we can move in any

102
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:17.960
direction.
Of course at that point.

103
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.730
One of the big benefits of having the steering system that we have in this

104
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.370
arrangement,
which you're looking at here,

105
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:29.970
is an illustration of the neutron spectrometer system actually able to look
down,

106
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.850
say a meter through the soil without digging and actually look for indications

107
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:35.684
of hydrogen,

108
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.990
which would tell us where we might want to drop the drill and actually ground

109
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:45.950
truth that what that means is we're actually going into a permanently shadowed

110
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:50.951
region and by definition permanently shadowed it in it's two or three or 4

111
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.840
billion year existence,
has never seen the sun.

112
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.740
So the way you picture that is say if my head was the sun and this is the moon

113
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.050
as the moon's moving around the earth,
around the sun,

114
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.310
The sun light is all tangential to the polar regions.

115
00:07:07.311 --> 00:07:10.520
So it actually shoots right over the top of some of these craters that are on

116
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:15.050
the polar regions that are very susceptible to be able to trap the water ice.

117
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.700
So we got to go down any of these areas that are actually maybe 50,
60,

118
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:24.350
70 degrees Kelvin,
maybe colder than Pluto and somehow have our machinery work.

119
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.830
So there's quite a bit of challenging that we are doing of ourselves right now.

120
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:29.600
Um,

121
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.190
so questions RP wishes to answer resource extraction needs to be economical.

122
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.320
Uh,
NASA won't get into the business of trying to,
uh,

123
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.300
provide resources,
at least not in the longterm.

124
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.640
That's the job of the commercial industry to figure that out.

125
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.620
But we need to answer some fundamental questions upfront in order for the

126
00:07:48.621 --> 00:07:53.300
commercial world to be able to understand how tough for maybe easy this is going

127
00:07:53.301 --> 00:07:56.510
to be.
So resource extraction must be economical.

128
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.310
What are the distribution of those,
of all those vertically and horizontally?

129
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.830
Um,
what's the overburden story?

130
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.490
Let's say you can't get to this water ice that we know is there,

131
00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:09.620
but you have to drill down two meters to get it.

132
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.080
And it only exists in a permanently shadowed region,

133
00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:14.940
not in a semi permanently shadowed region.
Uh,

134
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.760
that's a very different engineering problem than if it's littered on the
surface.

135
00:08:19.761 --> 00:08:23.720
And you could just be scooping along the way and then putting it into a hopper

136
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:27.920
and baking it out.
These are questions we need to answer.
Um,

137
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:32.510
working environment.
All the same logic here,
son versus shadows,

138
00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:36.920
soil mechanics,
traffic ability.
Is it easy to navigate over it?

139
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.580
Would you have these mobile platforms that can go in there and actually scooped

140
00:08:40.581 --> 00:08:42.050
us up or is it more static?

141
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.570
So our job on our p is to take a look at four different areas.

142
00:08:47.571 --> 00:08:49.280
This is our goal.
Um,

143
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.760
illustrate in the top right you could see a with color coding,

144
00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:56.840
different types of environments in a given area,

145
00:08:56.841 --> 00:08:57.930
in one of the polar regions.

146
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.960
And then the bottom right a illustrates a zoom in of those dry areas,

147
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.370
we really believe in the dryer is that are out in the sun.

148
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.540
There's not going to be any water.

149
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:09.780
I there and there may not even be water ice in the soil because it would have

150
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:14.100
over all those billions of years baked out from all the radiation and energy

151
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:15.960
being dumped into the soil from the sun.

152
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.140
But we're not sure that we just think that makes sense.

153
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.040
So we want to go try that out surface and permanently shattered regions that may

154
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:24.420
be literally on the surface.

155
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:28.920
We already have seen indications of frost from other missions.
Uh,
you know,

156
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:32.130
light weather,
like weather conditions,
if you will.

157
00:09:32.131 --> 00:09:35.400
Even though this is an airless body,
a shallow,

158
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.140
I sit stable on the first centimeter first 50 centimeters versus 50 to a hundred

159
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.160
deeper.
All these things are,
uh,
uh,

160
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.430
answers that we wished to be able to get on this mission.
Our customer,

161
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.560
which is NASA headquarters in Washington DC,
um,

162
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.780
is it has really given us a really interesting framework.

163
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:56.520
Remember I told you we're a different kind of mission.

164
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.310
We're executing differently.
They gave us two requirements,

165
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:03.330
which I've synopsized here.
Okay.
They're pretty high level.

166
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.690
The whole goal is that they didn't want to give us incredibly stringent

167
00:10:06.691 --> 00:10:08.790
requirements at level one,
as we call it,

168
00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:13.791
because if you have any residual risk because you're trying to do things cost

169
00:10:13.891 --> 00:10:16.020
effectively,
you could be a failure.

170
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:20.310
So they want to guide with the level ones and allow us to derive more detailed

171
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:23.130
requirements from that and take chances,
take a risk.

172
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:28.140
And in doing so we can be single strong,
which is our term for no redundancy,

173
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.720
right?
Test the heck out of the system,

174
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.370
go fly it and maybe accomplished something great like I'll cross for much less

175
00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:38.160
money than would normally be required for a NASA mission.

176
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.680
So multiple paths to mission success,
uh,
call Rp,

177
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.180
lightweight risk tolerant,
cost-effective,
um,
mission.
Um,

178
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:52.050
I'm already finding that some of our early costs estimates are one third or

179
00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:52.890
maybe even less.

180
00:10:52.891 --> 00:10:57.891
The cost of a typical a NASA mission RP is not going to be a technical marvel.

181
00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.700
So it was really hard for the engineers of which I am one that it's not going to

182
00:11:02.701 --> 00:11:07.701
be this amazing achievement from a technical point of view where we're putting

183
00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:12.090
the amazing or the marvel part,
um,
is in what it could answer.

184
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.890
But how we go about doing it should be as proven as we can possibly get it.

185
00:11:16.891 --> 00:11:18.360
If we can get things off the shelf,

186
00:11:18.361 --> 00:11:20.970
if there's things that have been demonstrated on other missions,

187
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:26.220
let's use them and then go do something great with that.
Including,
um,

188
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.250
influencing NASA NASA's methodology going forward,

189
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.550
which is a personal goal of mine.
Uh,

190
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.110
we are of course going to go after the minimum success first,

191
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:38.230
then we'd go for the full access and then we have fun.
Um,
and uh,

192
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.460
that could take a lot of different forms when we answer some of those

193
00:11:41.461 --> 00:11:45.930
fundamental questions within one lunar day.
Do we,
when lunar night comes,

194
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.460
which may be depending on your location,
six to 14 days later,
earth days later,

195
00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.320
um,
it'll get very,
very cold.

196
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.470
We're not required nor designed to make it through the night.

197
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:01.750
So do we just find a place that has the shortest night and then go sleep finally

198
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.990
and then come back in a earth week say and see if it comes back to life and we

199
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:08.950
can continue the mission.
Um,

200
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.980
Dewey just drive as far as we can into a permanently shadow region until we

201
00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:18.520
can't communicate with it anymore.
Uh,
lots of different possibilities.

202
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.910
So let me talk just very quickly,
um,

203
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:26.390
about how the neutron spectrometry works in a very simple way.
Um,

204
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.820
I'm an engineer,
not a lunar scientists.
So,
uh,
this,
this is how I look at,
uh,

205
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.380
the opportunity here.

206
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.640
So galactic cosmic rays are continuously hitting the visible regions of the
moon.

207
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.240
And um,
in doing so,

208
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.850
they scatter the shadow of nuclear and you get all this flux that comes flying

209
00:12:45.851 --> 00:12:46.600
out of the soil,

210
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.680
that neutron spectrometer that's sitting on the front and she saw very simply

211
00:12:50.681 --> 00:12:53.830
animated with the um,
uh,

212
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.300
blue pathways and so forth in the video are what we're able to measure.

213
00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.510
And if we find an area that's especially interesting,

214
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.830
you can see the neutron count rate there.
We could actually use our drill,

215
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:10.660
drill down to as much as a meter deep in the soil,
pull the material up.

216
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.980
And um,
in the video you would see that we actually cook the material.

217
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.300
We have a cleverly named device called an oven.
That's actually an acronym.

218
00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:24.610
Um,
but it's also an oven that cooks the soil,
you know,

219
00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:26.410
a crucible that we deliver into the oven,

220
00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:30.760
cooks it and measures all the constituents that come baking off.

221
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.780
And so that's,
that's the whole key,
the whole trick behind the mission.

222
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:37.683
So we have a,

223
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:42.490
we set ourselves a very ambitious goal in fiscal year 15,

224
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.890
um,
that is can we actually from our requirements in a single year,

225
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.480
go from requirements to a preliminary design while going through all the gate

226
00:13:52.481 --> 00:13:57.040
reviews that NASA has,
but a,
an expanded,
expedited version of them,

227
00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:02.140
manufacturer the hardware,
build the hardware,
conduct testing on it,

228
00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:04.690
and actually fly the mission.
Air quotes,

229
00:14:04.691 --> 00:14:07.150
fly the mission on earth all in a year.

230
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:12.310
And so this was the rover that we had designed and uh,

231
00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.790
I'll give away the answer.
We did it in a 10 to 11 months.

232
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.440
It was very impressive.

233
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.920
And so I'm going to walk you through now some of the work that we've done.
Um,

234
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.090
some of this predated the one year,
this is a little bit before,

235
00:14:25.091 --> 00:14:27.940
but I want to use it to illustrate some of the work that we've done.

236
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:32.410
So what you're seeing here is the Krx rover at Nasa Ames Research Center out in

237
00:14:32.411 --> 00:14:33.244
the rover scape.

238
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:37.660
And we've got the neutron spectrometer right up here in the front.

239
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:42.360
That's the one that you saw on the video and then a gamma ray source out in

240
00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.790
front on this viscous that sits up front.
Because the beauty,

241
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.150
one of the many beauties of earth is that we have our atmosphere to protect us

242
00:14:49.151 --> 00:14:52.430
from some of the radiation that we won't be protected from on the moon.

243
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.640
And so that's a radiation source,

244
00:14:55.641 --> 00:15:00.641
low level radiation source that is pummeling the soil in front of the rover and

245
00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:04.220
the Neutron Spectrometer can then take measurements as if it would out in the

246
00:15:04.221 --> 00:15:08.570
native lunar environment.
We also have an instrument called nervous,

247
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.540
uh,
which is a near infrared spectrometer system.

248
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.180
So you've got a neutron spectrometer,
a near infrared spectrometer.

249
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.600
This one does not have the ability to look down in soil.

250
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.010
That's what the NSS is for.

251
00:15:19.011 --> 00:15:22.940
This one has the ability to look at the surface like right on the surface.

252
00:15:22.941 --> 00:15:27.230
And so what's very good about that is it allows us as we're cruising and doing

253
00:15:27.231 --> 00:15:29.120
our mapping to see what's on the surface,

254
00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:31.850
but also if we bring materials up to the surface,

255
00:15:31.851 --> 00:15:35.960
we could look at what's coming up and actually get a vertical distribution of

256
00:15:35.961 --> 00:15:37.670
what we're finding down at that drill point.

257
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:44.230
We then set up tests in a thermal vacuum chambers.

258
00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:49.190
This is a soso image of a container,

259
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.840
say about a foot in diameter,

260
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.460
maybe about three feet tall that has been doped with a soil,

261
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:59.420
lunar simulant and a certain amount of water as a function of depth.

262
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.050
We put it in a thermal vacuum chamber,
take our drill system,

263
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:08.350
actually drill through it and see if we can recreate what we know is the shape

264
00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.060
of the volatile distribution in that canister.

265
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.870
And this is a plot of what we had found in our data.

266
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.930
And it did indeed match very well to what was going on in there.

267
00:16:17.931 --> 00:16:22.130
And that was at as near as we could reasonably get lunar temperature in a

268
00:16:22.131 --> 00:16:24.410
permanent shadow region and add vacuum.

269
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.590
So that was a very good test you'd see here.
Uh,
the crucible,
uh,

270
00:16:30.591 --> 00:16:33.890
that we're filling.
Um,
and this is the drill system,

271
00:16:33.891 --> 00:16:35.750
bringing up materials and dumping it on the surface.

272
00:16:35.751 --> 00:16:38.600
And that's where the near infrared spectrometer can take a look at it.

273
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.930
Now we're evolving the design a little bit further.

274
00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:45.290
Here's the oven that Jose referring to.
You can see it's a red hot in here.

275
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:47.210
It's just truly a ceramic,

276
00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:52.610
a double wound oven heating system in a scissor lift that pushes the crucible up

277
00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:57.410
into it.
Um,
more development of the payload and drill system.

278
00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:58.880
You see two videos on the right.

279
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:03.260
This is a two times sped up video of the processing of the crucible.

280
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:06.590
As it moves around after the drill has filled it.
Here's the drill,

281
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.400
here's the brush that knocks it into,
in this case of three d printed crucible.

282
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:15.710
So this is two times speed up testing all of our states,
um,

283
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:19.130
measuring stations,
putting on a cap,
taking off the cap and up top.

284
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.110
You could see us,
uh,

285
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:25.730
testing how the material comes off into these three d printed,

286
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:27.860
um,
crucibles and holders.

287
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.040
What you find is you see we're losing a lot of material over here.

288
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:36.710
This design needs to be improved upon and we since have improved on it.

289
00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:40.070
But this is again why we're doing this activity.
It makes it very much,

290
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.910
it makes us much smarter with what we're doing.
Okay.

291
00:17:43.911 --> 00:17:48.350
So the a rover that you saw,
the cat image of this is us starting to build it.

292
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:53.490
We're not building a flight rover.
Uh,
so for example,
the radiator system,

293
00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:56.610
which is what that top deck is trying to represent is just aluminum.

294
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.080
There's no point to test our ability to radiate off heat and an earth

295
00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:01.741
environment.

296
00:18:01.741 --> 00:18:06.570
But we tried to make it physically representative the wheels and the control

297
00:18:06.571 --> 00:18:10.350
system for steering and the suspension system is all relevant.

298
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:14.880
Although he had to robust some of the design up to work in one G.

299
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.160
Remember we've got one six g on the moon,

300
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:21.810
but to build the one six g item and then test it on earth may not give you

301
00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:25.290
relevant results,
may even cause problems.
Uh,

302
00:18:25.291 --> 00:18:29.940
heat spreaders where all the electronics are going so forth.
The dump,

303
00:18:29.941 --> 00:18:33.780
the heat building up our battery banks,
um,

304
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.740
now revolving in a little bit further,
very pretty a suspension drive system.

305
00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:42.100
We built five of these,
four of them for the rover,
and then one for testing,
uh,

306
00:18:42.101 --> 00:18:46.440
including the driver boards.
Um,
uh,

307
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.790
these are the one g wheels,
uh,

308
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.870
which would look a little different and we've already evolved them since this

309
00:18:51.871 --> 00:18:52.501
point.
But again,

310
00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:56.280
this is the one your activity and starting to build this system together,

311
00:18:56.281 --> 00:18:58.650
the chassis bones on each side.

312
00:18:58.651 --> 00:19:01.830
Here you can see that oven system member of the video that we're showing

313
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:06.150
materials going back and forth.
That's the very device in there as a test unit.

314
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:10.730
Here's a commercial drill from a company called Honeybee that built a

315
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.240
engineering test unit for us.

316
00:19:12.241 --> 00:19:17.241
They have lots and lots of experience out in a different analog environments

317
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:21.900
here on earth.
And so we're looking to them to provide that,
uh,
for the mission.

318
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.920
And here,
if you've been watching the date codes up top,

319
00:19:25.921 --> 00:19:30.450
this is August a fiscal 15.
The year mark would be in the end of September.

320
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:35.130
And this is us driving around the rover at NASA,

321
00:19:35.131 --> 00:19:38.490
Johnson and Houston.
And uh,

322
00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:41.460
it gives you a real sense of scale there.
Um,

323
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.430
some of the steering possibilities,

324
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.400
you see the solar ray in that image there that again is mocked up a,

325
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.290
we really are running off a battery power which are really flight forward design

326
00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:55.740
batteries,
but we charge it on an umbilical system before we went out there.

327
00:19:55.741 --> 00:20:00.741
It's all umbilical free now though in this activity we use Wifi for the comm

328
00:20:00.871 --> 00:20:04.980
system because we don't need to actually use a,
you know,
space-based comm system.

329
00:20:04.981 --> 00:20:08.010
We don't need to prove that either.
That's all that's all well understood.

330
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:08.641
However,

331
00:20:08.641 --> 00:20:12.630
that is the engineering test unit drill that's in there and inside of there is

332
00:20:12.631 --> 00:20:15.930
that oven is our um,
lava system,

333
00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:20.720
which is what sniffs the volatiles that come off of the oven.
Cs,
uh,

334
00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.210
pushing ourselves on some of these slopes and over obstacles,

335
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:28.560
frankly beyond the requirements in some cases.
But we're challenging the design.

336
00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:30.300
We're kind of beating this thing up.

337
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.200
I remember at one point we were up at the top of this hill and there was a

338
00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:39.020
pretty sheer cliff and,
um,
we were looking to do,
you know,

339
00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:44.190
a rotation and um,
one of the wheels nearly went off the edge.

340
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:49.690
All the lights flashed in my head and I thought I saw a tunnel.
Um,

341
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.710
and it ended up working out because one of the things you'll see in a video

342
00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:58.570
coming up is we have the ability to redistribute the weight of the rover across

343
00:20:58.571 --> 00:21:02.740
its four contact points.
So the wheels,
which could be a very,
uh,

344
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.990
important capability to be able to have.

345
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.780
So there is a still image showing you some of the piece parts.

346
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.070
I could see the a mocked up solar array.
Um,

347
00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:14.560
you'll notice this looks very different.
Yeah.
Question.

348
00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:15.723
<v 3>Yeah.
Since,</v>

349
00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.380
since you were talking about the difference between one g and one sixth g

350
00:21:18.381 --> 00:21:22.410
doesn't make sense to like no attention helium balloons or something to reduce

351
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.273
the weight.

352
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.160
<v 0>Hold that thought.
Okay.
No,
we didn't do helium balloons,
but we,
we,</v>

353
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.770
we took that same approach and you'll see that in a second.

354
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:34.240
But this doesn't look like any of the Mars Rovers,
not even a little bit.

355
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.240
I mean it's tall and the solar rays in the wrong place.

356
00:21:37.241 --> 00:21:40.140
And what you're seeing here is,
uh,

357
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.010
the nature of the environment that we're going in,

358
00:21:42.011 --> 00:21:43.480
which is a polar region on the moon.

359
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.240
When you think about that with my whole description,

360
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:49.000
my head being the sun and the moon and its orientation,

361
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.610
the earth and the sun.

362
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:56.710
Well the sun in particular never gets more than say seven or eight or nine

363
00:21:57.011 --> 00:22:00.430
degrees above the horizon from a polar region on the moon.

364
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.810
So we have these incredibly long shadows and solar energy.

365
00:22:05.811 --> 00:22:07.630
Since we're not nuclear or anything else,

366
00:22:07.631 --> 00:22:11.530
it's going to come in nearly horizontal,
little bit off of horizontal.

367
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:16.480
And so our solar ray looking up to the sky,
uh,
it does nothing.

368
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.580
It's nothing but blackness of space up there.

369
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.510
And so the solar array has to be positioned.
You see it's on a near vertical.

370
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.780
It's playing to that reality of where the sun will be over the course of our

371
00:22:25.781 --> 00:22:29.350
mission.
And then the a radiator system,

372
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.910
which this would normally be a not so good place to put that looking up into the

373
00:22:33.911 --> 00:22:35.560
sun,
but again,
because of where we are,

374
00:22:35.561 --> 00:22:37.180
it's going to be nothing but black up there.

375
00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:41.080
So it's a great place to radiate off excess heat.
And then of course,

376
00:22:41.081 --> 00:22:43.240
you've already seen the interesting way in which it moves.

377
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:48.380
That's all capability associated with us being able to navigate,
uh,

378
00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.190
some social surprises over rocks and so forth.

379
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.120
<v 3>Um,
yeah,
I think that's about it.</v>

380
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.100
<v 0>All right.
So I talked to you about some of the Mars Rovers.</v>

381
00:22:58.101 --> 00:22:59.450
Here's even some other,
uh,

382
00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:03.020
rovers to give you a comparison with my crude PowerPoint capabilities.

383
00:23:03.021 --> 00:23:06.290
These are roughly to scale from an image point of view.

384
00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.790
You'd see the actual dimensions there.
Uh,
so we're,

385
00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.050
even though we look very different than spirit and opportunity,
uh,

386
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:18.800
see all these,
uh,
you know,
foldout arrays and so forth.

387
00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.120
We just don't look like that.

388
00:23:20.121 --> 00:23:25.121
But we're roughly that size and this is 180 kilograms were heavier than that,

389
00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:29.750
nearly double that,
a weight or you could also see some of the speed performance.

390
00:23:29.751 --> 00:23:34.190
Although we're not trying to do a lunar speed record,
ground speed record,

391
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.370
but it's based on what we're trying to accomplish.
In the case of Luna Cod,

392
00:23:37.371 --> 00:23:41.660
it was about,
you know,
getting some mileage,
um,
under its belt.
In our case,

393
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:46.400
we can go as fast as 10 centimeters a second while making that neutron

394
00:23:46.401 --> 00:23:49.700
spectrometer measurement.
So we can measure on the fly.

395
00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:52.310
We don't have to stop and measure,
but are,
uh,

396
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.970
runout speed is something closer to 25 centimeters a second if we're trying to

397
00:23:55.971 --> 00:23:57.980
just get to another place.

398
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:00.470
<v 4>Okay.</v>

399
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:02.330
<v 0>Or Julian in the rock yard.
And you can see here,</v>

400
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:06.830
we actually took one of those crucibles that we had doped with lunar simulant

401
00:24:06.831 --> 00:24:09.820
and actually buried it in the soil.
Uh,

402
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.050
that is not going to be at the right temperature.

403
00:24:12.051 --> 00:24:14.150
We're in an atmospheric environment and so forth.

404
00:24:14.151 --> 00:24:18.620
But we're trying to practice things like actually positioning the rover over an

405
00:24:18.621 --> 00:24:21.320
area of interest.
Uh,
the movement they're in,

406
00:24:21.321 --> 00:24:25.550
and then drilling and seeing how the process works while acknowledging we're in

407
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.240
a couple of environmental ways of quite different than what we'll see on the

408
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:33.140
moon.
It's all about learning.
And you'll see on the drill,
uh,

409
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.170
the flu to the drill is very interesting.
Neither of these pictures reflect,

410
00:24:36.171 --> 00:24:39.130
I think the previous one showed it.
So if you go back and watch this,

411
00:24:39.131 --> 00:24:39.950
you could see it.

412
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:44.150
The upper part of the drill bit has a flute that looks much more like an Auger.

413
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.480
So it's a very high pitch,
right?

414
00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.810
This is the part that's actually trying to trap materials.
So has a very,
uh,

415
00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:55.810
low sloped pitch.
So the material gets stuck in it.

416
00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.730
The idea is that at the bottom of the,
of the drill bit,
when you go down there,

417
00:25:00.731 --> 00:25:03.370
you're trapping materials in there.
But as you keep going further,

418
00:25:03.371 --> 00:25:05.830
you want to move the materials up and out through the auger system.

419
00:25:05.831 --> 00:25:08.530
So you're trying to pass material up and out.

420
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:13.060
But this is the area where you want to trap it and then you pull it back up out

421
00:25:13.061 --> 00:25:14.830
of the ground.
So here's the trap soil.

422
00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:20.040
And then this brush system is wiping out those flutes where the materials trap

423
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.320
that falls down into the crucible.

424
00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.590
And then over here is a crucible shown inside the oven.

425
00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:30.280
But it would actually be going out through those brushes going out there to

426
00:25:30.281 --> 00:25:34.660
receive the material outside of the oven and then come back in and do the magic

427
00:25:34.661 --> 00:25:37.720
you saw in the video with running around into the oven,
measuring before,

428
00:25:37.721 --> 00:25:41.110
measuring,
after putting a cap on it,
all those different activities.

429
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:47.930
Uh,
Houston,
uh,
so this was in the middle of summer,

430
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.990
despite how that looks and these things come up on you pretty quick.

431
00:25:50.991 --> 00:25:53.930
You see clouds off in the distance and then suddenly this is happening to you.

432
00:25:53.931 --> 00:25:57.530
This was our lead systems engineer.
You just came back in his car.

433
00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:00.650
He did run out into this.
He was a hero along with other guys.

434
00:26:00.651 --> 00:26:05.210
But this tent you see here is actually a cooling tent because it's so stinking

435
00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:07.970
hot and humid there.
And so,
uh,

436
00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:11.750
there's a big air conditioner system in there and it's,
it's so hot.

437
00:26:11.751 --> 00:26:15.340
It's so miserable during mid day that,
uh,

438
00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:17.360
you have to go in there and just chill and there's water in there.

439
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:21.080
So this is the tent that right now you see as almost being folded in half by the

440
00:26:21.081 --> 00:26:24.830
wind and the temperature isn't actually a problem here.

441
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:31.400
We got water that's going inside the tent and you'd see water's pooling around

442
00:26:31.401 --> 00:26:32.750
the feet.
Uh,

443
00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.410
guys who are out there conducting the test actually had to make little dams

444
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:41.710
around the a rover in and a few guys that were hanging on the tent to keep it

445
00:26:42.051 --> 00:26:45.480
from lifting,
um,
hero.

446
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.520
And then once it cleared and that's,
that was literally,
you know,

447
00:26:50.521 --> 00:26:54.080
45 minutes later,
I look at the sky,
beautiful,
cloudy but clear sky.

448
00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.070
And then we took it back and it was all fine cause the guys were,
uh,

449
00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.490
a lot of locals there understand how the weather works,

450
00:26:59.491 --> 00:27:00.900
but it's pretty impressive to us.

451
00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:05.070
So the culmination hearing I'm out in Noah's that August 21st,

452
00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:10.660
um,
culmination of the work was to actually do the mission,
right,
uh,

453
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:14.700
on earth.
And so what we did was in the top left picture here,

454
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:16.410
this is at Ames research center.

455
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:21.410
You may know Jay and some other folks who are actually with very low cost,

456
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:23.900
you know,
mission construct.

457
00:27:23.901 --> 00:27:26.880
It doesn't look like what you used to seeing in the movies and that's by design.

458
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:30.240
This is just a bunch of pcs network together.
Um,

459
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:35.480
we're doing the overall mission operations role and then down here is at Kennedy

460
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.590
Space Center in Florida.
That's actually firing room for,

461
00:27:40.591 --> 00:27:44.040
for anyone who understands all the different firing rooms there.

462
00:27:44.041 --> 00:27:49.041
This is a pretty expensive well outfitted place that they put a,

463
00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:54.120
the simple setup in.
They are in control of the payload that's on the rover.

464
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.560
We're driving the rover around the honeybee drill that I told you about.

465
00:27:58.561 --> 00:28:03.561
It's actually being monitored at a Pasadena and this is actually taking place in

466
00:28:03.661 --> 00:28:07.950
Houston.
So yes,
the distances are all wrong.
If you're on the moon,

467
00:28:07.951 --> 00:28:08.910
it's much more challenging.

468
00:28:08.911 --> 00:28:13.140
But we're behaving and operating two procedures that are essentially what we

469
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.970
would expect to do on the mission.
We didn't give ourselves a breaks.

470
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.100
I mean we did in between different scenarios,

471
00:28:20.101 --> 00:28:23.100
but we really did a real time scenario there.

472
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.160
This is one of my favorite pictures from the whole activity.

473
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.720
You'll notice an interesting framing.
There's,
there's a big hill that uh,

474
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.360
at one point I thought we were nearly going to fall off of.

475
00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.670
So you've got to check in his phone.
Uh,

476
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.700
any idea what is framing that this image of the black above and below

477
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:47.120
those are sunglasses.
So it happened is we hadn't fully calibrated the,
uh,

478
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:50.490
imaging system and we went out there and that bright Houston,
uh,
light,

479
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.330
we had a whiteout conditions.
And so one of the engineers are there sacrifices.

480
00:28:54.331 --> 00:28:57.990
Oakley's snapped it in half the camera,
you know,
lenses.

481
00:28:57.991 --> 00:29:00.620
The eyes are this far park.
You couldn't just put a pair of glasses on,

482
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:02.250
snapped him,
duct taped them.

483
00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.400
Part of the drama that you can't see if there was a piece of duct tape here that

484
00:29:05.401 --> 00:29:08.310
was holding each one on.
And as the heat was going on,

485
00:29:08.311 --> 00:29:09.900
we're all at Ames research center.

486
00:29:09.901 --> 00:29:11.890
I think I'm sitting right over here and we're watching it.

487
00:29:11.891 --> 00:29:15.090
And you could slowly see the tape starting to peel away.
Is it going to drop?

488
00:29:15.091 --> 00:29:16.750
Is it again?
Uh,

489
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.130
it ended up working great type innovation we won't be able to do on the moon,

490
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:25.020
but it shows the character of the people who are,
uh,
involved.
And then finally,

491
00:29:25.021 --> 00:29:28.090
another fun picture do of our project scientists,

492
00:29:28.091 --> 00:29:30.220
Tony Color print and Rick Elphick.
Um,

493
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:34.830
you can see the ric is wearing a blue red three d glasses and getting,

494
00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.510
you know,
striking,
quite opposed.

495
00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:40.230
He's actually looking at the information that's coming off of the camera that

496
00:29:40.231 --> 00:29:41.470
looks down at the soil.

497
00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:44.800
We have different led sources designed into it and so we could turn it on and

498
00:29:44.801 --> 00:29:49.200
off different ones.
And by overlaying the data of those and then comparing it,
uh,

499
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:52.560
you can actually get an interesting 3-d and,
uh,

500
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.000
scientifically relevant information off of that.

501
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.620
Let's you see things through a different light.

502
00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:01.420
I think over the course of the testing we found m and m's,
uh,

503
00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:03.360
we've found paperclip.
Um,

504
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:07.990
I had a guy go and take some water and throw it over here and not tell the team

505
00:30:07.991 --> 00:30:09.940
who was operating it to see if they came across it.

506
00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:12.310
We didn't end up venturing over there,
so we couldn't say we found water.

507
00:30:12.311 --> 00:30:14.180
But we found m and M's.
Um,

508
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:19.070
and some other things with the official equipment driving tools.
Um,

509
00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.910
this is one of my,
my favorites.
It's a,

510
00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:26.680
it's called verve and you can see just the level of fidelity that you have

511
00:30:26.681 --> 00:30:30.520
represented in the model,
but also the terrain.
The terrain is very relevant,

512
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.530
a good representation of that area and the um,
uh,

513
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.900
rock yard over there at,
in Houston.
And,
uh,

514
00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:43.590
I was just watching the rover driver work with them as it was very intuitive,
um,

515
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:47.450
how you basically pick and place and do your way points and uh,

516
00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:51.700
as as so it's very impressive or developing new capabilities there that are

517
00:30:51.701 --> 00:30:55.870
being,
that will be used on other missions as well.
Okay.

518
00:30:55.871 --> 00:30:59.770
So helium balloons,
this was our version of helium balloons.

519
00:30:59.771 --> 00:31:04.540
You can see the black strapping here on each side.
Uh,
you'll see it again,

520
00:31:04.541 --> 00:31:08.070
but basically on each side and then going up with some,
you know,

521
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.620
ties up to the ceiling.
This is in a microgravity type test facility.

522
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:16.690
It's called the Argos facility and we can dial in the gravity that we want.

523
00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:22.080
So what you're watching here is traction testing and navigability.

524
00:31:22.361 --> 00:31:25.570
There you can see the yellow strap going up in one,
six g.

525
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.250
So this is representative of the moon,

526
00:31:27.251 --> 00:31:30.460
although that soil there happens to be just sand.
Um,

527
00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:35.500
and we're challenging ourselves at different angles to see what the grouser

528
00:31:35.501 --> 00:31:37.090
design looks like for the wheels.

529
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.440
And we even played with two different lander regresses to different lander

530
00:31:41.441 --> 00:31:44.620
designs.
This is quite a steep one,
not like what you've seen in the video,

531
00:31:44.621 --> 00:31:48.610
but some of our potential partners have posed tall landers,

532
00:31:48.611 --> 00:31:51.930
which means you have to navigate this.
This is also in that facility,

533
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:56.290
could still see the yellow strapping.
Um,
and believe it or not,

534
00:31:56.291 --> 00:31:58.630
this looks completely rigged.
Like it's been held back.

535
00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:01.660
This is in free rotation right now,

536
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:06.790
but at one six g and it's the aluminum treads on the aluminum slow pair,

537
00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:11.500
which is not an engineered,
um,
uh,
slide if you will.

538
00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.830
Uh,
but you're just getting aluminum to aluminum biting.
So it's actually,

539
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.250
this is not artificial despite how and counter intuitive it is.

540
00:32:18.251 --> 00:32:20.530
It looks like it's being held back somehow,
but it's not.

541
00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:25.570
And then I think there's one final one coming off of a lander deck that's very

542
00:32:25.571 --> 00:32:30.571
similar to what we expect from our lander design that we're currently working

543
00:32:31.241 --> 00:32:32.074
with.

544
00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.213
<v 1>Okay.</v>

545
00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:37.911
<v 0>Okay.</v>

546
00:32:37.911 --> 00:32:42.800
So this illustrates of the navigability of the suspension system and watch what

547
00:32:42.801 --> 00:32:45.110
happens right here.

548
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.520
Now that was a more of a tuning issue than anything else.

549
00:32:52.521 --> 00:32:54.650
So at first that you should not be impressed,

550
00:32:54.651 --> 00:32:57.170
but it illustrates an important thing.
Um,

551
00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:01.910
it's the ability to be able to redistribute the weight of the rover on to say,

552
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:06.350
you know,
three of the wheels.
Uh,
why does that matter?
Well,

553
00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:09.680
for obstacles potentially and stuff.
But the,
the really interesting thing,

554
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:12.830
one of the many interesting things about l cross was in those permanently

555
00:33:12.831 --> 00:33:17.710
shadowed regions when we impacted and we knew when we impacted,
uh,

556
00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.553
we can measure it,

557
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.290
there was no impact for those of you who watched when El Crosswind,

558
00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.400
it was a big nonevent where's the light shining out?

559
00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:29.240
Where's the big explosion that should come out of there?
Well,

560
00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.810
on the spectrum of what could have happened on El Cross,
that's one bookend.

561
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:38.230
The other book end though is one where the softest Downey Talc is in those

562
00:33:39.171 --> 00:33:40.310
permanently shadowed regions.

563
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.430
And so when we went in with the El Cross impact her,

564
00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:48.820
it was a good fraction of a second before there was a thermal signature that was

565
00:33:49.941 --> 00:33:53.360
measurable at 5,600 miles an hour,

566
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.230
a fraction of a second,
like three quarters.
Second is very deep.

567
00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:00.050
A lot of distance has occurred at that speed.

568
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.980
This is spawned a whole bunch of science associated with the nature of those

569
00:34:03.981 --> 00:34:05.510
permanently shatter regions.
Because think about it,

570
00:34:05.511 --> 00:34:10.070
there's no thermal cycling going on.
Um,
it's very,
very cool.

571
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:14.390
The principal,
uh,
forces at play,
maybe electrostatic.

572
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:17.390
And so there's been premises put out there,
you know,

573
00:34:17.391 --> 00:34:20.120
electrostatically stacked Adams,
you know,

574
00:34:20.121 --> 00:34:22.120
that are just this cush for when it came in.

575
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.230
So how do you navigate that with a rover?

576
00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:29.750
And so we don't know what that looks like when you're in the sign.

577
00:34:29.751 --> 00:34:32.900
You've got well consulted soil.
Are you going to,
as the moment you have this,

578
00:34:32.901 --> 00:34:36.200
we'll go in and sort of fall to your belly as a rover.

579
00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:41.270
Not Likely.
There's likely to be a transition,
but we,
we don't know.
Nobody knows.

580
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:45.350
And so the ability to have,
uh,
uh,

581
00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.290
the capability to move around and distribute weight,

582
00:34:48.291 --> 00:34:53.291
maybe pull yourself out of an area that you got stuck in and back away and then

583
00:34:53.571 --> 00:34:57.260
redistrict yourself,
uh,
might be worth every penny that that costs.

584
00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:01.430
So these are conversations we're having,
including the nature of the,
uh,

585
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:02.660
permanent shadow region,

586
00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:07.820
seeing here thermal vacuum testing going on here of some of the robotic systems,

587
00:35:07.821 --> 00:35:08.720
not the whole rover,

588
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:13.010
but some of the key mechanical systems at temperature at vacuum.

589
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:16.840
Got Some still images to,
uh,
of course,
true biology,

590
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.280
the nature of grease and oil and so forth.

591
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.020
In these environments is very relevant,
uh,

592
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:24.320
preventing offgassing or dealing with it

593
00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:27.470
<v 6>with the materials that you choose.
Here's vibe testing.</v>

594
00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.570
It doesn't look like much is happening in the video,

595
00:35:29.571 --> 00:35:31.490
but if you look very closely it is vibrating.

596
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.060
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

597
00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.550
<v 6>So this is random vibe and various configurations.</v>

598
00:35:35.551 --> 00:35:36.690
This happens to be in the launch.

599
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:41.370
You see the drill is stowed tucked down to the right and we're,

600
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.270
we're just trying to see what happens to the system and even the individual

601
00:35:45.271 --> 00:35:48.420
subsystems that you've seen some of these other photos at vibe.

602
00:35:48.421 --> 00:35:51.180
This is on yet another test of the viability of your system.

603
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:56.320
And as is the case in many missions,
the harshest environment it'll see is notch.

604
00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:01.400
<v 0>And so for example,
when we were talking about wheel design and one six g,</v>

605
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:03.163
um,

606
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:07.760
we actually have to design a system for well beyond what we expect to need on

607
00:36:07.761 --> 00:36:09.470
the moon just to survive launch.

608
00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:13.220
And that's just the nature of things until we start launching off of other

609
00:36:13.221 --> 00:36:16.100
planets where it might be an easier go at it.

610
00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.350
And of course looking at a stereo vision testing.
Uh,

611
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:24.560
this is a very strange environment that we're in here because the sign is so low

612
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.800
on the horizon,
the shadows are very long.

613
00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:33.250
So black,
the blackness of a shadow that has no atmospheric,
you know,

614
00:36:33.251 --> 00:36:34.910
cross lining,
it's very binary.

615
00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.490
So you've got whites and you got blacks and you got whites and you got blacks.

616
00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:42.860
How do you tell the whole from a shadow,
I do tell a hill from a shadow,

617
00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:45.380
from something over there that very,

618
00:36:45.381 --> 00:36:48.680
very difficult to do inexpensively.

619
00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:52.280
You can bring a lot of money to bear and start having laser based this and that

620
00:36:52.281 --> 00:36:55.670
and so forth,
which maybe we will end up doing.
But again,

621
00:36:55.671 --> 00:36:58.130
against the premise of doing things cost effectively,
this,

622
00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:00.980
this represents in a special engineering challenge,

623
00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:06.860
you listen carefully,
you could hear almost a music going on in the bottom right.

624
00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.770
This is our land or prototype,
a cad model,

625
00:37:09.771 --> 00:37:12.980
top left and actual built model and the right.

626
00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.610
And then this is a video of us doing cold flow testing.

627
00:37:16.611 --> 00:37:21.611
So we're actually running water through the thrusters in different pairings.

628
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:25.220
So it's bouncing around the thrust right now.
And then we have,
you know,

629
00:37:25.221 --> 00:37:27.230
just pipe to carry the waterway.

630
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:33.370
And so it's allowing us to just play with timing and then a kind of violent

631
00:37:33.531 --> 00:37:36.860
ending and that's where we were firing them all pretty quickly.
Uh,
but again,

632
00:37:36.861 --> 00:37:37.690
it's just a,

633
00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:42.070
a novel aluminum riveted structure that we're testing out the avionics,
um,

634
00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:46.930
at some level thrust or control.
So to,
uh,

635
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.700
to close resource prospector overview,

636
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.090
we're about the nature and distribution of the water and trying to move the ball

637
00:37:53.091 --> 00:37:55.550
so to speak,
down down the field a little bit further.

638
00:37:55.551 --> 00:37:58.610
This is what you can expect.
This is what you have to contend with.

639
00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:02.870
And even testing a little bit of that excavation and processing.

640
00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:06.790
When we bake off that stuff,
we're going to capture some oxygen,

641
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.680
are going to capture some other volatiles.
Um,

642
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:14.600
that could be a very early step to what would end up being required.

643
00:38:14.601 --> 00:38:18.260
If you are a commercial business coming in and looking to drop pallets all over

644
00:38:18.261 --> 00:38:21.070
the surface or down in a permanently shadowed region,
run,
run,

645
00:38:21.071 --> 00:38:23.060
run on some sort of uh,
devices going.

646
00:38:23.061 --> 00:38:27.350
It's filling bottles with leaders of oxygen,
leaders of hydrogen,

647
00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:31.790
and then NASA and other companies come and buy it by the leader and you're

648
00:38:31.791 --> 00:38:36.690
creating a whole new,
you know,
economic opportunity and their business.
Uh,

649
00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.960
so this is,
this is perfect use taxpayer bucks.
Um,
RP specs.

650
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:43.780
Um,
you can read it yourself,

651
00:38:43.781 --> 00:38:45.840
but there's that mission life that I was talking about.

652
00:38:45.841 --> 00:38:47.820
It all has to do with the lighting.
Um,

653
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:52.010
we can make this a much more expansion mission and go somehow nuke or something.

654
00:38:52.011 --> 00:38:52.930
You could survive the night,

655
00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:55.930
but we don't believe we need to do that to answer the fundamental questions.

656
00:38:55.931 --> 00:38:57.790
This isn't about engineering.

657
00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.870
Elegance is about answering the questions and there's this,

658
00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.320
I think a certain elegance in that in itself,
our timeline,

659
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:06.791
a phase,

660
00:39:06.791 --> 00:39:11.110
a formulation that was really where we're conceiving of the idea.

661
00:39:11.111 --> 00:39:15.520
Then this demonstration,
Rp 15 is what I just described to you.

662
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.880
All that testing that we did in a single year.
Now we're,
uh,

663
00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.030
we are doing the environmental testing and 16,

664
00:39:22.031 --> 00:39:26.750
that was the thermal vacuum chamber testing,
the slopes facility testing,
the,
uh,

665
00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:30.910
uh,
vibration testing and a number of other things that I didn't show here.

666
00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:35.200
And so fiscal 17 is what we're in now.
Our fiscal year started in October.

667
00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:40.500
And so we're targeting having our system requirements review at the end of this

668
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:45.250
fiscal year,
which is September of 17,
and moving out as a mission.

669
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.360
That's what we're currently targeting.

670
00:39:46.361 --> 00:39:51.190
You can see current launch date and so forth.
So that can't wait to go.

671
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:52.503
Thank you.

672
00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:57.190
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

673
00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:02.460
<v 0>in such a low temperature with your oils get stuck or stick until the ground.</v>

674
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:04.390
Like,
I don't know,
like,
uh,

675
00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:08.280
what's kind of physics would be expected in such a low temperature?
Yeah.
This,

676
00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:09.123
this is a,

677
00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:13.540
this is a fair question and this is why we're doing all that testing in

678
00:40:13.541 --> 00:40:14.500
different forms.

679
00:40:14.501 --> 00:40:19.501
We would ideally have a place where we could represent all the lunar conditions,

680
00:40:19.541 --> 00:40:24.100
have lunar simulant,
have the temperature's correct,
have the,
um,

681
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:28.090
uh,
vacuum conditions correct.
And bring the whole rover in there.

682
00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.680
That's unlikely it be,

683
00:40:29.681 --> 00:40:33.550
that would be a very expensive thing to do in a very big thermal vacuum chamber.

684
00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.310
We could maybe do it,
but it's a challenge.

685
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:38.440
So what we're trying to do is some of what you've seen here,

686
00:40:38.441 --> 00:40:42.760
which is take pieces of it and see,
um,
see how that works.

687
00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:46.670
If through our risk management process,
we determined that,
um,

688
00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:50.740
it's sketchy enough where these conditions and those conditions,

689
00:40:50.741 --> 00:40:53.470
if they combined together,
we might have a really bad day.

690
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.240
When you go to roll off of that lander,

691
00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:59.650
we may be forced to do more extensive testing.
Uh,
but we'll see.

692
00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:03.250
We're in the middle of evaluating that.
Uh,
so how again,

693
00:41:03.251 --> 00:41:06.760
do you redistribute the weight around the rover?

694
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:10.750
It's all about the mechanical positioning of the,
um,

695
00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:14.350
of the suspension system.
So you can lower,

696
00:41:14.351 --> 00:41:18.220
say these are my four wheels.
You could lower back corner,

697
00:41:18.221 --> 00:41:22.030
just kind of sit back and that allows you to pull this one out and maybe you can

698
00:41:22.031 --> 00:41:26.950
navigate back under that awkward pose and then reposition yourself and recenter.

699
00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:28.500
There's even a,

700
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.960
a strange possibility that I would not call this a designed in feature,

701
00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:35.290
but you could such potential articulation,

702
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:39.860
take the wheels and actually move them into an orthogonal orientation where

703
00:41:39.861 --> 00:41:44.320
they're not rotating and depending on what the locomotion looks like.
And I,
I'm,

704
00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.980
I'm just imagining here,

705
00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.760
you could potentially have some form of walking out of it.

706
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:54.140
If the traction properties are successful,
uh,
that's not,
like I said,

707
00:41:54.141 --> 00:41:58.550
a designed in feature.
But if we find ourselves in a position where,
ah,

708
00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:03.320
this is really a bad day,
then you have the possibility of exploring options.

709
00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:07.870
<v 7>Uh,
is that redistribution done manually or automatically?</v>

710
00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:12.630
<v 0>Yeah.
So,
um,
we that would be done manually on the ground.</v>

711
00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:17.250
Um,
you know,
there's a sliding scale of autonomy,
a fully autonomous system,

712
00:42:17.251 --> 00:42:22.170
which this is not.
And then a fully tele operated system,
which this is not,
um,

713
00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.380
uh,
we gave way points for our navigation,

714
00:42:25.381 --> 00:42:29.970
which means there's some self guidance if you will,
along the way.

715
00:42:29.971 --> 00:42:34.971
Autogeneration but this is closer to a tele type approach than,

716
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:39.270
uh,
than something fully autonomous.
And when you think about it,

717
00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:43.440
a Mars has a very different,
it's very different in many,
many ways,

718
00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.440
but one of them is just transport time,
communications,

719
00:42:46.441 --> 00:42:50.130
transport time that the moon has pretty,
pretty tight,

720
00:42:50.131 --> 00:42:51.540
pretty short transport time.

721
00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:56.780
So it allows us to do things with the benefit of humans in the loop that are not

722
00:42:57.541 --> 00:43:00.330
really feasible.
You have to script everything for,

723
00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:05.010
for the Mars missions just because of speed of light.
And so,
um,

724
00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:08.850
we're trying to play to that because again,
elegance isn't what we're after here.

725
00:43:08.851 --> 00:43:12.090
We're just trying to answer the questions and if the best way to do a short six

726
00:43:12.091 --> 00:43:15.690
to 14 day mission is with a bunch of people getting tired,

727
00:43:15.691 --> 00:43:19.950
but we can all survive doing that 24,
seven was shifting and so forth,

728
00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:22.200
then we should do that.
And that's what we're doing.

729
00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:24.270
<v 7>Yes.
I noticed that,
um,</v>

730
00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:28.530
some of the wheels you had in the demos looked more like a gears.

731
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:32.340
It seems that they would get sort of really good traction and these look like

732
00:43:32.341 --> 00:43:36.960
they're kind of shallow treads that don't look like they would work very well in

733
00:43:36.961 --> 00:43:39.690
some of the sandy environments.
So what's with the,

734
00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:43.510
<v 0>yeah,
so the,
um,
the ones that you saw in the pretty video,</v>

735
00:43:43.511 --> 00:43:47.740
and I think the one here,
um,
our,
our Chevron shaped right.

736
00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:52.300
And,
uh,
they were an initial stab at what might work in an environment.

737
00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:54.580
We found that it worked,
uh,
pretty,

738
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.880
pretty poorly and sand you and sought gunking up and so forth.

739
00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:02.870
The testing that we were doing on the slope and the microgravity facility,

740
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.520
uh,

741
00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:08.520
frankly just had angle iron on it and it was looking at things like the depth of

742
00:44:08.531 --> 00:44:13.220
the grouser and the spacing of the browser to just try to get,
uh,

743
00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:17.620
some sort of heuristic sense of what's going on.
But,
uh,

744
00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:21.040
that's really as far as it would go because there's so much about that testing

745
00:44:21.041 --> 00:44:25.600
that isn't relevant.
Like it isn't lunar simulant at the correct,
uh,

746
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:29.440
dryness and in a microgravity environment.
So we still have much testing to do.

747
00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:31.440
So.
Except that,
yes.

748
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:37.200
<v 8>So is there any chance that the data collected by this mission could be used for</v>

749
00:44:37.201 --> 00:44:41.370
a surgeon,
for traces of life or pest life,
perhaps in sort of,
uh,

750
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.200
extreme of files in this region?

751
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:44.990
<v 0>So,
uh,</v>

752
00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.890
I'm always impressed this happened on elk cross to where you set up to do these

753
00:44:48.891 --> 00:44:53.090
five things and that's what you designed the instruments forward to do these

754
00:44:53.091 --> 00:44:56.810
five things.
And then someone comes along and says,
you know,

755
00:44:56.811 --> 00:44:59.000
if I take half of that and correlate it with this,

756
00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.100
I could actually pull out this other information.

757
00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:05.540
So we're not attempting to do what you're describing.
It's all about volatiles.

758
00:45:05.541 --> 00:45:08.870
But if we can measure the carbon compounds and some other things,

759
00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:13.490
I don't know what might end up being possible,
but it is,
it is not our intention.

760
00:45:13.491 --> 00:45:15.500
It's really about resources.
It's more of a,

761
00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:19.160
an exploration mission as opposed to a scientific mission.

762
00:45:19.161 --> 00:45:23.120
Even though we're using science to answer some exploration questions.
It is,

763
00:45:23.121 --> 00:45:27.890
however,
we think that a learning from this is extensible to other places,

764
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:31.070
asteroids to Mars and so forth,

765
00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:36.440
not the specific conditions.
Um,
there's no atmosphere here.
And you know,

766
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:40.650
so much about is different,
but the methods of uh,

767
00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:46.220
getting to the or processing or might have great extensibility to other

768
00:45:46.221 --> 00:45:48.050
capabilities and the case of asteroids,

769
00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.740
the moon might be actually a very good analog,
no atmosphere,

770
00:45:51.741 --> 00:45:55.430
they're reduced gravity.
Um,
yeah,
it might be,

771
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:57.020
might be a very good example.

772
00:45:57.230 --> 00:46:01.130
So we think this has extensibility even if you don't care about the moon at all,

773
00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:04.520
I think we'll be maturing the sort of the TRL,

774
00:46:04.521 --> 00:46:08.180
the technology readiness level of a bunch of technology that will benefit going

775
00:46:08.181 --> 00:46:09.014
forward.

776
00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:14.670
<v 8>The Detroit to drill inside caves on earth to see how uh,</v>

777
00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:19.390
places that have never seen light of day correlate to places on the surface.

778
00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:22.330
So you know what to expect on the,
those bases on the moon.

779
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:28.490
<v 0>The correlation of Earth Cave Areas I think would be a little bit unclear with</v>

780
00:46:29.461 --> 00:46:33.780
respect to the moon.
What we were attempting to do when you saw those canisters,

781
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:37.340
the large canisters by say a meter tall,
um,

782
00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:42.620
was recreate what we believe is the case on the moon with lunar simulant.

783
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:47.010
And then we engineered the doping levels so that we could confirm if we could

784
00:46:47.011 --> 00:46:48.960
see it and even the compaction level.

785
00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:52.770
And we've even played with cases where we doped it with certain,
you know,

786
00:46:52.771 --> 00:46:54.780
rock counts and sizes and so forth.

787
00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:58.560
So I don't think we need to go to a,
uh,

788
00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:03.640
natural terrestrial cave area to attempt to mimic what we think we'll see on the

789
00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:06.240
moon.
We actually are able to create it.

790
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:09.870
Now the open question is do we actually understand what we're going to find

791
00:47:09.871 --> 00:47:10.350
there?

792
00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:14.970
And so trying variations on a theme is hugely important because when we discover

793
00:47:14.971 --> 00:47:17.430
that,
guess what,
we didn't actually know what the way we thought we did.

794
00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:21.780
Does the drill breaks?
Does the drill gets stuck?
Does it get kicked with a rock?

795
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:23.220
Does it get jammed?

796
00:47:23.221 --> 00:47:27.390
And I don't have spare fluted bits in my back pocket as a rover,

797
00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:31.390
a game over.
Do you need to have a way to pop off that drill?

798
00:47:31.391 --> 00:47:33.160
So as you can at least still scan?

799
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:38.170
These are all things we have to be very deliberate with.
But,
um,
I think,
I think,

800
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:40.420
um,
we have that handled.

801
00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:46.820
<v 8>So the results that you might find a drilling or are those typically made</v>

802
00:47:48.211 --> 00:47:50.730
publicly available?
In some sense,
yes.

803
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:53.290
<v 0>Yeah,
that's,
that's,
that's one of the</v>

804
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.050
really great things I think,
um,
about NASA frankly.

805
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:03.200
And that is a while it's,
it's a u s endeavor.
Uh,

806
00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:06.550
it's partnered in some cases with internationals.

807
00:48:06.551 --> 00:48:08.110
And so there's multiple players in there.

808
00:48:08.111 --> 00:48:12.790
In the end we make this stuff available to mankind.
Right?

809
00:48:12.791 --> 00:48:16.570
And so the,
uh,
I think that's for the overall good.

810
00:48:16.571 --> 00:48:19.000
But the other thing it brings from more selfish point of view,

811
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:21.340
if you get more mines on it,
right?

812
00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:24.970
You get a bunch of different people thinking in different ways on the problem.

813
00:48:24.971 --> 00:48:28.210
We don't have a corner on,
on all the smarts out there.

814
00:48:28.211 --> 00:48:32.320
So bringing the whole community to bear on,

815
00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:36.580
on data and how you look at the analytics of it I think is a very powerful.

816
00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:40.260
<v 8>Um,
yeah,
you guys are probably focused on the current mission,
but I'm,</v>

817
00:48:40.261 --> 00:48:43.830
I'm curious to know based on the outcomes of this and the findings.
Um,

818
00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.400
so you do find water and a good enough distribution that it might be worth

819
00:48:46.401 --> 00:48:50.120
following up on what type of missions in the next 10 to 20 years might we see

820
00:48:50.121 --> 00:48:53.180
that we,
you know,
we could be looking forward to

821
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:55.130
<v 0>yeah.
So,
um,</v>

822
00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.700
under the presumption that we have at least semi favorable results,

823
00:48:58.701 --> 00:49:03.701
meaning we find that the water or maybe other interesting things are available

824
00:49:04.041 --> 00:49:06.650
and accessible from an engineering point of view,

825
00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:09.770
which I suspect will be the case.
We're very water centric,

826
00:49:09.771 --> 00:49:14.240
but it doesn't just have to be about the water three maybe for,
yeah.
So,

827
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:17.300
um,
I think what the next missions will look like,
and I,

828
00:49:17.301 --> 00:49:20.560
I'm approached all the time by the commercial world,
um,

829
00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:26.380
saying that they would do a small scale excavation activity in a,

830
00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:30.830
um,
from a water point of view and a juicy area in an area where it's relatively

831
00:49:30.831 --> 00:49:34.130
easy,
whatever that means to get at it based on the RP data.

832
00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:39.640
And then I think that sort of creates a pathway to bigger and bigger scales.

833
00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:43.130
You could actually envision mobile systems eventually,

834
00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.680
but you're going to start probably with something that looks a little bit more

835
00:49:45.681 --> 00:49:49.860
like a pallet that's placed specifically in a very desirable area.
Um,

836
00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.100
and I think the government and the commercial side,

837
00:49:52.101 --> 00:49:55.520
we'll be working together on this because while we answered this question and

838
00:49:55.521 --> 00:49:58.880
maybe that now opens up an opportunity for the commercial world to go exploit

839
00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:04.210
and make profitable enterprise out of that,
the large scale,
uh,

840
00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:07.490
possibilities going as a next step might be something that's more suitable for

841
00:50:07.491 --> 00:50:11.810
government level risk taking and dollar amounts and then that will feed the
next.

842
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:15.830
So I see this kind of inch warming thing going up towards,
uh,

843
00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:19.730
really a holistic in situ resource utilization capability.

844
00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:23.870
<v 8>Uh,
could you assemble the,
uh,
influenced,</v>

845
00:50:23.871 --> 00:50:28.290
will polluted by a asteroids or comets that's flight

846
00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:31.610
<v 0>through moon and how did you differentiate those?</v>

847
00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:36.650
So I'm not gonna be able to answer how you differentiate commentary stuff or

848
00:50:36.651 --> 00:50:39.440
asteroidal stuff from other things.
But absolutely,

849
00:50:39.441 --> 00:50:44.000
there's lots of impact gardening going on.
I love that term.

850
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:45.530
I did not make that up,

851
00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:50.990
which is because there's no atmosphere on the moon or at least a very,

852
00:50:50.991 --> 00:50:55.640
very tenuous one that is not protecting the surface like we do on earth.

853
00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:58.070
Um,
surface is riddled with them.

854
00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:02.070
Impregnation of materials that have been brought there,
um,

855
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:07.520
over a few billion years.
Uh,
it's even,

856
00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:12.170
and I'll postulated that some of the big water fines in some of these

857
00:51:12.171 --> 00:51:16.670
permanently shadowed craters may well be the leftovers of asteroids or comets

858
00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:21.770
depositing on the moon since the moon's formation likely didn't allow water that

859
00:51:21.771 --> 00:51:25.640
was found at that time to somehow survive.
So it's probably all deposition.

860
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:29.270
So now there's yet another marketing opportunity right by and moon water.

861
00:51:29.271 --> 00:51:34.260
How much,
how much do you think this would cost and lunar water?
Right?
Uh,

862
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.450
so,
um,
I,

863
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:41.930
I think there's just untold possibilities here.
Even on the commercial side,

864
00:51:41.931 --> 00:51:45.980
we're hearing,
I speak a lot to the Google lunar x prize,
a competitor's.

865
00:51:45.981 --> 00:51:50.570
I went to the annual meeting last year and there's all sorts of rich ideas on

866
00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:55.100
what to do very explicitly with the material,
but also almost symbolically,
um,

867
00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:59.430
you know,
bringing things from Earth there and so forth.
There's lots of,
uh,

868
00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:01.250
exploitable possibility here.

869
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:06.890
<v 9>So you said the mission is during the lunar day,
um,</v>

870
00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.710
but wouldn't driving down to the craters,

871
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:13.070
make the environment pretty similar to the Luna night?
Temperature wise

872
00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:17.970
<v 0>will be from a temperature point of view,
but the,
uh,</v>

873
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:19.940
the idea is we can get back out.

874
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.990
So we have batteries in the sizing of the batteries and the sizing of the whole

875
00:52:23.991 --> 00:52:28.670
power system are very much driven by that point.
So can we go in there and spend,

876
00:52:28.671 --> 00:52:33.590
say five,
six hours in zero power,
positive conditions,

877
00:52:33.591 --> 00:52:37.470
just using the batteries and actually operate a drill,
bring it up.
Um,

878
00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:41.900
in the video unfortunately cutoff,
but in the video we,
for example,

879
00:52:41.901 --> 00:52:45.590
don't do processing down there.
We don't cook it.
That's an energy pig.

880
00:52:45.591 --> 00:52:49.040
So we get the material and we get out of there,
we get back out in Sun,

881
00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:53.420
turned her back on the sun,
get power positive and then start cooking the system.

882
00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:58.400
So,
um,
it is similar from a temperature point of view,

883
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:01.700
but we still have come back to earth because even though you're in this

884
00:53:01.701 --> 00:53:02.930
permanently shadowed region,

885
00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:06.320
we're designing the system to always be able to see earth,
to be able to,

886
00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:09.610
you know,
send our signal there.
Um,

887
00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:13.240
and to be able to navigate out because I pointed out were,
you know,

888
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:17.660
a little more like a tele off then we are like a fully autonomous system.
Um,

889
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:20.930
so yeah,
that's,
that's designed in,
that's intended.

890
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:25.350
It does put a challenge on our mechanical systems design and power systems

891
00:53:25.351 --> 00:53:26.730
design because it's very cold.

892
00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:28.620
<v 10>So about that,</v>

893
00:53:28.621 --> 00:53:32.170
about having the river always need to go from the dark place back to like did

894
00:53:32.171 --> 00:53:36.610
recharge and back,
have you considered having two or three rovers?

895
00:53:36.611 --> 00:53:39.910
One to just keep recharging the other one in the dark and it could also

896
00:53:39.911 --> 00:53:42.500
communicate with that one so it doesn't actually have to be facing earth thin.

897
00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:43.210
Okay.

898
00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:45.460
<v 0>There's even ideas out there,
um,</v>

899
00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:48.820
of umbilicals that go to something that's up on the surface,

900
00:53:48.821 --> 00:53:51.190
that's enjoying sign all the time.

901
00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:56.490
Those are all completely viable ideas and they may fit more into the paradigm of

902
00:53:56.771 --> 00:54:01.360
what you would do in a production sense,
right?
If it turns out,

903
00:54:01.361 --> 00:54:05.170
say that the water or the accessible waters all down in that,
you know,

904
00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:08.500
70 degree Kelvin area.
So it's tough.
Well,
yeah,

905
00:54:08.501 --> 00:54:11.920
the rim of that creator is likely going to be loaded with all sorts of power

906
00:54:11.921 --> 00:54:16.921
generation capability and at least you'd be able to go up there and sit and park

907
00:54:17.201 --> 00:54:20.140
in charge and you'd have a whole arsenal of these things going down there.

908
00:54:20.141 --> 00:54:22.750
That's all possible in our case that I remember our paradigm.

909
00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:25.960
We're trying to just answer the questions and if we think we can answer those

910
00:54:25.961 --> 00:54:30.280
questions about the nature of things in a simpler way that keeps our complexity

911
00:54:30.281 --> 00:54:33.640
in check keeps therefore our likelihoods of failure in check.

912
00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:36.630
That's what we're going to pick.
Um,
so,
uh,

913
00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:40.900
I take it you've heard of the men bill stone and the Shackleton Energy Company

914
00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:45.100
at all.
Um,
what are your thoughts on that as a future venture and a,
I mean,

915
00:54:45.101 --> 00:54:48.840
is this like the next oil economy of the space,
age of the solar system,
age?

916
00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:52.450
I think all of that as possible.
I won't talk about any particular company,

917
00:54:52.451 --> 00:54:57.250
but I have,
I have spoken with them at most recent conference I went to,
uh,

918
00:54:57.370 --> 00:54:59.140
despite water being very interesting.

919
00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:03.850
I had two different presenters from two different companies who I didn't speak

920
00:55:03.851 --> 00:55:08.851
with directly at all site RP as an important mission because it's answering

921
00:55:09.011 --> 00:55:13.300
questions so that they can do very clever things such as,
um,

922
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:16.090
actually,
you know,
scooping up the soil,

923
00:55:16.091 --> 00:55:19.630
they're putting it into this magical hopper and outcome,

924
00:55:19.631 --> 00:55:22.420
crucibles filling with copper,
crucibles filling with iron,

925
00:55:22.421 --> 00:55:24.850
crucibles filling with,
you know,
aluminum and so forth.

926
00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:29.920
And then you turn that into feed stock for three d printing and interesting

927
00:55:29.921 --> 00:55:32.710
public private partnership up.
Oh,
absolutely.
And,

928
00:55:32.711 --> 00:55:35.710
and the government would benefit from having that capability up there.

929
00:55:35.711 --> 00:55:40.660
It could be a profitable enterprise.
So the commercial side does this is a win,

930
00:55:40.661 --> 00:55:45.140
win,
win.
Absolutely.
And I think it starts with a mission like this.
All right.

931
00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:46.060
Thank you.

932
00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:49.790
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
