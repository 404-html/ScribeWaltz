1
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.940
Glory.
I'm Devin,
thank you so much for having me.
It's a pleasure to be here,

2
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.880
especially since this is a topic that's near and dear to my heart.

3
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.140
And I know that you've listed a long list of accomplishments.
Um,

4
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.200
but certainly,
you know,
I,
I think,
uh,

5
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.740
we would dive somewhere in to that story later on.
So today,
uh,

6
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:30.630
we've spent about 50 or so minutes to talk about how you can recognize some of

7
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:35.160
the signs and symptoms of stress and also what's causing some of those issues

8
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:39.720
too.
We'll also talk about some of the ways you can try to hack these,

9
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.040
you know,
there's symptoms away,
so how to hack your mind,
your body,

10
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.530
your time,
and your social life too.

11
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.450
And also if you ever need any more power ups too for your hacking.
Um,
you know,

12
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.930
there's some lots of resources out there and I would just point to you pointing

13
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.790
to some of the more promising ones too.

14
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.100
I think that all of us have faced some sort or know somebody who has faced some

15
00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:05.040
sort of,
um,
uh,
condition in the past,

16
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.960
whether it's stress to anxiety,
to complete panic attacks and breakdowns to,

17
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.210
and certainly I myself have had a share of them too.
Um,

18
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.220
I and also seeing folks who have been affected by these conditions,

19
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.300
seeing it,

20
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.300
seeing folks and seeing them recover and seeing them reach their goals has been

21
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:29.490
such a joy to me.
And being able to work with folks at other universities.

22
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:32.370
This is Dr. Gibson on technology issues,

23
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:36.390
on how we can use technology to boost access to mental health conditions.

24
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:39.750
And now being able to teach other physicians and other healthcare providers to

25
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:43.260
has been really important to me.
Um,
but I gotta say,
uh,

26
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.720
you 20 years ago you would not have found me,

27
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.190
you being able to muster up the courage to speak in front of a crowd like this

28
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:52.850
or um,
folks worldwide too.
Um,

29
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.300
I remember the times when I was in Soda Hall at Uc Berkeley where I was,

30
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.610
I was studying computer science at the time,
was very,
very,
um,

31
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.500
stressful and there was a pressure cooker time.

32
00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:06.870
And so this is me with a bag of beans trying to,

33
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.430
trying to nosh on and a study and then in all of the books that we've had to,

34
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.030
you know,
go through this is just for one of four exams,
uh,

35
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.050
in medical school to,
and even on vacation times,
you know,

36
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:22.110
I'd be taking my books and trying to read through them.

37
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.590
So it was this always on culture,
right?
Um,

38
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.420
that was through school and no PR pervades work that has,
um,
really,

39
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:34.770
really,
uh,
led to a lot of anxiety and stress that I faced myself too.

40
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.790
And a lot of it comes from this sort of inner critic voice,
this feeling that,

41
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.500
you know,
I could never be good enough.

42
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.390
There are all these negative thoughts that I've dealt with in the past.

43
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.850
Uh,
things like telling myself,
Gosh,

44
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:50.640
I wish I could get more done or I feel tired all the time.

45
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:54.930
I can't make a mistake,
I'm not good enough.
Um,
these are things that I,

46
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.470
I know I faced myself and other people,
uh,

47
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.730
face and those voices can,
uh,

48
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.170
be internalized and lead to something called the imposter syndrome where you

49
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:07.870
feel like you're a fake or you're an imposter.

50
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.290
And I think that the turning point for me was seeing how much my colleagues were

51
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:17.230
suffering too.
Um,
I've,

52
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.000
I've learned just in the past few weeks that there's a physician who's who,
who,

53
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:25.680
uh,
takes their own life a day on average.
Um,

54
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.830
so this is being reported more and more,
um,
through suicide and,

55
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.690
and so the culture of medicine isn't set up to sort of acknowledge these mental

56
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:36.330
health conditions.
Um,

57
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.720
and the fact that there's just an enormous amount of stress.
Um,
the,

58
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.390
we see this in executives too,
and um,
administrators too.

59
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.810
There are warning signs such as depressed moon.

60
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.260
There've been cases of executives.
There's one in the Harvard Business Review.

61
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.190
One on one executive would say,
um,
I,
um,

62
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.820
I wish I would have a heart attack so that could have an excuse to go to the

63
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:00.520
hospital and get away from work.
And,
uh,

64
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:05.110
that wasn't quite a suicidal plan.
But certainly along those lines,

65
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:07.260
if you,
if you're coming up with a plan and,

66
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.780
and thinking of executing on that plan,
that's a warning sign.

67
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.230
And then drugs and alcohol use,
uh,

68
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.560
to sort of mute those feelings can,

69
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.580
can be a warning sign that have more acute intervention as needed.

70
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.630
So having that,
uh,
and seeing that my colleagues,

71
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.190
seeing life in my family,
my nephews and nieces seeing,

72
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.070
um,
my,
uh,
relatives pass away.

73
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.310
And then finally I'm going through something big myself where I myself am being

74
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:43.170
considered and have found out that I'll be,
um,
be a live kidney donor.
Um,
they're,

75
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.680
you know,
potentially later this year.

76
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.950
That's a huge something that made me realize,
you know,

77
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.020
this is something that I would love to talk about and teach others about stress

78
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:56.260
and anxiety and making sure that,
um,

79
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.090
we live the life that we want to.

80
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.070
So what is the turning point that you or your friends may be facing to a online

81
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:05.590
people talk about things like kids being their turning point,

82
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:10.591
having kids or having a major health scare or traveling nonstop to the point of

83
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:15.640
exhaustion working nonstop.
Those are things that could be the turning point.

84
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.480
Um,
but you don't have to wait for a turning point to happen,
certainly,

85
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.320
but this is a big deal.
And as he,
as Devin had mentioned earlier too,

86
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.240
something that a lot of us,

87
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.420
especially men and especially in Southeast Asian cultures,

88
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.290
some cultures don't discuss this enough.
Um,

89
00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.620
and instead I'm kind of just,
uh,

90
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.370
internalize it and not acknowledge that it exists in the past,
I think.

91
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.770
And maybe even the present to a thing that you're anxious or you're stressed.
Um,

92
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.450
you know,
people would be worried that they're being dramatic,

93
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.740
but it's not being dramatic.
There are huge,

94
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.440
there are numbers that back up the concept of other people's suffering from

95
00:05:53.441 --> 00:05:56.890
anxiety and stress.
One in five people in the United States,

96
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.990
some sort of mental health condition in any given year.

97
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.130
And there've been a lot more statistics lately that have been released about how

98
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:09.131
anxiety and depression are some of the most common commonly reported conditions.

99
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.260
This one was in college campuses.

100
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.340
There was a New York Times article last year that talked about,
um,

101
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.300
how anxiety's a much bigger issue than we think it is.
Um,

102
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.250
and just this past week,

103
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.280
the American psychiatric association has been doing yearly reviews of anxiety

104
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.620
and they found that anxiety levels in the United States have been increasing,
um,

105
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.600
uh,
particularly around paying bills.
So their financial stressors.

106
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.020
And then just about five days ago,
um,

107
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.080
a study of folks in the U K a s showed that high job demands low sense of

108
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:48.700
control in jobs and a hijab strain,
uh,

109
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.740
has been predictive of future onset of common mental health conditions.

110
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.060
Basically depression and anxiety too.

111
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.850
So this is something that a lot of us are facing too.

112
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.440
And if we don't take address,

113
00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:04.250
these issues can lead to things like depression or low mood,
high,

114
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.670
high stress hormones,
cholesterol Epinephrin,

115
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.110
which boosts your high blood pressure in an unhealthy manner if it's too long

116
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:17.300
term poor coping skills.
And burnout as well.

117
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.630
So there are a lot of different flavors of stress and there are lot of symptoms

118
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.460
that can manifest itself.
Um,
but in general I would say that,

119
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.930
um,
stress,
uh,
you know,
there are different flavors of stress.

120
00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:36.820
Sometimes stress can be harnessed for good,
right?
If you don't have,
um,

121
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.270
some sort of deadline or if you don't have,
um,
um,

122
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.780
some sort of motivating factor,
it can be difficult to get things done,
right?

123
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:45.860
So there's,

124
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.030
there are two psychologists that Harvard that talked about performance and

125
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:51.860
correlating it with levels of stress.

126
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.380
And if you have too little amount of stress,

127
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.860
then you tend to be more bored and you tend to be too calm.

128
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.610
But if just the right amount of stress,
um,
or you stress,

129
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.720
you can achieve optimum performance,
you feel energized,
you feel focused,

130
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.910
work and feel like f can feel effortless or you might achieve that flow state.

131
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.360
But if you have too much stress,
then your performance can suffer.

132
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.020
This is something we call distress.
Where can lead to things like burnout,

133
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:22.380
fatigue,
exhaustion,
health issues too.
And burnout.

134
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.380
There are some components of burnout that can,
uh,
inform you whether,
you know,

135
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:29.900
you may be at risk to exhaustion,

136
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:34.930
cynicism and feeling like you nothing's really mattering and that,

137
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:37.250
and feeling like your work doesn't matter.

138
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:42.550
So exhaustion can include feelings of negativity.

139
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.050
You can't concentrate,
you're just kind of emotionally fatigued,
um,

140
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.070
and feeling incompetent.

141
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:54.100
That especially occurs if you don't have enough resources or if you don't have

142
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:58.350
clear expectations are you don't have good relationships with your coworkers or

143
00:08:58.351 --> 00:08:59.790
your family.
Uh,

144
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:04.230
and cynicism to feeling detached and negative feeling like it doesn't matter.

145
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.300
So combinations of these can lead to,
um,

146
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.930
can be a sign of burnout and stress.

147
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.410
This especially happens if you just happened to be a workaholic.

148
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.760
So I remember going through college that helped me go plow through a lot of

149
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:21.330
exams.
But then,
uh,
that's it to the point.

150
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.390
Sometimes people get this to an unhealthy state where they're working

151
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:27.900
excessively because things don't meet their standards.

152
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.400
Things aren't perfect enough.

153
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.780
There's also a different type of perfectionism where you just completely avoid

154
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.280
doing work and you end up procrastinating and avoiding touching,

155
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.440
touching that I'm inbox because you know that you can't get through inbox zero.

156
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.280
So it's very fascinating to learn about this.
Um,

157
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.500
this perfectionism and there are ways to address this as well.

158
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:57.990
When we see folks in clinic,
um,
uh,
we tried to come up with some sort of,

159
00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:58.853
um,

160
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:03.950
thought of as to what may be going on and what symptoms maybe closely matching

161
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:06.090
to a particular diagnosis.

162
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:10.560
And that just helps us sort of find the best sort of ways to treat these

163
00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:13.440
conditions.
Generalized anxiety is one of them.

164
00:10:13.441 --> 00:10:16.970
And generalized anxiety is when you feel like you're on edge almost.
Uh,
uh,

165
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.570
most of the time if you are maybe nervous or you can't control the worries,

166
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:27.530
you may feel like it is difficult to concentrate or you may be easily fatigued

167
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.820
to.
Um,
and that tends to happen with throughout the day.

168
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.770
So that's sort of anxiety throughout the day.

169
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.780
And then some folks have panic attacks where the anxiety spikes within just a

170
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.240
few minutes.
They feel like they're short of breath,

171
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.260
their heart rate goes up there shaking,
there's they're sweating.

172
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.820
I've seen this in classmates and a co Co colleagues as well.

173
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:56.180
And this can get to the point where you have maybe multiple panic attacks a day

174
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.470
and then you avoid things like driving because you don't know if you can drive

175
00:11:01.471 --> 00:11:03.090
in a car without getting a panic attack.

176
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:07.920
Some people have posttraumatic stress disorder and that's when you're exposed to

177
00:11:07.921 --> 00:11:11.580
something that is life threatening or very traumatic.

178
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:16.440
And then afterwards how you react to that stress,
um,
can,

179
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:17.160
uh,

180
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:22.160
determine whether you're able to function normally at work and at school and at

181
00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:26.820
home too.
So I've seen folks with major trauma in their lives,

182
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.180
but they're able to brush it off just fine.
They don't think about it,

183
00:11:30.181 --> 00:11:31.200
they don't get nightmares.

184
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:35.130
And then I see others who tell me that they faced a major trauma.

185
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.330
They get nightmares at night or maybe daytime nightmares or flashbacks.
Um,

186
00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:41.190
and they don't realize they have PTSD.

187
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:46.090
So this is something that I think is important to recognize in our peers and
our,

188
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.850
our ourselves too.
If this is something that we face growing up there,

189
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.580
just obsessive compulsive disorder where you,
you,

190
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.300
you can't get rid of thoughts,
uh,
they just keep on coming up in your mind.

191
00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.130
You know,
that they're not realistic,

192
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.530
but you got to figure out a way to get rid of them.

193
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.500
And then there are components where you're doing things over and over again,

194
00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:10.501
like washing your hands for a long period of time just to sort of feel better.

195
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.400
Or maybe you're checking locks for like an hour a day gets to the point where it

196
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:20.050
interferes with your life too.
So that's OCD,
that's another type of anxiety.

197
00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:25.090
Um,
so there's also addiction to where you take,

198
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.550
um,
substances and alcohol,
um,

199
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:33.460
and they have all sorts of different drugs that can cause different reactions.

200
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.900
Bottom line is that this is a brain disease.
Uh,
and this is where,
um,

201
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:42.990
folks may have an addiction and they may use it even though they know full well

202
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.040
that it's harmful to.
So this addiction,

203
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.420
the good news is that there's ways to treat this,
uh,

204
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.780
sort of this brain condition.
Um,

205
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.520
but it certainly recognizing it is an important first step.

206
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:02.530
So you may have seen questionnaires online that talk about,
you know,

207
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.620
do you mind my,
you have burnout or might you have depression?

208
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:10.030
And one of the questionnaires we have is the Phq nine patient health

209
00:13:10.031 --> 00:13:12.330
questionnaire with nine questions.
Um,

210
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.370
but this one is particularly for depression,

211
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:20.410
but there are all these issues that occur with the Phq nine and wouldn't you

212
00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:21.010
know,
it,

213
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.880
we have a whole manual called the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental

214
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:29.200
disorders that tries to help us diagnose and recognize these symptoms.

215
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.830
But realistically what we tried to do is look at the whole picture,

216
00:13:32.831 --> 00:13:34.930
someone's whole life and,

217
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:39.990
and the two inch book doesn't cover all of the possibilities sometimes.

218
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.380
So this is why I like to call what we've called the thousand cuts.
You know,

219
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.650
sometimes people are wounded by a thousand cuts.
Um,
so he might need,
um,

220
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.540
quite a few bandaids for those cuts.
Uh,

221
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.100
so recognizing those external drivers,

222
00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:57.850
all of these external things that can cause anxiety and stress is important.

223
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.670
And so that way you can know what the problem is.

224
00:14:00.671 --> 00:14:05.170
And then you can hack it if you need to.
So this is me in an outpatient clinic.

225
00:14:05.171 --> 00:14:09.380
I remember one of the folks that I came that came to see me,
um,

226
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.870
actually was having,
was very,
very stressed out.
Well what,
what kind of stress?

227
00:14:13.871 --> 00:14:17.250
Where are they facing?
They,
they were actually,
he,

228
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.310
he was actually hearing voices that weren't really there.
Uh,

229
00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:25.540
and it was because we had to ask,
you know,
how long has this been going on?

230
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:29.650
And he said,
well,
you know,
he hasn't been sleeping for a while.

231
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.570
Sleep affects your daytime performance,
your mood and your anxiety,

232
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.890
and that also in turn affects your sleep.
So we try to address the sleep first,

233
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.470
try to address the hallucinations that they're having.

234
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.600
Next time they came into clinic,

235
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.580
they came to see me and he said he still having them.
Um,
and I asked,

236
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:53.380
I dive deeper.
Why are they,
why were they anxious about why,
why,

237
00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.210
why were they,
uh,
uh,
not be able to sleep?
Actually,

238
00:14:56.211 --> 00:15:00.680
I gave the punchline and I'm already,
they would turn up.
They were very anxious.

239
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.110
What were they anxious about?

240
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.020
They were actually anxious about work turned out that they couldn't concentrate,

241
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.140
they couldn't focus at work,
they couldn't get the things done.

242
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.020
They were about to be laid off or fired.
Um,

243
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.580
and in talking with them further and digging deeper into these details,

244
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:22.090
found out that for their whole life he had been suffering through Adhd,

245
00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:26.810
actually not knowing,
not knowing the exact diagnosis or,

246
00:15:26.811 --> 00:15:28.010
and that it was treatable.

247
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.970
So we treated the Adhd and the next time they came to the clinic was the

248
00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:35.240
commerce I've ever seen,
um,
seen him.

249
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:40.280
And he was able to actually function quite well at work and be able to be able

250
00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:44.450
to sleep at night too,
just because we were able to dive deep into his details,

251
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.660
keeping on asking why is it this way?
Why is it this way?

252
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.510
And instead of just looking at the surface,

253
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:55.690
so knowing all of these things is important and we try to combine epidemiology,

254
00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:00.350
all these statistics,
one in five that that affects a lot of us in this room.

255
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.980
That doesn't quite help.
So we have to dive deeper into the details.

256
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:08.600
What if it's a cultural issue?
If you are Southeast Asian for instance,

257
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:09.920
um,
you know,

258
00:16:09.921 --> 00:16:14.540
could there be an issue such as coming from a family with,

259
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.480
um,
who immigrated from a war torn country?

260
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.240
Could that be a cultural issue?

261
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.410
So we try to combine this into some sort of framework.
Um,
so for instance,

262
00:16:24.411 --> 00:16:29.411
one particular framework is the bylaw bio psychosocial model where we look at

263
00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:30.830
the biology,

264
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:35.950
the psychology and the social factors that make up someone's someone,

265
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.540
um,
um,
and informed them on how,

266
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:43.570
how they behave or factors such as where's your family from was their trauma in

267
00:16:43.911 --> 00:16:45.770
their family.
And you know,
what,

268
00:16:45.771 --> 00:16:50.240
how do they react to adverse adversity?
Um,

269
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.290
do they have enough resilience to carry them through the day?

270
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:59.170
So we look at things like this through the lens of,
uh,

271
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:04.160
even say culture and religion to Southeast Asians for instance,

272
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.910
have a lot of ingrained elements of religion into their culture,

273
00:17:07.911 --> 00:17:12.380
like Confucianism and Buddhism that may prevent them from seeking help that they

274
00:17:12.381 --> 00:17:16.610
need.
And I mentioning this because I've done work amongst multiple Asian,

275
00:17:16.611 --> 00:17:18.640
southeast Asian cultures.
Um,

276
00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:23.960
things like accepting suffering too can be a major issue too,
when they're,

277
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:27.890
when you're trying to help somebody and they're not telling you exactly or

278
00:17:27.891 --> 00:17:30.440
they're not filling the questionnaire out.
Correct.
You know,

279
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.140
to reflect their own internal reality.
Um,
things like,
um,

280
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:36.130
external PR.

281
00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:40.520
So not just the internal pressures by external pressures and society's

282
00:17:40.521 --> 00:17:44.240
expectations of them.
So for instance,
in South East Asian cultures,

283
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.210
there's an enormous pressure to perform,
to be perfect,

284
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:52.390
to be that sort of Wiz kid that's being talked about in popular press,

285
00:17:53.521 --> 00:17:56.070
like Time magazine.
Um,
and,
uh,

286
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.170
and can you achieve success or are,

287
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:03.260
is there something that's preventing you from achieving that success?
Um,

288
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.490
so recognizing as important.
Um,

289
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:09.570
and there are all sorts of other things to recognize that even within

290
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.860
subcultures too,

291
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.490
you can't always assume that there's a blanket sort of stereotype.

292
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:18.270
So for instance,
um,
among particular populations,

293
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.690
some Southeast Asian cultures don't finish high school.

294
00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.170
There had been a large number of foreclosures during the great recession,

295
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.910
longterm unemployment that can affect,
um,
particular subgroups.
Um,

296
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:34.920
you know,
uh,
in the United States,
environmental factors can be an issue.

297
00:18:34.921 --> 00:18:38.070
If you've been exposed to a lot of trauma,
violence and neglect,

298
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.400
abuse or poverty can make put you at higher risk.

299
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.090
The things that happen or don't happen in childhood,
the number of parents,

300
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.100
the amount of time your parents were around,

301
00:18:47.101 --> 00:18:52.101
how much family were around medical conditions too and abuse to um,

302
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:56.390
or our school issues,
teacher issues,
um,

303
00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:01.490
and bullies as well too can also inform the way you react to adverse events,

304
00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:06.660
to relationships.
This can be a sensitive subject.

305
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:11.610
Things like interpersonal violence and how unstable or stable relationship is

306
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:16.820
and whether you're supported or unsupported through your preferences and your

307
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.090
desire for a relationship can be a factor.

308
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.670
And then finally,
um,

309
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.810
two other things by biology can be something that can be an issue.

310
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.200
So medical conditions,
the way your brain is set up,

311
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.150
the way your brain is structured too.

312
00:19:33.151 --> 00:19:36.480
If there's any sort of trauma that had happened,

313
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:40.860
physical trauma to happen to the brain,
thyroid conditions,

314
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.280
a lot of things can cause anxiety and stress.

315
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:49.260
Even the medicines that we take can come with some,
some of side effects as well.

316
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:54.450
Um,
and you know how the Amygdala to is structured,

317
00:19:54.451 --> 00:19:59.451
the Amygdala is the emotional center of the brain up here that processes all

318
00:19:59.881 --> 00:20:01.080
these sensory inputs.

319
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.950
And if it senses any sort of things that it perceives as a threat,

320
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:09.780
it can cause all these things to happen.
Your body and increased heart rate,

321
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.350
increased blood pressure,
you might be on edge a lot.
Um,

322
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.850
you might freeze to and you might not be thinking correctly.

323
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:21.750
So just imagine if you had a lot of sort of stressful situations at work and

324
00:20:21.751 --> 00:20:25.650
you're constantly on edge,
you're ag Migdal,
that would be,
um,

325
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.650
you know,
on fire all the time too.

326
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.850
So being able to handle this is important too,

327
00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:35.280
as well as the psychology and how you,

328
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.330
how you react and how you behave too.
So for instance,

329
00:20:39.331 --> 00:20:42.420
there are some personality factors such as self esteem,

330
00:20:42.421 --> 00:20:45.140
which we talked about earlier.
Things like how,

331
00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.840
how well you deal with stress and,
uh,

332
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.750
if you're a generally pessimistic to that can affect the way that you behave
too.

333
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.080
So that's why I think that,
um,
you know,

334
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.450
there isn't a magic bullet treatment right now.

335
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:03.430
There are all these things that you can address and knowing which knobs,

336
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:08.110
which buttons to push and which things to adjust can be helpful and important in

337
00:21:08.111 --> 00:21:12.220
your life if you're trying to sort of reduce your anxiety and reduce your
stress.

338
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.360
So the hacks,
right?
Um,
I think of this in terms of you know,

339
00:21:16.361 --> 00:21:17.970
computer programming.
Um,

340
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.240
when you're trying to program something or some sort of large structure,

341
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.100
there's multiple ways of doing this.

342
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.470
You might be doing this in an iterative fashion,
right?

343
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.120
Cause you're continuously changing.

344
00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:32.770
The code are continuously improving the product to um,
programming.

345
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.300
There is no one magic solution.

346
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.070
If you go to stack overflow and you're trying to find the answers to your

347
00:21:39.071 --> 00:21:41.500
question,
there are many different ways to,

348
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:46.470
to hack that python script for instance.
Um,
it's uh,
you have to research this,

349
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.020
you have to implement,
test it in your life too and deploy.

350
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:53.920
And if some of you are in sales or management a more,

351
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.650
it's sometimes difficult to understand,
okay,

352
00:21:56.651 --> 00:22:00.940
how am I going to achieve that milestone or get that deliverable when there are

353
00:22:00.941 --> 00:22:04.330
all these other market conditions,
new regulations in DC.

354
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:09.700
And around the world that can be changing the way you practice.
Um,
um,

355
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:14.410
and um,
developing your product.
So therefore,
particular hacks,

356
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.060
you know,
that,
uh,

357
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.750
I'd like to go over this is just a menu of different ways you can address some

358
00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:22.270
of those conditions earlier.
Um,

359
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.390
and so you can cherry pick the ones that you think will work for you.

360
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.650
Try One a week or try one every two weeks to see if it works.

361
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:33.760
We're going to talk about hacking your mind,
hacking your body,

362
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.210
hacking your time,
and hacking your social life.
And of course,

363
00:22:37.211 --> 00:22:40.480
there's all these other ways you can hack the rest of your life,

364
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:44.710
hacking your transportation or hacking your sleep too.

365
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:49.840
But first,
hacking your mind,
how you think,
how you feel and how you act,

366
00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:54.610
um,
can be helpful when you're dealing with stress and anxiety.
So,

367
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.160
uh,
out,
I think I had alluded this,

368
00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:01.790
alluded to this earlier to anxiety is something I definitely face,
uh,

369
00:23:01.791 --> 00:23:04.420
myself.
Um,
feeling like,
oh,

370
00:23:04.421 --> 00:23:09.370
I got to do something and feeling a little nervous,
right?
Um,
and 20 years ago,

371
00:23:09.371 --> 00:23:13.810
again,
being in front of a crowd,
um,
and talking,
um,

372
00:23:13.811 --> 00:23:16.750
was quite nerve wracking.
So I did something,
I did some,

373
00:23:16.751 --> 00:23:21.370
a series of experiments over the past,
uh,
um,
you know,
throughout my life,

374
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:26.530
exposing myself to stress and exposing myself to be little bits of stress

375
00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:30.340
initially and go and getting larger and larger each time.

376
00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.580
I remember teaching a python helps session.

377
00:23:33.581 --> 00:23:37.270
This wasn't sorta har teaching of Aaron and some other folks from the computer

378
00:23:37.271 --> 00:23:41.350
science undergraduate association and teaching a small group of undergraduates

379
00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.250
teaching,
um,
and toastmasters.
So while I was a software engineer,

380
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.960
I was,
I joined other folks from the engineering,
uh,

381
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:53.900
engineering teams to,
um,
join toastmasters,

382
00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:58.901
which is a group of peers who help each other out in terms of improving public

383
00:24:00.051 --> 00:24:04.430
speaking to,
and then from there I was able to,
uh,

384
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:09.140
uh,
handle sensitive conversations,
so to speak,
not just speaking in public,

385
00:24:09.141 --> 00:24:12.110
but speaking with sensitive,
um,

386
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:17.380
people speaking in under sensitive conditions with families in the surgical Icu

387
00:24:18.321 --> 00:24:22.250
and then the psychiatric intensive care unit speaking in a business setting.

388
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.320
So I attended,
I think I told Gloria this,

389
00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.980
I spoke with specifically joined a business school because I wanted to learn how

390
00:24:27.981 --> 00:24:31.910
to speak in front of a professional crowd,
uh,
and,

391
00:24:31.911 --> 00:24:36.860
and learning how to handle an advocate for,
um,

392
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.650
projects,
uh,
in front of a professional crowd.

393
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.860
And then this went on to hackathons.
Um,
and,
uh,

394
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:49.220
learning how to pitch for instance was very helpful,
was very helpful.

395
00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:52.970
This was my exposure therapy.
Um,
and other people do this too,

396
00:24:52.971 --> 00:24:57.080
if you have any particular fears.
Uh,
and so fear of heights,

397
00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.330
fear of enclosed spaces,

398
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.390
that's where exposure therapy can be very helpful.

399
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:06.570
There's another type of therapy that's been very helpful.
Um,

400
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.520
and that's where you'd kind of delete any sort of negative self talk or delete

401
00:25:10.521 --> 00:25:14.540
any sort of negative behaviors and their particular ways to do this.

402
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:19.070
And the most common form is through something called cognitive behavioral

403
00:25:19.071 --> 00:25:20.810
therapy or CBT.

404
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.140
And CBT is basically where you take your thoughts,

405
00:25:24.141 --> 00:25:29.141
your cognitions and your thoughts informed the way you feel and how you feel

406
00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:33.800
informs the way you behave or informs the,
uh,
issue.

407
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:39.160
And so these sort of our effect each other and how you changed your behavior or

408
00:25:40.101 --> 00:25:43.160
how you change your thoughts can affect how you feel.

409
00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.600
So if we were trying to adjust the behavior,
identifying the behavior,

410
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:52.870
then decreasing the negative and increasing the positive aspects can,

411
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:57.140
is something that you can coach yourself to do.
So for instance,

412
00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.470
if you feel bad or you feel angry,
um,

413
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:05.240
or down because they were trying to find a job or trying to find a new project,

414
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:06.620
you might be telling yourself,

415
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.920
I'm never going to get the job and you feel bad at or about it,

416
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:13.670
then it may actually discourage you and you start trying to apply for jobs.

417
00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:17.480
If you are,
say,
having a difficult time with a coworker,

418
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.830
a during a sensitive meeting and you,
you might think,
oh gosh,

419
00:26:21.831 --> 00:26:24.620
my colleague hates me,
then you might feel angry about this.

420
00:26:24.621 --> 00:26:27.680
You might blame them and they might end up giving them the cold shoulder.

421
00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:32.300
Or you might be in front of a large audience and you might say,
oh,

422
00:26:32.301 --> 00:26:36.200
my talk at Google is going to fail.
Uh,
and you might feel scared.

423
00:26:36.201 --> 00:26:39.110
And then you might end up avoiding public speaking entirely.

424
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:43.830
And so the key thing here is the avoidance avoidance.

425
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.700
And the uh,
is something that you want to address.

426
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:52.730
You want to change the behavior because a little bit of stress is a good thing.

427
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:58.200
Um,
the stresses and the issues that the behavior and how you react to it.

428
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.200
Now there are some positive,
um,

429
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.220
positive self talk that you want to promote.

430
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.420
So if you know,
hey,
I'm a,
I'm a,
I'm a pretty decent coder,
I can,

431
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.960
I can hack this code,
you know,
you might feel good about it.

432
00:27:12.961 --> 00:27:17.640
That might encourage you to do more check ins or take on more projects.
And,

433
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:22.400
and so this is the kind of thing you want to promote to a,
in your own,
um,

434
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:27.600
your own loops to use a watch Westworld reference.
Um,
so there's,

435
00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.450
uh,
there's another way to address this,
you know,

436
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.230
with the thoughts to you can change your thoughts.
And so if just the behavior,

437
00:27:34.231 --> 00:27:37.170
but thinking about the thoughts,
um,
oftentimes,
you know,

438
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.080
I just used that catastrophic example of,
oh gosh,

439
00:27:40.081 --> 00:27:45.030
this Google talk is talk at Google is going to fail a massively and people are

440
00:27:45.031 --> 00:27:47.790
going to point at me and laugh at me and that's a catastrophe.

441
00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:49.920
That's the worst case scenario we can think of.

442
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:54.660
So train yourself to think about other scenarios that could happen can be

443
00:27:54.661 --> 00:27:58.780
helpful.
Um,
and uh,
we use this in decision analysis in,

444
00:27:58.781 --> 00:28:00.390
in the business world.
Um,

445
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:04.560
so thinking about the best case scenario or the best case is getting to reach as

446
00:28:04.561 --> 00:28:05.700
many people as possible,

447
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.780
helping them out and everyone's anxiety and stress goes away.
That'll be awesome,

448
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.680
right?
What is the most likely scenario?
Well,
maybe some place in between.

449
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.910
So this sort of technique can be helpful in modulating a modular and your

450
00:28:17.911 --> 00:28:22.620
expectations in your,
and catastrophic thinking too.
So you can try this yourself.

451
00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:26.340
There are a lot of books out there about cognitive behavioral therapy.

452
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:31.200
There are also apps,
audio books and guides.
And if you do see a therapist,

453
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:31.771
you know,

454
00:28:31.771 --> 00:28:36.771
can find one that specifically addresses cognitive behavioral therapy to being

455
00:28:37.231 --> 00:28:40.500
present in the moment,
it can be also helpful too.
Um,

456
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.280
so these are some worksheets you can get.
Uh,

457
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:48.260
online to being present in the moment can be helpful.
Um,

458
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.750
because a lot of anxiety is just dwelling on the future,

459
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:54.840
being worried about what the future holds,

460
00:28:54.841 --> 00:28:56.940
thinking about all the bad things that could happen.

461
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.850
Eckhart Tolle wrote in the power of now that all negativity is caused by,

462
00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.200
um,
can be caused by denial of the presence.
So not focusing on the present,

463
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.160
but being worried about too much of the future and not enough of the present

464
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:12.023
moment.

465
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.430
So there are ways to introduce that presence in your life.
For instance,

466
00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:22.170
mindfulness meditation may have heard these terms,
um,
talked about a lot.

467
00:29:22.171 --> 00:29:24.240
There are lots of different ways to go about it.

468
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:29.540
Mindfulness is where you're aware of things outside your body of the external.

469
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:34.080
Um,
your senses are alive.
So for instance,

470
00:29:34.081 --> 00:29:39.081
you may be focused on the present moment of your environment,

471
00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.500
the sounds in the room.
Um,
breathing,

472
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:45.940
breathing to meditation is where you try to decrease the mental chatter,

473
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:50.390
the monkey mind,
Nicole and Buddhism,
and allowing the thoughts that you,

474
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:55.360
that pop up in your mind to float by like clouds.
And so this has been very,
uh,

475
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.470
very prevalent,

476
00:29:56.471 --> 00:30:01.060
especially in entrepreneurial entrepreneurs and CEOs who,

477
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:04.840
um,
who want to sort of achieve that focus.

478
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.370
So this is one particular hack.

479
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:10.960
Self acceptance is something that's also important to living in the present

480
00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:15.670
moment requires that you accept the way you are at the moment and,

481
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:20.230
and,
uh,
not be a doormat and not let other people walk over you.
Um,

482
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:25.500
I myself had the sheds in the past where I felt like I should be working on this

483
00:30:25.541 --> 00:30:29.200
website or I should be working on this research project and I've been taught

484
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.310
that a few sources I shouldn't should on myself.
Um,

485
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.320
accepting your anxiety and stress to and accepting that,
hey,
there's anxiety.
Um,

486
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.880
what can you do about this?

487
00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:43.900
And not letting it define you can be helpful in your journey towards self

488
00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:46.630
acceptance.
And then gratitude.

489
00:30:46.631 --> 00:30:51.631
Practicing gratitude can help you reframe negative thoughts and be in and sort

490
00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:56.050
of that cycle of negativity and allow you to think about what's positive in your

491
00:30:56.051 --> 00:30:57.670
life.
For instance,

492
00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.640
each day you could think about three things that you're grateful for,

493
00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:05.790
whether it's a coworker or whether it's one particular aspect of your work or

494
00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:10.330
even yourself to are there particular things that you're grateful for,
um,
that,

495
00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.300
uh,
that,
uh,
that you can appreciate.

496
00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.790
Storing it somewhere and reviewing it at,

497
00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:19.530
during stressful times can be very helpful to,
um,

498
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.350
so that when you're feeling down,
then you can look back and see,
uh,

499
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:25.270
the things that you're grateful for.

500
00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:29.710
And I've been able to use this in my own practice.
And then finally,

501
00:31:29.711 --> 00:31:33.730
during stressful situations there techniques like the freeze frame technique

502
00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:38.360
where if you're in the moment of acute anxiety or anger,
um,

503
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.470
you've just be able to recognize that moment.

504
00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:46.770
Try to step away from that moment focused on breathing so that you can separate

505
00:31:47.471 --> 00:31:49.000
yourself from that stressful moment.

506
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.530
You can think about a body particular body part or the heart and then trying to

507
00:31:53.531 --> 00:31:55.030
think of a positive feeling.

508
00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:58.090
And then reflecting on whether you can change the scenario,

509
00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:02.470
is there a better alternative towards thinking and more constructive alternative

510
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.000
towards thinking that way?

511
00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:09.370
So this is something that will require some practice I think.
But um,
certainly,

512
00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:12.100
um,
this has been talked about in the business literature,

513
00:32:12.101 --> 00:32:14.500
in the Harvard Business Review on stress.

514
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:23.120
Um,
and final,
uh,
final note.
Um,
you know,
a lot of the techniques,

515
00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:27.740
um,
can be difficult to remember.
I think if you are,

516
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:30.200
there's all these different techniques that are out there,

517
00:32:30.201 --> 00:32:33.170
all these different hacks,
sometimes apps can be helpful.

518
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:36.200
This is something that we've been looking at at the American psychiatric

519
00:32:36.201 --> 00:32:40.880
association and I definitely don't want to say I endorse any of them,

520
00:32:40.881 --> 00:32:44.930
but you can just try them out of these are low cost sort of ways to sort of

521
00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:48.890
achieve,
um,
you know,
implement these in your life too.

522
00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.740
I think that,
um,

523
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:57.320
what's exciting too is hacking your body can be helpful to your body and your

524
00:32:57.321 --> 00:33:02.060
mind are intertwined.
And it's fascinating because I found that,

525
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.650
um,
uh,
making sure that I treat myself well,
uh,

526
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.120
and practice self care is important.

527
00:33:08.121 --> 00:33:12.830
And I actually gained clarity and I got to say even a year ago,
um,
my,

528
00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:16.130
I wasn't this,
I really wasn't this way a year ago.

529
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.460
I had a BMI or body mass index over 30,

530
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:22.070
so I was considered medically obese.

531
00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:26.450
And it wasn't until I learned about all of these health issues in my family.
Um,

532
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:31.480
and then potential surgery coming up that I realized that I needed to act on

533
00:33:31.701 --> 00:33:35.720
this and sort of work on cutting down my obese,
my obesity.

534
00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.800
So I looked at two things,
diet and exercise.
But how you do it,

535
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:44.120
there's so many different hacks and ways to achieve that.
And I think that,
um,

536
00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:48.470
you know,
the ones that seem to have helped the most is focusing on more of a

537
00:33:48.471 --> 00:33:50.730
Mediterranean diet.
Uh,
this,

538
00:33:50.731 --> 00:33:54.800
this particular one is where you're focusing on more whole grains,
foods,

539
00:33:54.801 --> 00:33:59.720
plant based foods instead of the more Western Diet Starches,

540
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.810
fried foods and sort of processed foods too.

541
00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:07.760
And in the scientific literature we're seeing more that following these diets

542
00:34:07.761 --> 00:34:12.380
can be helpful in reducing your risk of depression and reducing your risk of a

543
00:34:12.381 --> 00:34:14.130
feeling down.
Um,

544
00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:18.800
when we're looking at things like fiber to having a high fiber content can

545
00:34:18.801 --> 00:34:23.780
increase and can decrease your odds of getting depression and also,

546
00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:28.160
um,
helping out with your gut bacteria.
And we're finding out more and more that,

547
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:29.000
um,

548
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
the fiber in food and plants can help promote healthy,

549
00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:35.210
uh,
uh,

550
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:40.210
colonies of bacteria to grow within your gastrointestinal tract to fiber.

551
00:34:40.641 --> 00:34:44.060
And then also probiotics.
A lot of folks are making a big deal out of this.

552
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:48.410
I think that the studies aren't really,
um,
uh,

553
00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.830
for anxiety and depression are more in rat models and mouse models.

554
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:56.420
But certainly there's a lot of claims out there right now.

555
00:34:56.421 --> 00:35:00.620
They're saying that probiotics should be nicknamed a psychobiotics because they

556
00:35:00.621 --> 00:35:02.750
do change the way we think.

557
00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:06.830
We already know that they can lower fasting glucose and decrease blood pressure.

558
00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.030
Uh,
and again,

559
00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:12.740
in mass models it does reduce anxiety and depression related behaviors.

560
00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.400
So it's spawning a whole new area of research,
uh,

561
00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:20.760
about the gut and the brain and seeing how these,
what we,

562
00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:26.020
what we eat and how we treat our gut can affect the way our brain functions

563
00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.493
through,
uh,

564
00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:31.820
metabolites through neurotransmitters like serotonin through bacterial

565
00:35:31.821 --> 00:35:34.790
molecules.
So it's very interesting.
Um,

566
00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:39.240
this particular physician and Columbia University has been talking about

567
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:40.890
nutritional psychiatry,

568
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:44.460
a nutritional mental health and how it can affect your mood.

569
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:48.930
And so he's been discussing the scientific literature behind,
uh,
uh,

570
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:53.550
eating right and having a better mood exercise.
Uh,

571
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:58.440
this is my,
uh,
futilely trying to use the elliptical.
Um,

572
00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.350
and there are different ways to hack a exercise.

573
00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:05.520
I've tried to do this by commuting,
by bicycle,
for instance.
Um,

574
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:10.200
both in southern California,
believe it or not,
and northern California.
Uh,

575
00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:14.970
and finally I found that group exercise really helps me because my mirror now I

576
00:36:14.971 --> 00:36:17.060
feel like my mirror neurons,
which are,
um,

577
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:21.270
this concept where you're sort of able to mimic other people and sort of feel

578
00:36:21.271 --> 00:36:23.360
what other people are feeling.
Uh,

579
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:27.360
our most active because I feel like exercising when other people around me are

580
00:36:27.361 --> 00:36:30.660
exercising too.
So I've been able to,

581
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.820
I've been fortunate enough to use,
uh,
apps with Google,
Google fit,

582
00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:40.290
um,
on tracking my calories and tracking the nutrients and I've been able to see

583
00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:43.290
results and I've lost 30 pounds,
which is awesome.
Over this past half year,

584
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:48.150
if I've noticed that,
um,
their rewards,
I've had to buy new clothes,

585
00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:52.850
um,
my energy's higher,
I see results,
but I'm also,
uh,

586
00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:57.480
uh,
I also have,
uh,
not just the rewards but also fear,
um,

587
00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.400
of say upcoming,
uh,

588
00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:04.650
upcoming surgery and societal expectations as well too.

589
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:08.670
So could you use that to harness yourself and motivate yourself to do more

590
00:37:08.671 --> 00:37:12.840
productive behaviors?
Yes,
it's kind of Nice as a kind of a negative thought,

591
00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:17.100
but it's been helpful for me too.
So hacking your body,

592
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:19.680
hacking your mind.
How about hacking your time?

593
00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:24.480
Time is something that's really precious to us and it's interesting to see,

594
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:29.940
um,
a lot of business articles about this.

595
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:32.850
But one of the most,
uh,
uh,

596
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:36.720
most salient quotes I think is from this speaker who also spoke at talks by

597
00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:40.920
Google or I mean Satie who's a New York Times bestselling author.

598
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.510
He says that,

599
00:37:42.511 --> 00:37:46.380
show me a man's calendar and spending and I'll show you what he prioritizes.

600
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.880
So show me your time,
show me your,
how you spend your money,

601
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.430
and then it kind of shows you where your priorities lie.

602
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.760
So just imagine if you took your calendar and plotted out every single hour of

603
00:38:00.031 --> 00:38:02.230
your day and ranking was,

604
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:06.180
was this productive and does it make me feel good?

605
00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:10.800
Do I feel like I have a lot of energy or value from this hour that I spent two?

606
00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.890
And I remember doing this even with my old devices.

607
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:17.600
This is shows you how old I am.
I used to someone,
the Palmer was,

608
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.500
I've been thinking about this for over a decade.
Uh,
this is the tap wave,

609
00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:23.970
PDA.
And even,
uh,

610
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:29.090
I tried the most skin notebooks and printing calendars out to people have all

611
00:38:29.401 --> 00:38:32.100
sorts of different ways of how they track their time.

612
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:36.370
But I think that the most fundamental thing,
um,
they,
you know,

613
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.080
the calendar's change.

614
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:42.100
I think you've deployed Google tasks and new version of Google tasks a week or

615
00:38:42.101 --> 00:38:45.070
two ago.
Um,
which is exciting,
but every year,

616
00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.860
every two years I think I'm finding myself using different tools.

617
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:52.420
But the bottom line is being able to take all the worries and all the anxiety

618
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.190
out of your head using an external brain and allowing that external brain to

619
00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:02.200
deal of the worries is important.
And I think no one talks a better,

620
00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:04.000
no one talks about this better than uh,

621
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:08.740
David Allen who talks about the art of stress free productivity and he actually

622
00:39:08.741 --> 00:39:13.420
has an algorithm in his book and you can find this algorithm online too about

623
00:39:13.421 --> 00:39:18.370
how you can get tasks,
get the words out of your head,
email,
etc.

624
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:21.010
And how to sort of a do it,

625
00:39:21.011 --> 00:39:26.011
delegate it or defer it as he says as the actions and placing them into lists,

626
00:39:26.111 --> 00:39:29.710
calendars and folders,
being able to worry about it,

627
00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:33.940
letting something else worry about it and putting your anxieties somewhere else

628
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.500
can be very,
very helpful.

629
00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:40.450
And then also controlling are focusing on your locus of control.

630
00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:45.010
Um,
can be helpful and not on things outside your control.

631
00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:50.050
So people have talked about things like the information diet and blocking off

632
00:39:50.051 --> 00:39:50.920
things that they don't,

633
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:55.950
they can't control social media news sources instead checking them maybe even

634
00:39:56.291 --> 00:39:58.480
once a day or even once a week.

635
00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:03.540
Two to minimize that stressor to say no to Fomo can be a really difficult,

636
00:40:05.021 --> 00:40:06.340
especially here in San Francisco.

637
00:40:06.341 --> 00:40:09.250
I think there's so many different activities that happen every day.

638
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:14.110
And fomo if you're,
um,
if you,
uh,
if you don't know if you're,

639
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:15.790
um,
uh,

640
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:21.030
if the fear of missing out and being able to recognize the fear of missing out,

641
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.770
identifying if the or applies to social media or conference events.

642
00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.210
If you're at a conference,
I mean,

643
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:31.930
I think some of you have had that where there are seven concurrent tracks going

644
00:40:31.931 --> 00:40:35.610
on and you're,
you got to choose to and you know,

645
00:40:35.611 --> 00:40:39.640
you don't know where to turn to and that can lead to a lot of fomo too.

646
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:43.660
So being able to recognize that Fomo,
setting limits,

647
00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:48.250
setting boundaries too can be helpful.
So you set up.
So you tell yourself,

648
00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:53.280
I will dedicate three hours to eight hours of just conference time and then I

649
00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:59.050
deserve to have a two hour break or I deserve to have drinks with friends later

650
00:40:59.051 --> 00:40:59.884
on too.

651
00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:03.880
So thinking about those options and seeing what's most appealing to you and

652
00:41:03.881 --> 00:41:06.310
being content with it can be helpful too,

653
00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:10.270
especially in the work environment,
especially in the home environment.

654
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:12.400
Blocking off time for productive,

655
00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:17.530
productive time to productively play is important so that you can sort of let

656
00:41:17.531 --> 00:41:18.730
your mind wander,

657
00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:23.230
get those Aha moments when you're in the shower or if you're on nature hikes to

658
00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:28.340
sleep.
Blocking often enough time for sleep can be helpful too.
Um,

659
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:33.510
there's a whole art to hacking sleep that I talk about with my patients I treat

660
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:38.000
and trying to help them with their sleeping.
Um,

661
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.640
and then pets to,
um,
this particular

662
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:46.590
dog has helped my family as well,
uh,
with,
uh,

663
00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:51.570
with our anxieties and stress levels.
And then finally,
um,

664
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:56.790
to looking at how you structure your time blocks to can be helpful.
Um,
the,

665
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:58.400
there's the pomodoro method.

666
00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:02.390
This is something similar to the pomodoro method where you do a lot of hard work

667
00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:06.890
and activity and then you take a break deliberately for say 10 minutes.

668
00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.640
You just kind of check out,
relax,
surrender,

669
00:42:10.641 --> 00:42:14.690
control that your mind wandered and then dive back in when you need to.

670
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:19.880
So some people use 10 minutes and people use whole night for sleep or showering.

671
00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.430
Um,
that's protect one particular technique.

672
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.900
And there's a similar technique that I've used called the pomodoro technique,
um,

673
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.823
that,
um,

674
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.150
that can help that help me sustain focus with a timer.

675
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:36.650
How can your social life is also one of the final hacks?

676
00:42:36.651 --> 00:42:41.420
I will talk about how we can choose your tribe can be very important to,
um,

677
00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:46.640
the thing I try to remind myself is now in our professional circles and our

678
00:42:46.641 --> 00:42:47.720
personal circles,

679
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:52.670
you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with,
right?

680
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:57.700
You basically adopted the decision making habits of the people you hang out

681
00:42:58.011 --> 00:43:00.950
with,
you,
um,
attain their knowledge.

682
00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:05.630
We talk about strong ties and we ties in networking networks and social

683
00:43:05.631 --> 00:43:08.150
networks.
And so these are the strong ties.

684
00:43:08.151 --> 00:43:10.900
And how and who you choose can,
um,

685
00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.120
can be helpful to your life too.

686
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:19.270
So you want to choose positive people who are givers and who are not takers.

687
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:22.310
There's a fascinating book by Adam Grant,

688
00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:27.540
give and take that talks about how he's found people who are generous and how

689
00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:31.730
they're able to focus on the greater good and how they're able to benefit people

690
00:43:31.731 --> 00:43:36.050
in their network instead of people who just take things for themselves and sort

691
00:43:36.051 --> 00:43:39.470
of use other people,
uh,
and walk over them like doormats.

692
00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:44.280
And so being a giver can be helpful in setting the tone for the rest of the,
the,

693
00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.920
your colleagues and your friends.

694
00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:51.070
We also want to avoid burnout or bending over backwards too much and letting

695
00:43:51.381 --> 00:43:55.730
other people use you to celebrating wins is important too.

696
00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:59.810
And you know,
I think that this is something I don't see too much,

697
00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:05.630
not used as much in the medical world because we're so,
so busy.

698
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:08.660
But I,
I've noticed that even in during stressful times,

699
00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:13.520
leaders will reward people even with a simple thank you too.
Thank you.

700
00:44:13.521 --> 00:44:16.790
I'm grateful to you for your work.
Uh,
can,

701
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:20.660
can really lift people's spirits and it's very,
very inexpensive.

702
00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:25.510
Showing gratitude to yourself to celebrating who you are,
can and,

703
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:26.130
and,

704
00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:31.130
and your strengths can help change the way you view yourself if you have self

705
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:31.973
esteem issues.

706
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.090
And then s and then trying to decrease destructive criticism and destructive

707
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:39.510
negative self talk.
Um,
what,
what,
uh,

708
00:44:39.511 --> 00:44:43.500
this has been helpful to me because,
um,
in,
in my line of work,

709
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:45.570
we make new best friends every two weeks.

710
00:44:45.571 --> 00:44:49.020
So every two weeks there's a different project or there's a different hospital

711
00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:53.100
or a different clinic that we go to.
Um,
think of them just like Pokemon.

712
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:55.750
Pokemon is where,
you know,

713
00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:00.800
folks are able to collect and categorize and lay and find out strengths.

714
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.740
People strengthen their own.
Pokemon strength is so two,

715
00:45:04.741 --> 00:45:09.570
you want to do this with anyone you meet,
uh,
any,
uh,
you know,
friends,

716
00:45:09.571 --> 00:45:10.830
family.
Um,

717
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:15.950
and I've been able to adopt this system in my contacts list,

718
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:19.650
um,
tagging folks by location,
how I met them.

719
00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:24.150
Because one of the biggest anxieties I have is when I meet someone again for the

720
00:45:24.151 --> 00:45:28.320
second time or the third time,
I completely forget.
How did I meet them?

721
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:32.760
What did they like?
I,
you know,
I,
I,
I forget their names too.
Um,

722
00:45:32.761 --> 00:45:36.420
so using these techniques can be helpful and there are whole books have been

723
00:45:36.421 --> 00:45:41.280
written such as this one never eat alone by Keith Ferrazzi that talks about

724
00:45:41.281 --> 00:45:46.140
these sort of hacks.
Um,
so lots of different hats.
We talked,

725
00:45:46.141 --> 00:45:46.974
we've talked about,

726
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.760
I want to leave you with one final thought is that if,
uh,

727
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:55.510
there are so many different hacks out there is,
um,

728
00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:59.940
a lot of fun actually to sort of figure out how you can boost yourself,

729
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:03.150
how you can make yourself feel better,
less anxious,
less stress.

730
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:08.420
And I'm glad to see that the mainstream media and mainstream blogs are talking

731
00:46:08.431 --> 00:46:11.190
about these topics.
Buzzfeed,
for instance,

732
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:15.000
has talked about mental health issues,
business coaches.

733
00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:17.850
This is one of my mentors and colleagues,
Preston knee,

734
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:22.830
who's talked about not just a east and west Asian American professionals,

735
00:46:22.831 --> 00:46:27.580
but now he's looking at personality and how it informs communication,
uh,

736
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:32.630
with difficult people and narcissist to and professionals in my sphere of work

737
00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:37.950
physicians,
which includes a psychiatrists,
psychologists,

738
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:42.900
social workers and marriage and family therapists are trained to listen,

739
00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:43.560
uh,

740
00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:48.560
in a nonjudgmental way and be able to offer guidance to help you navigate

741
00:46:49.021 --> 00:46:53.940
through rough waters.
And,
uh,
there are,
there's medicines too.

742
00:46:53.941 --> 00:46:57.970
If things get really severe,
you can do the one,
two punch.
I tell my,
uh,

743
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.370
the folks I,
I help out,
there's talk therapy and there's metacenter therapy.

744
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:06.420
There are pros and cons to each one and they all act in different lengths of

745
00:47:06.421 --> 00:47:07.830
time too.

746
00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.520
And so we're here to help you navigate those waters.

747
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:16.730
And then there are lots of different groups out there,
advocacy groups.
Um,

748
00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.710
Naomi for instance,
this,
the national lines and mental illness,

749
00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:24.480
but I want to highlight the anxiety and depression association of America,
Ada.

750
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:29.350
They've got some really cool charts on how you can figure out what kind of is

751
00:47:29.351 --> 00:47:33.040
best.
Um,
and what kind of therapy you might like.

752
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:37.630
And they talk about things like,
um,
fomo and Ada and,

753
00:47:37.631 --> 00:47:41.050
and uh,
also ADHD I believe too.
Um,

754
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:45.370
and then if you're interested in technology,
this is a,
we're here at Google.
Um,

755
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:48.880
there are a lot of technology events that are around mental health.

756
00:47:48.881 --> 00:47:50.470
And so if you wanted to hack with us,

757
00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.680
you can join us at the American psychiatric association.

758
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:56.320
The American telemedicine association has their own group.

759
00:47:56.530 --> 00:48:00.760
And then the hackathon that we had met at Gloria Hack mental health,

760
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:04.700
they have an upcoming hackathon in early June two,
and it's very,

761
00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.840
and it's a very easy to join too.

762
00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:13.290
So we've talked about how we can cover the signs and symptoms and recognize them

763
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:18.480
and how we can hack different aspects of your life for your own mental wellbeing

764
00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.630
and how you can power up.

765
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:24.750
But we just wanted to underscore how important it is for us to normalize this

766
00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:30.130
and talk about the subject.
So if we're able to talk about this swap techniques,

767
00:48:30.131 --> 00:48:31.060
share techniques,

768
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:35.410
and how we can improve our own lives and the lives of people around us,

769
00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:40.110
that is,
that will be an amazing outcome I think for the,

770
00:48:40.111 --> 00:48:44.750
so I'm happy to send a summary and some bonus material.
Um,

771
00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:46.240
thank you for having me.

772
00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:52.030
<v 3>Thank you so much.
This is very informative.</v>

773
00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:55.760
I learned a lot and I'm going to be watching it again.
Um,

774
00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:59.200
do we have any live questions?
Hi.
Uh,

775
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:03.430
I know that you talked about exposure therapy where you talked about kind of

776
00:49:03.431 --> 00:49:08.140
exposing people to your triggers over time gradually and then to CBT where you

777
00:49:08.141 --> 00:49:12.720
can delete or remove those triggers from,
from,
from your,
uh,

778
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:13.870
life.
Um,

779
00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:17.980
how do you balance or where do you draw the line between like what to kind of

780
00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.750
keep exposing yourself to and like what's,
what's a removed?

781
00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:24.410
<v 0>Sure.
So,
um,</v>

782
00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:30.010
I actually would say that CBT isn't exactly removing,

783
00:49:30.011 --> 00:49:32.920
but sort of reframing the way you react to it.

784
00:49:32.921 --> 00:49:36.250
So it's not entirely like you noticed that the stressor is still there.

785
00:49:36.251 --> 00:49:39.670
Your coworker and colleague still exists.
We can't delete our colleagues,

786
00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:42.790
our colleagues.
And then also we can't,
um,

787
00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:47.200
we may might not be able to delete the actual issue,

788
00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:51.090
but how we react to it,
uh,
is,
uh,
um,

789
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:56.250
the core change and we're trying to make with CBT and exposure therapy and

790
00:49:56.351 --> 00:50:00.190
exposure therapy.
We're changing how we react to a stressor,

791
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.760
but we're not changing the stressor itself in CBT.

792
00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:05.380
There is this something that's also stressful,

793
00:50:05.381 --> 00:50:08.690
either the thought or the behavior.
Um,
uh,

794
00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.740
and we just basically tried to change those are modulating.

795
00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:15.560
So I think that that's,
uh,
that,

796
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:17.410
that's how I would reframe that.

797
00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.900
<v 3>Um,
can you speak about how you anticipate technology will support mental health</v>

798
00:50:22.901 --> 00:50:26.770
management over the next 10 years?
Um,
and how you think Google can help?

799
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.980
<v 0>Sure.
You</v>

800
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.190
<v 4>already have had a fantastic,
phenomenal speaker.
I think Dr. Daniel Schlosser,
uh,</v>

801
00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:35.610
spoke at an earlier,
uh,
um,
uh,

802
00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:40.380
meeting to on this subject to,
uh,
I think that,
um,

803
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:43.400
there are many different ways,

804
00:50:43.401 --> 00:50:47.840
but I got to say technology is 20% of the 20% of the answer.

805
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:52.250
The rest of it's going to be politics and policies.
Um,
things like reimbursement,

806
00:50:52.251 --> 00:50:56.930
how he can train your,
the,
um,
mental health leaders to,

807
00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:01.430
um,
to,
uh,
be able to,
to spread these technologies.

808
00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:03.620
That's going to be an important aspect too.

809
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:05.990
So a lot of the technologies are already there.

810
00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:09.470
We already have video conferencing where you already have apps,

811
00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.980
you already have sort of activity trackers and smartwatches.

812
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:16.980
But how are we going to use that is going to be the next frontier.
Uh,

813
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:21.140
and so we're seeing a lot of activity in terms of research and dissemination.

814
00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:26.330
So if,
if,
uh,
so partnering with folks like the Ucs,
psychiatry,

815
00:51:26.331 --> 00:51:29.920
Digital Health Corp for instance,
um,
they are trying to,
uh,

816
00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:33.950
work with researchers on getting digital health and digital technologies

817
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:35.001
implemented.

818
00:51:35.001 --> 00:51:38.510
So I'd encourage you to look at the Ucf Psychiatry Digital Health Corp.

819
00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:39.750
Thank you.
