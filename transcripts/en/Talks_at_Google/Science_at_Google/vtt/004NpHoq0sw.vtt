1
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.860
Uh,
Sean has a really amazing bio.

2
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:10.790
We're lucky to have him here with us today for the other side series.
Um,

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.670
he is a UCLA medical school professor and the founder at the executive director

4
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:19.380
of the Ucla Center for digital behavior and the UC Institute for prediction

5
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:20.214
technology.

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.390
He has a phd in psychology and a Master's in health services research from

7
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.470
Stanford University.

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.550
And the work he will present today is on behavior change based on his research

9
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:32.130
with paste for the patients and consulting with businesses.

10
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.700
He's tackled challenges ranging from getting people to stick with New Year's

11
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:38.250
resolutions,
which we all would love to learn more about,

12
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:42.570
I'm sure to a keeping healthier and addressing some of the most important would

13
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:46.540
be problems like preventing the spread of HIV.
His book stick with it,
uh,

14
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.680
is available from Harper as of June 20th.
Thank you for being here.

15
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.603
<v 1>Okay,</v>

16
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.280
<v 2>thanks so much Jessica.</v>

17
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.240
I wrote this book because on a daily basis I was hearing stories from people who

18
00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:08.220
were having trouble sticking with things that they wanted to do.

19
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.140
For those of you who've,

20
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.980
who've ever tried to do something and it had a difficult time sticking with

21
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:18.050
things,
it can be really,
really tough.
You know,

22
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.320
if you've tried doing something and you fail at it and you really want to do it,

23
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.910
people can really suffer whether we're trying to do it for ourselves to get

24
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:31.140
ourselves to stick with things or we're trying to get other people who we really

25
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:35.760
care about to stick with things that they want to do or that are good for them.

26
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.700
So,
so when hearing these stories,
I'd really empathize with people and,

27
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.370
and at the same time,
you know,

28
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:47.820
half the time I'd be empathizing with them and half the time I'd be really

29
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:52.530
frustrated hearing their answers because they're their reasoning behind why they

30
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:55.740
couldn't stick with things or why other people couldn't stick with things.

31
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.360
We're often because someone wasn't dedicated enough,

32
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.070
they were lazy,
they,
there were problems with the individual,

33
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:08.760
they weren't motivated enough.
And you know,

34
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:13.761
this not only makes us feel bad about ourselves or about people to pin that on

35
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:14.670
the individual,

36
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.470
but it's actually not the correct science.

37
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.580
It's not backed by science.
So what I had learned is that

38
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.380
the reason why we don't stick with things is not because of a problem with the

39
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:34.590
person,
not not because of problem with ourselves or other people.

40
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.430
It's because we're not following the right process.

41
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.460
So in this talk,
I'm going to talk about that process and,

42
00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:46.770
and that's what led me to write this book.

43
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.220
And this same process can be used for no small mundane things,

44
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:56.730
just like getting ourself to stick with a hobby that we want to take on.

45
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.150
But it can also be used for really serious important things like getting

46
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:07.681
ourselves or others to stick with medication that's been prescribed or getting

47
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:12.640
ourselves or others to stay free from diseases.

48
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.890
So that's why I wrote this book.
Now

49
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.650
as a social and behavioral psychologist,
I love that I get to,

50
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.190
to me it and help so many different types of people.

51
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.770
I get to meet with entrepreneurs,
with public health experts,

52
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.250
with engineers in our own research participants.

53
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.490
And on the way over here,
for example,
on the flight over,
I got,

54
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.720
I got into conversation with the person in the seat next to me and he,

55
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.960
he reminds me of my uncle sid from New York.

56
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:53.770
He has this strong New York accent and,
and so he says to me,

57
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.590
Dr Yung,
every month I pay for my gym membership.
I,

58
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.180
I tried to do something good for myself.
I know I should go to the gym,

59
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.630
but I don't go to the gym.
Why don't I go,

60
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.150
I'm paying for my gym membership.

61
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.800
Can you give me some drugs or analyze my dreams to help me?

62
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.590
But I have to tell him,
no,
I can't because that's not what I do.

63
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.170
I help people change their behavior.

64
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.240
But his problem is one that I think a lot of us can relate to.

65
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.950
The problem of,
you know,
how do we stick to things?
And I know I,

66
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.730
a few years ago,
I planned by the end of the summer,

67
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.230
I plan to learn basics of speaking Chinese.

68
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.460
But at the end of the summer,
all I could say was,

69
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.540
yeah,
I'll have the kung pao chicken please.

70
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.220
Now now problems like this or are not just about personal behaviors like wanting

71
00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:59.830
to learn a new language or or stick with things,

72
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.740
they also applied to business.

73
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.310
So a team in your organization may have plans to complete work by a deadline,

74
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.810
but,
but then they keep missing their deadlines,

75
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.650
but they plan their own deadlines.
Now the,

76
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.690
the typical solution to things like this or the reasoning behind it is to say

77
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.330
that the person is flawed,

78
00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:31.090
that the person doesn't have enough willpower,

79
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:34.840
the person isn't motivated enough and we need to change the person.

80
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.430
But that only,
you know,

81
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:41.290
it not only makes us feel badly about ourselves as people with with putting

82
00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:45.190
blame like that,
but it's not the correct science.

83
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.893
So,

84
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.140
so what I've learned is that we just need to know that there are three different

85
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:54.670
types of behaviors.

86
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.550
Once we know those three types of behaviors,

87
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.050
there are a set of tools for changing those three types of behaviors.

88
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.030
So that's what we're going to go over in this talk.
Now,
when you walked in,

89
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.220
you should have received a a card.

90
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:12.410
Hopefully raise your hand right now if you didn't get a,

91
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.980
if you didn't get a card in and we can get someone to get your card right now.

92
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.260
Great.
Thanks so much.
Uh,

93
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:23.261
so on the card I want to ask you to write down a behavior that you want to

94
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:27.680
change.
This can be a,
a personal behavior,

95
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:31.340
like getting yourself to read more books or,

96
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.400
or to be more engaged in work.
Um,

97
00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:37.550
it can be a business type behavior,

98
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:40.910
like getting your employees to take better care of their health.

99
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.350
Make sure to write it down because toward the end I'm going to call on some of

100
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:48.740
you to talk about your behavior and we'll call someone up here actually.

101
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.563
All right.

102
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.600
How many of you have had the situation where you are trying to get something

103
00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:02.450
out?
You're trying to talk and someone keeps interrupting you?

104
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.240
Think probably all of us have read.
All of us have experienced that.
Now.

105
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:10.460
How many of you get frustrated when you're,

106
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.160
when you're trying to talk in the person keeps frustrating you.

107
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.450
<v 1>Okay,</v>

108
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.010
<v 2>well it may not be that person's fault.</v>

109
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.200
So that person may be doing what I call an automatic behavior.

110
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.120
So an automatic behavior is something where we're not even aware of what we're

111
00:07:30.121 --> 00:07:32.760
doing.
It just happens unconsciously.

112
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:39.260
And knowing that something is an automatic behavior allows us to know how to

113
00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:40.584
address it.

114
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.950
So other examples of an automatic behavior are forgetting that we're not

115
00:07:46.561 --> 00:07:51.561
standing up straight eating food that's just sitting in front of us without even

116
00:07:51.601 --> 00:07:55.170
being aware of what we're doing.
Those are automatic behaviors.

117
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:58.320
But once we know that some things,
an automatic behavior,

118
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.430
there are a set of tools and strategies that we can use to change it.

119
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.290
But before we get into that,
let's talk about the second type of behavior.

120
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:15.220
Well,
while waiting at a stoplight to cross the street,

121
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.520
I'd often pull out my phone check email to burn some time and sometimes I'd even

122
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.100
cross the street while I'm still reading the email.

123
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.130
That's not always the best idea.
It can lead to accidents.

124
00:08:33.131 --> 00:08:36.820
It can lead me tripping in the middle of the street.
I shouldn't be doing that.

125
00:08:36.821 --> 00:08:41.620
But,
but I feel like
I wasn't able to stop.

126
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:43.143
You know,
I,

127
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.540
I felt like I had to just finish reading this email and then I put the phone

128
00:08:46.541 --> 00:08:50.980
away.
So this is an example of what I call a burning behavior.

129
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.580
Birding behaviors.
Well,
automatic behaviors or things that unconsciously,

130
00:08:56.581 --> 00:09:01.581
automatically burning behaviors are behaviors where we're aware of what we're

131
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:05.940
doing,
but we feel powerless to stop.

132
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.770
We feel like we just can't stop.

133
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.040
So in my case,
knowing that it was a burning behavior,

134
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.780
I was able to stop it.
And part of that solution comes from every week.

135
00:09:18.781 --> 00:09:21.810
Now I take a digital day of rest.

136
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.100
So from Friday to Saturday,
I don't use any apps.

137
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.090
I don't check email,
I don't even talk about work.

138
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.610
It's just time for friends and family.

139
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.190
And I was able to,
to address that and to,

140
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.580
to stop what could be a growing digital addiction because I knew this was a

141
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:47.460
burning behavior.
But before we get into that,

142
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.830
let me tell you about the last type of behavior

143
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.460
and also go into with this the,

144
00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:56.610
the background of how I came to study this.

145
00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.730
So this is my brother up here,

146
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.900
and when I was in graduate school,

147
00:10:03.901 --> 00:10:08.370
just down the street here at Stanford,
my brother came up to visit.

148
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:14.390
Now he had been suffering from an intestinal disorder called Crohn's disease and

149
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.550
he came up to visit and he was just in too much pain to go back home.

150
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.730
So we brought him to the emergency room

151
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.760
and they looked at him and it turns out his intestines had burst.

152
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.430
So he was rushed into emergency surgery and

153
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.890
they saved his life.
He was minutes away from dying.

154
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.170
They said they saved his life.
So we spent,

155
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.140
spent two weeks recovering at Stanford Hospital,

156
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:51.590
then he was prescribed daily medication advice to change his lifestyle and a,

157
00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.370
and then he was released.
Now,

158
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.530
now try to put yourself in my brother's situation the way that I did.

159
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.660
You just,

160
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:06.470
you just almost died and you've been told change your lifestyle.

161
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:12.260
How likely do you,
do you guys think you would be to do that?
I mean,

162
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.940
if you're like my brother,
if you're like most people,
you'd say,

163
00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:20.040
I'm going to change.
I'm going to eat differently.
I'm going to exercise.

164
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.360
I'm going to take my medication,

165
00:11:21.361 --> 00:11:23.670
I'm going to do everything that I'm supposed to do.

166
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.180
And my brother said he'd do that 100%

167
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.363
<v 3>but he didn't.</v>

168
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.730
<v 2>I didn't understand why I,</v>

169
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.600
my family and I were really close.
I love my brother.

170
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.200
So I was on the phone with my mom for hours every day and we were trying to

171
00:11:48.801 --> 00:11:50.500
figure out,
you know,

172
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:55.510
what could we do to get him to follow these recommendations?

173
00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.670
Why wasn't he doing it?
I was scared for him.
I was,

174
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:01.901
I was worried.

175
00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:06.640
I was confused and I was frustrated and so I started searching for answers.

176
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:09.910
I started talking to all different types of people,

177
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:13.840
experts in education,
in medicine,
in business,

178
00:12:13.841 --> 00:12:17.410
and I was trying to find answers that I kept finding.

179
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.930
I kept finding the same one size fits all solution answers.

180
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.030
People were saying he needed to have more willpower.

181
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.680
People were saying he needed to be more educated about crones and how to change

182
00:12:32.681 --> 00:12:33.514
it.

183
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:39.150
They were saying that that he wasn't motivated enough about his health but this,

184
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.320
but he's my brother's smart,
he's motivated,
he's health conscious,
he's educated,

185
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.800
so these answers didn't make sense to me and so that's why I started studying

186
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:54.400
this area and after 15 years of studying it,

187
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.140
I've come up with some answers.

188
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:02.170
So what I figured out is it's not about a one size fits all solution and it's

189
00:13:02.171 --> 00:13:06.130
not about blaming the individual.
What we need to know is that

190
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.400
not all behaviors are the same.
There are three types of behaviors.
You know,

191
00:13:12.401 --> 00:13:15.220
I found while I was questioning my brothers,

192
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.160
while I was questioning why my brother wasn't changing,

193
00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:20.680
other things were happening at the same time in my life.

194
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.610
I was in a band and and trying to figure out how do we get,

195
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.000
how do we get the fans of our band to keep coming back to our shows to keep

196
00:13:28.001 --> 00:13:28.870
buying albums.

197
00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:34.510
I was teaching classes at Stanford and wondering why was it that the students in

198
00:13:35.531 --> 00:13:39.700
our classes would wait until the day of paper was due and then they'd asked for

199
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:44.701
more time or I was wondering how could I get myself where I was working on so

200
00:13:44.861 --> 00:13:49.120
many different things to stay engaged and motivated and doing all of them.

201
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.900
Now all of these seem like really different things,

202
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.540
but on this,
if you look deeper there,

203
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:02.570
they're actually United by one common thread and that's how do we get people to

204
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:08.080
stick with things.
So people often,

205
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.360
often we're even planning what they were going to do,

206
00:14:10.361 --> 00:14:14.440
but they still kept failing.
So how do we get people to stick with things?
Well,

207
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:20.190
what I've found is that we need to know the three types of behaviors.

208
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:26.940
So the three types of behaviors or automatic burning and common behaviors are

209
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:31.630
what I call the abcs of behavior.
So I'll do a quick recap about that.

210
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.440
Automatic behaviors are behaviors that happen unconsciously,

211
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:39.010
like the example of the interrupter

212
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:45.160
burning behaviors,
burning behaviors or behaviors that,

213
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:49.780
that are not happening unconsciously.
But we feel powerless to stop.

214
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.010
Addictions are often burning behaviors.

215
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.870
And then third are common behaviors.

216
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.500
Common behaviors are the most common of all behaviors.

217
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.900
Common behaviors are often due to motivation.
So,

218
00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.360
um,
common behavior is something where we're aware of what we're doing,

219
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:18.250
but the risks of doing it or the energy that it takes for us to do it isn't

220
00:15:19.791 --> 00:15:24.290
worth the benefits we think we might get from doing it.
So let me,

221
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:25.790
let me say that again.
I'll repeat that.

222
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:30.020
Common behavior is something where the energy that it takes for us to do

223
00:15:30.021 --> 00:15:33.290
something or the,
the risks that it takes for us to do it,

224
00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:37.040
is it worth the benefit we think we might get from doing it.

225
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:42.080
So let me give an example cause that's,
that's a lot.
So my brothers,

226
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.050
my brothers lifestyle change was an example of a common behavior

227
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.650
because despite being told that he should change his lifestyle and that may keep

228
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:55.970
them out of the hospital,
he didn't think it was worth it to change.

229
00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:02.060
Why should he,
why should he give up things that he loved doing?

230
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.250
Why should he change the way he eats?
Why should he exercise more,
meditate,

231
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.330
take medication?

232
00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:12.770
Why should you do these things if there wasn't even a guarantee that it would

233
00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:15.620
work?
That's a common behavior.

234
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.790
But knowing that something's a common behavior

235
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.560
or an arb behavior allows us to know how to fix it.

236
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.600
We just need to know the set of tools for fixing those types of behaviors.

237
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:31.543
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

238
00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.420
<v 2>so this set of tools or what I call the forces of behavior change.
Now you guys,</v>

239
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:43.170
you guys have may have learned in physics that there are forces that move

240
00:16:43.571 --> 00:16:46.930
objects and move objects can't move this.

241
00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:52.570
There are forces that move objects in certain directions.
Well,

242
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.930
there are behavioral forces that move people.

243
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.420
They get us to behave in certain ways

244
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:05.900
now just as a flight crew or a pilot or aerospace engineers need to know the

245
00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:10.740
physical forces that move a plane in order to fly it safely.

246
00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:16.020
All of us need to know the behavioral forces that move people so we can behave

247
00:17:16.021 --> 00:17:19.470
the way we want.
There are seven of these forces.

248
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:22.330
So what I did,

249
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:27.330
I came up with a framework called science where each one of these,

250
00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.900
each one,
the letters of science represents a different,

251
00:17:30.901 --> 00:17:35.901
one of the seven forces and it's called science because it's not because you

252
00:17:35.971 --> 00:17:37.620
need a scientist to to know it,

253
00:17:37.621 --> 00:17:41.850
but because it's based on decades of scientific research.
So

254
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.760
s stands for stepladders.

255
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:47.040
<v 1>Okay,</v>

256
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.750
<v 2>we know we're supposed to do things in small,</v>

257
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.230
but we often don't.

258
00:17:52.231 --> 00:17:55.410
We often don't plan small steps to change our behavior.

259
00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:01.260
A few weeks ago I ran into someone at the market and he was a cross country

260
00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:05.310
runner in high school and he decided that he wanted to run a marathon.

261
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:09.000
He ran cross country in high school so he knew how to run,

262
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.190
but he hadn't run since then.

263
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.220
Then you know it had been 20 years since then and he decides,

264
00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:16.710
I'm just going to go run this marathon and I'm going to do it.
I've got,

265
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.500
I've got the motivation,
I've got the energy,
I can do this.

266
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.750
Any actually did pretty well.

267
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:26.310
You got to mile 19 but then he collapsed and he said,

268
00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:30.630
I didn't finish that marathon and I'm probably not going to run another marathon

269
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.310
again.
Now that story,
you know,
I don't know about for you guys,

270
00:18:35.311 --> 00:18:39.630
but there's no way I could run a marathon without training for it,

271
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.970
so,
so this makes a lot of sense.
If we want to be able to do something,

272
00:18:44.971 --> 00:18:46.350
if we want to stick to things,

273
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.340
we need to start in small incremental steps,

274
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.070
but just like the marathon example,

275
00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:55.500
we often make the same mistakes in our own life.

276
00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:01.010
If we want to be able to make a new year's resolution to go to the gym,

277
00:19:01.261 --> 00:19:03.150
we'll say,
I'm going to go to the gym.

278
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.990
I haven't really been at all before this past year,

279
00:19:06.991 --> 00:19:11.991
but I'm going to go five days a week for the next year and that's a pretty tall

280
00:19:12.421 --> 00:19:15.660
order.
So we need to think about things in small steps.

281
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.350
But the question is how do you know what a small step is?

282
00:19:19.351 --> 00:19:23.820
How do you know how small a step should be?

283
00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:29.370
So I created this,
this figure here called steps,
goals,
and dreams.

284
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.860
Now the idea is the marathon example.
If,

285
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.650
if I was going to try to run a marathon,
I've never run one before,

286
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:39.900
I'm not going to be able to do it in a week,

287
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.640
I'm not going to be able to do it in a month,

288
00:19:41.641 --> 00:19:46.140
probably probably take me a few months of training to run a marathon.

289
00:19:46.141 --> 00:19:49.740
So that's what I call a dream.
It's attainable,

290
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.690
but it takes some time to get there.

291
00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:59.060
If I want something now to do a first step would be something that takes less

292
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.310
than a week.
So getting a pair of running shoes,
maybe a first step,

293
00:20:05.311 --> 00:20:09.900
or if I haven't run before,
much running for 10 1520 minutes,

294
00:20:09.901 --> 00:20:12.960
just something small would be a first step.
So this,

295
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:18.170
this figure will teach us how we can plan steps that are the right size so that

296
00:20:18.241 --> 00:20:19.074
we don't give up.

297
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:24.320
<v 1>Okay,</v>

298
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.200
<v 2>so that's step ladders.
C stands for community.</v>

299
00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.350
We all want to be different from the crowd.

300
00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.840
We want to be different than other individuals,

301
00:20:32.841 --> 00:20:35.360
but our social environment matters.

302
00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.210
It matters a lot more than we even think it does.

303
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:43.880
And there's a science how to leverage social to create change.

304
00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

305
00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.980
<v 2>One of the that we do in</v>

306
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.700
<v 1>our research,
I created what's called the hope intervention.</v>

307
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:57.260
Hope intervention is an online community where it's designed to motivate people

308
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:58.930
to change their behavior.

309
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:04.860
We invite people to a 12 week intervention and we've found that these

310
00:21:05.921 --> 00:21:09.250
interventions to change people's behavior across different areas,

311
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:14.110
drug use,
HIV,
different types of behaviors.

312
00:21:14.111 --> 00:21:18.910
We find that within 12 weeks we can get people to change their behavior and it

313
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:23.770
leverages the,
the force of community through these online communities.

314
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.220
<v 2>We find that that people in our hope interventions are about two to three times</v>

315
00:21:30.221 --> 00:21:34.920
as likely to change their behavior.
Now I stands for important

316
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.920
people won't do things unless they want to do it unless they're motivated.
Right?

317
00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.530
Yes,
but no,
not necessarily.

318
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:49.790
Motivation definitely matters and that's why it's up here as one of these seven

319
00:21:49.791 --> 00:21:50.624
forces,

320
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:55.750
but people actually don't need to be motivated in order to stick with things.

321
00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:02.140
So I'll give an example from the the hope intervention that I was mentioning.

322
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.610
We did,

323
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:09.120
we did a whole intervention on trying to get people at high risk for HIV to get

324
00:22:09.281 --> 00:22:14.050
an HIV test.
They weren't interested in getting an HIV test.

325
00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:18.640
We just,
we had him sign up for an,
for our group.
They took a survey,

326
00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.700
we paid them to take a survey and then we said,
all right,

327
00:22:21.701 --> 00:22:24.700
you guys are free to go.
You don't need to be in this community anymore.

328
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.470
It was up to us to keep them engaged,
keep them motivated.
Well,

329
00:22:29.471 --> 00:22:33.870
by the end of the study
we had people in,

330
00:22:33.871 --> 00:22:38.871
in our hope group were much more likely two to three times as likely as people

331
00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:44.020
who were to test for HIV.
They still didn't even,
wasn't,

332
00:22:44.021 --> 00:22:47.440
we're an interested necessarily in testing,
but we got them to test.

333
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:52.060
So the point is
important in motivation matters.

334
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.670
But if we're using the other forces,

335
00:22:54.671 --> 00:22:58.450
we can often get people to do things even if they're not motivated to do that

336
00:22:58.451 --> 00:22:59.284
thing themselves.

337
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.000
Now e stands for easy.

338
00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.430
If we can make something easier for people to do,

339
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
then for them not to do it or easier for ourselves to do than to not do people

340
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.870
do it.
It's that simple.

341
00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:19.493
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

342
00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:23.450
<v 2>Just like,
like,
uh,
we can,</v>

343
00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:28.700
we can get people to,
to do easy things by changing around our environment.

344
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:33.320
We can do that with behaviors.
In this chapter on easy,

345
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:38.510
I talk about some business examples of how businesses were able to make things

346
00:23:38.511 --> 00:23:39.344
easy.

347
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:44.480
So have you guys who's heard the story of Joe Column B?

348
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:52.980
So if you guys ask someone,
ask someone about the story of [inaudible].

349
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:57.950
Let's see what,
what,
uh,
what time is it?
Oh,
we've got,
okay,
we've got time.

350
00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:02.180
Let me tell you this story.
It's a good story.
So Joe,
column B,
and uh,

351
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.620
this was took place in 1958 in the late 1950s.

352
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:12.010
He had graduated from Stanford School of business from the GSB and he went to go

353
00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:16.090
work for a company called Owl Rexall.
Aloe Rexall was a,

354
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.510
is a grocery chain,
grocery store chain.
And what they told them is,

355
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.500
hey Joe,

356
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.280
we want you to go off on your own and start this new chain of stores called

357
00:24:25.281 --> 00:24:28.640
Pronto.
So he starts pronto.

358
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.550
But pronto was struggling.
He wasn't doing well.

359
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:37.300
The reason is there was this other competitor grocery store that had just come

360
00:24:37.671 --> 00:24:41.480
out and they were doing really well.
They were called seven 11.

361
00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:46.070
So seven 11 was open at unprecedented hours.
They were open.

362
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:50.450
7:00 AM to 11:00 PM they were offering all kinds of products.

363
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:55.820
Joe and Pronto couldn't compete.
So our Rexall said it's not working.

364
00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:01.670
Let's ax Prompto and,
and we'll,
we'll do something else,

365
00:25:01.671 --> 00:25:05.390
Joe.
But Joe didn't want to do that.
He left.

366
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:10.610
He left work from Al Rexall and he mortgaged his house and decides he's going to

367
00:25:10.611 --> 00:25:15.200
go on his own and saved Pronto,
but he didn't know how to do it.
So,

368
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.390
so he says,
okay,
I'm going to take a vacation.

369
00:25:17.391 --> 00:25:20.330
Meanwhile I'm going to go to the Caribbean and,

370
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.570
and think this over while he's in the Caribbean,

371
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.420
he's relaxing,
he's laying by the beach.
People would bring into my ties.
He's,

372
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.550
he's drinking,
they're bringing him food,

373
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.720
he's listening to Calypso and reggae music there.

374
00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:41.290
And he realizes this is a pretty sweet setup for someone who's on vacation.

375
00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.210
They're making it pretty easy for tourists to be here.

376
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.390
Maybe there's something that I can do with this,

377
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.350
this lifestyle with this making it easy and I can bring this back to pronto.

378
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.390
So that's what he does.

379
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:58.490
So he goes back home and in compared to competitor stores,

380
00:25:58.491 --> 00:26:02.840
which were offering 10 different types of Manet's,

381
00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:07.250
13 types of bread,
you know,
a ton of different product choices.

382
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:11.180
Joe Decides I'm going to have just one.
I'm going to make it easy for people.

383
00:26:11.181 --> 00:26:14.150
When they come in here,
they're going to know what they can purchase.

384
00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.400
And it worked.
It worked.

385
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.760
People started not only coming in to to his stores,

386
00:26:19.761 --> 00:26:24.320
but they kept on buying and it kept on working and,
and pronto stores,

387
00:26:24.321 --> 00:26:27.740
which ultimately changed their name,
became a huge lasting success.

388
00:26:27.741 --> 00:26:30.920
They're still around today.
Anyone know?

389
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:33.980
Anyone have an idea of what the store chain is?

390
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:39.050
You got to say a ladder trader Joe's.
Exactly.

391
00:26:39.051 --> 00:26:43.220
So his name was Joe.
They're inspired by the trip to the Caribbean.

392
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.980
So now when you,
you see the Hawaiian shirts,
it's from the story of Joe.

393
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.170
Now Trader Joe's isn't the only one to leverage this force of easy.

394
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.370
Think about Amazon.
You know,
Amazon prime,

395
00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:01.380
Amazon Dash make shopping easy.
You don't even delete.

396
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.480
You don't have to leave your home.
I mean we,

397
00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.910
I don't go shopping anywhere anymore.

398
00:27:05.911 --> 00:27:10.260
Just everything on Amazon now they can deliver to you before you even know what

399
00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:15.210
you want to order.
That's pretty easy.
Google,
you guys have actually done it too.

400
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.610
And,
and with some of you in the group,

401
00:27:17.611 --> 00:27:21.450
you may be a may have been involved in this.
So,
so Google,

402
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:25.560
as you guys know,
I'm one of the founding tenants.

403
00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:29.130
One of the benefits of Google is that there's food everywhere.

404
00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:34.730
Well that also can lead to the Google 15 or Google 20 right?

405
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:40.700
And so Google found that their employees were not as healthy as they would like.

406
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.770
So they decided we're going to change around the dining halls and make it so

407
00:27:46.771 --> 00:27:51.771
that we're going to take the unhealthier foods and put it in the back and make

408
00:27:51.961 --> 00:27:53.940
them in containers that aren't clear anymore.

409
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.380
Had a big effect on employee behavior and unhealth and on eating.

410
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:04.020
So the force of easy is a powerful way to change people's behavior.

411
00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.630
Next n stands for neuro hacks,
neuro hack,
sir,

412
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:13.410
quick mental shortcuts that can get us to change our behavior.

413
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:17.010
So just like hitting control,

414
00:28:17.011 --> 00:28:22.011
alt delete on a PC can allow us to use a program that was jammed up or reset

415
00:28:23.071 --> 00:28:27.620
things.
Neuro hacks allow us to reset our brain and allow us to,

416
00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:30.870
to think and behave in ways that we couldn't before.

417
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.850
I'll give an example of a neuro hacking in the chapter on neuro hacks.

418
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:40.890
I mentioned a story by a man named Marissa.
So Maricio was,

419
00:28:40.891 --> 00:28:44.580
was a designer and he was in a funk,

420
00:28:44.581 --> 00:28:47.070
though he had just gotten a divorce.

421
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.460
He didn't feel like motivated to be a designer anymore.

422
00:28:50.461 --> 00:28:53.070
He didn't feel like going to work,
but he didn't know what to do.

423
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.080
But he got an idea while he was at work one day and he came across to the

424
00:28:58.081 --> 00:29:01.290
familiar screen of,
of it's flashing in front of him saying,

425
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:04.050
you need to change your password.
And he says,

426
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:08.760
I'm going to use my password to change my life and get me out of this funk.

427
00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:10.410
So what does he do?
So he says,

428
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:15.870
I'm going to change my password to the number four.
Get her,

429
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:20.910
forget her,
forget her.
So,

430
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:26.280
uh,
or sorry,
not for,
forgive her,
forgive her.

431
00:29:26.281 --> 00:29:28.500
I forgive her.
I forget.
So forgive her.

432
00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:33.420
So he decides I'm going to every day I have to type,

433
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.290
forgive her.
And that'll get me to be able to forgive,

434
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.210
forgive for what's happened.
And when you first started doing it,

435
00:29:43.211 --> 00:29:44.350
it was pretty difficult.
You know,

436
00:29:44.351 --> 00:29:47.650
you can imagine he's going through this divorce is having a tough time and now

437
00:29:47.651 --> 00:29:51.970
he has to type forgive her.
So the first few times it was difficult,

438
00:29:51.971 --> 00:29:56.320
but what he found is that as he kept typing,
forgive her,

439
00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.000
it became easier to do.
He didn't have these,

440
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.150
these terrible feelings that he thought he would.

441
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.490
He didn't have to change his password to something else.

442
00:30:06.491 --> 00:30:11.491
He could continue doing this and it just reset his brain and made him think I'm

443
00:30:12.281 --> 00:30:15.220
getting over her.
I am.
I'm forgiving her.

444
00:30:15.221 --> 00:30:19.360
I'm forgetting and I'm moving on.
And he has moved on since that was,

445
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:23.560
it was a neuro hack that allows him to,
to move on.
But,

446
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:27.220
but he didn't just stop there.
He also,
he was smoking and he,

447
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:32.380
he changed his password to quit smoking.
And he said,

448
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.670
you told me that you quit smoking overnight.
Five years later.

449
00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:41.050
He hasn't been smoking since.
That's the power of neuro hacks.

450
00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.650
C stands for captivating.

451
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:47.640
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

452
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.060
<v 2>We know that we should reward ourselves.</v>

453
00:30:51.061 --> 00:30:55.040
We should reward people for,
for doing things in order to,

454
00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:58.800
to create lasting change.
But rewards don't always work.

455
00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:04.290
Think about the gamification gamification fad,
which has kind of fizzled out.

456
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.530
So rewards work but not,

457
00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:11.160
oh is because not all types of rewards work.

458
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:16.910
Not everyone's motivated by points and badges and leaderboards out.

459
00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.670
We need not just any reward,

460
00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:24.000
but we need a reward that's truly captivating.

461
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.130
It's gotta be important to people.

462
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.570
Different things are motivating to different people.
So this chapter,

463
00:31:30.571 --> 00:31:35.190
we'll talk about the history and there's a long history going back about a

464
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:38.280
hundred years of,
of how to motivate change and how to create rewards.

465
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.240
This chapter,
we'll talk about it
finally,

466
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:47.430
he stands for ingrained,
or Barack Obama was known for,

467
00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:52.020
for making a routine out of the clothes that he wore,

468
00:31:52.021 --> 00:31:56.010
the food that he ate so that he could save time for making important decisions

469
00:31:56.011 --> 00:32:00.570
about our country.
Mark Zuckerberg,
he was known for,

470
00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:05.160
or he has a 20 versions of the same shirt writer,

471
00:32:05.161 --> 00:32:07.680
Ernest Hemingway.
He writes,

472
00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.820
he was known for writing every day at the same time.
In the morning,

473
00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:14.550
if you make something,
a routine,

474
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
it becomes easier to do and it gets ingrained in our brain.

475
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:23.610
So those are,
those are the seven forces.
That's the,
the science framework.

476
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.950
And now all we need to do is,
is no,

477
00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:33.360
now that we know the,
the ABC is,

478
00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:36.480
we know the three types of behaviors and we know the seven forces,

479
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:42.680
we just need to know which of the seven forces do we use and when,

480
00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:49.990
so I created a,
a simple two step model.

481
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:53.440
It's pretty easy.
You're just step one,

482
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.970
identify whether something is in a,
B or c behavior.

483
00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.093
And second,

484
00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:04.300
apply the forces needed to change that type of behavior.

485
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:12.650
So this is,
this is what I call the science of lasting change.

486
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.140
And here's,
here's the figure.

487
00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.910
You can see that first there's automatic behaviors,

488
00:33:19.911 --> 00:33:21.980
burning behaviors and common behaviors.

489
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:26.150
Automatic behaviors were not aware of what we're doing.
So there's,

490
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:30.560
there's no brain and the stick figures had burning behaviors where we're a

491
00:33:30.561 --> 00:33:35.060
little bit more aware.
Um,
and then common behaviors,
we're fully aware.
So,

492
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:37.270
and,
and as you can see,
the,

493
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:42.490
the seven forces are listed down at the bottom and the more stars next to that

494
00:33:43.731 --> 00:33:47.750
force,
the more important it is for changing that type of behavior.

495
00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:53.600
You know,
in general as we get more complicated types of behaviors,

496
00:33:53.601 --> 00:33:54.770
as we get more aware of it,

497
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.900
we need a larger set of tools to change those types of behaviors.

498
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:03.410
We need more forces.
Now this,

499
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:09.430
this framework is something that I put together based on decades of scientific

500
00:34:11.991 --> 00:34:16.700
research from other scientists and psychologists and from our own work,

501
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:22.280
I've found that this works across a number of different areas.
We've,

502
00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:22.971
we've used it,

503
00:34:22.971 --> 00:34:26.780
I'm in the medical school and we've used it and apply it to people at risk for

504
00:34:26.781 --> 00:34:28.640
diseases where we need to change help.

505
00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:33.710
I found that it works in my own life for personal behaviors and,

506
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.830
and it works in business work that I do too.

507
00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:39.573
So,

508
00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.480
so this gives you a high level overview and,

509
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.040
and if there's,

510
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:50.150
there's more questions that the book goes into a lot more detail about this

511
00:34:50.151 --> 00:34:50.984
framework

512
00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.850
and what I want to do now,
the purpose of this talk,

513
00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:01.050
I want to leave you guys with understanding the difference between a,

514
00:35:01.051 --> 00:35:04.590
B and c behaviors.
So what I'd like to do now as a,

515
00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:09.370
a type of Q and a is have someone come up here,
uh,

516
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:12.900
and we'll talk about whether your behaviors and a B or c behavior.
But,

517
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:18.260
but first let's everyone pull out your cards that we had at the beginning and

518
00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.690
raise your hand if you wrote down in a behavior.

519
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.680
Okay.
Raise your hand if you wrote down a bee behavior.

520
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.760
I think so.
Half hands.
Halfway.
I think so.
Good.
Good.
What are,

521
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:36.530
what's,
what's the BB behavior?

522
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:43.830
Coughing.
Brushing the teeth.
That lunchtime.
Okay.

523
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.220
And uh,
and see behavior.

524
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.820
Great.
So what's it,

525
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:56.820
what's the c behavior you had making music?
Making music.
Excellent.

526
00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:01.590
That's one after my own heart.
Um,
all right,
so,
so let's,

527
00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:06.900
let's say just to settle it in and make sure we understand the difference.

528
00:36:06.901 --> 00:36:09.150
Let's call,
call someone up.
Can I get a,

529
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.470
a brave volunteered to come up here and walk through it?
All right,

530
00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:16.620
thanks for coming up here Chris.
Sure.
So tell us about,

531
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.880
tell us about your behavior.

532
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:23.500
<v 4>I'm really into dark chocolate and um,
unfortunately I'm into it in,</v>

533
00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:26.680
at nighttime and the darker the better.

534
00:36:26.681 --> 00:36:31.270
So I tend to eat it before I go to bed and then I fall asleep until three

535
00:36:31.271 --> 00:36:33.760
o'clock on that.
I'm like,
I'm up.

536
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.080
So it's a pretty common behavior,
but sometimes it feels burning.

537
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:43.340
Like I just have to have it cause I get a lift sometimes I can get a little work

538
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.213
done.

539
00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:49.330
<v 2>Excellent.
So you're already,
you're already thinking about,
so here's a,</v>

540
00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:54.250
here's a chart I was going to ask.
Do we think it's it in a B or c behavior?

541
00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:59.410
So if it's done without awareness.
So the behavior he mentioned was,
you know,

542
00:36:59.411 --> 00:37:02.350
late night snacks and eating chocolate at,
at nighttime.

543
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:06.820
If it's done without awareness,
I mean my guests,
I'm with you.

544
00:37:06.821 --> 00:37:10.840
My guess is that it's a c behavior,
but let's,
let's just go through for example.

545
00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:15.520
So it would be an a behavior.
If you're not even aware,
you're,

546
00:37:15.521 --> 00:37:18.940
you're almost either sleepwalking or you're just going in there grabbing

547
00:37:18.941 --> 00:37:22.860
chocolate.
Um,
it sounds like you're,
you're aware of what you're doing when you,

548
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:23.970
I always know what I'm doing.

549
00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:27.750
You know what you want that chocolate tell keep me away from the chocolate.
Yeah.

550
00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:32.140
It would be a behavioral,
is it,
does it feel almost like an addiction?

551
00:37:32.141 --> 00:37:36.940
Does it feel like you can't stop yourself?
Um,
when I'm really stressed out,

552
00:37:36.941 --> 00:37:39.130
it feels like I can't stop myself.
When you're really,

553
00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:44.290
when you're really stressed out,
you can't do it.
Okay.
And in general,
in general,

554
00:37:44.291 --> 00:37:48.580
it's uh,
it's something where you're aware of what you're doing,
but it's just,

555
00:37:48.581 --> 00:37:53.500
there are other things that are,
that are,
you know,
it's driving you toward it.

556
00:37:53.501 --> 00:37:55.000
You're,
you're aware of what you're doing,

557
00:37:55.001 --> 00:37:57.790
but you really want the chocolate and feel like you should eat it.

558
00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:00.040
<v 4>Well it tastes good and I get a lift.</v>

559
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.540
<v 2>So then I would,
I would call that a common behavior too.
But it's,</v>

560
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.860
it's,
uh,

561
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:13.160
this is a good example because some behaviors based on the person or based on

562
00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.440
the behavior,
it can be in different categories and we're,

563
00:38:16.441 --> 00:38:19.610
we'll use different solutions to address it.
So.

564
00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:23.550
So let's talk about how to address it.
Let's go back to go back to here.

565
00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:27.240
So as you'll see,

566
00:38:27.241 --> 00:38:30.870
common behaviors community has three stars.

567
00:38:30.871 --> 00:38:35.830
So that makes it really important.
If we can,
if we can,
community,

568
00:38:35.831 --> 00:38:40.720
that'll help out a lot.
So the question is,
do you live with anyone?
I do.
You do?

569
00:38:40.721 --> 00:38:45.220
Okay.
Yeah.
Uh,
so does the person who you live with,

570
00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.130
do they,
do they also eat chocolate?

571
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.610
<v 4>She's a lot of sugar at night,
so,
um,</v>

572
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:56.950
so I feel like I'm a little more disciplined than she is,

573
00:38:56.951 --> 00:38:59.020
but she doesn't have any issues with it.
You know,

574
00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:02.230
she can just have her sweet stuff and she'll go to sleep.
But,

575
00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:07.740
<v 2>so that's,
you guys see the challenge that's confronted.</v>

576
00:39:07.741 --> 00:39:11.960
That's one of the difficult parts.
You know,
if you're living with someone,
um,

577
00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:17.540
and that person has no problem with the behavior that they're doing and you have

578
00:39:17.581 --> 00:39:21.580
a problem when you're doing it,
it can make it difficult.
So,
you know,

579
00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.500
so one,
this is where,
where,
uh,

580
00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:30.480
discussions come in and,
and would she be,
would she be willing to change?

581
00:39:30.481 --> 00:39:32.490
Would she be willing?
Could you have this discussion with her?

582
00:39:32.491 --> 00:39:35.610
Were both of you guys could,
could,
uh,

583
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:39.270
slow down or stop eating late night chocolate?
And if not,
it's fine.

584
00:39:39.271 --> 00:39:41.940
If the answer's no,
we can,
but that's a first solution.

585
00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:43.183
<v 4>Well,</v>

586
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:48.430
I mean she tends to stay up later and watch TV so we could have hours where she

587
00:39:49.791 --> 00:39:51.110
eats her stuff.
My

588
00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:55.640
<v 2>got it.
Okay.
So it sounds like,
so that's,
that's a more difficult one.</v>

589
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:57.710
Um,
but,

590
00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:02.660
but what we can do is so easy.

591
00:40:02.661 --> 00:40:06.710
It's very important.
Uh,
is there a way for you to be able,

592
00:40:06.711 --> 00:40:09.290
it sounds like she eats or sweets,
but for you it's chocolate.

593
00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:14.570
Is there a way for you to either just get the chocolate out of the house,

594
00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:15.800
not have chocolate around?

595
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:20.760
<v 4>Well,
I've,
I've moved it out of the office into the pantry.
Sorry,</v>

596
00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:25.130
I have to go downstairs to do it.
So excellent.

597
00:40:25.131 --> 00:40:26.060
It's further away.

598
00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:30.550
<v 2>Excellent.
So,
so that's an example of,
of being able,</v>

599
00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:34.480
if it's further away,
then it's going to be harder to do.

600
00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.960
It's not going to be as easy and you'll be less likely to do it.

601
00:40:37.961 --> 00:40:40.660
And has that hat,
how's that worked out for you?

602
00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:42.670
<v 4>It's less than the intake.</v>

603
00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:47.100
<v 2>Great.
So the next step would be,</v>

604
00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:48.900
can you get it out of the house completely?

605
00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:54.330
Uh,
I don't want to do that.

606
00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.320
<v 4>I don't really want to,
but,
um,</v>

607
00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:02.410
I can't for periods of time and then I feel like I have to sort of just read.

608
00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:06.260
I just have to have so,
so,

609
00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.340
<v 2>so if you can,</v>

610
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:10.730
if you can make it where you have to go to the store in order to get the

611
00:41:10.731 --> 00:41:14.540
chocolate,
that'll,
that'll lessen the amount of,
of chocolate that you're eating.

612
00:41:14.541 --> 00:41:18.050
That's it.
A simple one that definitely makes it easy.
Um,

613
00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.810
there also,
if you could put,

614
00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:23.870
are there other kinds of foods that you would like that you can put other than

615
00:41:23.871 --> 00:41:27.530
chocolate you can make closer to you.
So when you're sitting around watching TV,

616
00:41:27.531 --> 00:41:31.130
can you put food in front of you other than chocolate that you would eat?

617
00:41:31.131 --> 00:41:34.300
And we'd just fill you up.
I like fruit that won't,
that won't keep you away.

618
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.700
Great.
Great.
So,
so that's another example of,

619
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:41.860
of how we can use easy,
we can do this in a,

620
00:41:41.861 --> 00:41:43.250
in a gradual process.

621
00:41:43.251 --> 00:41:46.940
Like don't just necessarily throw all the chocolate out of the house if you

622
00:41:46.941 --> 00:41:47.810
don't think that will work.

623
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:51.290
But you can start with just putting fruit in front of you and eating the fruit

624
00:41:51.291 --> 00:41:52.710
or other food,
um,

625
00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:56.600
in what you'll find is that as that becomes a routine,

626
00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.470
it'll become ingrained in grand in your brain every day you'll start doing it

627
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:04.010
and it'll become a neuro hack.
So you might think,

628
00:42:04.011 --> 00:42:06.950
I'm not capable of stopping myself from eating chocolate.

629
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:10.910
But as you see day after day that you're eating fruit,
instead,

630
00:42:10.911 --> 00:42:13.760
you'll realize there's nothing wrong with me.

631
00:42:13.761 --> 00:42:17.190
It's not like I'm just wired to have to have this chocolate.
Um,

632
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.480
but you're capable of doing it and it will reset your brain and reset your

633
00:42:20.481 --> 00:42:25.270
behavior.
So,
so these are,
these are the ways of,

634
00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:29.810
of incorporating the science of lasting change.
And,

635
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:33.740
and uh,
just this is uh,
a quick,

636
00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.510
a quick example of a,
of a stick with it session.

637
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:43.310
So let's all give Chris a hand for coming up here,

638
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:46.040
being great for doing that.
Thanks so much Chris.

639
00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:53.560
All right now,

640
00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:01.430
now before we,
before we end off,
I'm after all,

641
00:43:01.431 --> 00:43:05.600
I'm a teacher so I can't have you guys leave here without giving you an

642
00:43:05.601 --> 00:43:06.434
assignment.

643
00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:11.720
Now just buy just for showing up here today,

644
00:43:11.721 --> 00:43:12.554
you guys are,

645
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:17.560
have already activated some of the important important forces for lasting change

646
00:43:17.751 --> 00:43:21.020
and,
and being able to change the behavior that you wrote down.

647
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:25.010
And what we want to do is,
is keep that energy going,
keep,

648
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:30.360
keep the motivation going and keep,
keep the forces so,

649
00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:33.620
so with this take home,
this take home assignment,

650
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:36.650
this is something to do immediately to do today.

651
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:42.200
What I want you to do is take the behavior that you wrote down on the card and I

652
00:43:42.201 --> 00:43:46.640
want you to to tell someone else.
You could tell,
it could be a coworker,

653
00:43:46.641 --> 00:43:51.170
it could be a friend,
could be a romantic partner,
it could be a stranger.

654
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:55.850
I want you to tell them,
do you think the behaviors that a,

655
00:43:55.851 --> 00:43:58.640
B or c behavior and why,
why do you think that?

656
00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:02.000
And just by going through this process of discussing it with them,

657
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:06.530
it helps to reinforce in your head.
It will teach you to how to,

658
00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.160
to know the difference and will keep the energy going.

659
00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:15.320
Second eye,
please email me and let me know.

660
00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:17.870
You can reach me at Sean Young,

661
00:44:17.871 --> 00:44:22.070

Phd.

662
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:25.910
Tell me whether you think it's an a,
B or c behavior and why.

663
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.760
Now I went into this,

664
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:32.540
this area because I really wanted to,

665
00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.720
to be able to have an impact on the world and to help people so,

666
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:40.710
so please reach out to me.
I really want to,

667
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:45.480
to be able to try to help with this.
Now before I,

668
00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:49.440
before I finish off,
I've good news to share.

669
00:44:49.441 --> 00:44:51.120
Going back to the story of my brother,

670
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:56.820
he in the year since then,
my brother has,

671
00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:02.190
he's changed his behavior.
He really healthy eating,

672
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:07.200
he exercises,
he
takes his medication,

673
00:45:07.201 --> 00:45:11.190
he does everything that you supposed to do and best of all these really healthy.

674
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:15.420
He's,
he's been feeling great and he's been doing really well and since he's my

675
00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:18.420
brother I can pretend to take some credit for that.

676
00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:25.960
So I'm going to leave you guys and,
and if,

677
00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:31.510
if the information in here,
if this was helpful,
if you like this,
hopefully,

678
00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:34.390
hopefully you learn something and enjoyed it.
If you did,

679
00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:39.070
there's this great book out here that you guys can all read that will give you

680
00:45:39.071 --> 00:45:44.000
more info about it.
You're laughing at this.
Pick my favorite.

681
00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:49.210
I think my favorite thing about this picture is that it makes me wonder the

682
00:45:49.211 --> 00:45:51.700
other photographer was a cat wearing a GoPro.

683
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.360
The squat at the top.
We often,
when we're trying to do things,

684
00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:01.840
we think that if we can't do it,

685
00:46:01.841 --> 00:46:04.540
it's because we're not motivated enough cause we're not inspired.

686
00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:08.800
We don't have enough willpower,
but those are temporary feelings.

687
00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:10.750
They come and they go,

688
00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:16.320
so we can't have behaviors last just based on inspiration.

689
00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:23.730
What we need is to have a process that doesn't matter how we're feeling at the

690
00:46:24.941 --> 00:46:27.760
time.
We'll be able to follow that process.

691
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:34.580
So that's where I say motivation,
inspiration,

692
00:46:34.581 --> 00:46:37.880
and willpower are temporary feelings.

693
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:43.990
The secret to sticking with something is to use a process that you can follow no

694
00:46:45.171 --> 00:46:49.490
matter how you feel.
You guys have been a great audience.

695
00:46:49.491 --> 00:46:50.530
Thank you so much for your,

696
00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:53.060
<v 1>I look forward to here.</v>
