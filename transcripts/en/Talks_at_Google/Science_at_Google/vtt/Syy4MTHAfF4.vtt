1
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.400
It's my absolute pleasure to work on both and some room and Nadine Kreisberg two

2
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.713
talks at Google.

3
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.980
Gordian is a French or tour composer in Chamonix Trans researcher.

4
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.470
She has been 15 years learning and practicing,

5
00:00:20.471 --> 00:00:24.730
one going in shamanic trends and collaborating with researchers in neuroscience

6
00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:25.564
and psychiatry.

7
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.940
Aside from this research coding also collaborate extensively with artists and

8
00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:34.360
these workshops exploring the influence of trends on creativity.

9
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.930
She has written several books,
translated into many languages.

10
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.960
The one that was translated to English is June in [inaudible] footsteps and we

11
00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:44.350
still have a few copies here.

12
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.120
No Dean's work is about accompany people on their journey to understand who they

13
00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:50.120
are and becoming it.

14
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.670
She combines video stores from depth psychology and Dreamwork to business

15
00:00:54.671 --> 00:00:57.910
coaching and leadership training from trauma relief,

16
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.160
Emdr to intergenerational work.

17
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.970
She works in both one on one and group settings in the bay area and around the

18
00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:04.804
world.

19
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.630
I had the pleasure to work with both coding and Nadine personally and I know you

20
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.550
weren't in for a treat.
Please welcome Corrine and Nadine.

21
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.763
<v 1>Hmm,</v>

22
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.373
<v 0>thank you Mario.</v>

23
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.710
Thank you for having us today or super excited and thank you for calling

24
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.760
everyone out there.
And everyone here,

25
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.180
I think you are in for a treat because,
um,

26
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.520
we're going to tell you about an amazing story,

27
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.620
which is the encounter of ancient technology and the newest technology.

28
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.530
Uh,
these days we keep talking about technology is technology,

29
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:45.420
technology and we forget a lot of the ancient technology which we still carry

30
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:48.480
in,
which we can still tap into.
Um,

31
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.570
so we're going to tell you a story at the cutting edge of neuroscience and

32
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:53.280
psychiatry and psychology,

33
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.540
but rooted in ancient schools of wisdom and what's called shamanism.

34
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.320
Um,
I'll give you the main headlines and then we'll go into it.
So,

35
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.480
uh,
you've all heard or experienced or heard about or experienced trance,

36
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.070
a different state of consciousness where we can access information and transform

37
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:16.530
things.
And usually when we think about trends,

38
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:20.520
we either think about shamanic traditions where there's a drum and someone goes

39
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:25.410
and talks to the spirits or we think since the sixties about taking LSD or

40
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:29.430
mushrooms or Iowasca and so on and so forth.
So all those things are,

41
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:33.990
there are more and more,
um,
available here.
Um,
no,

42
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.441
uh,

43
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:39.441
it turns out that we actually can self induced stress without any substance,

44
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:44.220
without anything.
And um,
so that's some good news.

45
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:48.680
It seems that it's a capability that every human being house and cool.

46
00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:53.681
Hannah has uncovered a way for human beings to learn how to self induce when

47
00:02:55.531 --> 00:03:00.430
it's safe for that person.
And then the next is what for,

48
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.540
and that's where the research comes in and you're going to hear about all the

49
00:03:05.541 --> 00:03:10.541
things that go is beginning to do to see cancer research,

50
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.460
um,
research on obesity and all sorts of healing things,
self development,

51
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:19.930
self understanding,
um,
psychiatric issues.
It can,

52
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.770
it can be a tool for many,
many things.
It's just the beginning of that research.

53
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:27.940
So this is a story where he had to tell you,
uh,
how it unfolded.

54
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.360
The reason I'm here is that,
um,

55
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.550
I do have a background in psychology,

56
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:36.940
but also I've worked with many shamans from around the world and I've always

57
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:40.810
thought that on that journey to become ourselves,
we need many,

58
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:43.060
many different tools.
And it was,

59
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.270
it's always amazing to combine psychology and this ability to go to other

60
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:53.530
dimensions.
And I met Cohi in a few years ago,
uh,

61
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:54.220
and we,

62
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.780
we've been working together and we're developing a protocol to integrate

63
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.750
self-induced trends and psychology.
And we're in the process of doing things.

64
00:04:02.751 --> 00:04:05.470
We're already working with people.
It's phenomenal,
the results.

65
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.070
So we'll share a little bit about that.
So that's the reason that I'm here.
But,

66
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:12.280
so let's hear more about you.
And so my first question is like,

67
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:17.281
how does it happen that a Parisian very Cartesian was never dealt with?

68
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:21.070
Any of that ends up developing self induced trance?

69
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.720
<v 3>Um,
all begin in 2001,</v>

70
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.831
uh,

71
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:31.831
I was living in London at the time and dealing with the loss of my father and

72
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.570
dealing with the grief and the,
when my producer,

73
00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:39.760
I was working in the BB World Service,

74
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.390
maybe she won't salvage the radio and what my project,
when,
what,

75
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.250
when my producer told me,
I can send you in Mongolia to do a report,

76
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.500
uh,
for the radio about Mongolian shamanism.
I told her,
oh,
yes.
You know,

77
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.520
because,
um,
the forest,
I could be the bitter.

78
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.510
It could be for me,
you know?
So,
um,
I went in a,
in Mongolia,

79
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.980
uh,
to study by what shamanism could be.
And,

80
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:12.490
um,
I met,
uh,
this shaman,

81
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.740
a friend of mine era,
uh,

82
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.550
accompanied me to,
to this place it in the north of Mongolia,
at the,

83
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.470
in Cheveria,
the border north Siberia.
And,
um,
as soon as the

84
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.590
Shaman began to,
to beat a drum,
uh,

85
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:36.160
it did something there.
We wield,
I,

86
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:40.420
I began to shake and more and more.

87
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:41.590
And I,

88
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.070
I was feeling like I was transforming myself in a wharf.

89
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.680
You know,

90
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.670
I began to hold like a wolf and I feel like I had a,
uh,

91
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.990
poles and the muzzle instead of my nose.

92
00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.310
And it was quite weird because,
uh,
I realize what happened to me,

93
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.650
but I couldn't control anymore.
Plus this was very scary,
you know?

94
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.460
And when the drumming stop,
uh,

95
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.440
there's a man was speaking with my friend and,
uh,

96
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.100
he told her why,
why did you,
why didn't you tell me that she was a chairman?

97
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.230
Because according to him,
uh,
I react like that because I was a shy man.

98
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:28.170
So,
um,
it'll be both.
So now you don't have any choice.
Uh,

99
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.670
we are going to keep you with us for three years,
you know?

100
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:35.600
And so by id I told him no,
it's not possible.

101
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.540
I don't want to stay at the Syrian border for three years with you and the it

102
00:06:40.541 --> 00:06:45.090
was not possible.
And,
uh,
it'll be yes,
yes,
yes,
yes.
It will be possible babies.
She,

103
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.960
I don't want to do that.
He told me,
you don't have any choice.

104
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:53.290
If you don't stay with us and do what the spirits are supposed to teach you,

105
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.030
uh,
you are going to die
by law.

106
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.510
So this is me.

107
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.860
One year later,
we used to go,
uh,
with my drum and,

108
00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:17.430
uh,
he's,
um,
husbands,
uh,
Sherman,
uh,

109
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.790
DG with keeping me,

110
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.650
holding me your during the trends and um,
hi.

111
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:29.240
Hi.
Spend a lot of time in Mongolia,
you know,
uh,
it lasts eight years.

112
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:30.074
Finally,

113
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.380
I went few months a year in Mongolia for free,

114
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.990
uh,
eight years.
And,
uh,
finally,
uh,

115
00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:42.770
I discover how interesting could be trance states.

116
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.143
What is it

117
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.710
that those are the main points is that during the trends you are timeless.

118
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.371
You know,

119
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:57.371
you don't feel it was time and you feel less so pain,

120
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.440
the strength increasing.
Did you see the,

121
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.200
the size of the drum,
you know,
the big one,

122
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:11.210
it's seven kilos,
seven to eight kilos.
So it's very,

123
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.021
very heavy.

124
00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:17.021
And I could manage to use it four hours drumming and beating the drum for hours

125
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.420
without any,
uh,
any pain.

126
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:27.420
So census how shoppers and um,

127
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.330
the sense of self in modified of course you feel like you are an animal,
a wharf,

128
00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:36.310
but it's not only one animal,
it can be,
uh,
it can be a,
um,

129
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.610
an entity can be a,
all the animals.
It can be a lot of things

130
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.160
and information.
This is a main point because during the trance,

131
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:51.190
a shaman is using this special state to reach a skew.

132
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:56.730
What he equals a so called world's periods just to get information's.

133
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.400
He is not able to,

134
00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.010
to get in another state of consciousness.

135
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:06.810
So this is a really important about the trans
thought.

136
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:08.250
My question was why,

137
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:13.670
why this can put me in such a state and an interesting state.

138
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:19.050
So I decided to,
to,
to,
to go through scientist and my,

139
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:23.670
my dream was to record my brain,

140
00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:27.930
you know who EEG but the,
the scientists,
it's him

141
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.690
is [inaudible] is,
I'm working in a,

142
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:37.560
in Alberta,
in the hospital as a psychotherapist.

143
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.480
And it taught me if you want to be recorded with a knee EEG,
you are gone.

144
00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.970
Um,
do the trance without the drum,
you know,

145
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.350
because uh,

146
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.260
when you are drumming and when the electrodes are connected to the,

147
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.890
to the computer,
you are going to break everything in the,
in the laboratory,

148
00:09:58.891 --> 00:09:59.610
you know,

149
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:04.080
so I don't know what you are going to do and how you are going to do this.

150
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:08.130
But if you want to do the experience you will have to uh,

151
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.960
self induce and use.
Exactly.
So I didn't know how to,

152
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.720
how to self and use because in,
in Mongolia,

153
00:10:15.721 --> 00:10:20.090
every Shana and use a a drum.
So I were thinking about,

154
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.780
um,
the,
the music of the drum.
Trying to remember the music of the drum.

155
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:28.200
It was not working.
And um,
I remember,

156
00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:32.510
but at the beginning of the Trans,
I was always shaking like that,
you know.

157
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:36.570
So,
uh,
I began to,

158
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:40.470
to check and,
and um,

159
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.550
I could go back to the trans by this way.

160
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.330
So it was my safe self injection.
I didn't know yet,

161
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.740
but it was myself and election and everybody and his own self injection.

162
00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:56.910
But at the time I realized that this was working.

163
00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.660
I could shake and I cook food,
the trend.
So when I um,

164
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.090
I've been ready,
the Jeff Lawler it on me.

165
00:11:06.091 --> 00:11:10.500
Okay,
now you already,
so we can uh,
do the regionals.
So,

166
00:11:10.501 --> 00:11:12.630
but decided to record me.

167
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:17.631
I'm in the normal state and in a translate states.

168
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.050
And uh,

169
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:24.050
first I'd like to show you a little video about what is a self induced trance.

170
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.140
Well this is this what you are going to see is in another laboratory,

171
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.990
but it's more or less what I did in,
in uh,

172
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:38.020
the Alberta Hospital and I was moving much less in the Alberta hospital than,

173
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:43.890
than here.
So you are going to see how uh,
it's easy to sell FanDuel's a trans,

174
00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:47.040
but what the trends can teach us.

175
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.290
You are a I am,

176
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.500
I am doing some sounds I am completely unable,

177
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.580
unable to do in a normal state.

178
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:59.010
I am doing some chanting and you are a,

179
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.790
you will be amazed by what we are able to do in this stage.

180
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:08.020
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

181
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.570
<v 3>You all going to early Sono language.</v>

182
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.950
Nobody can understand this language.
It's not identify it as a

183
00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.710
language,
but uh,
we think it's a pre language,

184
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:26.730
no kind of pure information because when I do this language with coming out

185
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:33.180
Alona I don't think about what I am going to say,
but when I do this language,
I,

186
00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:38.450
I understand the sense,
the meaning of the language,
but uh,

187
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.890
nobody can understand.

188
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.160
<v 1>Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.</v>

189
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:23.820
<v 3>So it's done very quick training.</v>

190
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.700
Tomorrow you'll train and Domo,
it's easy to go for the twins.

191
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.090
It was supposed to feel

192
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:42.300
a little bit of water in front of me and the results.

193
00:13:42.301 --> 00:13:47.301
I wanted to know if I could get some information from this water and to know you

194
00:13:48.921 --> 00:13:50.820
a little bit of the belt.

195
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:20.283
<v 1>Okay.</v>

196
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.360
<v 3>This is a language I was speaking about that.</v>

197
00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.080
<v 0>So there were different types of water,
river,</v>

198
00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.310
an ocean and poisoned and not poisoned.

199
00:14:46.311 --> 00:14:50.000
And they wanted to see if in the state of trance she could get the information

200
00:14:50.001 --> 00:14:51.400
of which water,
which,

201
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.530
<v 4>and of course she was able,</v>

202
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:39.950
<v 3>this is a sample of what you can,
you can do in a transplant.</v>

203
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:44.420
Each trance is difference.
Uh,
as we can discover after,

204
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.040
um,

205
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:51.250
each one developed a kind of trance and it's not abusive like that,

206
00:15:51.321 --> 00:15:54.590
but each person who is doing self and using trip,

207
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:59.620
Trans cell phone use trends is able to reveal some own capabilities.

208
00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.430
And uh,
so it's different for each.

209
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:10.510
So after what I had to buy to do the EEG recording and um,

210
00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:16.080
uh,
here is one of the first,
um,

211
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.240
you majors,
I don't,

212
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:22.430
on the left it's a me on a trends and on,

213
00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:27.380
on the right to nine on the,
on the right,
uh,
the control group,
women,

214
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:32.690
uh,
80 people a more or less,
yes,
80 women and uh,

215
00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:35.420
they wanted to compare,
uh,

216
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:39.610
the brain activity for the control group and,
and uh,

217
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.140
does this me and you know,

218
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:47.230
the image of a remark that the brain activity was a increase in the,

219
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.150
in the place where the Arrow is.

220
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.040
And this is me on the trends on the left and me,
uh,
on the,

221
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:05.220
on the normal state.

222
00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:10.110
And there is a difference too with the brain activity different and the

223
00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:16.770
increase in this special place.
So,
um,
to,

224
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:18.180
to sum up,

225
00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:22.920
this is where it is increased and where it is decreased.

226
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.280
So it depends on the bandwidth.

227
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:35.283
<v 1>Okay.</v>

228
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:42.440
<v 3>And he also,
the results before trends,
the EEG is normal,</v>

229
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.900
completely normal during the trends.

230
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.860
There is a big modification of the brain activity.
So,
uh,
means that,

231
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:55.020
uh,
it's not magic.
You know,
the ethnologist

232
00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:01.170
had the idea that it was cultural.
The trans was a cultural thing,

233
00:18:01.171 --> 00:18:05.440
but a law,
we,
we,
we did show that it,

234
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.710
it was a cognitive phenomenon.

235
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.580
Oh,
varies a right hemisphere ferric predominance.

236
00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:22.510
And after the trends,
the EEG was back to normal.

237
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:29.430
<v 0>So this was the first time ever that a brain under Shimony trends was studied by</v>

238
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.513
scientists.

239
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.960
And just a few months ago they published the results in a scientific journal.

240
00:18:35.961 --> 00:18:39.790
So it's the first time ever that people thought about it,

241
00:18:39.791 --> 00:18:41.470
but it was the first time it was proved,

242
00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.830
<v 3>it took 10 years for this article to be published,</v>

243
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.510
10 years.
So now you can consult it.

244
00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.400
And this is a conclusion.

245
00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.440
<v 0>So it can be a powerful tool.
So Colin,
my question is once,</v>

246
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:04.940
so you did all that research and you understood you're not crazy,

247
00:19:04.941 --> 00:19:06.530
there's something happening in your brain,

248
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:10.460
why did you decide to then develop a tool to share it with others?

249
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:16.760
<v 3>Um,
because thanks to,
to this,
these researchers,
I,
uh,</v>

250
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.990
we,
we show that it was a cognitive phenomena.
So,

251
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.110
uh,

252
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:26.550
I think it was for everybody and if I was able to self and user trends,

253
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.750
it was possible for everybody.
So the,

254
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:34.810
the drum is a efficient to put somebody in a trends for one out of 100,000

255
00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:38.904
people.

256
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:43.140
So it's zero.zero zero zero 1%.

257
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:49.370
There was only 30 Sherman in Mongolia for a population of free million.
No.

258
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.540
So it's very few.

259
00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.770
So I was thinking maybe it's a drum is not efficient enough.

260
00:19:54.771 --> 00:19:58.400
He's not powerful enough to put everybody in a trance.

261
00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:03.310
So I was thinking about a tool we could do with IMTS,

262
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.630
um,
to improve this effect.

263
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.580
So high I had as a musician and a composer,
I um,

264
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:19.700
uh,
I found the in in the drumming some parts very,
very,

265
00:20:19.701 --> 00:20:21.560
very,
very powerful on Migraine.

266
00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:27.340
I couldn't stop to go through trends when I was listening to this special little

267
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:32.090
loops from the drunk.
And I get this loops to the,

268
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.300
to the side to some scientist I am working with.

269
00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:40.780
And the tried to find how and the why is this special sequences?

270
00:20:41.391 --> 00:20:41.601
Well,

271
00:20:41.601 --> 00:20:46.601
so powerful and the tray to empower them much more.

272
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.740
And,
uh,
we,
we create a new tool.

273
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.540
I had the chance to test this new tool.
It's own loop.

274
00:20:55.541 --> 00:20:59.890
We call it a sound loop in liberals,
you know,
in the art school,

275
00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:04.891
in the national art school in France where I am doing workshop to,

276
00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:08.050
to,
to show them.

277
00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:12.740
But the moment of creativity is kind of a trance to one,
you know.
So,

278
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:13.833
uh,
the,

279
00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:18.910
the agreed to test the sound loop and the result was this

280
00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:26.130
16 out of 20 and I took a trends.

281
00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.920
So we realized that,
okay

282
00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.720
everybody,
or more or less goof word trends,

283
00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.600
but the next step was to,

284
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.600
to try and to teach them how to self and use it.

285
00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.053
<v 1>Wow.</v>

286
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:47.150
<v 0>Well he tested it with many,</v>

287
00:21:47.151 --> 00:21:51.080
many more groups so that you understand that of many different cultures and

288
00:21:51.081 --> 00:21:51.861
different places.

289
00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:56.000
We tested it also in California and a number of groups and the percentage was

290
00:21:56.001 --> 00:21:58.730
always very consistent.
It was about 80% of the people,

291
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.170
very often people who have never experienced trends when they are exposed to the

292
00:22:03.171 --> 00:22:06.260
sound loop,
boom,
they experienced something.

293
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.660
<v 3>And we,
we the the artist we,</v>

294
00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.620
I will thinking it's easy with artist,

295
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.420
you know the know the state of course their noses thing.

296
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.270
But with researchers it will be different.

297
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.540
So we did test with all the researcher we are working with and it was the same,

298
00:22:25.381 --> 00:22:29.370
the same result at the first,
at the first listening,

299
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.160
they could go through trends,
80% of them could,

300
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:38.760
could be able to go through trends and that take on a fellow listening.

301
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.170
Everybody was able to go food trends.
So it was,

302
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.970
<v 0>and in general what happens is like if during that experience he's a person has</v>

303
00:22:47.971 --> 00:22:51.180
an experience and their body starts shaking or something like this,

304
00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.050
whatever happens to them first might be their key to self induce.

305
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:58.050
In the same way that Colin said that to self induce,

306
00:22:58.051 --> 00:23:01.710
she went back to the gesture she was making at the beginning.
So in the same way,

307
00:23:01.711 --> 00:23:02.730
that's what can happen.

308
00:23:02.731 --> 00:23:05.900
So this is what we're doing now when we're working with people on where,

309
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.690
when it's safe for them,
we're teaching them to self,
you do it,

310
00:23:09.691 --> 00:23:10.460
this is what we're doing.

311
00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.440
We're just observing what happens on their face or in their body.

312
00:23:13.441 --> 00:23:17.960
And then we get them to repeat that and then boom,
they can go.
Um,

313
00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:22.620
the thing is when someone goes in that state,
the person,
he's always conscious.

314
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:27.360
So it is always that observer seeing what's going on and the person can come

315
00:23:27.361 --> 00:23:28.530
back whenever they want,

316
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.910
which is very different from taking something because when you take something,

317
00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:34.800
you are under the influence,

318
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:39.630
right of the thing because then there is the physical consequences in your brain

319
00:23:39.631 --> 00:23:42.780
and your body of whatever you're taking.
So this is a big difference.

320
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:49.580
Then a very interesting and important part of it was for instance,
you started,

321
00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:53.010
uh,
I can talk about Francis.
Um,

322
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.920
and because this is the beginning of a lot of research,
someone in Paris,

323
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:03.110
one of the top researchers in France,
one of the people managing the cnrs,

324
00:24:03.111 --> 00:24:05.910
which his leg,
the top,
there's no such thing in the US,

325
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:10.280
but it's like Nih plus Mit plus all the top research labs in the country.

326
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:15.170
Um,
he was diagnosed with a very bad cancer,

327
00:24:15.171 --> 00:24:19.700
prostate cancer metastasize to the spine and he was given just a few months to

328
00:24:19.701 --> 00:24:22.040
live and he was already paralyzed.

329
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:27.560
He was barely walking with a stick,
couldn't move the hips,
nothing really.

330
00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:33.030
Um,
and because science couldn't do anything for him,
uh,

331
00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:37.520
he,
he ended up with Colin and Colin said,
look,
we can try.

332
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:38.720
We can try to sell him.
Nope.

333
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:44.530
And I can try to sell you to self Angelo to plants to show you how to Seth

334
00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.610
Andrews.
He told me,
okay.
Okay.

335
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:50.750
The next video with the first listening of the some loop.

336
00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:55.740
So you're going to see is ego to food trends.
He ended,

337
00:24:55.741 --> 00:24:57.110
took a trend and

338
00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.720
you are going to see the hips moving like,
like hell,
you know,

339
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:06.650
and just watch the hips paralyzed and just watch what happens to them in the

340
00:25:06.651 --> 00:25:09.830
state of trance for someone who has never experienced trans before.

341
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.160
Very rational scientist,
researcher.

342
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:28.993
<v 5>Hmm.</v>

343
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.533
Hmm.

344
00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:54.930
<v 0>So no,
Noah osteopathic,</v>

345
00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:58.340
no physiotherapist he was working with could understand any of it.

346
00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:03.830
And then after that,
what happened was that he started self inducing every day.

347
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.300
Even in the middle of the night,

348
00:26:05.301 --> 00:26:10.301
he's buddy would wake him up and just start a trance and he,

349
00:26:10.491 --> 00:26:15.220
he's research is about studying,
uh,
like developing an MRI to study metabolism,

350
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:16.063
the metabolism.

351
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:21.530
And he realized basically that his body was waking up and starting the trends at

352
00:26:21.531 --> 00:26:25.090
the same time,
the cancer cells were,
uh,

353
00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.190
in their own biorhythm spreading.
So at the same time,

354
00:26:28.191 --> 00:26:33.191
he's buddy automatically was waking up doing the trends and now we're 14 months

355
00:26:33.621 --> 00:26:38.240
later,
he's in total remission.
He's completely healed and what they'd still need.

356
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.400
It's not only thanks to Lisa,

357
00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:44.970
you do a lot of nutrition saint she's diets and things like that.

358
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:49.270
<v 3>But this portrayal helped him to recover the body,</v>

359
00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.530
the body,

360
00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:54.380
<v 0>the by saying he's walking now,
no more stick and so on and so forth.</v>

361
00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:59.010
And so very intrigued by what it did to his body.
He is he,

362
00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:03.500
for us or for other reasons,
he's created a foundation to research again,

363
00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:04.880
all that stuff with the metabolism.

364
00:27:04.881 --> 00:27:09.690
But one of the part of that research will be to see how can self-induced trans

365
00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.420
help in cases of cancer.

366
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:16.400
So that leads us to the next step to the next part of our talk,

367
00:27:16.401 --> 00:27:21.080
which is how can it be used,
this tool.
So one is this,

368
00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.730
do you want to see a few more words about the foundation or Francis?

369
00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:30.960
<v 3>Uh,
no,
he's gonna,
he's to work on advanced missiles to,</v>

370
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.810
to cure people on this.

371
00:27:32.811 --> 00:27:37.811
One of this will be one of them and he's working on metabolism.

372
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:42.110
So we will be able to see how the trends can act,

373
00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:47.090
have an effect or not on,
on the cell metabolism.

374
00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:52.240
So this part of the working he like to do and he remarked that there is a

375
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.650
synaptic trace,
um,

376
00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:03.080
left on the synapse,
uh,
after the trans,
you know,

377
00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:08.210
and he could manage to,
to reconnect conscientiously,

378
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:13.070
uh,
to this,
uh,
Synopsis Trace.

379
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:16.580
After the trends,
though there is a really a,
a parental,

380
00:28:16.581 --> 00:28:19.370
very real mark in the,
in the brain,

381
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:22.750
which could stay and,
uh,

382
00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:29.600
had to,
um,
way of learning,
uh,
some,

383
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:34.160
some new,
uh,
what the body can,
can do.

384
00:28:34.161 --> 00:28:38.240
And what the body has to teach you and what would you do like you to do?

385
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.820
<v 0>Yes.
The second field of research for you,
now that you're starting in psychiatry.</v>

386
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:50.430
So you've began to work with,
um,
a psychiatry clinic in France,

387
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:56.190
um,
uh,
20 psychiatry's.
They're experienced a sell on loop.

388
00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:00.000
And you can imagine that it's difficult for them to just let go and go into

389
00:29:00.001 --> 00:29:03.270
trends and make weird noises because it might sound and look like they are our

390
00:29:03.271 --> 00:29:07.650
patients,
you know?
So there might be some resistance in that group,
but actually,

391
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:11.580
again,
almost all of them experienced trends,
which is amazing.

392
00:29:11.581 --> 00:29:13.320
And of course it was the first time for them.

393
00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.930
And so you're developing a program now,

394
00:29:15.931 --> 00:29:20.700
a pilot program with them to see how it can be used in case of dissociative

395
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:22.050
patients.
Okay.

396
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:26.720
<v 3>In this case,
so a dissociative disorder,
depression,</v>

397
00:29:26.721 --> 00:29:31.650
panic attacks,
and PTSD.
So this is just the beginning.
We didn't

398
00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.760
do anything yet,

399
00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:39.790
but we got the authorization to start this pilot program.

400
00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:45.130
The name of psychiatry.
See Dr. Allen One and uh,
is very,

401
00:29:45.131 --> 00:29:48.760
uh,
very eager to begin this kind of,
uh,
researchers.

402
00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.120
<v 0>Yeah.
One of the examples,</v>

403
00:29:50.121 --> 00:29:55.121
just to give you an example is the idea is that when a client has a patient,

404
00:29:55.221 --> 00:29:57.200
has a dissociative episode,
you know,

405
00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:02.180
schizophrenia person and they just go and it's usually extremely painful,

406
00:30:02.181 --> 00:30:06.050
extremely traumatizing,
difficult to come back and so on and so forth.

407
00:30:06.051 --> 00:30:08.570
With the trends it might,

408
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:13.930
it might help them go in a controlled way in that state and learn to come back

409
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:15.860
much more gently.

410
00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:20.360
And if they learned the the path back and forth,

411
00:30:20.361 --> 00:30:22.130
but in a gentle and Safeway,

412
00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.840
maybe it can diminish the trauma and the pain when they just have an episode.

413
00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.860
Maybe,
maybe it can do something about the frequency of the episodes.

414
00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.760
We don't know you're going to see.
So that's one thing.
And the PTSD,
uh,

415
00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:39.170
that's a really important thing because of course you might have heard there's a

416
00:30:39.171 --> 00:30:44.171
lot of research using LSD or Psilocybin for PTSD and depression and all sorts of

417
00:30:46.311 --> 00:30:49.700
things like that.
But there might be side effects to those things.

418
00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:55.090
So now it would be interesting again to use self induced trance.
He said,

419
00:30:55.100 --> 00:31:00.080
No side effect for those things.
And you're developing a program with again,

420
00:31:00.081 --> 00:31:03.680
the CNRS and the brain machine interface.

421
00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.810
<v 3>Um,
what,
what is important,
it's no big to,
to,</v>

422
00:31:08.811 --> 00:31:10.470
to be able to self and a trench.

423
00:31:10.471 --> 00:31:15.130
You need the key before to go through the state and to know what is a state,

424
00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:19.980
you know,
to the key can be the song loop then,
but French laboratory,

425
00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.260
uh,
ask,
uh,

426
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:26.580
if it could be possible to help them to develop a brain machine interface to

427
00:31:28.291 --> 00:31:29.790
help people to go for the Trans.

428
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:34.950
And after that we'll elbow elbow to safe and end users the trends.

429
00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:39.160
So this is a new,
a new project we have with the French,
uh,

430
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.400
laboratory to,

431
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
to set up this kind of brain machine computer on this with this,

432
00:31:47.311 --> 00:31:49.410
with a new adventure.
Yeah.

433
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:54.620
<v 0>Cultural reality.
Because of course that might lend itself very well,
you know,</v>

434
00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:00.320
to taking people on a journey where they can then self juice.

435
00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:06.120
The next field,
uh,
educational field.

436
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:12.210
<v 3>You,
you,
you saw,
uh,
during the chance I am able to do something in clinical,
no,</v>

437
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:15.010
I am not able to do in my normal state.

438
00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:19.700
So some other researcher in another laboratory.
I think that,
uh,

439
00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.670
it could be interesting to test two to test what we,

440
00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:28.690
we could be able to learn during as a state trends because we realize that some

441
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.910
inhibited system,
um,
uh,

442
00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:38.860
removed during our moved,
during the,
during the trance state.

443
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.190
So it's

444
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.180
<v 0>should be why you are so able to do something we don't know.</v>

445
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:47.720
We are able to do no.
So,
but like to,

446
00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:51.620
to use this specialty to,
to,
to,

447
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:57.280
to test and to try to know where and how we could learn and what we could learn

448
00:32:58.461 --> 00:33:02.600
in this special thing.
We all know we have so many later and capabilities,
right?

449
00:33:02.601 --> 00:33:06.110
And for instance,
in a,
in circumstance of high danger,

450
00:33:06.111 --> 00:33:10.520
we certainly can run faster than we ever thought we could.

451
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:15.170
So we have those capabilities in us.
And so,
so many.
So the idea is like,
okay,

452
00:33:15.171 --> 00:33:20.010
let's try in itself into state and see what we can explore.
And,
um,

453
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:24.290
the last 20 psychology,
and this is where we collaborating.
And,
um,

454
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:29.300
now it's been a year.
So there's more,
um,
I mean we,
we,

455
00:33:29.301 --> 00:33:33.480
we've worked with a number of people,
so now we can see a bit how it works.
So,
um,

456
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.310
it's fascinating to see what happens when you,

457
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.440
when you combine verbal and nonverbal.

458
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.980
Basically when you combine the more classical tools of psychology,

459
00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:47.981
even dreamwork which already goes into the unconscious somewhere and Colin's

460
00:33:48.141 --> 00:33:51.710
work and the capability to self induced.
So just to give you an example,

461
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.210
um,

462
00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:58.210
with a few people I work with and we go deep in that kind of one on one work,

463
00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:01.910
there were things we could not understand where it was coming from.
You know,

464
00:34:01.911 --> 00:34:06.911
like some deep anxiety or some deep phobias and the person we just couldn't and

465
00:34:07.251 --> 00:34:10.250
nothing was appearing in the dreams because that person was too stressed to even

466
00:34:10.251 --> 00:34:12.710
remember their dreams or you know,
whatever was happening.

467
00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:16.970
And so we couldn't trace the,
you know,
the core,

468
00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:21.380
the root cause of that problem.
And if we can't understand the root cause,

469
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:22.370
we can't change it.

470
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:27.140
And then that person who had never experienced or ever,
ever,

471
00:34:27.141 --> 00:34:30.530
ever experienced strengths was exposed to the cell and loop.
Boom.

472
00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:32.870
It was phenomenal what she experienced.

473
00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:37.640
And then we spent more time with her and we were able,

474
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:41.540
so she was able to self induce.
And then when she was before stuff in juicing,

475
00:34:41.541 --> 00:34:44.180
we ask the question because that's the thing,
when you're going to trends,

476
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:47.570
you can either just go and see what shows up in terms of material,

477
00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.460
which you see what you feel,

478
00:34:49.461 --> 00:34:52.010
which were body does or actually you can ask a question,

479
00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:53.450
you can have an intention.

480
00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:58.850
And so we did that a number of times where we asked a question about key points

481
00:34:58.851 --> 00:35:03.350
we could never understand and she got answers that I don't know how long it

482
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:07.220
would have taken in the more classical therapy,
um,

483
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.420
to get those answers.

484
00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:13.420
And it comes in a way which is so real that it gets etched in the sales.

485
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.490
You know,
it gets etched in your understanding in a different way.

486
00:35:16.491 --> 00:35:18.920
It's not intellectual because you really feel it.

487
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:20.870
And so it was a big breakthrough.

488
00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.770
And then I come even when we do the integration,
the verbal integration,

489
00:35:24.771 --> 00:35:25.401
because again,

490
00:35:25.401 --> 00:35:30.140
and Coleen keeps insisting on that to have a trans experience of just for the

491
00:35:30.141 --> 00:35:33.800
sake of it,
she calls it,
told them an edge,
which I love in French.
You know,

492
00:35:33.801 --> 00:35:37.280
like when you do a car who sell a thing,
it's like just entertainment.

493
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.570
It's just an Aha moment,
you know?

494
00:35:39.571 --> 00:35:44.430
And then what if you don't work on the material that's being revealed if you

495
00:35:44.431 --> 00:35:48.660
don't work on how to integrate it in your life,
what's the point?
I mean,

496
00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:50.460
and worst case actually,

497
00:35:50.461 --> 00:35:55.020
what gets exposed is actually traumatizing or painful material.

498
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:58.770
And if there's nobody to help you integrate that,
it's actually dangerous.

499
00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.210
So we,
that

500
00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.320
<v 3>the spirits are saying yes,
right?</v>

501
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:13.710
<v 0>So,
so this is what we're developing.
We're developing a protocol,
um,</v>

502
00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.050
to also teach people to self-induced when it's safe and so on and so forth.

503
00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:19.070
Individuals.

504
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:25.100
And I'm so as you can hear about all those things,

505
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:29.210
um,
this is an ancestral timeless capability

506
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:32.060
in every human being.

507
00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:38.240
But now with science and technology we can explore in differently and where it's

508
00:36:38.241 --> 00:36:41.150
like really beginning to discover a new continent.

509
00:36:41.151 --> 00:36:45.260
Every single we're describing in how to use the tool for all those different

510
00:36:45.261 --> 00:36:47.240
things.
It's just the beginning of the research.

511
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:50.830
<v 3>So we don't have any answer yet,</v>

512
00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:56.340
but this is the beginning and the readership are eager to go through that and

513
00:36:57.761 --> 00:37:00.430
the thing,
but it is promising.

514
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:04.550
But so that's it for fall now and uh,

515
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:06.400
we have to say to the tweet,

516
00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:11.660
it's not possible to lead this kind of tool for everybody in all ways.

517
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:16.670
It will be just for people train with it and positions and psychiatry and people

518
00:37:19.871 --> 00:37:23.230
were able to,
to manage this without any danger.

519
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:29.220
<v 0>So that's it.
Very exciting things.
We have a few minutes for questions.</v>

520
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:30.323
So

521
00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:31.903
<v 6>yes</v>

522
00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:41.270
speaking,
no they don't.
There are people drinking anymore.
Okay.

523
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:44.790
<v 7>So the first question is,</v>

524
00:37:44.791 --> 00:37:49.380
you mentioned the brain machine interface.

525
00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.780
So what's the idea behind that?
Like the whole,

526
00:37:52.781 --> 00:37:57.781
like you would have some sort of a machine that affects like a brain waves and

527
00:38:01.171 --> 00:38:03.250
stuff and then put you into a trust.

528
00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.230
<v 3>The computer will analyze you.
You,</v>

529
00:38:06.231 --> 00:38:10.850
you have a electrodes on your head on in the brain machine system and the

530
00:38:10.851 --> 00:38:15.851
computer will analyze the brain waves and help you to go through trends through

531
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:17.980
a special,
uh,

532
00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.830
<v 7>there would just read your brain waves and,</v>

533
00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:27.110
<v 3>and help you to go through a trans.
Because I am,
I'm gonna give my head,</v>

534
00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:27.531
you know,

535
00:38:27.531 --> 00:38:32.531
to do some marks and to educate what is trance state to the computer.

536
00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:38.580
And on this a researcher will be able to,

537
00:38:38.581 --> 00:38:41.820
to create,
um,
Como [inaudible].

538
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:45.770
<v 0>Yeah.
So basically by recording her,
putting that in the program,</v>

539
00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.620
the computer program will know what,

540
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:52.640
where the brain of that person should go to access that trends.
And so,

541
00:38:52.641 --> 00:38:53.770
so that's what,
that's what the

542
00:38:55.470 --> 00:39:00.090
<v 7>yeah,
exactly.
Yeah,
exactly.</v>

543
00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.180
Exactly.
Are you going though?
Neurofeedback?
Okay.

544
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:06.220
And then the second question is,

545
00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:12.010
was the difference between this chance and then self hypnosis?

546
00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:13.410
<v 3>I know we,</v>

547
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:18.330
we did some research in the MRI just to know what parts of the brain were

548
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:21.310
activated during the,

549
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:26.160
just when I decide to go through trends or when somebody decided to go to an

550
00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.330
independent hypnosis experience.

551
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:33.750
And the MRI showed that it was different,

552
00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:39.420
a place in the brain which will activated during a trans,

553
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:43.780
this kind of trends and the hypnosis trance.

554
00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:48.940
<v 7>Okay.
So you're saying it's a different thing,
what seems to be,</v>

555
00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.390
seems to me,
however

556
00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:54.010
<v 3>different you both of the brain activation.</v>

557
00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.180
<v 5>Okay.</v>

558
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.930
<v 7>And I have another,
maybe a wild one,</v>

559
00:39:57.931 --> 00:40:02.810
but I learned a lot would be the difference between this and the state of,

560
00:40:02.811 --> 00:40:05.100
and a lie to the person.
Like,
you know,

561
00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:08.910
some guru that achieve like,
you know,

562
00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:13.220
<v 3>hello.
Uh,
we did some,
some,
uh,
EEG experience too.</v>

563
00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:18.030
And um,
uh,
they realized that between the Trans,

564
00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.730
uh,
commodity to hot,

565
00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:26.660
<v 0>yeah.
When the person is resting in my to address</v>

566
00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.490
<v 3>great wrestling state between the trenches,
well,</v>

567
00:40:29.491 --> 00:40:34.491
similar to the meditation experience and people will meditating a lot and it's

568
00:40:37.921 --> 00:40:40.650
kind of
same.

569
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:45.660
There's the same till I had,
I hired and I had,

570
00:40:45.661 --> 00:40:50.460
so I had,
I had experience with some AI in enlightment during,

571
00:40:50.461 --> 00:40:54.240
during some trenches.
Not each time,
but uh,
I had,

572
00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:59.060
<v 0>so that was really fascinating that in the resting state,</v>

573
00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:04.640
her brain is the same as the one of extremely advanced meditators who have

574
00:41:04.641 --> 00:41:09.380
meditated for decades.
We,
because they compared her to Buddhist monks basically.

575
00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:11.763
<v 5>Thank you.</v>

576
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.230
<v 3>Yes.
So they're in the trance state.</v>

577
00:41:16.231 --> 00:41:19.830
There's a resting period between the transitions,
is that what you're saying?

578
00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.950
Equals a special,
a experiment experimentation.

579
00:41:22.951 --> 00:41:27.951
So they asked me to go through trends to stop and another one and stop and

580
00:41:28.861 --> 00:41:33.830
another one they thought they could,
they could eat my brain too,
to know what,

581
00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.090
<v 0>but actually I just wanted to add that my own experience,</v>

582
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:42.280
self reported experience of a lot of people who've I learned with her.
Um,

583
00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:44.110
it's a,
it's a sort of high,
you know,

584
00:41:44.111 --> 00:41:49.111
like it's a sort of place of empowerment and high after the trends that might be

585
00:41:49.331 --> 00:41:51.700
that thing of in life man,
close to it.
So yeah.

586
00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:56.030
<v 3>And can you tell us which part of the brain the this trans activates it.</v>

587
00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.440
It's written into the article you are going to see.
Yes.
It's not my field.

588
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.650
I'm committed.

589
00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:04.180
One of the last things that you mentioned that you said that you don't have the

590
00:42:04.181 --> 00:42:06.790
answers yet and I was just wondering what some of the most pressing questions.

591
00:42:06.791 --> 00:42:08.830
Where would you that you have in other words you you want,

592
00:42:08.831 --> 00:42:11.970
the last thing is you mentioned accordion [inaudible] speak slowly because it's

593
00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.800
short.
You want it to last things you said was that you don't have,
he said,

594
00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:17.950
oh we don't have the answers yet and I was only wondering what like what are

595
00:42:17.951 --> 00:42:19.900
some of the most pressing questions that you're looking for?

596
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:25.110
It's a quick history.
The,
the answer we are looking for and does it works in,

597
00:42:25.111 --> 00:42:30.040
in Ptsd that it worked with the dissociation tribal,
does it work?

598
00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.580
This is the answer we'd like to have,
but we,
we,

599
00:42:33.581 --> 00:42:38.380
we tried on a few people's,
so it's promising,
but it's not a,

600
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:41.520
you know,
you can,
you can count on this and

601
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:46.690
five people is not all,
you know,
so we have to go further.

602
00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:50.310
<v 8>That's the second thing of book.
The two of us here,</v>

603
00:42:50.311 --> 00:42:53.280
we're both documentary filmmakers and we're working on a project where there's
a,

604
00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.340
there's a doctor in the MD phd that worked on something in the fifties and

605
00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:00.120
sixties is fairly similar to this work at least in touching some of it.
And uh,

606
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:02.830
but no one really listened to him.
And I was wondering like,

607
00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:05.640
how do you have similar issues?
And in other words,

608
00:43:05.641 --> 00:43:09.460
are there trends in some sense?
Um,
uh,

609
00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:14.520
do you have any issues with getting,
getting the,
some of your research seen,
uh,

610
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:15.151
by it either way,

611
00:43:15.151 --> 00:43:17.730
the academic community or other communities that you're just kind of getting the

612
00:43:17.731 --> 00:43:20.850
attention of people because just because it's on,
it's not necessarily a,
yes,

613
00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:24.960
there's,
there's,
we seem to be opening a psilocybin and Lsd,

614
00:43:24.961 --> 00:43:28.680
some of these things as being options for treating PTSD.
And other things.

615
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:33.390
And so I just,
I,
my question is,
um,
do you have any issues with,
with uh,

616
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:37.020
beginning your work,
seen,
seen and understood easily?

617
00:43:37.021 --> 00:43:38.010
I guess by the academic community

618
00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.780
<v 0>it is controversial for people who just don't know,</v>

619
00:43:40.781 --> 00:43:43.810
so they hear that they associated to his weird things,
you know,

620
00:43:43.811 --> 00:43:46.530
just out of ignorance.
Um,

621
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:50.080
and so for Coleen I can say it,
she couldn't say it.

622
00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:53.650
It's been an amazingly courageous journey.
Uh,

623
00:43:53.651 --> 00:43:57.220
and also she's in France,
you know,
it's not California,

624
00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:01.090
it's a little bit less or it used to be a little bit less open to all those

625
00:44:01.091 --> 00:44:05.800
things.
Um,
so,
so yes,
it's been difficult,

626
00:44:05.801 --> 00:44:10.360
but that's cool.
It says if it hasn't been that difficult it would,

627
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.640
maybe she would not have been that rigorous in her scientific grounding of that

628
00:44:16.661 --> 00:44:17.830
work.
You know,

629
00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:22.330
because she's so much wants to make sure that nobody can find the breach into

630
00:44:22.331 --> 00:44:25.840
that work and nobody can say,
you know,
it's Voodoo is Shama and blah,
blah,
blah.

631
00:44:25.841 --> 00:44:27.010
With their associations,

632
00:44:27.011 --> 00:44:31.920
with those words that it forced her to do it in a super rigorous way.
Yes,
yes.

633
00:44:31.921 --> 00:44:35.930
But it is challenging,
but it is,
there is a momentum right now because Justin,

634
00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:38.070
the last few months,
oldest things have been happening.

635
00:44:38.071 --> 00:44:42.530
So it's like her work of 17 years,
he's no beginning to,

636
00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:44.040
to pay a lot of fruits,

637
00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:46.980
which is beautiful for the benefit of all sentient beings.

638
00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:52.880
<v 9>Um,
I had,
uh,
I was really interested in,
um,</v>

639
00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:55.580
when you would be in this state,

640
00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.420
you said you had said there was of a certain language that would come out and

641
00:44:59.421 --> 00:45:03.810
you were unsure of where this was coming from.
Is there any,
oh,

642
00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:08.240
are you doing anything to look into that?
And is there any sort of research?

643
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:12.690
<v 0>Not yet.
Not yet.
It'll,
it was not a priority,
but we should,</v>

644
00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:17.280
we have a lot to do and to try to understand what is the language,

645
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:22.160
what could be associated to this,
uh,

646
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:23.550
kind of language.
Yes.

647
00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:26.050
<v 9>Could you,
would you compare that to something,
you know,</v>

648
00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:29.970
like automatic writing and,
and,
you know,
that sort of thing.

649
00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:34.650
<v 0>It's comes along like automatic writing comes,
you know,
comes through somewhere.</v>

650
00:45:34.651 --> 00:45:39.130
We don't know.
We don't know,
but this comes out.
But,
uh,

651
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:43.800
it has a meaning.
Uh,
you understand the meaning when you say you to tell it,

652
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.410
but we don't know where it comes from.

653
00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:49.160
I just want to add one thing to you that um,

654
00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:54.060
in the sessions we do one on one with people calling does a trails on them
first.

655
00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:57.870
And in several cases when Colin is doing her trust,

656
00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:02.370
the person begin answering in that same language and they were like having a

657
00:46:02.371 --> 00:46:06.000
dialogue somewhere.
I'm really understanding each other.
That's very interesting.

658
00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:09.840
Yeah.
Can you twice I was talking about the prayer language.

659
00:46:09.841 --> 00:46:13.940
It's something we couldn't tell you directly to your,

660
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.880
to your cells instead of fuel mine.
You know,
it's just very,

661
00:46:17.881 --> 00:46:21.960
well we then very interesting I think and people whose native tongue that are

662
00:46:21.961 --> 00:46:26.640
different.
So again,
really intriguing.
Yup.
Uh,
just a quick followup question,

663
00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:31.080
uh,
uh,
are you aware of that this is all visit observation.

664
00:46:31.081 --> 00:46:34.050
So you were recording yourself or you're observing someone.

665
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:38.040
Are you aware of things that you are saying and doing with the,

666
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.360
with the body in that trance state?

667
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:46.410
Is the person aware of the things that they are saying?
No,
wait,
yes.

668
00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:48.150
That's the new thing.
That's the thing.

669
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:51.840
There's always an observer aware of what's going on always.

670
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:57.020
And you can always decide to come back.
The Observer is there.
Quick question,

671
00:46:57.021 --> 00:47:00.700
another quick question.
So seizures are also,
uh,

672
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:05.300
electrical activity in the brain.
This is also,
it seems,

673
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:08.850
seems like an electrical activity in the brain.
How do they compare?

674
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.680
One is in monetary,
the other one is voluntary,
please.
Not The difference.

675
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:18.080
Seizures
[inaudible]

676
00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:20.730
commodity component.

677
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.760
[inaudible] [inaudible] Oh no,
the,
the,

678
00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:30.070
the EEG showed that it was completely different.
Interesting.
That's

679
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:34.270
<v 3>completely different,
but very keen.
Mongolia in Mongolia,
some epileptics,</v>

680
00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.550
a soft kind of epilepsy,

681
00:47:36.551 --> 00:47:40.450
but we don't know which one are compelled to Shamanic,
uh,

682
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.110
to show many powers

683
00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.980
<v 0>in many traditions.
Extra the right.</v>

684
00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:48.370
<v 3>Yeah.
People are considered the showmans.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

685
00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:53.300
So it's not all the epilepsy,
but some of them are.
Consider Shannon.

686
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:55.583
<v 1>Thank you.
Yeah.</v>

687
00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:01.320
<v 10>Okay.
Hi.
Thank you for the talk.
I just have a question about diet.
This is,</v>

688
00:48:01.321 --> 00:48:06.321
it is a stunning special diet that will help to induce trance states.

689
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:11.290
<v 3>Oh No,
no,
no,
no.
Do the youth was for Francis,
the researcher,</v>

690
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:15.670
uh,
to,
to help the,
to,
to heal the cancer.

691
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.870
It was just for,
for him.
But we don't have any diet in this kind of,
uh,
uh,

692
00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:24.800
practice.
We should maybe.

693
00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:31.610
Yeah.
I was wondering in Mongolia with the Shamans,

694
00:48:31.611 --> 00:48:36.020
do they have certain age limits before it will they let children partake in

695
00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:38.500
Trans states?
And then how does that translate into you?

696
00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:43.570
It's not a low the children,
no.
Wait,

697
00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:48.190
um,
uh,
the children is,

698
00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.470
well 18,
19,
20,
it's not,

699
00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:56.910
never another before that age and a,

700
00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:00.520
the end of the practice.
It depends on your teeth.

701
00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:06.190
Really.
Yes.
If she lose your teeth,
you lose your power.
Why?

702
00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:10.930
Because you are not able to eat meat.
So you need to eat meat.

703
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:14.830
<v 0>Yeah.
You let culture talking about diet.
Yes.</v>

704
00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.141
But usually in,

705
00:49:16.141 --> 00:49:21.141
in a family when a child shows signs of something,

706
00:49:21.281 --> 00:49:25.450
it often starts with a child being very sick and uh,

707
00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:29.410
on usually like they don't understand what's going on and then they take the

708
00:49:29.411 --> 00:49:33.910
child to a shaman and the Shama and might say,
Ooh,
this one has the skills.

709
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.840
You know,

710
00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:39.840
usually from an then sister and they explained to the family if you don't train

711
00:49:40.091 --> 00:49:43.180
the child,
the child my died might have more and more illnesses,

712
00:49:43.181 --> 00:49:47.710
more and more problems.
But then the age apprenticeship,

713
00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:50.950
I think a,
it's on average 13 years in Mongolia,

714
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:53.650
the apprenticeship to become a shaman.
So it's not like,

715
00:49:53.651 --> 00:49:57.970
okay I'm going a few months in the Amazon and then under showman it's 13 years

716
00:49:57.971 --> 00:50:02.971
of very harsh a presence apprenticeship too to be able to deal with all those

717
00:50:03.971 --> 00:50:04.804
dimensions.

718
00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:10.350
<v 3>And have you heard of light language because it sounds like what you were,</v>

719
00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:14.410
what I observed is similar to what people called light language.
I don't know.

720
00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.790
I can connect you with some yeah,
yeah.
Yes,
yes.

721
00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.790
<v 10>Do you see your work as having similarities to,</v>

722
00:50:22.791 --> 00:50:27.560
I'll look tropic breath work and if so,
do you like want to work with them,
um,

723
00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.210
to get

724
00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:32.960
<v 0>uptake in the psychiatric community if,
if your research is successful?
Yes.</v>

725
00:50:32.961 --> 00:50:34.970
Holotropic breath work.
Cause there's a,

726
00:50:34.971 --> 00:50:39.920
there are a lot of parallels between what this tool can do and uh,

727
00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.950
many other things,
you know,
like that.
Um,

728
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:46.970
what we've seen with a lot of people who've experienced holotropic breathwork is

729
00:50:46.971 --> 00:50:50.600
like the intensity,
the physicality,
you know,
like all that happens.

730
00:50:50.601 --> 00:50:54.560
Like that this doesn't happen in this,
it's like much lighter,
you know,

731
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:58.010
I was an experience but um,
definitely,

732
00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:59.870
definitely because it's like those are just,

733
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:03.980
those are different tools to access there.
So absolutely.

734
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:06.860
And Stung growth is aware of our work,

735
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:12.840
<v 3>but each store,
this is interesting because each tool send you in,</v>

736
00:51:12.841 --> 00:51:14.260
in different places.

737
00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:19.650
So this kind of a tool could help you to do some research in a certain field,

738
00:51:20.861 --> 00:51:24.070
but this kind of can,
can go,

739
00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:28.120
went to a training.

740
00:51:28.121 --> 00:51:32.380
So each tool as his own interests.
Yeah.

741
00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:33.860
<v 0>Can we experience the sound loop?</v>

742
00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:41.580
Well,
it may not today,
but uh,
we definitely use it in our,
in our one on one work.

743
00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:45.470
Um,
so definitely that's a setting.

744
00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:50.480
<v 3>Good.
Organize a workshop in,
in Google we could organize a workshop,
Eh,
you,</v>

745
00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:53.720
you have to be,
uh,
10,

746
00:51:53.721 --> 00:51:56.240
10 is a good amount of people.
Uh,

747
00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:01.290
we need good speakers and a,
and it's possible.
Yeah.
And,
uh,

748
00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:04.010
usually in the workshop with the artist,

749
00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:08.990
it takes three days to teach them how to self induce a trans,

750
00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:12.230
no free free days of practicing the trends.

751
00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.990
It means a seven,

752
00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:19.010
eight trends and after the able to cell phone use and also the,
it,
no,

753
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:24.050
it's not that long.
So it depends off each of course.

754
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:25.430
Uh,

755
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:29.540
some will need more time to Seth Andrews or trans,

756
00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:33.890
but z average is around this.

757
00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:40.240
<v 0>Well,
thank you very much.
Uh,
it was beautiful to share all of this with you.</v>

758
00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:41.950
Um,
again,

759
00:52:41.951 --> 00:52:45.460
this beautiful idea of the encounter between an ancient technology and the new

760
00:52:45.461 --> 00:52:49.990
technology,
especially being here at Google,
I think is quite intriguing.

761
00:52:49.991 --> 00:52:54.280
I hope it piqued your curiosity and a much,
much,
much,

762
00:52:54.281 --> 00:52:57.930
much more to explore.
Thank you,
Maria.
It's again.
Yeah.
Thank you.

763
00:52:59.390 --> 00:52:59.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>
