WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.500
Yeah.
So thank you for the invitation.
It's great to be here.
Thanks for coming.

2
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.640
So as Richard mentioned,
uh,

3
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.650
I am a senior lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney.
Um,

4
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.910
but I'm also a children's book author and I'm also a father and it's kind of

5
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:32.070
summed up in this most common question I get from other academics.

6
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.160
So this is a stock photo of a sciencey looking person and that's not their real

7
00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:42.960
name,
but the email itself is,
is one that I've received.

8
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.700
It says,
uh,

9
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.750
I'm also a scientist and I happened to be an aspiring author as well.

10
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.620
Uh,
you've written dozens of children's books,

11
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.880
so starting with quantum physics for babies,
uh,

12
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.050
which was published mid last year,

13
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.650
and now the latest is astrophysics for babies.
Um,

14
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.310
and there's some picture books in there as well,

15
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.810
and you have four kids and an active academic career.

16
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.330
Um,
so what is your secret?
And I thought that was a funny question.

17
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.160
You know,
my secret,

18
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.770
I thought any answer to that would be kind of like an infomercial.
So initially,

19
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:28.500
you know,
I didn't give an answer,
I didn't think about it.
I just had,
you know,

20
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:31.740
hard work and a little bit of luck and you'll get there.

21
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.220
And speaking of luck,
you know,

22
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:38.520
I get to travel all around the world as an academic talking about quantum

23
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:40.830
physics.
Um,
you know,

24
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:44.790
I talked to students giving lectures and other researchers.

25
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:49.791
I get to talk to business leaders and entrepreneurs about quantum technology.

26
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.750
But since becoming an author now,
I talked to science enthusiasts,
um,

27
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.580
high school students,
elementary school students,
teachers,
journalists,

28
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.320
and even now because the books are for babies,
parents and toddlers.

29
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.950
And I received lots of questions obviously,
but quantum physics,

30
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.860
which is unsurprising,
but what I didn't expect,

31
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.720
where question is about my personal life and my philosophy towards parenting.

32
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.810
So parents really want to know,
okay,

33
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.430
how do you really teach kids quantum physics?
Um,

34
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.950
and the questions are kind of phrase in this,
what's your,

35
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:27.660
what's the secret sort of way?

36
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.810
And these are difficult obviously to answer it because,
well,

37
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:35.811
there's not really an easy answer or even an answer at all to such a question.

38
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.230
Um,

39
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.790
but in trying to brides some answer that was honest and as concise as possible,

40
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.620
uh,
something kind of started to coalesce in my mind after answering all these

41
00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:51.090
questions.
So there's this old saying,
it's kind of cliche.

42
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.900
If you don't know where you came from,
then you can't know where you're going.

43
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.840
So I thought maybe there's some truth to that.
Um,

44
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.020
maybe I've been too busy as an academic trying to publish and work through the

45
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:07.410
system,
building a marriage,
building a family that,
you know,

46
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.960
I never really stopped and thought about,
you know,
what,

47
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.880
what was it about my up bringing that allowed me to do this?
Maybe there,

48
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.150
there was a secret.
Um,
and if there was then a,

49
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.160
I should maybe be more thoughtful in using those tools that I've developed in my

50
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:31.870
upgrade,
bringing with my own children.
So I kind of thought about it.

51
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:35.170
I have a pretty bad memory and I don't really remember much about my childhood,

52
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:37.450
but luckily,
um,

53
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.140
my parents took lots of pictures and lots of videos.
So I,

54
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.910
I bothered my mom,

55
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.080
but I guess not really because I probably don't call her enough.
So definitely,

56
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.000
definitely call your mom.
Uh,

57
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.070
I got some old home videos from my dad and set to it and I think what I found

58
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:59.530
was kind of a common thread that I going to tell you about today.

59
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.610
The story in doing my research probably starts a bit earlier though with my

60
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:07.174
grandfather.

61
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.810
So he served briefly as a radio operator in World War II and then he stayed in

62
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:18.061
radio his whole life and he dabbled in all sorts of aspects of radio including

63
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:20.950
hosting and then eventually advertising.

64
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.550
But the way I remember him was like in his retirement where he just always had

65
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.820
this experience where he wanted to perfect his surroundings in terms of sound.

66
00:04:36.951 --> 00:04:41.500
So he always had this,
the best sound system in his,

67
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.710
in his apartment and he just loved these devices that produce sound.

68
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.440
And I think that's what led to my father being kind of a tinkerer of electronics

69
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.933
as well.

70
00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.600
My living room going up had like these ever evolving handcrafted sound systems.

71
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.500
The house was full of electronics,
but you know,

72
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.740
I'm surrounded by electronics here today and not like these kinds of connected

73
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:13.240
devices.
It was exposed wires and DIY gadgets.

74
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.630
These were my dad's toys,

75
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.220
but he wasn't a licensed electrician.
In fact,

76
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.430
I don't think he's formerly trained in anything,

77
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.790
but that didn't stop him from being called what was known as a Jack of all

78
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:34.290
trades.
And so I see some young people in the audience today think,
you know,

79
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.890
if he were my age today than he would have a big beard and Tattoo and you'd find

80
00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:42.910
them at them makerspace building a custom gear for fixed fee or something like

81
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:45.010
that.
Um,
but the point is,

82
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.080
he built stuff and it was using whatever materials were available.

83
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.030
And as you could see from the clip,
you know,

84
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:53.800
safety really wasn't much of a concern.

85
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:58.801
So just put a clamp on a desk and attach a link to it and that'll be the light

86
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:00.464
for the kids.

87
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.810
And so really I saw firsthand what it was to play with things that weren't

88
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:10.811
marketed and packaged as toys and play with things in ways that other people

89
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:16.490
hadn't thought of before.
My brother and I joined my dad in the shop,

90
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.320
which was the garage,
and we were wiring and cutting and hammering and painting.

91
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.070
That is one of his homemade speakers there,

92
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.640
and I actually still remember and can prove that I got cut by that reciprocal

93
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:33.410
saw.
There's a little fading scar,

94
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.880
but then there was a shift,
right?
So

95
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.380
the consumer electronics started to get cheaper and these DIY gadgets were

96
00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:49.481
replaced by electronic chips that were covered in plastic in the late eighties

97
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:53.000
personal computers became affordable for middle class income families,

98
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.420
and I had access to Ataris and commodores and Nintendo's Sega has and eventually

99
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:00.740
personal computers and the Internet.

100
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.590
And what this shift entailed was something entirely new.

101
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.610
No longer did I play with the wires and the physical things,
the hardware.

102
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.020
Now I played with software and as an added bonus,
having a twin brother,

103
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.970
I had to become a rather robust user.

104
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.420
I think he had to be a little bit more robust than I did.

105
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.970
So I was an early adopter of many new gadgets and that include the gadgets with

106
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:29.930
software.
I wouldn't say I came of age with the personal computer.

107
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.440
I think that is a bit too early.
That's Gen X.
I'm kind of at the cusp.

108
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.040
I'm an elder millennial maybe.
Um,

109
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.050
so those were the people that needed to learn to code,
to use personal computers.

110
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.431
Those were my friends,

111
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:47.120
older siblings I came of age with graphical user interfaces,

112
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.800
not lines of computer code.

113
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.000
And I'm talking about the kinds of software that my generation grew up with and

114
00:07:53.001 --> 00:07:57.770
that our parents had to use in their office jobs.
So windows,
a word,

115
00:07:57.771 --> 00:08:00.710
processors and spreadsheets,
quickbooks,

116
00:08:00.711 --> 00:08:04.850
Photoshop and eventually web browsers and all of our smartphone apps.

117
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:11.590
And I played with software the same way I watched my dad play with his

118
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:14.150
electronic toys and tools.

119
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.480
So this here is the very first home video on the set that my dad gave me.

120
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.130
And what you can see is that rather than for its intended use,

121
00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:26.480
like film your family,

122
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.920
he just starts goofing around and playing with it and probably like in a way

123
00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:35.690
that the designers really never intended.
And so I've inherited this behavior.

124
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:41.050
I open a toy or gadget and immediately and uncontrollably start testing and

125
00:08:41.991 --> 00:08:44.660
trying to figure out how it works without reading the instructions.

126
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.490
So more often than not,

127
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.520
I can kind of get it to work within a few minutes and occasionally I find some

128
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:51.230
new and interesting use for it.

129
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.840
So the entirety of my life has been this user tester tinker and eventually

130
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:02.580
builder of software.
And I think there's an APP name for this as well.

131
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.720
A hacker,
the 21st century version of the Jack of all trades.

132
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.770
Of course we're all users of software today,

133
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.830
but this hacker mentality is difficult to achieve and understand because

134
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:20.490
software today is designed to be real robust against this exact behavior.

135
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:26.390
So developers and the companies they work for or don't necessarily want users to

136
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:30.630
play with their software in ways they don't intend,
they want to.

137
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:35.490
I think perhaps avoid those one star reviews on the APP store because it has to

138
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:39.810
work fast and it has to work almost in an expected way.

139
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:46.290
And perhaps you've seen people on the bus just doing this motion over and over

140
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:49.920
and over again.
So this isn't the kind of play that I'm talking about,
right?

141
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:54.020
People play with software today.
All right.
Again,
when their smart phones,

142
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.420
you know,
think flappy bird or crossy road,

143
00:09:57.421 --> 00:10:00.000
when this is the only thing that you do with the software.

144
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.140
I'm talking about software where you have this freedom to only follow your own

145
00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:08.160
curiosity,
um,
in playing with it.

146
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.550
And so in terms of that play,

147
00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:15.930
I think the single waking activity I've done most in my life is play with

148
00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:19.710
software.
And I think this is the secret.
This is my secret.

149
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.630
My Dad was a jack of all trades and I am a jack of all software,

150
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.920
a hacker.
And to make this a little more concrete,
uh,

151
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:32.580
I'm going to give you a few snapshots over the many years of how I've used

152
00:10:32.581 --> 00:10:36.870
software with this hacker mentality in mind.
So,

153
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.750
uh,
let's go back to high school.

154
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.820
The Internet wasn't a big thing in suburban Canada until the late,

155
00:10:44.821 --> 00:10:45.720
the late nineties.

156
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.920
Of course when the first Internet access store opened up and there was an

157
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:50.671
affordable option,

158
00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:55.671
my dad was an early adopter and a perhaps you might remember the sound,

159
00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.790
which is like burned into my mind.

160
00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:06.790
All right,
that's enough of that.

161
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.160
So my high school of course I understand Internet access,
like all high schools,

162
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:16.510
whatever,
but it was in the library and not very many people used it.

163
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.990
If you wanted to do a webpage,

164
00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:24.850
how it worked back then was somebody somehow found out about a webpage,

165
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.260
maybe through some links to from other web pages.

166
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.760
And if you wanted someone else to know about that one patient and you'd have to,

167
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:31.091
you know,

168
00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:34.630
write down in the web address on a piece of paper and then they would go to

169
00:11:34.631 --> 00:11:38.380
internet explorer or Netscape and type that address in and Voila,

170
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:43.090
they would see the web page.
Uh,
if you didn't know that address then,

171
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:48.160
then you would never see the webpage.
But then,
uh,
one thing came along.

172
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.230
Does anyone remember?
Web Color?
Uh,

173
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.230
I feel maybe I don't need to lecture you here on the history of,

174
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.710
of Internet search.
Uh,

175
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.370
but just in case this was the kind of precursor to Google,
uh,

176
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:08.190
this is an archive of screenshot from 1996 I believe.
And um,

177
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.123
by the way,

178
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.270
if you thought like fake news and conspiracy theories are a recent sort of

179
00:12:13.271 --> 00:12:14.104
phenomenon,

180
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:19.140
have a look at the example that you should search in like the one of the first

181
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:23.320
search engines ever.
Alien abduction Ufo Roswell.

182
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.310
So a web crawler I gave kind of terrible search results,
but you know,

183
00:12:29.311 --> 00:12:34.050
it's one of the first search engines.
Um,
I checked actually it's still works.

184
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.570
You can go to [inaudible] dot com and the first thing I searched for and web

185
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:42.370
color.com was Google.
And the first hit is Amazon.
Um,
which is,

186
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.020
which is a bit strange,
but maybe not.
Um,

187
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.610
so I don't need to tell you here about the kind of technology today that goes

188
00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:54.820
into the kind of seemingly simple task of web search.

189
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.460
But back then it was more difficult.

190
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.330
You had to be what I would call a search engine hacker.

191
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.520
I mean look at the example why,
you know,

192
00:13:03.521 --> 00:13:08.470
why would you have to put alien abduction in quotation marks,
but Ufo Roswell,

193
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:09.430
not in quotation marks.

194
00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:12.550
So these are the kind of like tricks that you had to play back then.

195
00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:14.740
Whereas now I type one letter,

196
00:13:14.741 --> 00:13:17.650
I haven't even decided what I want to search for and you guys have figured out

197
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:23.080
already that what I want to search for it.
Um,
so,

198
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:24.783
uh,

199
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:29.790
I think there was like this brief brief terminology shortly after Google before,

200
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.490
you know,
search really became kind of this intuitive thing.
Google food.

201
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.430
I don't know if you guys remember that.
Uh,

202
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.170
it almost disappears as fast as it arrived.
And so I had this,

203
00:13:40.171 --> 00:13:44.320
this kind of Google Fu in high school and I was one of the very few people that

204
00:13:44.321 --> 00:13:48.400
use a web search to complete my assignments and kind of a,

205
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.730
as an added bonus.
If you were,
you know,

206
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.520
relatively good at computers than you are a teenager,
um,

207
00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.670
you could use your web search skills for some other things.
But,
uh,

208
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.740
I didn't include a slide for that.
So,

209
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:08.280
um,
I used like a map once to drive to one of the Carolinas.
Um,

210
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.600
it was kind of awful.
The map,
I mean,

211
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.260
most of my driving has been local and for that I don't use maps.

212
00:14:14.261 --> 00:14:18.460
I've never actually picked out and unfolded one of these real real maps.

213
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.990
Dotcom was in full swing by the time I got my first driver's license.

214
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:27.250
And I use this old but again still exist in website,

215
00:14:27.251 --> 00:14:30.670
mapquest.
And if you go and you look at it,

216
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.060
it looks the same pretty much as mapping software today.

217
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.980
You can pan and zoom and you could ask it for directions and it would get you

218
00:14:38.981 --> 00:14:43.180
from a to B.
But you know,
that wasn't really necessarily what you wanted.

219
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.520
You wanted the fastest route,
the shortest route,

220
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.880
a route that didn't contain traffic or a route that contained a new streets or

221
00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:55.600
an old alley that was never part of the map.
Um,

222
00:14:55.730 --> 00:15:00.200
and so what you had to do was kind of hack the root,
right?

223
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.290
And in doing so,
you had to be the one that was,
you know,

224
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:08.310
really kind of looking and panning around and optimizing it.

225
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:13.220
So today,
you know,
mapping software is much,
much better for driving directions.

226
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.900
But I wouldn't say it is for walking directions and I'm hoping that it's not

227
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:20.720
like a news flash that perhaps in other parts of the world,

228
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:23.090
people still still walk to places.

229
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:27.170
I've noticed that there's a lot of cars in America,

230
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.330
so I use Google maps in,

231
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.240
in and walking around Australia,
um,
for walking directions.

232
00:15:35.241 --> 00:15:38.570
But oftentimes it misses things,
right?
I mean,
you have a campus here,

233
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:39.930
so you'll know,
uh,

234
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.440
that there are pathways that you want to take say that are well trodden through,

235
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.720
you know,
fields that aren't just don't show up on a map.

236
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.440
And so you have to sort of manually change your route.

237
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:57.410
And the thing is,
I don't feel like I ever had an innate sense of direction.

238
00:15:57.411 --> 00:15:59.330
I don't think that that's really a thing.

239
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.140
But through practice I've developed a pretty good sense of direction.

240
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:08.720
And that practice is only available through the ability to play with software.

241
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.890
Like Google maps and something.
I,

242
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:17.900
by looking at the area here just this morning,
I found out just,

243
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:21.710
but you know,
looking at my local area and then,
and then zooming out,

244
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:27.040
I found out that currently I'm further north than where I grew up in Canada,

245
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:32.400
which is I think,
so it was surprising to me and I think,
um,

246
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.110
maybe surprising to you cause you normally use in Canada is,
oh,

247
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:40.580
Canada's north of here,
but in this case it's south southwest.

248
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:43.010
And again,

249
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.990
today I'm kind of losing this practice because now I kind of just showed up my

250
00:16:47.991 --> 00:16:51.680
phone,
right?
Like,
okay,
Google,
uh,
navigate home,
right?

251
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.930
And losing this,
this,
uh,
practice with software,
uh,

252
00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.600
is I feel like it's kind of okay because,
you know,

253
00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:02.900
these are all the software that I've used in the past.
And now,
you know,

254
00:17:02.901 --> 00:17:05.840
as I moved to different jobs,
I'm using different kinds of software.

255
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:10.610
And as a university lecturer and researcher,

256
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:15.140
I use all sorts of various software.
And in fact,
now I have to create software.

257
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.780
So it's quite small.
But there you see,

258
00:17:17.781 --> 00:17:22.781
maybe you recognize some python code where I'm answering scientific questions.

259
00:17:23.511 --> 00:17:24.344
So the code,

260
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:28.490
the software that have created above produces an answer to a scientific question

261
00:17:28.491 --> 00:17:33.260
that you see below.
And then I use latech and other,

262
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.670
a bit of software and the whole chain of software to produce academic papers.

263
00:17:37.671 --> 00:17:40.230
So I as academics,
we,

264
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:45.240
we write the code that creates the journal articles and then I use other

265
00:17:46.401 --> 00:17:50.280
software including the software that didn't work so well just second ago,
um,

266
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.970
to create presentations to present those results to my colleagues.

267
00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.650
And so that whole chain,

268
00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:01.020
I'm using all of this software and in many cases,
you know,

269
00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:05.520
I'm the creator software.
And as someone who's,
as an academic,

270
00:18:05.521 --> 00:18:07.140
who's not really trained in software development,

271
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.670
I would say it's very much hacking your way through it.

272
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.230
And B,

273
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:18.210
being able to use software efficiently in this way really set you ahead in a

274
00:18:18.211 --> 00:18:22.020
field where it's,
it's,
it's not,
it's not common,
right?

275
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:26.790
Not every academic,
even,
uh,
would touch a line of code,

276
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.520
uh,
when I'm not in the office.

277
00:18:29.521 --> 00:18:33.810
So in the evenings I have a hobby as you can see from the stack of books.

278
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:39.170
I write children's books and unsurprisingly it makes use of software.

279
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:45.270
This software here,
uh,
maybe recognize it,
it's called Inkscape.

280
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:50.510
So it's a free and open source piece of software and I'm quite sure that it's

281
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:56.180
intended purpose was not to create a picture books for children and I buy,

282
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.651
you know,

283
00:18:58.651 --> 00:19:02.430
being able to use the software which I use in my research to create scientific

284
00:19:02.431 --> 00:19:03.264
diagrams.

285
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:08.190
I can make myself appear like an artist even though as you can see I'm just

286
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.490
manipulating geometric shapes and and vectors.

287
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:13.110
<v 3>Okay.</v>

288
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:18.110
<v 1>This image is a part of good night lab,</v>

289
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:25.550
which was my first picture book that was published by source books and I'm quite

290
00:19:26.821 --> 00:19:29.570
proud to say that I know and their,

291
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.540
their design team enough that when they respond to my emails anyways,

292
00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:36.870
they also using Inkscape now even though they hadn't heard of it before.

293
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.300
And speaking of publishing,

294
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:44.010
I actually use some translation software to negotiate my first international

295
00:19:44.011 --> 00:19:45.490
book contract.
Uh,

296
00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:48.060
at the time I was self published and didn't know anything about publishing.

297
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.540
So I contacted some,

298
00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:54.930
some publishers in China using,

299
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.210
I think it was Google translate or I'll say it's Google translate anyways,

300
00:19:58.211 --> 00:20:03.080
since I'm here
and in using translation software,
uh,

301
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.940
now I actually write children's books directly for,

302
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.640
for the Chinese market.

303
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:12.570
<v 3>Okay.</v>

304
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.220
<v 1>And so,
um,</v>

305
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.400
my response would be,
you know,
dear anonymous,

306
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:25.260
handsome sciencey looking guy,
I have an answer for you.

307
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.070
Of course,
you know,
I don't manage alone.

308
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.570
I have an amazing family and amazing partner,

309
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:35.810
but I also have software and without the efficient use and ability to play with

310
00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:40.770
software,
the first book,
Quantum Physics for babies certainly wouldn't exist.

311
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.810
And as you saw,

312
00:20:42.811 --> 00:20:47.220
all of my other illustrated books wouldn't exist and even my entire academic

313
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:52.210
career wouldn't exist.
Am I?
I think that's due to my upbringing.

314
00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:52.630
So,

315
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:57.630
which was kind of perfect for making use of this evolving technology.

316
00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:03.100
But these successes are kind of a product of that unique environment,

317
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.220
culture and opportunities that I was given.

318
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:09.400
And so I have to thank my parents for that.

319
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.990
But the problem with success stories is that they're very hard to repeat,

320
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.440
right?
So we don't have that same environment.
And culture today.

321
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:23.620
So as a parent myself,

322
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.400
I can't repeat the same thing that my parents did,

323
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:32.500
but I can kind of use this spirit that is,

324
00:21:32.501 --> 00:21:37.501
I can give my children experiences and opportunities to play with tools and

325
00:21:37.601 --> 00:21:40.540
technology.
But that is not enough.

326
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:44.470
I think the real lesson from my childhood story is that children will be

327
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:49.150
attracted to the ideas and the mannerisms and activities that their parents or

328
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:54.151
their teachers or their friends show a genuine interest in this today's sort of,

329
00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:00.280
uh,
educational,
um,
conversation.

330
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:04.300
We're always talking about stem,
science and technology and engineering,

331
00:22:04.301 --> 00:22:05.134
mathematics.

332
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:10.500
And I'm not too worried about my own children's interest in stem because they

333
00:22:10.961 --> 00:22:15.961
see me showing enthusiasm for it are constantly.

334
00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.060
But I want to give you kind of an example of the theme,

335
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:24.380
which is that my children don't really see me doing science much anymore cause
I,

336
00:22:24.381 --> 00:22:26.800
I'm doing that in the office.
And then when I'm at home,

337
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.780
I'm working on children's books.

338
00:22:28.781 --> 00:22:31.510
So they see me writing books more than they see me doing science.

339
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.210
And so I was quite amused,
but in hindsight,

340
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:39.270
not all that surprised when like my children would show up in the morning and

341
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.430
they will say,
I made this,
you know,
I made a book because they see,

342
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.480
they see daddy making books and the tools are,

343
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:50.980
are actually quite easy to find and without any sort of,

344
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:55.690
you know,
I never thought to have them write,
write books.
You know,

345
00:22:55.691 --> 00:22:59.020
I encouraged them to do science and do experiments,
but,

346
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.890
but now they show up reading books.
Uh,

347
00:23:02.891 --> 00:23:07.891
another amusing story is that I once gave a presentation,

348
00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.370
kind of a more choreographed presentation at a,
at a,

349
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:15.340
at the world science festival in Brisbane where I was on stage trying to inspire

350
00:23:15.341 --> 00:23:19.920
high school students to,
to,
uh,
get a job in,
in,

351
00:23:19.921 --> 00:23:24.470
in science.
You know,
the,
the title was cool jobs and,
uh,

352
00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:29.410
my four year old son was watching and afterward he said to me,
Daddy,

353
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.180
maybe when you grow up you can actually do science and not just talk about

354
00:23:34.181 --> 00:23:38.680
science.
So I'm a bit worried that,
you know,
I'm not,

355
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:42.940
I'm not,
uh,
demonstrating the practice of science enough.

356
00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:47.570
I'm wondering,
you know,
the parents are asking these questions about,
you know,

357
00:23:47.571 --> 00:23:52.190
this the secret,
how do I,
you know,
I read the books and h w what's next?
Right?

358
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.590
How do I continue along this path?

359
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:59.840
And I wonder what sort of interests and curiosities they're instilling in their

360
00:23:59.841 --> 00:24:04.841
children and what opportunities and experiences they are giving to them and what

361
00:24:06.381 --> 00:24:08.840
they're kind of showing them with genuine interest.

362
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:14.150
So I want to tell you about one more thing that I'm interested in that my

363
00:24:14.151 --> 00:24:18.380
children I think are uniquely placed to take advantage of if they so wish.

364
00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.290
Uh,
so maybe I should have had like a sound for this.

365
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:29.180
Welcome to the quantum realm.
Quantum physics,
um,

366
00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:33.290
has sort of a reputation for being a mysterious thing.

367
00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:37.520
But the way I like to explain it in kind of a,

368
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:42.010
the least sort of mystical way to perfect group of,

369
00:24:42.011 --> 00:24:47.011
of technology minded people is that it's just a mathematical theory that works

370
00:24:47.901 --> 00:24:52.010
well for some physical phenomenon and not so well or not so conveniently with

371
00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:52.844
others.

372
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:58.090
So it's a mathematical theory that works well when physical things are very well

373
00:24:58.671 --> 00:25:00.140
isolated from an environment.

374
00:25:00.141 --> 00:25:05.141
So if you can identify some region of the world that's isolated from its

375
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.253
environment,

376
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:11.150
then describing that with this mechanism of quantum physics will work really

377
00:25:11.151 --> 00:25:15.590
well.
And Adam's,
when you think about it,
they're very well isolated.

378
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:20.830
I mean everything you know is mostly space and these atoms are very far away

379
00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:23.750
from any other atom or a particle.

380
00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:26.810
And so that's why quantum physics works really well to describe them.

381
00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:32.410
Now what we're doing today is trying to build massive quantum technology

382
00:25:32.751 --> 00:25:36.380
devices.
And again,
the only reason or or,

383
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:40.100
or the only way it will be well described by quantum physics is,

384
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:43.250
is if we can isolate these things from their environment.

385
00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:49.970
Okay,
great.
But you might think,
what is quantum done for me lately?

386
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.650
Well,
in fact,

387
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:56.800
quantum physics is the most precise and well studied theory of science that we

388
00:25:58.551 --> 00:25:59.384
have to date.

389
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:04.070
And it's the basis for pretty much all the technology that we enjoy today.

390
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.560
So the GPS,

391
00:26:06.561 --> 00:26:11.270
like that map I showed you requires precise timing afforded by atomic clocks,

392
00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.150
atomic clocks themselves as the word Adam right in it.

393
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:18.470
So obviously quantum physics plays a role in that.

394
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.900
There's a medical scan there.

395
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:25.100
So that involves looking at the spins of uh,

396
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.830
nuclear atoms in the body.

397
00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:33.350
We have lasers which write and read on to combat this.

398
00:26:33.351 --> 00:26:34.410
And CDS.

399
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:40.630
Quantum states of light are required to send signals through fiber optic cables

400
00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:45.420
across huge distances,
connect all of us by the Internet.

401
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.140
And what are these things connecting?
They're connecting computers,

402
00:26:49.141 --> 00:26:52.980
the billions upon billions of transistors that are around us in the world today.

403
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.910
And the only reason that we can do that is because of our understanding of

404
00:26:56.911 --> 00:27:00.750
semiconductor physics,
which is based on,
on quantum mechanics.

405
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:05.670
But today,
uh,
we're doing something a little bit different.

406
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:10.640
All of that was based on big things like,
um,

407
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.290
things that you can see in touch with your hand.

408
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:18.420
And the kind of quantum physics that plays a role there is,
uh,

409
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:23.450
what's describing a lot of quantum things that are behaving all in the same way.

410
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.920
Now we have access to individual quantum systems.

411
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.780
So on the right hand side you see,
uh,

412
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:38.120
an ion trap that can trap individual atoms and for certain ions you can actually

413
00:27:38.881 --> 00:27:39.301
see them.

414
00:27:39.301 --> 00:27:44.250
So I got a chance to go to a lab in Innsbrook and could see a single atom

415
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:49.260
fluorescing.
Um,
but for the most part you of course you can't see these things.

416
00:27:49.261 --> 00:27:53.490
And so the pictures we drive them or kind of our artists interpretation

417
00:27:55.110 --> 00:28:00.090
on the right is a super conducting quantum device,

418
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:03.930
which is the kind that Google builds.
This one's from IBM.

419
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:09.710
And so each sort of pattern you see there is for artificial quantum Adams.

420
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:11.261
And we're,

421
00:28:11.261 --> 00:28:16.261
what we're trying to do now is use quantum physics for,

422
00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:16.830
you know,

423
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:21.830
in its full power to develop new technology to create new devices.

424
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:27.930
And probably the holy grail of this research is a quantum computer which would

425
00:28:27.931 --> 00:28:32.931
solve existing problems that are just not solvable today and probably will solve

426
00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:36.660
problems that we haven't even thought of.

427
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.060
This is just one of many emerging technologies.

428
00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:47.570
So I want to give you kind of an analogy for what,

429
00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:53.270
say a child growing up today might experience any kind of a lesson,

430
00:28:55.651 --> 00:28:56.850
if you will.
From my,

431
00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:01.320
the secret that I had when I asked this question to,

432
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:06.270
uh,
people generation above me saying gen x and baby were worse.

433
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.330
The name they come up with is Bill Gates

434
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:15.950
and Bill Gates success story is not that much different than mine except in the

435
00:29:19.261 --> 00:29:21.300
number of Zeros on our bank account statements.

436
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:27.200
So he had a very unique opportunity to play with early digital computers and I

437
00:29:28.831 --> 00:29:33.831
think that he would claim or thank that Hah,

438
00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:38.340
thank the people that gave him that opportunity for the numbers of zeroes that

439
00:29:38.341 --> 00:29:40.710
he has on his bank account statement.
So it was,

440
00:29:40.711 --> 00:29:45.711
I think play this sort of access to test and tinker in sort of unconstrained

441
00:29:47.231 --> 00:29:52.231
environment that led him to at least his first unintentional success.

442
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.510
Of course,
what came after it was very intentional.

443
00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:01.870
So my claim is that 20 years from now there'll be a quantum technology

444
00:30:01.871 --> 00:30:03.490
equivalent of bill gates.

445
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.430
And that future leader is just an eight year old child today.

446
00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:11.770
And that child will have access and opportunity to play with quantum technology

447
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:17.160
and come of age with this quantum technology revolution that's um,

448
00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.930
my year old daughter and she's playing with,
uh,

449
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:27.380
a quantum computer so that IBM has a cloud based,

450
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:28.640
small comp,

451
00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:32.230
quantum computing device that you can go and play with and there's this

452
00:30:32.231 --> 00:30:37.231
graphical editor to create a quantum algorithms and you hit run and it runs on a

453
00:30:37.901 --> 00:30:41.170
real quantum device.
So,
you know,
perhaps that person will be her,

454
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:43.180
but perhaps not.

455
00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:49.120
The only thing I know is that it definitely won't if she's not given access to

456
00:30:49.121 --> 00:30:52.450
it.
And so,
um,
that's my secret.

457
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:54.320
And um,

458
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.810
I'm confident that I dodged my fear of being an infomercial because I didn't

459
00:30:58.811 --> 00:31:02.220
really give like a secret recipe and there wasn't a,

460
00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:06.820
a one weird trick that's going to make life coaches angry or anything like that.

461
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:11.650
The answer I want to get to parents that there's no simple steps to become a

462
00:31:11.651 --> 00:31:15.790
leader,
say in quantum technology or physics or,
or science more generally.

463
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:21.350
The road to success is not sort of laid out in front of you with the pave

464
00:31:21.351 --> 00:31:26.030
stones.
I think that sort of road analogy is a really bad one.
Uh,

465
00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:31.120
what I wanted to convey is that success is something kind of more what you build

466
00:31:32.111 --> 00:31:32.950
up underneath you.

467
00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:37.270
And that comes from is kind of like creating this scaffolding and spreading it

468
00:31:37.271 --> 00:31:42.271
around you and as an adult were sort of free to create this variety for

469
00:31:43.751 --> 00:31:47.830
ourselves of opportunities.
And I really think that we should,

470
00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:48.840
and that's the thing I would tell,

471
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.840
tell parents is that one of the most important things is that you need to do

472
00:31:52.841 --> 00:31:56.920
this because the important people in your life are the ones that are watching

473
00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:01.840
and the ones that are learning and they need to see what it is to play and

474
00:32:01.841 --> 00:32:06.550
tinker and really struggle,
I think with big ideas.
Thank you.

475
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:15.610
So your very first book,
what,
uh,
what inspired you?
How did you get started?
Right.

476
00:32:15.611 --> 00:32:20.050
So the first book was quantum physics for babies and I certainly wouldn't have

477
00:32:20.051 --> 00:32:24.070
done it if I hadn't had children on my own.
So I,

478
00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.510
I was in,
uh,

479
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:31.710
a store and I saw us buying books for the kids and I saw some kind of technology

480
00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:40.190
because of one of these like coding for kids books.
And I thought,
oh,

481
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.100
that's,
that's a great idea.
You know,
that's what I want.

482
00:32:43.101 --> 00:32:47.660
I don't want anymore first farm animals books.
Um,
I want some,

483
00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:51.520
some technology books.
And I started looking and seeing,
wow,
there's not,
not,

484
00:32:51.521 --> 00:32:55.490
not that many available.
And I thought maybe,

485
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.960
maybe I could do this.
You know what I mean?

486
00:32:56.961 --> 00:33:01.961
Maybe I'll just write about the science book and I'm starting to think about it.

487
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:06.530
And when the idea of quantum physics for babies popped into my mind,
I knew,

488
00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:10.580
you know,
that's,
that's at least going to get some double takes.

489
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.920
So I think that's kind of how it started.

490
00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:16.323
<v 4>Action.</v>

491
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:25.890
<v 1>Um,
well,
when I started,
so I self published it initially,</v>

492
00:33:25.891 --> 00:33:26.491
so I,
you know,

493
00:33:26.491 --> 00:33:31.491
I had copies myself and I would give them to my children's teachers and they

494
00:33:32.011 --> 00:33:32.310
would,

495
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:37.310
they would look at it and they would kind of like squinting and then they would

496
00:33:37.891 --> 00:33:41.460
laugh and then they would hand it back.
And I would say no,
it's a real,
real book.

497
00:33:41.461 --> 00:33:46.380
Open,
open it up.
Um,
but I get,
I get lots of funny stories.

498
00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.273
Um,

499
00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.500
the funny ones are like stories of children repeating lines from the book in

500
00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.090
public to people.
Um,
you know,

501
00:33:54.091 --> 00:33:58.260
like kids arguing at the,
at the playground saying,

502
00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:03.170
you know,
you're not made of energy.
I made of energy,
that sort of thing.
Um,

503
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.570
and then,
uh,

504
00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:09.330
in the book that I showed you a good night lab,

505
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:12.870
I was drawing a picture of the grumpy old professor.
So in the book,

506
00:34:12.871 --> 00:34:16.330
the grumpy old professors shouting,
publish,
uh,

507
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:21.570
so it's a parody of goodnight moon.
So if you remember good night moon,
there's a,

508
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:27.270
what is it?
An an old lady,
uh,
telling the child to shush.

509
00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:31.320
So,
and good night lab,
it's a grumpy old professors shouting,
publish.

510
00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:34.170
And someone tweeted me and said,
thanks a lot Chris.

511
00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.320
Now my toddlers running around the house yelling at me to publish

512
00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.750
and I thought,
yeah,
achievement.
I'm mark.
That was what I was going for it.

513
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:52.190
<v 5>So my wife and I both to tell the operator Algebras and she is about to give</v>

514
00:34:52.801 --> 00:34:57.330
birth than two and a half,
three weeks ish.
So I was wondering,

515
00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:02.460
how was it having a kid having to go in,
go to conferences?
How,

516
00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:06.390
how was your personal life?
How was your life with that?

517
00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:11.470
<v 1>Sure.
I think that as an academic,
you on,
I mean,
this is,</v>

518
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:15.400
this is different for every academic,
but I,
so I,
and in,
in,
in a sense,

519
00:35:15.401 --> 00:35:19.240
I've been really lucky in having a lot of freedom.

520
00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:23.800
I have this amazing partner who really,
really wants to stay at home and raise,

521
00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.120
um,
raise their children.
And I was able to,

522
00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.210
to take time off.
I mean,

523
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:35.290
my first two children were born when I was finishing my phd and I was nearing

524
00:35:36.401 --> 00:35:38.310
the end,
so I was writing up and,
you know,

525
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.230
people don't expect you to be around anyways.

526
00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:44.850
And so I could really be at home a lot.

527
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:50.190
And in many ways it was a transition for me because before all of my free time,

528
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.140
I feel like I don't have a better word for it,
but maybe wasted.

529
00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:59.630
Um,
playing way too many video games and,
uh,
you know,
the,

530
00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:02.760
the child comes along and now you have this extra responsibility and you're
like,

531
00:36:02.761 --> 00:36:06.930
okay,
well I really need to finish this thesis because I'm going to need to start

532
00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:09.720
earning money.
And,
and,
uh,

533
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:14.040
and so I felt like after the first child was born,

534
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.390
I was far more productive than I was before that.

535
00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:22.170
And there's lots of times where you'll be able to get work done.

536
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:25.020
Maybe you don't want to get work done at night,
but as an academic,

537
00:36:25.021 --> 00:36:28.890
you want to get work done at night where,
you know,
you can rock the Rock,

538
00:36:28.891 --> 00:36:33.600
the thing with your foot and paper,
your thesis on the laptop.
So I've been,

539
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:38.550
I've been really lucky.
I mean,
I,
again,
I don't have a secret.
Thank you.

540
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.240
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>
