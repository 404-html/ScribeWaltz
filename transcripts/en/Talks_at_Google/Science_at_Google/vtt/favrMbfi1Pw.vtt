1
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.460
I'm probably the only one in this room old enough to remember that when you

2
00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:14.150
wanted to use a computer,
it made a 15 minute walk across town.

3
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.010
And my case from University College London where I was a student,
uh,

4
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:21.500
to some my Nas Senate House,
uh,

5
00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:24.680
where in this entire building was housed.

6
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.440
I think it was an IBM three 60,
something like that.

7
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.600
And you go with a pocket full of punch cards and hand them across a desk and

8
00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:36.790
sign all sorts of forms and got back the next day to see what had happened.
Uh,

9
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.100
now the astonishing increase in processing power that has occurred during my

10
00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:46.970
lifetime encapsulated in the famous Moore's law,
uh,

11
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is due almost entirely to the properties of quantum mechanics.

12
00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:55.790
Quantum systems,
whether it's electrons and photons.

13
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.390
And the architect of quantum mechanics was one Erwin Schrodinger who put

14
00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:06.230
together a what we would now understand as a,

15
00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:11.231
the fundamentals of this subject in the late 1920s add add a stroke.

16
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.450
Quantum mechanics explained the nature of matter all the way from atomic nuclei

17
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.760
right up to the structure of stars.

18
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.640
It's the most successful scientific theory behalf.

19
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.880
So it's not just a in the computing industry that it's had an impact.

20
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:31.550
It's really right across,
uh,
technology.
Uh,
more than that.

21
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.290
Quantum mechanics provides us with our deepest account of the nature of reality.

22
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.800
It's not just the nature of matter,
but the nature of reality as well.

23
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.930
And it's a subject that continues to intrigue and baffle.

24
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.820
Mainstream scientists.
Schrodinger was a giant of theoretical physics.

25
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.090
This was a very difficult subject and he is rightly given the credit along with

26
00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:59.900
Heisenberg and direct for founding it.
Now,

27
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.370
fast forward to about 10 years.
And,
uh,
uh,

28
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.450
the scientific scene took a turn for the worst with the rise of narcism in

29
00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:13.451
Europe and many people fled some to work on the allied war effort trading or who

30
00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:19.940
was Austrian also fled.
But instead of joining the ally,
boring fit,

31
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.710
he settled in Dublin.
Ireland was neutral during World War Two,

32
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.990
and he made a home there with his wife and his mistress living under the same

33
00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:34.610
roof.
Apparently he's still had many affairs.
It doesn't prevent him.

34
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.700
Uh,
and,
uh,
he turned his attention,
I suppose.
Uh,

35
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.020
having sort of got out of the mainstream,
uh,

36
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.950
to whatever it was that interested him and he decided,
uh,

37
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.310
that having cracked the problem a matter,

38
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.010
maybe he could crack the problem of life.

39
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.000
And he delivered a series of lectures in 90 43,

40
00:02:56.001 --> 00:03:01.001
which became a very famous book published in 44 by Cambridge University press

41
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.400
called what is life

42
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.580
asking that basic question.
Uh,

43
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.010
and you might say,
well,
what is so special about life?

44
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:17.011
I think all of us have that impression that living organisms are in a class

45
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.460
apart.
That they're unlike any other complex systems.

46
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.660
They have a rather extraordinary properties.
Uh,

47
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.530
any deed rather baffling properties.

48
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.460
I'm not sure if he was interested to know was whether life living organisms or

49
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:35.680
could be explained by physics.

50
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.980
Then the question was could it be explained by known physics or did it need any

51
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:42.491
new physics?

52
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:47.491
Might there be some sort of laws of life and Schrodinger's open minded about

53
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:47.711
this?

54
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:52.711
He said that one must be prepared to find a new type of physical law prevailing.

55
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:56.860
It it.
So notice it's not just a new physical law,
but a new kind of law.

56
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.780
For many,
many years,

57
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.090
I was skeptical that we would need new physics to explain knife.
Uh,

58
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.360
I just thought our difficulty in understanding and living systems was due to the

59
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.010
fundamental complexity of living organisms.
But over the last few years,

60
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:15.910
I've become convinced that we do need some new physics.
And so,
uh,

61
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.720
we might think of biology as the next great frontier of physics.

62
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.790
I think there's new physics lurking in biology,

63
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.920
which could have a sweeping implications across the whole of science.
Now,

64
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.370
a contemporary of trading our Max Delbruck,

65
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.320
I think express very nicely the puzzlement that we all feel when thinking about

66
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:39.040
living organisms.
And they'll be just a quote.
What he said here,

67
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.450
the curiosity remains to grasp more clearly how the same matter,

68
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.670
which in physics and chemistry displays orderly and reproducible and relatively

69
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:52.840
simple properties arranges itself in the most astounding fashions.

70
00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:56.200
As soon as it is drawn into the orbit of living organisms,

71
00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.520
the closer one looks at these performances of matter in living organisms.

72
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.590
The more impressive the show becomes.

73
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.830
The meanest living cell becomes a magic puzzle box full of elaborate and

74
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:09.790
changing molecules.

75
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.310
And to condense this message a while Delbruck is saying is that when we're

76
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:17.650
dealing at the level of atoms,
it's just now in physics,

77
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.590
but at the level of cells it seems like magic.

78
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.760
And what is the source of that magic?
Uh,
what I want to tell you today,
uh,

79
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.310
briefly,
uh,
is that,
uh,
that wall of secrecy,

80
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.630
uh,
mystery that is surrounding the nature of,
uh,

81
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.120
living systems.

82
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.480
I think there's a chink in that and we can begin to see where the answer lies,

83
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.440
uh,
to explain the astonishing properties of living things.
Now,

84
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:48.620
let me just enumerate some of those properties and their implications.
Uh,

85
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.960
organisms seem to have a sort of inner motive power.

86
00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:57.710
They seem to be self propelled.
Something goes right back to Aristotle.
Uh,

87
00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.120
why did I get about that?
Uh,

88
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.710
they operate as if they have a project or a goal or a purpose.

89
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.750
Obviously human beings do,

90
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:10.480
but even a humble bacteria and pokes around seemingly knowingly,
uh,

91
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.710
looking for food or something,
they seem to know what they're doing.
Uh,
they,

92
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.690
unlike mes systems,
they create order out of chaos.
Uh,
there's a natural tendency,

93
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:22.040
I'll talk about it in the moment.

94
00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:26.930
The second law of thermodynamics for systems to degenerate and become more and

95
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:28.940
more disorderly.
It's easier to break it,

96
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.920
the make it then anyone here with teenage children will know exactly what I mean

97
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.870
when you inspect their bedrooms.

98
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.510
Living systems are self organizing and they evolve in an open ended way.

99
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.830
You cannot really predict in advance if you got an a time machine,

100
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:49.040
my back 3 billion years and there were just these sort of boring bacteria.

101
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.210
If you try to predict the future of the biosphere,

102
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.590
that would be trees and bees and cacti and so on,
you couldn't do it.

103
00:06:57.591 --> 00:07:02.591
It's an open ended and seemingly boundless possibility space

104
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.180
living organisms.
I suppose they most characteristic feature,

105
00:07:08.181 --> 00:07:13.181
at least the one that intrigues me is that they achieve seemingly impossible

106
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:13.791
states.

107
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:18.791
That is they achieve states of matter that could not arise in any other way from

108
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:20.510
nonliving systems.

109
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.470
And I give some examples later on and this race is a how question.

110
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.540
Like when I,

111
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.380
when I decided I would write a book about what is life about the nature of life.

112
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.380
A lot of my biology friends,
we're a bit baffled by that.
You know,

113
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:39.110
what's the problem?
We study life,
uh,

114
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.850
and of course biologist study what life does not,
what life is.

115
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:49.300
And the big issue for a physicist is that all this wonderful life,

116
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:54.380
which once it gets going keeps,
keeps going,
it all works very well.

117
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:58.130
It perpetuates itself.
So once the system is up and running it's fine.

118
00:07:58.131 --> 00:08:00.170
But how did it get started in the first place?

119
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.400
And that's a really important question because everybody I think wants to know

120
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.650
are we alone in the universe?

121
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.020
And the answer hinges on adjust,

122
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:14.570
how likely it is that life starts up from non life.
What is it?

123
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.530
What is the process that uh,
if you like animates matter,

124
00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:23.300
what is the process that makes normal matter living matter?

125
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.130
We don't know.
But if this is something which is incredibly unlikely,

126
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:33.131
if the chemical pathway leading from a mishmash of chemicals to the first living

127
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:35.210
thing was very long and convoluted,

128
00:08:35.211 --> 00:08:38.090
it may have happened only once in the entire observable universe,

129
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:43.430
in which case we are it,
there is no life anywhere else.
Alternatively,

130
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.380
if this is something that is this process as pathways built into the fundamental

131
00:08:48.381 --> 00:08:50.150
nature of the universe,

132
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.020
then we could expect that life will come.
Uh,
wherever there,

133
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.630
there are opportunities wherever they are earth like planets,

134
00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.140
university will be teaming with it.
So this is a really important question.

135
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.320
Now we're hampered in this entire discussion about life,
uh,

136
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.830
because we don't have a life meter.

137
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.940
This is what it might look like if you had one.
Um,

138
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.650
what we would ideally like to be able to do,

139
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.570
particularly in searching for life elsewhere,

140
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.840
is to send a life meter off to Mars or tighten or wherever you happen to think

141
00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:26.790
life may look.
Uh,
and it will come back hopefully with the reading showing,

142
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:27.870
yes there is life there.

143
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.650
But we also feel that the transition from non life to life isn't going to be an

144
00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:32.484
abrupt thing.

145
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.350
It's not just some amazing gigantic chemical reaction that just sort of happened

146
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:39.660
one day.
There's going to be this pathway.

147
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:43.170
We don't know whether it's a lot of jumps or just a slow rise.

148
00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:46.200
We don't know what it was cause we have no idea what that pathway was.
Um,

149
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.670
but wouldn't it be nice if we could go to somebody like titan sample,

150
00:09:50.671 --> 00:09:51.361
the atmosphere,

151
00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:56.361
which we know is full of organics and this life meter would say,

152
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.070
well nice try titan.

153
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.680
You've been there four and a half billion years trying to cook up life.

154
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:06.970
Didn't quite get there,
but you did get 83.7% of the way there.
Come back with a,

155
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.620
that was almost life will be no almost life if we saw it.

156
00:10:10.621 --> 00:10:11.970
We know life when we see it.

157
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:16.050
But can we tell the difference between something that's living,

158
00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:20.670
something's almost living.
Something that was living in no longer is now,

159
00:10:20.671 --> 00:10:24.780
this seems like a very sort of academic exercise and it's a type of question

160
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:28.200
we'd love to discuss in the beyond center at Arizona State University.

161
00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:31.740
And we sit around and we argue about this and define this and we think we've got

162
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:32.610
our own approach,

163
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:37.080
which I got to talk about in a moment based on the informational properties of

164
00:10:37.081 --> 00:10:38.280
these systems.
Uh,

165
00:10:38.281 --> 00:10:41.730
but there's a very practical sense in which it would be nice to know the answer

166
00:10:41.731 --> 00:10:43.710
of how to build a life meter.

167
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:47.120
We had a conference couple of years ago,
uh,

168
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.910
and presence in the meeting was Chris Mckay from Nasa Ames.

169
00:10:51.911 --> 00:10:55.910
So it's an astrobiology lab.
And we were trying to convince him that,
uh,

170
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.970
a true definition of life was a software definition,
not a hardware definition.

171
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.830
That definition based on the patterns and Organization of Information,

172
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.170
uh,
it should be substrate independent.

173
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:12.250
What we'd like is a universal definition of life that would apply whatever the

174
00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:14.050
chemical basis.
Uh,

175
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:18.540
and we've got some ideas about that and a little bit abstract and so on.
Uh,

176
00:11:18.541 --> 00:11:22.680
and Chrysalis response was,
well,
this is all very exciting and well and good,

177
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.760
but I have to tell NASA,
hey,
quarters,
by April the 24th,

178
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.940
what we're going to put on this spacecraft and the spacecraft a is going to go

179
00:11:32.281 --> 00:11:36.450
to a moon of Saturn called Enceladus.

180
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.570
Some people say enchilada.
Uh,

181
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.260
and you see that from the surface of Enceladus or these,

182
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.370
this plume of material coming out now and sell it as has our,

183
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.850
an icy crust but illiquid interior and the Cassini spacecraft measured organic

184
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:58.570
molecules coming out in that gas.
So it was,
Chris says,

185
00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:03.250
it's almost like at salad,
this is put up a sign saying life free samples.

186
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.980
And so what they'd like to do is fly a spacecraft that I go through that a plume

187
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.910
and put a life meter on board and tell us,
you know,
is,

188
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.950
is there life there or not?
But what,

189
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.730
as soon as you start thinking about exactly what the you put on that spacecraft,

190
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:23.730
you hit the,
what I regard as the fundamental problem with trying to,
uh,

191
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.810
understand what is life.

192
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.850
If you ask a physicist to describe life,
then you're going to have,

193
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.680
or a chemist,
you're going to have a description in terms of falses.

194
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:38.860
And molecular shapes are definitives and binding energies and entropy and the

195
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:43.420
energy and all that fun stuff that you learn,
uh,
in,
uh,

196
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:47.620
in physics degrees.
Uh,
if you ask about ologist,

197
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.660
you get a very different narrative.

198
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.560
So biologists will describe life in terms of coded information,
uh,

199
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.910
instructions,
editing,
transcription,

200
00:12:57.911 --> 00:13:02.800
translation signals,
uh,
all of those sorts of things.

201
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.960
And to summarize that in terms of information,

202
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.440
so physicists talk in terms of hardware,
stuff,

203
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.220
biologists talk in terms of software or information.

204
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:20.410
And very much in the news of the moment is a gene editing.

205
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.170
So sales,
we'll edit their own genes,

206
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.040
but now we can do it artificially,
we can intercede.

207
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:32.820
And so we have two very different conceptual descriptions of the same

208
00:13:33.371 --> 00:13:38.040
phenomenon.
And you might think,
well,
that's a problem.
Uh,
but,
um,

209
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.930
uh,
one of my scientific mentors,
John Wheeler,

210
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.210
was fond of saying that revolutions in science,

211
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.680
Omar to the clash of ideas than the steady accumulation of facts.

212
00:13:47.681 --> 00:13:52.681
And so when you see something like this twin narratives but completely different

213
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.540
conceptual basis,
that's where progress in sands is likely to come.
Now,

214
00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:01.460
if there are any doubters in the room that think information,
uh,

215
00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.430
is not terribly relevant to biology,

216
00:14:03.431 --> 00:14:06.380
let me just run through some obvious examples.
Uh,

217
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.630
the DNA in your body's is packed full of coded information.

218
00:14:10.631 --> 00:14:13.490
It's not just information,
it's encoded.
Uh,

219
00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:18.400
so the book of life is written in this four letter alphabet of a,
g,
C and t,

220
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:22.310
uh,
jeans down to act in isolation.
They tend to form networks,

221
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:24.570
sometimes a great complexity.
Uh,

222
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.610
they switch each other on and off and information swirls around these networks.

223
00:14:28.611 --> 00:14:31.180
So we've been studying that,
the patterns of information,

224
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:36.480
the way it's stored and how the network architecture typology,

225
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:42.490
the wiring diagram,
if you like,
uh,
affects the behavior of that information.

226
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:47.500
And what is very clear from people who study biological networks is that if you

227
00:14:48.071 --> 00:14:50.320
apply things like scaling laws,

228
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.660
that they're very different from random networks and otherwise evolution has

229
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:57.500
honed the topology and the architecture of these networks,
uh,

230
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.790
to have certain properties.
So when we think of life,
uh,
there,

231
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.800
there is a sort of reductionistic tendency to attribute biological functions to

232
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.610
specific genes or maybe collections of genes.

233
00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:15.140
But we should really think in these network terms.
Uh,
and if we want to,
uh,

234
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.760
either reconfigure life or a cure,
some disease or something,

235
00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:24.170
we really need to think of,
uh,
at,
at that network level,

236
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.290
the informational level now,
but it doesn't stop there.

237
00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:31.340
Individual cells signal each other.
They transfer information.

238
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.830
Even bacteria can form biofilms.

239
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:37.850
They appear to be very clever when they're acting collectively.
But of course,

240
00:15:37.851 --> 00:15:41.450
once you get up to,
uh,
the level of social insects,

241
00:15:41.451 --> 00:15:43.040
then collective decision making,

242
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:47.240
VR information transfer becomes a really important subject.

243
00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:51.290
We have a group per big group,
Asu,
uh,
working on,

244
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.070
uh,
how ants,
um,
get together that,
I mean,

245
00:15:55.071 --> 00:15:57.940
that looks like they're having a conference,
but,
uh,
uh,
they are,

246
00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:01.700
but they do have a little,
uh,
uh,
very complex repertoire of behavior.

247
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:05.410
But individually,
each hands is pretty stupid.
But collectively they're,

248
00:16:05.411 --> 00:16:07.920
they're pretty smart.
So Baird's in flux.

249
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.820
That's another example anyone has read.

250
00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:15.100
Today's papers were probably know that bees,

251
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.960
which also very clever,
I can not only play football,

252
00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.510
but apparently they can do arithmetic.
So,
uh,

253
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.880
all of this has to do with information exchange and collected decision making.

254
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:31.390
Probably the most dramatic example of information deployed in the service of

255
00:16:32.511 --> 00:16:37.040
life is the development of the embryo from single celled Zygote,

256
00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:41.570
the exquisite choreography that is involved in getting all the right bits in the

257
00:16:41.571 --> 00:16:43.580
right places at the right time.

258
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:48.260
And it's still not fully understood.
But Alan Turing,

259
00:16:48.261 --> 00:16:51.560
as a matter of fact,
had a great interest in this and developed a,

260
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.740
a mathematical theory about how morphogenetic these will be.
Uh,

261
00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:00.140
at that time her known chemicals might diffuse through our system and sort of

262
00:17:00.141 --> 00:17:03.740
set up a three dimensional grid against which,
uh,

263
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.180
as we would now say,

264
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:09.980
Lang modern language that the genes would express themselves in the appropriate

265
00:17:09.981 --> 00:17:10.580
way.

266
00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:15.230
What this is really saying is that there is a dynamic chemical network and a

267
00:17:15.231 --> 00:17:19.290
dynamic information network and these networks a couple together,
uh,

268
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:23.960
and there's complex feedback loops and the whole thing operates to give this

269
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.920
astonishing developmental pathway.
And then last but,
uh,

270
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:33.200
probably not least is what's between our ears.
Uh,
this is,
uh,

271
00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.580
perhaps the best example of it,
the power of information in biology.

272
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:42.320
Once it leads to behavior and understanding at the level of human beings,

273
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.030
then it becomes a truly spectacular.
One.

274
00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:51.180
Last point about this,
uh,
just last week,

275
00:17:51.181 --> 00:17:56.181
can my colleagues published a study in which they look to David 28,000 genomes?

276
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.240
Uh,
and this is a,
um,

277
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:02.140
a planet wide network of,
uh,

278
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.590
organized information that they've mapped out here.

279
00:18:04.591 --> 00:18:09.450
I won't go into the details except to say that the biosphere was the original

280
00:18:09.451 --> 00:18:12.750
worldwide web and it's a web of information exchange.

281
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:18.260
Now this idea that life is really about information and a logic and a

282
00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:24.000
information processing,
uh,
is certainly not my idea.

283
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:25.730
It didn't start with me.
Uh,

284
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:29.780
there was a very visionary paper in nature by Paneth,

285
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.600
the former president of the royal society could life,
logic and information.

286
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.180
And again,
I'll just read what he has to say.

287
00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.530
We need to describe the molecular interactions and biochemical transformations

288
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:45.120
that take place in living organisms and then translate these descriptions into

289
00:18:45.121 --> 00:18:48.450
the logic circuits that reveal how information is managed.

290
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.590
This analysis should not be confined to the flow of information from gene to

291
00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:53.424
protein,

292
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:58.550
but should also be applied to all functions operating in cells and organisms.

293
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.560
And so what he's saying here is that we should perhaps think of life as a little

294
00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:08.130
bit like electronics where you have these modules with each of which has a

295
00:19:08.131 --> 00:19:10.740
function.
Uh,
these may just be logical functions.

296
00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:14.820
There are many examples of logic gates in bacteria,
for example,

297
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:18.840
in gene regulatory circuits,
a that just operate and they can be wired together.

298
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:23.010
They just operate like a logic gates in computers.

299
00:19:23.011 --> 00:19:28.011
And so this enables even simple organisms to carry out really very sophisticated

300
00:19:28.141 --> 00:19:30.270
computations.
Now,

301
00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.740
a lot of this was presaged by the co inventor of the Computer Nyman.

302
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:39.810
So cheering came up originally with the idea of a universal computer.

303
00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:44.640
So that is a machine that could compute anything or could output anything that

304
00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:49.530
was in principle,
computable given long enough.
And Paul Nyman,
uh,

305
00:19:49.531 --> 00:19:53.090
drew a close analogy with what he called a universal constructor.

306
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:58.310
Universal constructor would be a machine that could take parts if he is provided

307
00:19:58.651 --> 00:20:02.280
with enough parts and it could assemble them into anything that it was

308
00:20:02.281 --> 00:20:07.110
programmed to do,
including itself,
it can make a copy of itself.

309
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:11.040
So he was interesting in the concept of a self reproducing machine.

310
00:20:11.041 --> 00:20:12.840
Is it possible he said to build a machine,

311
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:17.010
they could construct any physical system including itself.

312
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.550
And in carrying that analysis through,
uh,

313
00:20:20.551 --> 00:20:25.551
he preceded the logical architecture that we now know life on earth uses a,

314
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.470
that life is really an information replication of management system.

315
00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:33.600
And in particular the dual row,

316
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:38.580
he foresaw the dual role of DNA.
Uh,
what'd I say?
Do row.

317
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.000
There are two things that can happen to DNA.
So it sits there,

318
00:20:42.001 --> 00:20:46.260
this famous double helix and it's got instructions in the form of genes.

319
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.020
These can be read out.
So it can be a,
as it were,

320
00:20:50.021 --> 00:20:54.240
a database for the life project.
It could be read out.
Uh,
and,

321
00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:58.870
and in that sense it's in active mode.
It's,
it's sending that information out.

322
00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.810
Uh,
but when the seller comes to divide,
that stops actually,

323
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.440
it doesn't stop the two things that go on together,
but nevermind,
ah,

324
00:21:06.441 --> 00:21:10.860
there it goes,
flips to the other function.
It then is just not,
um,
uh,

325
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:15.220
information.
It's not a database.
It is then just a physical object,

326
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.260
a physical structure that gets replicated.

327
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.930
So two quite separate things happen to DNA.
One is it gets read out the other,

328
00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.050
it gets replicated.

329
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.980
Nobody quite knows exactly how cells toggle between these two different

330
00:21:29.591 --> 00:21:30.700
functions of DNA.

331
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.940
But in his notion of a self reproducing machine for nine months,

332
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:40.870
uh,
he,
he spoke to something called a supervisory unit,
which were basically say,

333
00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:46.210
okay,
make this,
make this,
make this,
make this,
then stop my hand.
Nothing.

334
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:49.930
We're just copy the instruction set and take down instruction set and put it in

335
00:21:49.931 --> 00:21:53.170
the project that so had to have what life does.

336
00:21:53.171 --> 00:21:58.171
True self replication DNA has to have that dual hardware software function.

337
00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.180
Now I'm software,
now I'm harbor.

338
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:06.010
So really important insight into the fundamental logic that runs life as we know

339
00:22:06.011 --> 00:22:09.360
it and have an omen was absolutely right.
Uh,

340
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:14.400
this is the way that life does organize itself.
We're now,
uh,
let,

341
00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:17.150
let me move on because I don't have too much longer.
Uh,

342
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.230
all of this raises the question of what is information.

343
00:22:20.231 --> 00:22:24.320
I've been using that in a very sort of colloquial sense.
Um,

344
00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:29.490
but I'd like to tell you a little bit about how we need to think of information,

345
00:22:29.801 --> 00:22:32.230
not so much as something to talk about,

346
00:22:32.231 --> 00:22:35.830
but as a physical variable that can enter into the laws of physics.

347
00:22:35.831 --> 00:22:39.360
Because I provocatively said at the outset,
I agree with [inaudible],

348
00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:43.300
we need a new type of physical law and I think it's a physical law that will

349
00:22:43.301 --> 00:22:47.440
embed information in a fundamental way in the laws of physics.

350
00:22:47.441 --> 00:22:52.400
These will be new laws of physics,
but it would be physics,
not magic.
Uh,

351
00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:56.590
to do that you had to quantify information until most of the people here know

352
00:22:56.591 --> 00:23:01.591
that this was Claude Shannon who developed information theory in the late 1940s

353
00:23:02.651 --> 00:23:07.090
and define the binary digit or bit,
uh,
if you don't know their story,

354
00:23:07.091 --> 00:23:10.460
one bit of information is what you get if you toss a coin and then see whether

355
00:23:10.461 --> 00:23:13.870
it came down heads or tails.
Uh,
but,
um,

356
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.920
Shannon defined information in terms of reduction in uncertainty.
Uh,

357
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:20.080
you,
you've got a 50,

358
00:23:20.081 --> 00:23:24.880
50 chance heads or tails where you look and see that uncertainty goes away.

359
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.220
And that's just one bit of uncertainty.

360
00:23:27.221 --> 00:23:32.010
So that is all a standard stuff these days.
Uh,

361
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.800
but what I'm going to ask is can inflammation,

362
00:23:35.801 --> 00:23:37.660
which seems to be a sort of abstract concept,

363
00:23:37.661 --> 00:23:39.340
can they actually have physical cloud?

364
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:44.500
There's an analogy here with energy.
So as you're all aware,

365
00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:45.290
uh,

366
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:50.290
information is something that can be instantiated in a wide variety of physical

367
00:23:51.231 --> 00:23:55.130
systems.
If you want a copy,
a file from your computer to a flash drive,

368
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.490
you can do that.
You keep the information,
you can then send it down.

369
00:23:58.491 --> 00:24:00.920
An optical fiber is photons.
Uh,

370
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:04.430
there's any number of different ways you could store all that information.

371
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.810
The information is conserved.
It's independent of the substrate,
just like energy.

372
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.321
Uh,

373
00:24:09.321 --> 00:24:14.300
you can convert electrical energy into mechanical energy or gravitational energy

374
00:24:14.301 --> 00:24:16.850
or chemical energy.
The energy stays the same,

375
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.240
but it's manifestation or instantiation,
uh,

376
00:24:20.241 --> 00:24:22.400
can be passed from one thing to another.

377
00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:26.060
So just as energy has a sort of independent existence,

378
00:24:26.061 --> 00:24:27.440
but it's always tied to matter.

379
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:32.450
So information we talk about it as if it's a thing with an independent
existence,

380
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.220
but it is always tied to matter.

381
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:38.420
So to fully understand how information operates in living systems,

382
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:42.020
we have to understand how information couples to matter,

383
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:47.030
not just as a way of speaking,
but,
uh,
in a law like manner.
And it turns out that,

384
00:24:47.031 --> 00:24:50.950
uh,
the answer,
the beginnings of announcer,
we're already there,
uh,

385
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.710
in the 19th century with the work of James Clark,

386
00:24:54.711 --> 00:24:59.090
Maxwell and Maxwell's demon.
Now let me just explain this concept.

387
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:04.360
So Maxwell who unified electricity and magnetism also made seminal contributions

388
00:25:05.511 --> 00:25:09.680
to the theory of heat.
And in a letter to a friend,

389
00:25:09.681 --> 00:25:12.890
I mean this was a while to Fuzz,
is called a thought experiment.

390
00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.690
He envisaged a tiny being soon to be called a demon who could perceive

391
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.070
individual molecules in their pallets and then salt them into fast and slow

392
00:25:22.071 --> 00:25:22.631
categories.

393
00:25:22.631 --> 00:25:27.631
So what you see there is a shutter mechanism and the Wiley Demon will open the

394
00:25:28.341 --> 00:25:33.341
shutter to let fast moving particles go from right to left and slow moving

395
00:25:33.411 --> 00:25:35.060
particles go the other direction.

396
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:40.310
And Maxwell argued that that could be done without any expenditure of energy.

397
00:25:40.311 --> 00:25:42.470
It was a,
in principle,
you could just,

398
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.250
it was just a matter of letting the molecules,
uh,
move through.

399
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.810
And if you do that,
because molecular speed is a measure of temperature,

400
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.510
you end up with the left side hot on the right side.

401
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.340
And then an engineer could build you a heat engine that could do useful work to

402
00:25:58.341 --> 00:25:59.720
run off their temperature gradient.

403
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:04.750
So this was a device Maxwell's demon of converting information about the

404
00:26:06.531 --> 00:26:09.950
molecules into work,
heat into work.

405
00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.650
Without any further ado.

406
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:16.070
And that's in flagrant violation of the second law of thermodynamics.

407
00:26:16.071 --> 00:26:17.780
The most fundamental law of the universe.

408
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:23.270
And that's the law that we think of when we say he goes from hot to cold.
Uh,

409
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:26.300
for example,
if you put a snow person,

410
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:29.420
I guess we should call it next to a fire,
uh,

411
00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.500
the snow person melts and the f five,
you know,
loses heat.

412
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.550
It doesn't go the other way.

413
00:26:34.551 --> 00:26:38.090
You don't find that there's more and more snow on the right.
Uh,

414
00:26:38.091 --> 00:26:41.600
and the flames get hotter and hotter.
So that's very familiar.

415
00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:45.930
Nobody really would contest that except some who might be thinking,
well,

416
00:26:45.931 --> 00:26:47.610
how would I want to back up my refrigerator?

417
00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:52.080
Doesn't that take a heat from the cold interior and put it into the warm
kitchen?

418
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:56.280
And the answer is yes.
And you pay an electricity bill for that.

419
00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.460
In other words,
given energy,
yes,

420
00:26:59.461 --> 00:27:02.820
you can make heat flow up hill or backwards or reverse the Arrow of time,

421
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.600
however you want to think of it.
Uh,
but Maxwell's demon does it.

422
00:27:06.601 --> 00:27:08.310
It's not plugged into the national grid.

423
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Maxwell's demon does it for nothing but not quite for nothing because Maxwell's

424
00:27:14.011 --> 00:27:18.210
demon is using information to gain a firmer than I make advantage.

425
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:22.830
And that says the information is a type of fuel.
And sure enough,

426
00:27:22.831 --> 00:27:25.800
it is a type of fjord.
And the last three or four years,

427
00:27:25.801 --> 00:27:28.620
there'd been a flood of papers and experiments,
uh,

428
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:33.120
making what I called information engines.
These engines run on information,

429
00:27:33.121 --> 00:27:35.760
power alone.
My favorite one is in Finland.

430
00:27:35.761 --> 00:27:39.700
This is an inflammation powered refrigerator.
Yeah,
you can actually do this.
Um,

431
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:46.020
each got an efficiency of 75% of converting bits,
uh,
into,

432
00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:49.170
uh,
into work or into a energy.

433
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:54.770
And it's not really going to spark a kitchen revolution in the near future

434
00:27:55.651 --> 00:27:59.730
because this is nano technology is,
is on a nano scale.
But nevertheless,

435
00:27:59.731 --> 00:28:02.850
it establishes the important principle.
The Maxwell was right.

436
00:28:02.851 --> 00:28:04.380
So this is a Maxwell demon.

437
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:09.420
There's one just a couple of months ago reported in Korea that has more than 98%

438
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:14.460
conversion efficiency of information into work.
Uh,
but it was,

439
00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:17.670
um,
a couple of,
uh,
of giants of the field,

440
00:28:17.671 --> 00:28:21.330
of the theory of computation working at IBM,
Rolf Landauer.

441
00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:26.390
And then Charles Bennett who really put all this together about 20 years ago,

442
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.670
they were interested in the fundamental limits of computation.
Uh,

443
00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:33.770
what I often say to people is,
um,
uh,

444
00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.920
this machine here is the laptop.
But you know,
I very rarely put it on my lap.

445
00:28:37.921 --> 00:28:40.080
And I think these days people tend to not do that.

446
00:28:40.081 --> 00:28:41.160
But if you do put it on your lap,

447
00:28:41.161 --> 00:28:44.880
you and it just gets hot and that heat is a wasted,
in fact,

448
00:28:44.881 --> 00:28:49.210
I read somewhere that the entire heat output from the world's computing industry

449
00:28:49.211 --> 00:28:51.780
is more than the power requirements of Denmark.

450
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:56.550
And increasingly a lot of that's going to big coin in a bitcoin is costing

451
00:28:56.551 --> 00:29:01.050
staggering amounts of energy.
Now,
you know,
why do you expend energy like that?

452
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.970
And so what Landau was interested in is how do the laws of computing and the

453
00:29:05.971 --> 00:29:08.130
laws of thermodynamics interconnect?

454
00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:13.580
And they do because every time a bit is flipped or erased it model the point

455
00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:19.170
that you generate a little bit of heat and that could be reduced enormously.

456
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
And I just ask you to think that your brain is like a mega what super

457
00:29:26.351 --> 00:29:29.970
supercomputer,
but it runs on the equivalent of a light bulb,
small light bulb.

458
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.830
So it's,

459
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.630
it's possible to greatly reduce the amount of heat which is expended.
Uh,

460
00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:40.410
Landauer and later Charles Bennett were interested,
could it be reduced to zero?

461
00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.910
Could you have reversible computation?
Uh,

462
00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.260
and all that's in the book I won't get into with here that have enough time,

463
00:29:47.261 --> 00:29:50.880
but what they identify,
at least what Charles Bennett identified,
uh,

464
00:29:50.881 --> 00:29:53.980
is that you're not getting something for nothing here,
mate.

465
00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:58.310
Maxwell's steam and looks like it's some sort of perpetual motion machine.
It's,

466
00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.600
it's really not because,
uh,
you get a little bit,

467
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.680
you can always grab a little bit of a thermodynamic advantage,

468
00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.810
but if you wanted something for your kitchen,

469
00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.000
you'd have to go on doing it again and again.
And again.

470
00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:11.860
You'd have to have a cycle.

471
00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.130
And in order to operate a Maxwell demon and the cycle,

472
00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:19.240
the poor thing gets his brain clogged up with information because remember it's

473
00:30:19.241 --> 00:30:24.241
got to observe store act and then that's in its register and that register will

474
00:30:25.271 --> 00:30:29.110
fill up and fill up.
And so at some stage it has to be cleared out,
brainwashed,

475
00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.200
reset and started again.

476
00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:37.410
And that act of resetting the register generates as much entropy as you have

477
00:30:37.861 --> 00:30:40.360
gained.
So overall in the universe,

478
00:30:40.361 --> 00:30:44.680
the second law is still a bade,
but nevertheless,

479
00:30:44.681 --> 00:30:48.910
at the level of nanotechnology,
uh,
you can gain an advantage,
uh,

480
00:30:48.911 --> 00:30:50.680
on here as a matter of interest.

481
00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.100
For the more mathematically inclined is the second law of thermodynamics that

482
00:30:54.101 --> 00:30:55.810
explicitly includes information.

483
00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:58.780
So if you put an information termi measured in bits,

484
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:03.280
put an information to him in to that equation,
the books balance.

485
00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:07.570
Now you might be thinking,
well,
this is all well and good for nanotechnologists.

486
00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:11.080
What's he got to do with life?
And the answer is what life is all about.

487
00:31:11.081 --> 00:31:15.460
Nano technology that we're full of molecular machines,

488
00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:20.620
many of them are Maxwell demons.
Chuntering away doing the business of life.

489
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.810
There are many examples.
It reads about them in the book,

490
00:31:22.811 --> 00:31:26.350
but I'm just going to give you one to give you the flavor of this cause I need

491
00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:31.330
to wind this up in a moment.
Um,
the,
uh,
uh,
what's going on in your head says,

492
00:31:31.331 --> 00:31:35.800
I hope you're paying attention,
uh,
is that your neurons are signaling each other.

493
00:31:35.801 --> 00:31:40.801
There's these signals a little bit like electrical wires,

494
00:31:40.811 --> 00:31:43.230
the axons in your brain,
but it's the,

495
00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:46.360
it's not like a flow of electrons through the brain.

496
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.710
What happens is that there's like a wave of polarization,

497
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:54.220
electric polarization across the membrane of the Axon.

498
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.760
And there are these holes in the membrane that are gated,

499
00:31:57.761 --> 00:31:59.020
just like Maxwell's demon.

500
00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:02.320
They can be opened and closed and the brain does open and close them.

501
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.310
It gets inflammation from the neighboring pattern.

502
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:09.610
Electrical pattern makes decisions to open and close them and lets through

503
00:32:09.611 --> 00:32:13.300
sodium ions in one direction and potassium ions in the other direction with

504
00:32:13.301 --> 00:32:16.420
great fidelity and no energy expenditure,

505
00:32:16.421 --> 00:32:19.720
which is why all this can happen with just a light bulb.

506
00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:25.030
And so that's one great example of life using a Maxwell demon type advice.

507
00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:26.500
Uh,
in this case in our heads.

508
00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:30.670
I want to wrap this up by talking about how did all this stuff happened in the

509
00:32:30.671 --> 00:32:32.880
first place.
What Darwin,
uh,

510
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:37.810
famously gave us a wonderful account of how life had evolved over billions of

511
00:32:37.811 --> 00:32:41.990
years on earth,
but he refused to be drawn on the origin of life.

512
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:45.080
The problem of life's origin,
uh,
mean rubbish.
He said,

513
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:47.960
thinking of this one might as well think of the origin of matter.

514
00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:53.030
And when I was a student,
the feeling was very much summed up by crick.

515
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.680
Life seems almost a miracle.

516
00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:59.360
He said so many of the conditions for it to get Gehring.
This didn't stop.

517
00:32:59.361 --> 00:33:04.361
Some people like a Stanley Miller attentive to cook up life in the lab by,

518
00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:06.470
uh,
in this case,

519
00:33:06.471 --> 00:33:11.240
putting some common gaseous and sparking electricity through them.
Uh,
this,

520
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:14.970
uh,
whole prebiotic synthesis,
uh,

521
00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:19.070
enterprise continues to this day.
They've got a bit further,
but not very much.

522
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:22.730
But I think there's an absolutely fundamental reason why we're not going to

523
00:33:22.731 --> 00:33:26.420
solve the secret of life,
uh,
by mixing stuff up in a chemistry lab.

524
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:27.831
And the answer,

525
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:31.400
I've said it all along is that life's distinguishing feature is the way it

526
00:33:31.401 --> 00:33:36.401
organizes and manages information and no greater example can I give then the

527
00:33:37.851 --> 00:33:39.810
genetic code itself,
uh,
the,

528
00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:44.960
the information on your DNA is coded information has got to be decoded before it

529
00:33:44.961 --> 00:33:49.910
means anything before it has biological functionality.
And of course,

530
00:33:49.911 --> 00:33:53.480
what we'd like to know is how did this come to exist in the first place from

531
00:33:53.481 --> 00:33:58.481
some sort of molecular Maloo random forces?

532
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:01.580
How did a genetic code arise?

533
00:34:01.581 --> 00:34:06.230
How come molecules write code?
It's very deeply baffling.

534
00:34:06.231 --> 00:34:10.640
I think we're a long way from understanding that.
Uh,
but to truly finish,

535
00:34:10.641 --> 00:34:13.010
I want to tell you that it goes much beyond that.

536
00:34:13.011 --> 00:34:14.990
And so I'm going to finish on a sort of lighthearted though,

537
00:34:14.991 --> 00:34:17.140
but it's actually a very profound,
uh,

538
00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:21.620
which is that information about energy goes beyond the gene.

539
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:25.250
There's a whole field called epigenetics,
which recognizes that,

540
00:34:25.251 --> 00:34:28.460
but the particular epigeneticist sign like best,
uh,

541
00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.720
Mike Levin at Tufts University,
he's got a,

542
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:36.730
the Allen Discovery Center there where he likes to work with these worms called

543
00:34:36.821 --> 00:34:39.740
planaria are teachers love these because they have a head and a tail,

544
00:34:39.741 --> 00:34:40.640
even have a little brain.

545
00:34:40.641 --> 00:34:42.890
Apparently you see the eyes at one end tail at the other.

546
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:45.200
The great thing is if you chop them in half,

547
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.650
then the town makes a head and the head makes a tail.
Uh,

548
00:34:48.651 --> 00:34:53.060
and so children love that.
You see the,
uh,
the,
there we go.

549
00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:56.510
Uh,
you can get two of them and you can go on doing this.

550
00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:58.460
You get more and more and more of them.
And I asked Mike,

551
00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:01.070
do they have ever have sex?
And he said,
well,
they do,

552
00:35:01.071 --> 00:35:05.500
but they prefer to be chopped up.
Now what,

553
00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.700
what might can do is,

554
00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.920
what is he's discovered is that when you chop them in,
chop chop through them,

555
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.550
the electric polarization across the membrane.

556
00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:17.450
That's what I was talking about with the axons.

557
00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.870
All cells had that they will have a potential difference across the member and

558
00:35:20.871 --> 00:35:25.190
their pump protons out to keep that,
that gets altered around the wound.

559
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:29.300
Uh,
so the path,
there's an electrical pattern there.

560
00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:34.310
Now he can muck around with that pattern with drugs that sort of alter the ionic

561
00:35:34.311 --> 00:35:37.530
concentration and so on.
And uh,
when he fiddles like that,

562
00:35:37.531 --> 00:35:42.531
he can end up making a two headed and two tailed.

563
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.470
Well,
and again,

564
00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:48.840
I asked him are the two Taub one's really stupid and he said it doesn't seem to

565
00:35:48.841 --> 00:35:51.770
make a lot of difference where they head to head on up,
but,

566
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.370
and this is a mind blowing thing.

567
00:35:53.371 --> 00:35:57.390
If he chops up at two headed worm and the two halves,

568
00:35:57.391 --> 00:35:59.880
you might think that would restore the original phenotype.

569
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:02.640
But now it makes two two headed worms.

570
00:36:02.641 --> 00:36:05.130
And the same thing with the two two tail worms.

571
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.950
The point is they've got identical DNA.

572
00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:12.330
So a visitor from Mars might think these are different species,

573
00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:16.950
but they've got identical DNA.
So this is Epi genetic inheritance,

574
00:36:16.951 --> 00:36:21.900
it's often called.
So this is a way that the information about the phenotype,

575
00:36:21.901 --> 00:36:25.830
about the physical form is propagated from one to the next,

576
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.860
not in the genes.
And we don't know how it's propagated.

577
00:36:28.861 --> 00:36:31.620
We're working with him to try to figure out where is that information being

578
00:36:31.621 --> 00:36:36.330
stored and processed and passed on.
Uh,
it raises,
uh,

579
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.810
uh,
this,
uh,

580
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:42.990
entire question about electrically encoded software by bioelectric memory.

581
00:36:42.991 --> 00:36:47.520
And where does it come from?
Um,
a postscript to this is that he took a lot of,

582
00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:52.420
um,
and his colleagues,
he's,
he has a large research group.
Uh,

583
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.360
it took a lot of these worms chopped the middle,

584
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:58.860
the middle's out and sent all these middles off to the space station.
Uh,

585
00:36:58.861 --> 00:37:02.490
there it is.
And,
um,
when the middle's came back,

586
00:37:02.491 --> 00:37:06.090
about 15% of them had two heads,
you see?
So they,
he,

587
00:37:06.091 --> 00:37:10.830
but they basically lost the head down on earth,
but it came back with two.
Uh,
and,

588
00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:14.480
uh,
this was much publicized in the press a couple of years ago here in,

589
00:37:14.481 --> 00:37:19.170
in Britain that was described as a two heady flatworm stand.

590
00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:22.550
The scientists boffins baffled disease.
Uh,

591
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:25.970
Mike Levin has no idea what a boffin is.
I had to explain all this.
Um,

592
00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:30.660
but whenever it puffins get mentioned,
there was baffled.
Uh,
so,

593
00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:35.550
uh,
this takes us beyond the gene to epigenetic control,
mechanical,

594
00:37:35.551 --> 00:37:39.160
electrical and gravitational effects can all,
uh,

595
00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:43.650
determine what genes are switched on and off and therefore informational

596
00:37:43.651 --> 00:37:46.830
patterns.
Uh,
and that leads us to questions like,

597
00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:50.150
is there an electrical code to go alongside it?
Uh,

598
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:55.220
can we use this a electrical leverage to cure things like cancer or birth

599
00:37:55.651 --> 00:38:00.390
defects,
defects or repair tissues.
We came into this,
so I came into this lecture,

600
00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.960
uh,
w with the quantum mechanics and I would like to leave it with quantum

601
00:38:03.961 --> 00:38:04.794
mechanics,
uh,

602
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:09.630
because I think that the true answer to finding her information capitals to

603
00:38:09.631 --> 00:38:10.980
matter in biological systems,

604
00:38:10.981 --> 00:38:15.981
what probably come at the same interface where we are into large molecules that

605
00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.580
have quantum effects.
But we,

606
00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:25.730
some people suspect that these quantum effects will become modified when they're

607
00:38:25.951 --> 00:38:26.970
sufficiently large.

608
00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:31.740
And there's an entire field of quantum biology struggling to get out where

609
00:38:31.741 --> 00:38:36.741
people are conjecturing that if life is so clever at manipulating bits,

610
00:38:36.791 --> 00:38:41.050
cannot manipulate cubits as well.
And of course,
quantum computing,

611
00:38:41.051 --> 00:38:45.700
Google is invested in that.
Uh,
this is a a billion dollar research,

612
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:49.690
multibillion dollar research project around the world to build a quantum

613
00:38:49.691 --> 00:38:51.040
computer.
Uh,

614
00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:56.100
and somehow I feel that if quantum computing is achievable but surprise me a

615
00:38:57.341 --> 00:38:57.971
great deal,

616
00:38:57.971 --> 00:39:02.971
if that was the first human technology that had never been found in nature,

617
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.260
everything else we've invented nature got their first,
uh,

618
00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:11.020
is quantum computing to be the exception.
I somehow don't think so.

619
00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:16.320
And I somehow think that quantum biology and the convergence of nanotechnology,

620
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:22.750
chemistry,
physics,
information theory in that realm,

621
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:26.770
which still likes a name that's going to be the next great frontier of physics.

622
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.410
That's my last word on the subject.
Thank you.

623
00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:35.080
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

624
00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:42.540
<v 3>to keep my information as fuel.
Does that imply that and Maxwell's demon,</v>

625
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:44.280
the information is being destroyed?

626
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:47.800
<v 1>Uh,
well,
uh,
I</v>

627
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:50.470
did explain that set,

628
00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:54.940
but perhaps rather quickly that when the register is clear to repeat the cycle,

629
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.280
that's where the information is destroyed and the,

630
00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.680
and the entropy of the system rises.
Uh,

631
00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.210
so it's limited to the,

632
00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:08.380
basically the storage capacity of the demons register.
Uh,

633
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.600
and so this,
uh,

634
00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:14.020
entire field is still not absolutely completely worked out to everybody's

635
00:40:14.021 --> 00:40:16.660
satisfaction.
Um,
that people say,
well,

636
00:40:16.661 --> 00:40:20.260
suppose when you had an infinite supply of demons or supposing you store that

637
00:40:20.261 --> 00:40:24.550
information,
not a in any,
uh,
energy land landscape,

638
00:40:24.551 --> 00:40:26.130
but some other physical variable.

639
00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.210
And I might there be some way of getting around this.

640
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:31.240
It's all active actively under investigation.

641
00:40:31.241 --> 00:40:35.550
But the key point is that the information is used to gain a thermodynamic

642
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.100
advantage to convert heat into work,
but in a small amount.

643
00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:43.720
And that if you go on doing that cumulatively sooner or later you have to erase

644
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.480
the information in the register and then you get back the entropy,

645
00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:51.970
the entropy disadvantage,
it compensates you for the game that you've had.

646
00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:53.910
So it's not a free lunch,
but,

647
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:58.090
but if the name of the game is to play the margins of thermal dynamics on a nano

648
00:40:58.091 --> 00:41:02.140
scale,
then that's certainly what life is doing.
But I didn't have time.

649
00:41:02.141 --> 00:41:06.580
Life is doing much more than just playing a thermodynamic game.
Uh,

650
00:41:06.581 --> 00:41:11.230
it's also doing this complex organization and coded information management and

651
00:41:11.231 --> 00:41:11.810
so on.

652
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:15.460
And all of that has to come in any true understanding of the nature of life.

653
00:41:15.461 --> 00:41:16.630
And so,
uh,
the,

654
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:20.410
the game of chess I skipped over but would have been if I'd have had time and

655
00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:25.240
attempt to explain how I think we can capture that concept of functional or

656
00:41:25.241 --> 00:41:28.210
meaningful information in a context,
uh,

657
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.310
in a new type of physical law,

658
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:34.640
which was what trading of the suggesting it would be a sort of top down law in

659
00:41:34.641 --> 00:41:39.560
which the,
um,
just to give you the words in which the,
uh,
dynamic,

660
00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:40.940
I'll update rules if you like.

661
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:45.940
The evolution of the system will be a function of the state of a system.

662
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:49.370
Quite unlike any law of physics we've had so far where the laws are fixed,

663
00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:52.770
the states change with time.
We're advocating that the,
um,

664
00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:56.840
the laws are a function of the state and that gives a whole new pathways to

665
00:41:56.841 --> 00:42:01.370
complexity and we've done some computer models to foster that,

666
00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:05.240
that claim.
So that's why I think the new type of physical law comes in.

667
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:08.930
But this is still a work in progress.
Do Think,
uh,

668
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:13.790
physics can explain consciousness?
Ah,
wow.
There's the how chapter book,

669
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:16.430
the other book on consciousness.
I thank you for mentioning that.

670
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:22.660
I found most of my life being a cosmologists and so I've been interested in the

671
00:42:22.941 --> 00:42:26.150
origin of the universe and then as is obvious,

672
00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.640
more recently I've become interested in the origin of life.

673
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:32.570
And I like to say there are really three great origin problems,

674
00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.730
university life and then consciousness.

675
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:37.850
I think we've cracked the problem more or less.
So the origin of the universe,

676
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:41.360
that's the easy one.
Uh,
the origin of life is very tough,

677
00:42:41.361 --> 00:42:44.270
but I think we're on the case.
The origin of consciousness.

678
00:42:44.271 --> 00:42:47.570
We don't even know how to frame that.
However,

679
00:42:47.571 --> 00:42:50.870
that hasn't stopped me writing a chapter about it.
Uh,
this is,

680
00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.640
this is a chapter in which I more or less,
uh,
uh,

681
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:57.620
outline what all the problems are rather than they come up with the solutions.

682
00:42:57.621 --> 00:43:01.490
But there is one thing that I warmed to and it's part of this power of

683
00:43:01.491 --> 00:43:04.040
information.
There's a whole,
I should say,

684
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:08.060
not just biological networks network and researchers who like these things.

685
00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:12.060
One of these is a Giulio Tononi.
Uh,

686
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:16.610
he's a neuroscientist and he's defined something called integrated information.

687
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:17.231
Uh,

688
00:43:17.231 --> 00:43:20.900
and so it's often said that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and

689
00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:24.030
never more so then for consciousness.
Uh,

690
00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:29.100
and this is a way of attempting to mathematize that feeling that the collective

691
00:43:29.511 --> 00:43:32.630
system has greater power than the components.
Uh,

692
00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:35.580
and he can demonstrate that for certain types of networks,
we,

693
00:43:35.581 --> 00:43:39.500
certain types of feedback loops.
So in principle,
if you believed his definition,

694
00:43:39.501 --> 00:43:43.790
which very few people do,
but it's,
you know,
heroic try,
uh,
you'd be able to say,

695
00:43:43.791 --> 00:43:48.320
well,
there's a thermostat conscious.
That's a famous conundrum,
uh,
you know,

696
00:43:48.321 --> 00:43:52.480
is a radio consciousness and conscious and he could give an answer.
Did.

697
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.650
He actually has a way of defining a consciousness meter,

698
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:58.550
not just the life meet their consciousness meter.

699
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.490
And it all depends on the architecture,

700
00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:06.230
the information architecture in the network.
So that,
that's something that I,

701
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.440
I do describe and,
and I should probably say at this stage,

702
00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:13.110
having mentioned that there's a network of collaborators.
Um,
uh,

703
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:15.760
almost everything that I write in my book,
uh,

704
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:19.860
originates with my young collaborators,
Sarah Walker,

705
00:44:19.861 --> 00:44:24.770
and are magnificent group of students and postdocs.
And Sarah is so gracious,

706
00:44:24.771 --> 00:44:25.191
she said,

707
00:44:25.191 --> 00:44:30.191
but everything I tell you I got from here in the first place.

708
00:44:30.261 --> 00:44:33.900
And so,
um,
uh,
but I,
but,
but she's,
she's very smart.

709
00:44:33.901 --> 00:44:37.520
And so a lot of these ideas are actually has,
um,
in Alaska

710
00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.730
<v 4>a few years I've been hearing about the free energy principle,</v>

711
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:45.770
which tries to define a life as being something that can mirror its environment

712
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:49.160
and lake coming up,
coming up with a definition of life,
uh,

713
00:44:49.161 --> 00:44:51.800
as a system that's capable of mirroring it environment.

714
00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.740
And I was wondering if you'd heard of this and what you are taught are,

715
00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:59.990
<v 1>so is this the work of Jeremy England?
Yes,
yes,
yes,
yes.</v>

716
00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:03.410
And he and his staff does get a bit of a mantra here.

717
00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:07.660
Not as big a mention as in Dan Brown's book,
but he is the,
I guess,

718
00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:11.750
get some engine.
Um,
and uh,
it's connected.

719
00:45:11.751 --> 00:45:15.930
I mean it's this whole point about,
uh,
uh,
par.
Um,

720
00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:20.450
these pathways are often very complex in biology of going from here to here on

721
00:45:20.451 --> 00:45:22.170
how much,
uh,
that,

722
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:26.030
so I should suggest get technical technical for a moment.

723
00:45:26.031 --> 00:45:29.780
The word free energy has a very specific meaning to a physicist.

724
00:45:29.781 --> 00:45:32.450
It doesn't mean as energy for free.
I mean it's available.

725
00:45:32.451 --> 00:45:34.490
Energy is probably a better way of looking at it.

726
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:39.620
And the F that appeared in that equation I showed that had the item or that is

727
00:45:39.621 --> 00:45:44.040
the,
the free energy and information has to come into that.
Uh,

728
00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:47.900
and so it's,
it,
it is very much connected with the same thing.

729
00:45:47.901 --> 00:45:50.930
There's something called [inaudible] is inequality that goes into this.
And,

730
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:55.760
and in in the book you will see a yard in scares contraction that can turn

731
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:59.060
information into work and it looks like a child's mobile.
It's a,

732
00:45:59.061 --> 00:46:02.410
it's a thought experiment.
But,
but as I say,
these things,
not,

733
00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.240
not that particular button,
but these sorts of things are being built now.

734
00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.500
This is part of the technology.

735
00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:10.930
<v 5>Uh,
so I just have a clarification question regarding the a Maxwell demon.</v>

736
00:46:10.931 --> 00:46:11.291
So I think,

737
00:46:11.291 --> 00:46:16.291
I don't understand why the demons information content as it does its job is

738
00:46:16.331 --> 00:46:18.280
going up.
Like,
you know,

739
00:46:18.281 --> 00:46:22.300
I would have imagined that the demon just decide to own a certain speed

740
00:46:22.301 --> 00:46:23.470
threshold yes.

741
00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:28.560
In the direction then let's every molecule approaching it at a faster speed than

742
00:46:28.781 --> 00:46:32.140
that.
True.
So it just has one bit of information that is maintaining

743
00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:33.540
<v 1>a deck,</v>

744
00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:38.540
but the team has to be able to observe and assess the speeds of those molecules.

745
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:44.700
And then is this one coming fast enough?
And then yes,
open the shutter.

746
00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:49.890
You see,
so it's a,
and the person who analyze this in great detail.

747
00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:53.370
In the 1920s,
Leo Silat,
uh,

748
00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:58.470
he simplified everything and had a single molecule in a box with a movable

749
00:46:59.611 --> 00:47:03.930
screen.
Uh,
it's called Zillow.
Jen,
Jen.
It's much discussed in my book.

750
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.210
And,
uh,
the,
uh,

751
00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:10.050
the demon would then ask the question is the molecule on the right or on the

752
00:47:10.051 --> 00:47:13.510
left?
And then he said the screen and extract the work.
Uh,

753
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.420
but then in order to repeat that cycle,

754
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:20.160
you would have to eliminate the inflammation from its register or accumulate it

755
00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:22.470
and then accumulates.
If the,
if it's a fine,

756
00:47:22.471 --> 00:47:26.850
I register then eventually all this we're grinds to a halt.

757
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:31.390
But I mean,
you're to say,
well,
you know,
what about this,
what about that?

758
00:47:31.391 --> 00:47:36.270
Because this is still a subject which is picked over.
So Charles Bennett,

759
00:47:36.271 --> 00:47:40.870
who in my view,
a settled issue to my satisfaction,
has his detractors and say,

760
00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:45.850
but what about if you did this?
And surprising that.
Uh,
but I think overall,

761
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:46.600
the,
the,

762
00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:51.600
the key message is that it's not the Silat thought it was the act of acquisition

763
00:47:52.601 --> 00:47:55.630
of the information that in order for the demons and know what the molecules were

764
00:47:55.631 --> 00:47:59.680
doing,
we'd have to expend energy and that energy would raise the entropy.

765
00:47:59.681 --> 00:48:02.920
And that's where the books balance wasn't at that stage.

766
00:48:02.921 --> 00:48:06.820
It's at the clearing of the register stage.
So it really is,
uh,

767
00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:11.410
this is where thermodynamics and computing really do mesh together because it's

768
00:48:11.411 --> 00:48:13.870
not the physics of sensing.

769
00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:17.590
It's the physics of computation that saves the second law.
So there's very,

770
00:48:17.591 --> 00:48:22.430
very deep connection between the world of computing and life,
uh,

771
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:26.710
which I think is sort of increasing the Elvis there.
Everybody here we see it.

772
00:48:26.711 --> 00:48:30.460
You'd have boiled down to its essential with see large engine and Bennett's

773
00:48:30.461 --> 00:48:32.980
resolution of the demon paradox.

774
00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:37.600
<v 6>Um,
maybe I will have another crack at another direction from on the topic of</v>

775
00:48:37.601 --> 00:48:42.520
consciousness.
If we can kind of unify everything,
get all the physics,

776
00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:44.110
smoke the information,

777
00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:47.800
what does it say about free will of the individual?

778
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:49.170
<v 1>Right.
Uh,
you've,</v>

779
00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:53.680
you've raised a vast subject across and I could stand here for a very long time

780
00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:57.790
talking about free.
Well,
I can't do that.
I have no choice.

781
00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:02.230
I have to go off and do another event.
Uh,

782
00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:07.030
but just very briefly and of course I do allude to it in the book.
Um,

783
00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:12.280
let me just cut to the chase and tell you my own position on free bowl.

784
00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:16.200
Freewill I think is a feeling that we have more to the point,

785
00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.400
and this comes out in the book,
um,

786
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:24.150
that freewill is closely connected to our sense that time is flowing.

787
00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:28.720
Now a physicists were telling you time count flow.
That's an illusion.

788
00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:31.660
But it's a necessary illusion for us.
They'll live our lives,

789
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:36.110
we live our lives as if time flows.
It doesn't,
it doesn't flow.
Uh,

790
00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:39.070
there are simply intervals between events and states of your brain.

791
00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:44.620
So I think that the illusion of the flow of time is because we convince

792
00:49:44.621 --> 00:49:46.510
ourselves that we have,

793
00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:50.020
I've used the word we ourselves conserved selves,

794
00:49:50.021 --> 00:49:54.340
that I'm the same self was I had when I was a child.
In other words,

795
00:49:54.341 --> 00:49:57.880
that the self stays unchanged.
The world changes around us.

796
00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:01.690
That gives us an impression of the flow of time.
Think that's back to front.

797
00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:06.220
I think the world doesn't change.
There's simply successive states,

798
00:50:06.221 --> 00:50:07.180
time isn't flowing.

799
00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:11.200
But at each successive moment you're all slightly different self from what you

800
00:50:11.201 --> 00:50:15.670
were before.
So a lot of mutual information between the yeah,
yes,
the self.

801
00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.130
But it is different.
You're a different person today.

802
00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:19.540
From what you were yesterday.

803
00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:24.220
So I think our sense of freedom has to do with getting that back to front.
Uh,

804
00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:25.480
anyway,
read the book

805
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:33.220
<v 6>on the last slide on quantum computation and quantum biology and the link,</v>

806
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:35.083
are there any

807
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:41.620
proposals for a physical system that inside biology could do useful quantum

808
00:50:42.231 --> 00:50:45.340
computation in the sense that how will accubid B Oh,

809
00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:50.090
coherence of a cubit to a bunch of cubits be maintaining temperature,

810
00:50:50.091 --> 00:50:50.924
moisture,
et cetera.

811
00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:55.200
<v 1>Okay.
So first of all,
there's the biggest subject of quantum biology.
Generally,</v>

812
00:50:55.440 --> 00:51:00.440
can biology deploy any quantum effects involving things I can tanglement and

813
00:51:00.871 --> 00:51:05.130
toweling and so on.
The answer to that is almost certainly yes.

814
00:51:05.131 --> 00:51:09.480
And I give four examples in that particular chapter in the book while having to

815
00:51:09.481 --> 00:51:14.481
do with the in photosynthesis the transfer of energy from the light harvesting

816
00:51:14.911 --> 00:51:17.880
center to the reaction Chemical Reaction Center.

817
00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:21.550
Now that has to do with bird navigation,
extraordinary thing,
um,

818
00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:25.920
or factory responsive flies.
Uh,
and you know,
some other,

819
00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:26.701
other things in there.

820
00:51:26.701 --> 00:51:31.050
The one that really strikes me because my colleagues at Asu doing experiments is

821
00:51:31.051 --> 00:51:35.970
the way that electron tunneling through organic molecules can be dramatically

822
00:51:35.971 --> 00:51:39.360
different according to the sequence,
say if it's a protein,

823
00:51:39.361 --> 00:51:40.770
the nucleotide sequence,

824
00:51:40.771 --> 00:51:44.820
a colleague of mine said a change one amino acid in a cycle on and off switch.

825
00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:50.100
So it looks like biology has fine tuned by natural selection,

826
00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:55.340
fine tune these organically functional molecules to have special quantum

827
00:51:55.621 --> 00:51:56.281
tunneling properties.

828
00:51:56.281 --> 00:52:00.210
So I think there's very little doubt that quantum mechanics is playing a role in

829
00:52:00.211 --> 00:52:01.510
biology.
Uh,

830
00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:06.560
what's not clear is whether this is just a few quirky little things that life

831
00:52:07.951 --> 00:52:09.840
has stumbled across and taken advantage of,

832
00:52:09.841 --> 00:52:14.700
or whether it's the tip of a quantum iceberg.
But your question specifically was,

833
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:19.050
uh,
can they be cubit processing?
There was a claim,
uh,

834
00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:22.590
by a Purveyor Patel from India that,
uh,

835
00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:24.600
that indeed was taking place,

836
00:52:24.601 --> 00:52:29.340
that it was actually Grover's algorithm being implemented in the genetic code.

837
00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:33.000
He's backed away from that claim in recent years.
Uh,

838
00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:36.750
so it was a sort of Nice try,
gained a lot of attention.
I agree with you.

839
00:52:36.751 --> 00:52:38.070
And that warm,
wet environment,

840
00:52:38.071 --> 00:52:42.420
it's very hard to see how decoherence wouldn't kill this stone dead,

841
00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:46.350
but that would also be true of some of the other quantum effects.
And,
uh,
again,

842
00:52:46.351 --> 00:52:49.620
there's a,
a lot of work being done to see how,
uh,

843
00:52:49.621 --> 00:52:52.500
the quantum processes could be screened,

844
00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:55.800
could screen out the environmental noise and so on.
Uh,

845
00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:00.600
and so it could be the biology has got a trick or two to teach people working in

846
00:53:00.601 --> 00:53:01.434
quantum computing.

847
00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:04.590
There are certainly some people who do work in quantum computing who are aware

848
00:53:04.591 --> 00:53:08.730
of this,
but this is all very much the cutting edge,

849
00:53:08.731 --> 00:53:10.860
I think we'll find out in the coming years.

850
00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.740
<v 6>Thank you very much for coming,
Paul.
That was thoroughly,
thoroughly enjoyable.</v>

851
00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.410
Yeah.
Thank you very much.
Paul Davies.

852
00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:22.820
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
