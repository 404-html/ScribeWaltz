1
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:05.991
Um,
I'm really,

2
00:00:05.991 --> 00:00:10.490
really pleased to be welcoming a professor of Brent Benjamin Bergen here as part

3
00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:14.000
of a toxic Google.
So without further ado,
uh,
I'll,

4
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.430
I'm happy to hand it over to Ben.
So thank you Nancy

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.540
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

6
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.980
<v 1>So,
uh,
I'm really thrilled to be back in the homeland.</v>

7
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.780
Um,
and to,
to talk to you about the topic of my latest book.
Now,

8
00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:36.130
as Nancy said,
there will be strong language,

9
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.250
uh,
empirically strong language.

10
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.460
There will be objectively the worst words of the language on the next slide.

11
00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:48.320
So this is a great time.
If you feel like you might be uncomfortable with that,

12
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.630
that sort of thing,
uh,
to conveniently need to slip out and go get some coffee.

13
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.730
Um,
okay,

14
00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.120
so human language serves a variety of communicative functions.

15
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.490
The function that we usually think about is conveying information through time

16
00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:09.640
and space,
facts,
descriptions of things.

17
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.770
And that's certainly a thing that language does,

18
00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:12.940
but it does something else as well.

19
00:01:12.941 --> 00:01:17.941
And that's to convey emotion in the hot cognition of immediate feelings.

20
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.980
We need some way to communicate with conspecifics that were angry.

21
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.980
Right now we're frustrated or frightened and this is where profanity thrives.

22
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.280
So what I've tried to do in this book is to take an empirical cognitive science

23
00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:40.330
based approach to what profanity is,
how it works,

24
00:01:40.331 --> 00:01:42.880
how it comes to be,
that way,
how it changes over time,

25
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.750
and importantly what it reveals about our brains,

26
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.000
our social lives and ourselves.

27
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.450
So what I wanted to do today was to give you a brief tour of some of the things

28
00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:59.200
that we learn about profanity and about ourselves,

29
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.300
our brains,
by taking this leap of faith.
And to begin with,

30
00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:09.301
I want to start empirically by asking what precisely profanity is,

31
00:02:09.341 --> 00:02:12.850
where it comes from.
What words do we mean by profanity?

32
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.040
Why are those words profane?
Uh,
and if you were to ask regulatory agencies,

33
00:02:18.041 --> 00:02:19.780
like the FCC for example,

34
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.200
they wouldn't give you a list because they haven't done the leg work.

35
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.220
They don't actually know empirically what people think is offensive language.

36
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.820
But fortunately we do have some evidence from large scale psycholinguistic

37
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.360
studies,
um,
that,
uh,

38
00:02:34.361 --> 00:02:39.361
that tell us broadly what the types of words are that people find profane.

39
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.930
And more specifically exactly which one's a particular group of people find

40
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.470
offensive at a particular time and place.
So let's start locally.

41
00:02:47.471 --> 00:02:52.120
Let's start in California with people in their say twenties.
Um,

42
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.780
what are the worst words of American English according to these people?

43
00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.340
So here's a study from about 10 years ago at Ucla that asked a undergrads,

44
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.440
uh,
who would now be in their mid twenties.
Uh,
what are the,
what,

45
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.770
how would you rate a list of words in terms of their offensiveness one word at a

46
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:12.740
time.
And here are without further ado,
uh,

47
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.290
the words that are worst in English according to these,
uh,

48
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.120
these respondents from worst to least bad.

49
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.113
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

50
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.900
<v 1>So,
uh,
some,</v>

51
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.260
some things to note for contemporary speakers of,

52
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.610
of American English,
including especially younger ones.

53
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.410
The worst words in the language are predominantly not the words that George

54
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.830
Carlin would have told you 50 years ago are the ones you can't say on
television.

55
00:03:43.831 --> 00:03:46.560
They're a new class of words,
slurs,
in fact,

56
00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:51.420
words that Darryl Gate by insulting a particular social group.

57
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.460
Uh,
but because of their ethnicity or religion,
sex,
sexual orientation,
and so on.

58
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.600
And in fact,
you find that,
uh,

59
00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:03.240
a four letter word that starts withF is actually 13th on the list.

60
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.730
Uh,
we can go down the list a,

61
00:04:05.731 --> 00:04:10.731
if you want and find a whole bunch more offensive words until we get down to a

62
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:15.780
famous four letter word that starts with s h that doesn't appear to be that

63
00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:19.980
offensive at all compared to the rest of the words in the language.
Now,
when we,

64
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.140
when we compare,
uh,

65
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.410
language taboos across the world's languages,

66
00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:30.411
what we discover is that the types of words that feed into this list are

67
00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:35.541
actually quite representative of the world's languages across the globe.

68
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.530
There are four categories of words that seem to be most reliable in providing

69
00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:43.600
the taboo vocabulary of the language,
um,

70
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.370
that his words relating to,
uh,
religious concepts,

71
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.940
words relating to sex and sexual activities,

72
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.490
words relating to other bodily functions,

73
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.590
the organs that are responsible for those functions,
the actions,
uh,

74
00:04:58.591 --> 00:05:02.280
involved in those functions,
uh,
the upkeep of those bodily functions and so on.

75
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.610
Um,
and then finally,
uh,
finally slurs.

76
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.170
And those are the kind of the big four categories that contribute profane

77
00:05:10.171 --> 00:05:11.004
vocabulary.

78
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.780
And if you were to categorize the list of most defensive words in English by

79
00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:18.810
which of these four categories they most properly belong to.
Of course,

80
00:05:18.811 --> 00:05:23.610
there's a little bit of a wiggle room here you would find,
um,
that,

81
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.390
uh,

82
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.390
in English it is indeed the slurs that on average and in specific cases are

83
00:05:29.971 --> 00:05:32.520
judged to be the most profane words of the language.

84
00:05:32.521 --> 00:05:36.780
The most offensive words of the language copulation is also,
uh,
near,

85
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.630
uh,
second,
uh,
second best.

86
00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:44.631
And religion doesn't really provide much profane vocabulary to contemporary

87
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:47.550
American English at all across the world.

88
00:05:47.551 --> 00:05:50.760
Different languages we'll sample differently from each of these columns.

89
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.160
So if you look at Italian,
for example,

90
00:05:53.161 --> 00:05:58.110
the strongest words in Italian known as best mea are,

91
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.650
uh,
basically the formula is this.

92
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:05.330
You take the word pig and you add it to a religious term and that gives you a

93
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:10.220
really,
really offensive term.
So protocol,
Madonna or protocol deal really,

94
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:12.700
really offensive.
Sorry,
Italians.
Um,

95
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.400
in Quebecois French spoken north of the border,

96
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.170
the worst words are these words called Saca,

97
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.810
which are a Catholic liturgical terms like,
um,
uh,

98
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.860
like Taobao hammock or tabernacle or Kelly's,
which is chalice.

99
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.850
And these words are far more offensive than any of the words that we have a on

100
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:34.070
this list for speakers of chemical off French.

101
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:38.300
So around the world languages we'll sample differently from these,

102
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.580
from these groups to find their most defensive terminology.
UH,

103
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.130
Russian has recently experienced a big regulatory change.

104
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.680
Uh,
Putin's government,
uh,
has outlawed,
uh,

105
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.590
us a set of words known as much,

106
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.570
which are pretty much all drawn from sexual vocabulary and those can now no

107
00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:59.980
longer be used in the arts or media in general.
Um,

108
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.950
so there are differences across the world's languages.
Now you may,

109
00:07:03.951 --> 00:07:06.680
you may be looking at these words and saying,
well,
okay,

110
00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:08.390
this is where the words come from,

111
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.230
but there's a lot that can't be sufficient,
right?

112
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.710
There's lots of words that relate to population or to bodily functions that are

113
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:17.510
not obscene.
Right?

114
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:21.770
Words that you would describe when talking with a child in the kindergarten or

115
00:07:21.771 --> 00:07:26.300
when talking,
talking to your doctor for example,
or when labeling these,

116
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.160
uh,
these columns copulation for example,
is not a,
it's not a profane word.

117
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.830
So there must be something else about the words that makes them offensive to

118
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:37.460
people.

119
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.810
And the first thing that people oftentimes come up with is the length of the

120
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:44.540
word.
Something about how the word sounds or how it's spelled.

121
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.870
We have this idea in,
uh,

122
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.740
in English that there's something special about four letter words,
right?

123
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.820
And in fact,

124
00:07:52.821 --> 00:07:56.210
if you look empirically at the distribution of four letter words among profane

125
00:07:56.211 --> 00:07:59.960
words compared to what you'd expect on the basis of the distribution in the

126
00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:01.100
language in general,

127
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.280
you do find that there are far more profane four letter words then you would

128
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:07.250
expect by chance.

129
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:10.940
And that's true even if you normalize for the frequency of profane words,

130
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.340
but you find something else as well.

131
00:08:13.341 --> 00:08:15.590
It's not just four letter words that are more frequent.

132
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.250
It's also three letter words and five letter words and eight letter words.

133
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.310
And all those differences turned out to be significant.
So,

134
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.220
so what's special about three,
four,

135
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.240
five and hate letter words?
Well,
it has something to do.

136
00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:31.400
If you go back and look at these words,
you can actually,

137
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.260
you can actually start to see the pattern.

138
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:39.070
The AA letter words are made up of two fourish letter words and why,

139
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.030
why,
and the four and five and three letter words oftentimes sound pretty similar

140
00:08:44.031 --> 00:08:47.030
that they may be spelled with five letters.

141
00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:49.610
But that doesn't mean that they have five distinct sounds.
In fact,

142
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.330
this is an artifact of English orthography being terrible.

143
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.140
So English spelling doesn't look at all like it how it sounds.

144
00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:02.370
It's unlike a rational languages like Spanish for example,

145
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:07.110
or Indonesian that actually do have a one character per sound,

146
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.610
uh,
uh,
dictate well in English,
not so much.
And so in fact,

147
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.440
what's going on with these three and four and five letter words is that English

148
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.860
profane words tend to follow a particular sound pattern.

149
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.240
And that sound pattern is this English syllables come in two varieties.

150
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.080
They're the ones that have continents at the end.

151
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.390
And the ones that have no consonants at the end.

152
00:09:30.391 --> 00:09:33.120
And that makes a big difference for lots of stuff that linguists care about.

153
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.620
The thing that you should care about with respect to this distinction is that

154
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:42.650
English profane words are far more likely to end with consonants at the end.

155
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.770
They fall into this category over here,

156
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.550
then they are to have no spoken consonants at the end.

157
00:09:50.551 --> 00:09:55.551
And you can come up with maybe five words in English that are arguably profane,

158
00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.330
that show up on these lists across languages that people find to be offensive.

159
00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:05.310
Um,
and they're really mostly not that bad,
right?

160
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.110
So,
uh,
who is not the strongest word in the English language,

161
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.500
nor is PE screw jus shows up on some lists.

162
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.050
I think it's the use of Jew as a verb.

163
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.290
So to Jew someone or did you someone down that it's a,

164
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:21.660
that is judged to be offensive.
Um,
so,

165
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:26.670
so there's not a lot of profane vocabulary in English that that ends with no

166
00:10:26.671 --> 00:10:29.610
consonants.
There's almost,
all of it ends with continents.

167
00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:33.690
And this differs from the language in general,
which is far more evenly balanced.

168
00:10:33.691 --> 00:10:37.590
When you look at nouns or verbs or frequent words,
infrequent words in general,

169
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.420
uh,
this is a very strange distribution for the sounds of words.
And so,

170
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.320
so you look at this,
this distribution and the,

171
00:10:45.321 --> 00:10:50.321
and this might start to explain the part of why certain words are judged to be

172
00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:51.660
more offensive than others,

173
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:55.760
even though they might come from the same meaning source.
Um,

174
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.220
but isn't this just a pattern in the lexicon?

175
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:02.970
Is this just a distributional fact or is this something that's actually active

176
00:11:02.971 --> 00:11:04.590
in the minds of English speakers?

177
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.160
Is this something that you bring to bear when you're exposed to a word?

178
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.710
Do you have this pattern in mind?

179
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.430
Does this template applied to a new word that you're exposed to?
Well,

180
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.530
in order to ask this question,
what we did was we,
uh,
we invented some new words.

181
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.730
We invented words that didn't actually exist in English,

182
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.180
but that were equally likely to,
uh,

183
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:31.470
to exist in English that had sequences of sounds or sequences of letters that

184
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.940
are coherent with how English works.
But just don't happen to exist.
So,
uh,

185
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.200
that we,
we gave,

186
00:11:37.201 --> 00:11:42.201
we made up words like river and delivered and Sti and steet.

187
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.980
And we ask people to make various judgments about these words.
Uh,

188
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.670
how much does it sound like a word?
And also,
by the way,

189
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.790
how likely do you think this word is to be profane?
And,
uh,

190
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.800
this is what they said.
Uh,

191
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:02.500
so we had some words that started with just one consonant at the beginning.

192
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.281
Those are these,

193
00:12:03.281 --> 00:12:06.070
and then some that started with s plus a consonant cause that's a nice way to

194
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:08.530
build more constant contents into the beginnings of words.

195
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.210
And so you see two statistically significant effects here.
Two main effects.

196
00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:17.410
The first is that if you have two consonants at the beginning,

197
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.590
you're going to be judged more profane.
That has higher bars.

198
00:12:20.591 --> 00:12:22.390
Then if you have only one consonant at the beginning,

199
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.220
these two bars are higher than these two bars.

200
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.480
And then the second effect is that the dark bars are higher than the gray bars.

201
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:32.410
And that's,
uh,
showing that if you have a consonant at the end,

202
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.370
you're judged to be more profound than if you have no consonant spoken consonant

203
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.730
at the end.
And that's true.
Uh,
those,

204
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.410
those two effects are independent of one another.

205
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.910
So it appears to be that people have this template in their minds.

206
00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:50.410
There's expectation that that profane words are going to sound a particular way.

207
00:12:50.411 --> 00:12:53.020
And when exposed to a brand new word,
they bring that to bear.

208
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:58.170
Now this is not particularly surprising if you've ever watched people invent new

209
00:12:58.271 --> 00:13:01.600
words.
So consider the case of fiction.

210
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.810
So when you have a fictitious language,

211
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.900
say cling on or Dothraki and you have to come up with what is the profane

212
00:13:10.631 --> 00:13:15.631
inventory going to be like without exception English speakers make up words that

213
00:13:15.701 --> 00:13:19.930
follow this heavy consonants at the end pattern.

214
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.280
Moreover,
when people invent new profane words,

215
00:13:24.281 --> 00:13:25.660
and this is happening all the time,

216
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.690
those words overwhelmingly followed this same pattern.

217
00:13:28.691 --> 00:13:33.691
So I have the privilege of teaching at Uc San Diego where I'm able to consult on

218
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:37.960
a near daily basis with undergraduate students who are aged 18 to 22.

219
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.170
And they know all kinds of things about language and how it's changing that I do

220
00:13:41.171 --> 00:13:44.800
not know.
And uh,
they bring in a new words.
I,

221
00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:47.200
one of the things that I ask them is to surprise me.

222
00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:49.660
Tell me something that I don't know about,
uh,

223
00:13:49.661 --> 00:13:52.690
about how people are using language in your community.

224
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.250
And what you find is that there's a whole host of new group,
new profane words,

225
00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.070
uh,
with every new crop of students.

226
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.940
So you might not have heard the word spurg before.

227
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.020
This is a term of abuse for people with Asperger Syndrome.
Um,

228
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:13.000
you might have heard the word tarred before.
This is an abbreviation for retard.

229
00:14:13.001 --> 00:14:14.830
This is judged by young,

230
00:14:14.831 --> 00:14:17.560
young adults to be one of the most offensive words in the language,

231
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.730
more offensive than the f word.
Um,
uh,

232
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.780
the word milk of the word guilt,
which is a new one that I hadn't heard before.

233
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.930
Um,
so there's a variety of new words,

234
00:14:28.931 --> 00:14:31.600
which not surprisingly,

235
00:14:31.601 --> 00:14:33.970
if people have this pattern in their minds,

236
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.520
follow this heavy consonants at the end syllable pat.

237
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.220
Now why do English profanities tend to sound like this?
Well,

238
00:14:42.221 --> 00:14:44.410
there are a couple of possible explanations.

239
00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:47.650
It could be that at some point in the previous history of the language,

240
00:14:47.651 --> 00:14:51.830
it just happened to be the case that a bunch of profane words sounded like that.

241
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.990
And then over the course of history,

242
00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:58.280
people as they invented new words tended to invent words that sounded like the

243
00:14:58.281 --> 00:15:01.670
ones that they already knew that were profane.
They sort of snowball.

244
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.660
Do you have this accretion by the rich getting richer sort of process?

245
00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:09.400
That's certainly possible.
But it's also possible that there's some,

246
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.970
a reason to the rhyme,
if you will,
that,
um,

247
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.660
that that's a linguist joke by the way.
Um,
that,
um,
that,
that there's,

248
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:22.460
that there's a specific,
there's a specific reason why this particular pattern.

249
00:15:22.461 --> 00:15:25.250
Now when children start to acquire a language,

250
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:30.060
the early sounds that they're able to produce are,
uh,

251
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.110
in conformance in conformity with certain patterns.

252
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:37.790
One thing that's very hard for them to do is to produce a bunch of consonants,

253
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.770
especially at the end of a syllable.

254
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.210
Childlike language tends to reduce syllables to just a consonant and vowel and

255
00:15:44.211 --> 00:15:46.760
often repeats,
if anything.
Um,
so,

256
00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:51.290
so it's possible that these words are tailored to be the type of thing that

257
00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:55.400
sounds least childlike,
not because then children can't produce it,

258
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.490
but just for the sort of the mouth feel of the word,

259
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:02.620
it feels unlike the type of thing that a child would be likely to say.

260
00:16:02.621 --> 00:16:06.140
And it also sounds unlikely to be something that a child would say.

261
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:11.570
A final possibility is that it might have something to do with the youth that

262
00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:12.830
you put these words too.

263
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.210
And I first started thinking about this when I saw interviews with people with

264
00:16:17.211 --> 00:16:20.810
Tourette's syndrome.
Now you may or may not be familiar with Tourette's syndrome.

265
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:25.580
It's an inhibitory control disorder where,
uh,
that's a developmental disorder.

266
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.670
People have trouble controlling ticks,

267
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.610
which are movements usually of the head and neck,

268
00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:34.890
sometimes the upper torso about 10% of the time.
Uh,

269
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.630
they also have a particular symptom known as Copra Lelea,

270
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.410
which is the uncontrollable production of taboo words.

271
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:47.710
And it so happens that when you ask people how they control this copra Lelea

272
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.930
they often report that what they do is they,

273
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.140
they can't control the beginning of the word.

274
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.600
So one person I saw interviewed for example,

275
00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.280
said that his tick was the word cock.
So he couldn't not say that word.

276
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.420
He would be at work,
he would be in public,
you'd be at a,

277
00:17:03.421 --> 00:17:07.340
at a ball game with his kids.
And he just couldn't not say that word,

278
00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.340
but he could change the end of the word.

279
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:14.120
He could just close his mouth.
So cop.

280
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.240
And so his solution was to say cop,
cop,
cop,
cop,
cop.

281
00:17:17.241 --> 00:17:21.740
And he described the effect as being that people thought that he was a little

282
00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:22.251
bit strange,

283
00:17:22.251 --> 00:17:25.760
but certainly it didn't have the consequence of him not being able to go out in

284
00:17:25.761 --> 00:17:27.680
public anymore.
And,

285
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:32.480
and so it occurs to me that one of the things that having a bunch of continents

286
00:17:32.481 --> 00:17:35.060
at the end does is it stops the word.

287
00:17:35.061 --> 00:17:39.530
So if what you want to do with profanity is to express a strong emotion and then

288
00:17:39.531 --> 00:17:44.300
be able to quickly curtail the audible illness of that expression,

289
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.270
then maybe it would be useful to have something at the end that's not a vowel

290
00:17:47.271 --> 00:17:51.330
but a consonant.
And there's a little bit of corroborating evidence for this.

291
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.590
The continents that you can stick at the end of a word are not all equal in

292
00:17:55.591 --> 00:17:57.060
their ability to stop sound.

293
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:02.340
There are some called stop consonants like Po and to and cut that really do just

294
00:18:02.341 --> 00:18:04.110
stop the sound coming out of your mouth.

295
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.760
And if those are the ones that are most likely to occur at the ends of profane

296
00:18:08.761 --> 00:18:13.410
words,
then this is consistent with that explanation.
And in fact,
if you count,
uh,

297
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:17.850
all English monosyllabic words and you look at the,
the ending continents,

298
00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:21.900
there are about as many stop consonants like Pataka as there are on stop

299
00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:23.640
consonants.
That's in the language in general.

300
00:18:23.641 --> 00:18:27.510
But if you look just at profane English monosyllabic words that are far more

301
00:18:27.511 --> 00:18:29.550
stops than nonstop consequence.

302
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.430
So that's a thing anyway.
Um,
as you look across languages,

303
00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:40.630
you find that this sound pattern doesn't necessarily hold up.

304
00:18:40.631 --> 00:18:42.010
So there are languages,
for example,

305
00:18:42.011 --> 00:18:46.150
that just don't allow continents at the ends of syllables.
Uh,

306
00:18:46.151 --> 00:18:49.360
so Japanese mostly doesn't allow consonants at the ends of syllables except for,

307
00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:50.733
but no others.

308
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.980
A Hawaiian mostly doesn't like consonants at the ends of syllables.

309
00:18:53.981 --> 00:18:57.820
So in those languages you just couldn't have it.
If you turn a well,
we're,

310
00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:00.730
I'm in San Diego,
so if you turn a south,
uh,

311
00:19:00.731 --> 00:19:05.350
you find that Spanish doesn't really have this pattern either.
Most,
uh,

312
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.620
most words in Spanish that are nouns or verbs,
adjectives,

313
00:19:08.621 --> 00:19:11.470
adverbs are a multi syllable words.

314
00:19:11.471 --> 00:19:14.350
So you don't really get one syllable pro profanity in Spanish.

315
00:19:14.351 --> 00:19:17.050
So there are certainly differences across the world,
languages,

316
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.420
so more to be explored here,
but,

317
00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.360
but you certainly see that across the world's languages.
Uh,

318
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:27.550
there is a tendency to have something like profanity drawn from one of these

319
00:19:27.551 --> 00:19:30.640
four categories,
uh,
having certain sound patterns,

320
00:19:30.641 --> 00:19:32.830
although maybe not these specific sound patterns.

321
00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:37.090
And there are few exceptions to the fact of having profanity,

322
00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.770
but there are exceptions.

323
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:42.250
So in some languages or in some cultures I should say,

324
00:19:42.251 --> 00:19:43.690
there's not even a setting.

325
00:19:43.691 --> 00:19:47.650
There's not even a pervasive cultural belief that there's a set of words that we

326
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.490
all agree are the bad words that we shouldn't say in public.

327
00:19:51.491 --> 00:19:52.750
We shouldn't say around kids.

328
00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:56.200
We shouldn't allow kids to say that needed to be bleeped that people should be

329
00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:59.510
punished for.
So for example,
it's long been reported that,
uh,

330
00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:00.670
this is the case in Japan.

331
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
So there isn't this sort of social setting that there is a set of words that we

332
00:20:07.241 --> 00:20:11.350
need to,
uh,
we need to make sure that kids are protected from.

333
00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:16.780
So there are lots of ways to insult people in Japanese.
Uh,

334
00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.910
there are lots of ways to offend people in Japanese.

335
00:20:18.911 --> 00:20:23.110
You can insult people's ancestors and liken them to animals that really

336
00:20:23.111 --> 00:20:26.620
offensive thing to do.
You can call people ignorant.

337
00:20:26.621 --> 00:20:30.250
You can use the wrong honorific forums.
Uh,
you know,
uh,

338
00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.170
those little endings on the ends of,
you know,

339
00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.320
verbs and nouns that make it seem like you're talking to someone of low status

340
00:20:35.321 --> 00:20:37.200
rather than high status.
Um,

341
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:41.680
but specific words that are bad words,
not so much.

342
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:45.190
If you want to say that someone's,
if you want to insult someone,
you might,

343
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.750
you use the word [inaudible],
um,
to,

344
00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.060
to talk about genitalia you might use changing.
Uh,
some people say that.
So,

345
00:20:52.061 --> 00:20:54.290
which literally means excrement,
uh,

346
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.190
is the closest thing that there is to profanity in Japanese.

347
00:20:57.191 --> 00:21:00.430
But you see it in hello kitty videos.
I mean,
it's not,
uh,
it's,

348
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.630
it's clearly not clearly doesn't rise to the level of even even shit,

349
00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:09.370
which as we saw it doesn't,
it doesn't break the top 30.
Um,
so,

350
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.700
so,
uh,
across the world languages,

351
00:21:12.701 --> 00:21:17.680
the idea of profanity is actually built off of something a little bit more than

352
00:21:17.681 --> 00:21:22.600
just just having words belonging to certain tests,
certain domains of experience,

353
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.800
and more than just having words that sound powerful,
there's something else.

354
00:21:26.801 --> 00:21:27.970
There's a cultural setting.

355
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:32.380
And what we find when we look within a culture across time is that you get the

356
00:21:32.381 --> 00:21:36.580
exact same effect that over the course of the history of a language,

357
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.820
a particular word may enter into being profane.

358
00:21:39.821 --> 00:21:44.320
And then decades or centuries later may no longer be profane.

359
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.520
So it just so happens that,
uh,
if you know someone named Dick,

360
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:53.440
he's probably 65 years old or older.
And the reason I know that is that I went,

361
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:57.700
uh,
and I dug into the social security administration naming database,
um,

362
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.880
which has records of every live birth,
um,

363
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:05.020
recorded in the United States.
And as it turns out,

364
00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:09.850
there was a long period of us history in which children were being given the

365
00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.510
given name.
Dick,
not Richard,
these weren't Richards who are nicknamed Dick.

366
00:22:13.511 --> 00:22:16.570
They were actually named Dick and said Dick on their birth certificate.

367
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.340
So what I did was I just counted over on a year by year basis how many dicks

368
00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:25.990
there were and how many risks there were.
Uh,
and uh,
here,

369
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:29.110
here's the data and sort of speaks for itself.

370
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:35.410
There was a time when there were lots of dicks and then,

371
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:40.480
um,
by 1965,
uh,
there were no more decks.

372
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:45.160
There were risks and there were Richards,
but,
but no more,
no more Dixon.

373
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:50.160
I actually have a relative named Richard who was born,

374
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:54.790
uh,
right around here,
uh,
who went by Dick until the mid 1990s.

375
00:22:54.791 --> 00:22:57.760
And then we got an email saying,
by the way,
I'm now going by Rick.

376
00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:01.870
And this is a totally rational thing to do for obvious reasons.

377
00:23:01.871 --> 00:23:05.560
This is a word that had accumulated enough,
uh,

378
00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:09.280
enough impact in its secondary,
meaning it's new acquired meaning,

379
00:23:09.281 --> 00:23:13.720
which interestingly seems to have arisen indirectly from a meaning relating to

380
00:23:13.721 --> 00:23:17.620
so.
So Dick First came to me the a riding crop,

381
00:23:17.621 --> 00:23:19.270
like the handle of a riding crop.

382
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.300
You can see how it then would be metaphorically extended to a body parts,
um,

383
00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.020
that was maybe shaped similarly.
Um,
but,
uh,

384
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:31.170
but that change took decades to take effect to the point where people started to

385
00:23:32.201 --> 00:23:35.530
decide that other meaning is just too invasive,

386
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:37.780
is just too problematic.

387
00:23:37.781 --> 00:23:40.780
When I introduced myself and we see this not just with Dick,

388
00:23:40.781 --> 00:23:45.290
but you can plot the same history with,
uh,
closely related word cock,

389
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.610
which used to only refer to,
um,
uh,
to the rooster,

390
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:54.670
uh,
before the word rooster existed,
then gained a secondary,
meaning.

391
00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.510
It gained a meaning relating to well,

392
00:23:56.511 --> 00:24:00.650
they actually have the same thing that Dick did.
And uh,
at that point,

393
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.870
after some centuries of discomfort,

394
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.580
puritanical Americans and the 18th century decided this was not a stable state

395
00:24:07.581 --> 00:24:12.581
of affairs and they really needed another way to describe to call the male of

396
00:24:12.921 --> 00:24:17.570
the chicken.
And they invented a word based on the place that that animal sleeps.

397
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.920
Its sleeps in a roost.
So it is a rooster.
And,
uh,

398
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.490
and that word gained,
uh,
gained,
uh,

399
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.770
a familiarity and use in the United States,

400
00:24:27.771 --> 00:24:30.800
although it hasn't caught on in other places in the world.
So you still have,

401
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:31.521
for example,

402
00:24:31.521 --> 00:24:34.940
Great Britain where a rooster is sort of a funny American word that they know

403
00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:38.360
about it.
Kind of like how,
um,
you know,
like Laurie is for us,
he was like,

404
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:42.650
whatever,
you guys were ridiculous.
Um,
this is kind of kind of the same thing.

405
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:46.820
So what we see across words when we look at profane vocabulary is that they,

406
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.880
they follow this pattern that at first,
they're not profane at all,

407
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:54.110
refer to animals or to people that they gain profane meanings,

408
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:58.100
that those profane meanings squeeze out the old meanings.

409
00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:03.500
Create an externality of having to invent new words to cover the semantic ground

410
00:25:03.501 --> 00:25:05.960
that is now no longer covered by,
uh,

411
00:25:05.961 --> 00:25:08.240
by the word that's not being used in its original way.

412
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:11.450
And then eventually these words die out.

413
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:16.370
So many of the most profane words from English are no longer used.

414
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:20.240
So if I were to tell you that in Shakespeare's time that the equivalent of the f

415
00:25:20.241 --> 00:25:22.120
word was [inaudible],

416
00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.310
you would only know that if you were a Shakespearean scholar.

417
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:30.410
It comes from an old root,
meaning something like to turn or screw.

418
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:35.570
We have other words that have followed a similar semantic pattern.
Um,
but,
uh,

419
00:25:35.571 --> 00:25:40.550
but it's completely fallen out of use.
So has tarnation and so has gad,

420
00:25:40.551 --> 00:25:42.470
Zeus and downs.

421
00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:47.200
These are all words that at some point were extremely vulgar.
Uh,

422
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.070
Gad Zoucks comes from God's eyes and it falls into this,
uh,

423
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:53.750
religious terminology,
but no longer is used at all.

424
00:25:53.751 --> 00:25:56.990
And so this is the general pattern that we observe.
If we're,

425
00:25:56.991 --> 00:25:58.460
if we're to project forward,

426
00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:02.390
we can reasonably assume that the very set of words that are now judged to be

427
00:26:02.391 --> 00:26:06.830
the most offensive ones in the English language within a century certainly will

428
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.600
no longer have the impact that they have.

429
00:26:08.601 --> 00:26:11.240
And it would be surprising if the f word,
for example,

430
00:26:11.241 --> 00:26:14.450
we're still still censored on broadcast television in 20 years.

431
00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.830
But at the point at which there's some ambiguity,

432
00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.070
there's ample opportunity for double entendre.

433
00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.310
And so just because this is a real thing that actually happened,

434
00:26:25.311 --> 00:26:28.760
I wanted to show this.
So right around here in the 1960s,

435
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.720
there was a very famous person whose name was Richard and uh,

436
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:37.580
and his proponents played on this double meaning to create this actual real,

437
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.250
uh,
political messaging.

438
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.710
It's the type of thing that you could get away with in 1955.

439
00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:53.370
We're 1965 because there was still,

440
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:57.210
because his name was Dick,
right?
Maybe not.

441
00:26:57.211 --> 00:27:01.190
The thing that you could get away with in 2016 or maybe actually you could have,

442
00:27:01.191 --> 00:27:03.380
well I guess we'll find out in about three weeks.
Um,

443
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.520
okay,
so,
so what makes profanity?
Well,
there's,

444
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.880
there's a whole bunch of that that goes into making prevented the first you have

445
00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:15.360
to have a cultural belief that some words are bad and they,

446
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.530
and you don't have to have that.

447
00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:20.940
You could be Japanese and not have that cultural belief.
Second,

448
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:23.310
you have to apply that belief to specific words,

449
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.580
which are most likely to be drawn from certain categories of meaning and they

450
00:27:26.581 --> 00:27:28.170
make may pattern together and sound.

451
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:33.530
And then in order for that belief system to be inserted into people's brains,

452
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.950
there has to be some system for reinforcing it.

453
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:42.750
So there has to be some system of punishment.
Censorship.
Ironically,

454
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:46.920
the punishment,
the soap in the mouth,
the bleeping on the,
on television,

455
00:27:46.921 --> 00:27:51.921
that is exactly what makes those specific words have the taboos that they have.

456
00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:56.760
It is the thing that recreates that belief system for each new generation of

457
00:27:56.761 --> 00:27:58.080
speakers of the language.

458
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:04.260
Now I wanted to talk to you not just about what profanity is and sort of some of

459
00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:06.150
the science of like what we know about it,

460
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:10.740
but also what it uniquely reveals about our brains.

461
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.660
And so that's what I wanted to turn to next.

462
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:17.990
There are certain facts about how profanity is used that differ from the rest of

463
00:28:19.021 --> 00:28:21.450
language.
Profanity is emotional.

464
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:25.860
It evokes emotions and other people.
It is inhibited.

465
00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.720
It is the type of thing that you know,

466
00:28:27.721 --> 00:28:31.380
that you're not supposed to say in certain circumstances.
And as a consequence,

467
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.620
it uses different brain systems from the rest of language.

468
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:39.390
And I'm going to show you now two kinds of things that we learn about how our

469
00:28:39.391 --> 00:28:43.020
brains compute language on the basis of this.

470
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.200
A set of facts to the first has to do with speech.

471
00:28:46.201 --> 00:28:50.910
Every speech is peppered with errors.
I've tried to not produce many now,

472
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:55.740
but in fact,
people produce roughly and error every thousand words.
It's a lot.
Um,

473
00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:59.000
in particular it's been believed for a long time,
uh,

474
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.440
that the speech errors may reflect,
uh,

475
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.980
thoughts that people have that they are not consciously or did Eric consciously

476
00:29:04.981 --> 00:29:07.620
trying to suppress.
And if this is true,

477
00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.410
then we might expect to find that.

478
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:15.000
Repress thoughts produce more taboo errors,

479
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.390
then non taboo errors,
all things being equal.

480
00:29:18.391 --> 00:29:23.391
And certainly we tend to notice when people make speech errors that are vulgar,

481
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:26.970
right?
So here are two examples.

482
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.750
This is if you watch the news enough live news,
you'll get this,
um,

483
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.600
examples like this.
I hope that the audio works here

484
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:34.171
<v 3>soon.</v>

485
00:29:34.171 --> 00:29:38.430
67 Nasser going to share with your partner in me in the mood for a little rooms

486
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:43.720
and we've been sued in the Hannukah Hall Haig Long Food Truck Food truck.

487
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:52.350
That's what I meant to say is old I five lunch truck is here for that.

488
00:29:55.420 --> 00:30:00.340
<v 1>Okay.
Food truck that says,
okay,</v>

489
00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:02.520
here's another example.
I mean you could find that

490
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:06.210
<v 4>it's a sausage competition that I judge.
Oh,</v>

491
00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:08.880
like sausage eating.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

492
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:14.090
Kayla Cuevas and local sausage makers,

493
00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:18.410
they all make their best and they enter it.
I bet.
If delicious.

494
00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.980
It is February 9th,
7:00 PM adds up.

495
00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:25.100
Prairieland Park tickets are only $25.
It's for charity.

496
00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.940
And uh,
you can get,
uh,

497
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:31.100
tickets online ad pick dick pic.
Oh,

498
00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.690
well you're thinking about thoughts

499
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:41.940
about sausage.
Thank goodness that was ridiculous.

500
00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.820
We were not drinking wine today.
No,
we were now looking really good event.

501
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:49.460
It is kicking a Cabasa.
So go to pick a dick.

502
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:53.673
Okay,

503
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:58.030
<v 1>so,
so these are,
these are the ones you feel sorry for her.
Right?</v>

504
00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:02.560
And she probably enjoyed the wine.
But these are,
these are,
these are the,

505
00:31:02.561 --> 00:31:07.450
these are the errors that we notice,
of course,
because if she said,
uh,
uh,

506
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:11.290
pick a kick,
it would,
no one would care.
Right?
It wouldn't make a difference.

507
00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:16.060
It doesn't violate a social expectation about behavior,
for example,

508
00:31:16.061 --> 00:31:19.840
on broadcast television.
But when you actually look,
when you,

509
00:31:19.841 --> 00:31:22.150
when you do the controlled experiment,
I won't give you the details,

510
00:31:22.151 --> 00:31:26.200
but when you create conditions for people to produce errors that are either

511
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.190
taboo errors or like those or neutral errors that don't produce any taboo

512
00:31:30.191 --> 00:31:31.630
language at all,
what you find,

513
00:31:31.631 --> 00:31:34.360
there've been a variety of studies are showing you the,
the the first two,

514
00:31:34.361 --> 00:31:38.610
but data hold up for and have held up for nearly 40 years.
Um,

515
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.800
you find that people are far more likely,
they make,
uh,

516
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:46.360
many times more depending on the study to make many times more neutral errors

517
00:31:46.361 --> 00:31:47.260
than taboo errors.

518
00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:52.650
And that's actually revealing because why would you be able to avoid making

519
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:57.430
errors when the error would be taboo?
Well,

520
00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:02.580
the interpretation and the thing that we've learned about language and the brain

521
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.150
from looking at this,

522
00:32:04.151 --> 00:32:09.151
these taboo areas specifically is that in the cases when it would make them win,

523
00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.860
there would be the most damage to making an error because it would be a taboo

524
00:32:14.861 --> 00:32:19.390
word coming out.
Those are the conditions under which you avoid making errors,

525
00:32:19.391 --> 00:32:23.860
which implicates a,
an internal self monitoring system.

526
00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.310
And there's a whole bunch of research that's grown up around this idea that

527
00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:30.340
perhaps when you're planning to produce speech,

528
00:32:30.341 --> 00:32:33.610
when you're activating those words in some grammatical organisation and you're

529
00:32:33.611 --> 00:32:37.810
going to speak them,
that you do a little sanity check,

530
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:42.290
you run an internal simulation and internal model of what it's going to be like

531
00:32:42.291 --> 00:32:43.370
to say those words.

532
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:47.780
And in the case where there's something bad coming down the pike,

533
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.270
you pull the lever and stop the assembly line.

534
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.650
And we actually know now by comparing cases where people have,
um,

535
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:59.330
are induced to make errors that are,
would be profane,
uh,

536
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.480
like,
uh,
hit shed.
Okay.

537
00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:05.210
If you switch the first sounds of hit shed,

538
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:09.710
it would be taboo if you switch.
The first sounds of hit said it would not be.

539
00:33:09.711 --> 00:33:13.580
So if you compare what happens in PR in a person's brain when they successfully

540
00:33:13.581 --> 00:33:17.720
avoid making an error on the taboo ones versus the neutral ones,

541
00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:22.900
you find that this is the part of the brain right here that's doing more work,

542
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:26.810
avoiding making a taboo error.

543
00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.740
It's a particular part of the brain known as the right inferior frontal gyrus.

544
00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:35.660
That's part of a system specifically responsible for wait for it inhibitory

545
00:33:35.661 --> 00:33:37.670
control.
It's responsible for,

546
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:41.690
you know when you're sitting at a light and it turns green and you're about to

547
00:33:41.691 --> 00:33:44.030
go and then all of a sudden the light changes.

548
00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.640
Maybe there's a firetruck coming from the other direction and it did that

549
00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:48.740
magical blinking thing where it changes the lights.

550
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:54.130
So your ability to not do something to inhibit the execution of that action.

551
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:57.980
That's what the right inferior frontal gyrus is implicated in.

552
00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.220
It does it in general when you're moving around in the world and it does it

553
00:34:01.221 --> 00:34:04.730
specifically when you're avoiding producing profane language,

554
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:07.280
and we can see this in people's behavior as well.

555
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:12.490
So people are suppressing their trying to inhibit producing profane words in

556
00:34:15.081 --> 00:34:19.130
tasks like this.
So this is a a task notice picture,
word interference.

557
00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:23.690
If you give people a a picture and say,
name that picture,
what is this?

558
00:34:23.691 --> 00:34:27.410
A picture of as quickly as possible and then measure how long it takes them to

559
00:34:27.411 --> 00:34:31.910
say what the name of that thing is and then prince and irrelevant word over it.

560
00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:36.620
You find that as long as the word doesn't have similarity in sound or meaning,

561
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:40.580
it doesn't interfere with naming the word with saying the word dog.
Um,

562
00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:44.180
but what happens when you give them a word that they had that they're supposed

563
00:34:44.181 --> 00:34:48.950
to ignore,
that they have more trouble ignoring?
Well,

564
00:34:48.951 --> 00:34:53.390
you find that saying the word dog in this circumstance takes people a

565
00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.650
significantly longer.

566
00:34:56.210 --> 00:35:00.080
The taboo distractors slows people down for to say the word dog.

567
00:35:00.081 --> 00:35:04.190
And the reason for that is because they are activating this inhibitory control

568
00:35:04.191 --> 00:35:07.190
mechanism there bought their brain is saying,
don't say that word,

569
00:35:07.191 --> 00:35:10.460
don't say that word,
and it slows down the production of any word.

570
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.630
The second major finding that I wanted to talk about with respect to the brain

571
00:35:14.631 --> 00:35:17.720
has to do with the originators in the brain.

572
00:35:17.721 --> 00:35:21.620
Those circuits that are responsible for producing language.
Now,

573
00:35:21.621 --> 00:35:24.620
if you've taken an introductory psychology class or linguistics,

574
00:35:24.621 --> 00:35:28.160
maybe even you will have learned that in almost all people,

575
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.280
there are language centers housed in the left hemisphere of the brain,

576
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:35.420
specifically responsible for particular language functions,
broke his area,

577
00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.490
articulates words or lines them up or something.

578
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:41.820
Vernac his area is responsible for word meaning.
Um,

579
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.390
primary auditory cortex is responsible for hearing the sounds that then are

580
00:35:45.391 --> 00:35:49.080
interpreted in terms of words.
And there's a lot of truth to all of this.

581
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:54.440
The thing is that when people have damage to these different parts of the brain,

582
00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:58.830
they have damage to the specific fund functions that those parts of the brain

583
00:35:58.831 --> 00:36:02.520
are supposed to be involved with.
With some exceptions.

584
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:07.580
And we've known this for a 150 years that one of the first scientists to study,

585
00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:09.243
um,

586
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:14.300
the incapacitation of language due to brain damage was or known as Aphasia,

587
00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:20.240
uh,
was uh,
a researcher and physician known as Jacques Florida.
Uh,

588
00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:25.260
he was arguably the founder of neuro linguistics.
He was born in 1773.

589
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.530
He was trained in Montpellier,
and at the age of 52,

590
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.050
he suffered a debilitating stroke.

591
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.760
And that stroke left him basically unable to speak,
but he recovered.

592
00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:39.090
And he began to study people who had similar conditions,

593
00:36:39.091 --> 00:36:43.290
who had had some sort of brain damage leading to an inability to produce

594
00:36:43.291 --> 00:36:47.760
language.
And his most famous case was a parish priest,

595
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:52.740
a man of the cloth who had a stroke,
lost his ability to speak entirely,

596
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:56.220
had no ability to speak with the exception of two words.

597
00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:01.200
And those two words were the French word,
[inaudible],
which means I or me.

598
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.690
And the second was as a Lord,

599
00:37:03.691 --> 00:37:06.570
Thou wrote the most forceful oaths of the tongue,

600
00:37:06.571 --> 00:37:09.720
which begins with an f in which our dictionaries have never dared to print.

601
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:14.490
The French F word starts with the same letter as the English effort as it by,
by,

602
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.080
by coincidence.
Um,

603
00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:21.350
and so this is now common knowledge among the physiologists that people who have

604
00:37:21.571 --> 00:37:24.840
damage to Broca's area.
We'll lose language in general,

605
00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.360
but not necessarily swearing.

606
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.900
Many people who lose the ability to produce language in general.

607
00:37:30.901 --> 00:37:35.370
And this is due to,
uh,
due to traumatic brain injury due to stroke.

608
00:37:35.371 --> 00:37:39.630
Like in these cases,
um,
Alzheimer's disease can cause Aphasia as well.

609
00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:45.110
A variety of different causes can lead to this same syndrome.
People will,
uh,
so,

610
00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.620
uh,
patients,
for example,

611
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.410
we'll be looking at a picture of a dog and a cat and there's supposed to say the

612
00:37:49.411 --> 00:37:52.860
dog is chasing the cat and they can't say the dog is chasing the cat.

613
00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:55.510
So they'll swear.
Um,

614
00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.990
the most extreme example is from people who,
uh,

615
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.630
for medical reasons had to have their entire left hemisphere removed.
So,
um,

616
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:07.470
the most convincing case is,
uh,
a patient known as EEC.

617
00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:11.940
He was 47 years old,
right handed man,
left lateralized for language,

618
00:38:11.941 --> 00:38:14.930
and he had severe symptoms,
um,
from a,

619
00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:18.630
a substantial left hemisphere tumor on his frontal lobe.

620
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.680
So over Broca's area,
um,

621
00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:25.310
the tumor was removed but was determined to be malignant.
And so his,
uh,

622
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.580
doctors decided to remove the entire,
uh,

623
00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:33.660
hemisphere or radical left hemispherectomy.
And,
uh,
so what,

624
00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:37.570
what happened?
What happened in the case of his language?
Well,

625
00:38:37.571 --> 00:38:38.440
this is what happened.

626
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.190
According to his doctor after his entire left hemisphere who was removed at the

627
00:38:42.191 --> 00:38:44.960
age of 47,
his attempts to,

628
00:38:44.961 --> 00:38:49.961
to reply to questions immediately after operation were totally unsuccessful.

629
00:38:50.351 --> 00:38:52.570
He would open his mouth and other isolated words,

630
00:38:52.571 --> 00:38:55.660
and after apparently struggling to organize words for meaningful speech,

631
00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:00.070
recognized his inability and would utter expletives or short emotional phrases

632
00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:01.060
like God dammit,

633
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:06.010
expletives and curses were well articulated and clearly understandable.

634
00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:11.020
It doesn't have language except when he's swearing due to profanity.

635
00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.710
Or do you do frustration?
Do this strong emotional states.
Now,

636
00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:19.390
what could possibly be the part of the brain that can support language support,

637
00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:21.290
emotional,
uh,

638
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:26.050
communication if the entire left hemisphere is removed?
Well,

639
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:30.550
we know because of specific case studies like this one.

640
00:39:30.551 --> 00:39:35.551
So this is the case of a particular individual who is a bilingual French,

641
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.690
uh,
Hebrew speaker,
75 years old,
right handed.

642
00:39:40.691 --> 00:39:45.691
He had a stroke and after his stroke he was unable to swear all of his language

643
00:39:48.941 --> 00:39:52.360
was preserved except for swearing.
And a couple of other things.

644
00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:57.040
He could not provide the correct expletive for situations described to him,

645
00:39:57.041 --> 00:39:59.290
nor he could he complete a curse.
Now,

646
00:39:59.291 --> 00:40:03.410
if you know people who speak French or people who speak Hebrew,
this is,
uh,
an,

647
00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:07.720
an absolutely strange state of affairs not to be able to curse.
Um,

648
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.960
and,
and so here's the payoff.
Where did this particular subject,

649
00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:17.080
this particular patient,
where did he have brain damage from his stroke?

650
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:22.470
He had damage and the right hemisphere of his brain in a place called the Basal

651
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:27.700
Ganglia.
The Basal Ganglia are,
uh,
a part of the limbic system,

652
00:40:27.701 --> 00:40:30.100
which is responsible for emotion regulation.

653
00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:35.080
The Basal Ganglia in particular seem to be responsible for deciding what actions

654
00:40:35.081 --> 00:40:39.460
to perform and what actions to not specifically perform on the basis of an

655
00:40:39.461 --> 00:40:43.930
emotional state.
So I'm angry.
Should I fight or flight?
I'm angry.

656
00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.330
Should I say something?
If so,
what should I say?
That sort of thing.

657
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:48.040
Or should I not say anything at all?

658
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.110
That appears to be what the Basal Ganglia do.

659
00:40:50.111 --> 00:40:55.110
And so it appears that we have a second system that can produce vocalizations

660
00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.300
and there's some corroborating evidence again from Tourette's syndrome,

661
00:40:58.301 --> 00:40:59.320
which I mentioned earlier,

662
00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:02.920
when people have coper Lelea it can be through Tourette's syndrome,

663
00:41:02.921 --> 00:41:06.130
but other sorts of diseases produce it as well.
Um,
you,

664
00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.190
when you have corporate Lelea,
these are the types of words that you,

665
00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:14.400
that you are unable to suppress saying they look a lot like the first list that

666
00:41:14.411 --> 00:41:19.411
we saw in fact and what brain mechanisms are impaired in Tourette's syndrome.

667
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:21.400
That's right.
The Basil Ganglia,

668
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:26.160
Basal Ganglia are different in people who have developmental Tourette Syndrome,

669
00:41:26.161 --> 00:41:28.690
then people who are a neuro-typical.

670
00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:33.380
So what we learned from this is that there are actually multiple vocalization in

671
00:41:33.381 --> 00:41:34.610
humans.
There's one pathway,

672
00:41:34.611 --> 00:41:39.611
the one over here on your left that's in blue that doesn't really involve all

673
00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:42.560
these smart,

674
00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:47.480
evolutionarily new cortical systems that we think are the things that evolved

675
00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.790
that allow us to do language instead.

676
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.840
This system is a sort of a shortcut that we share with other mammals.

677
00:41:53.841 --> 00:41:56.330
And in fact,
um,
even other vertebrates,

678
00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:00.260
it's a system for vocalizing that other primates,
for example,
use when they're,

679
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:05.060
uh,
expressing fear or identifying a Predator that's in their environment.

680
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:09.920
On the other side in red,
you have the system.
Um,
that is our new,

681
00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:14.930
our new system.
Um,
so we have,
we have two capacities for language,

682
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:16.610
one for reflexive,

683
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.510
automatic emotional language and another for rational,
cerebral,

684
00:42:20.511 --> 00:42:23.960
intentional communication,
a of ideas.
And again,

685
00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:28.100
we wouldn't know about this,
this binary system of pathways,

686
00:42:28.101 --> 00:42:30.770
these two pathways if it weren't for profane language.

687
00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:35.060
So profanity works differently from the rest of language.
It sounds different.

688
00:42:35.061 --> 00:42:38.270
It changes differently over time.
It's processed differently in the brain.

689
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:42.800
There are significant gains to be made in the science of language by looking at

690
00:42:42.801 --> 00:42:43.634
profanity.

691
00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:48.640
But first we have to overcome the stigmas associated with these most powerful

692
00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.520
words of our language.
I'd like to thank you now and then welcome.

693
00:42:52.521 --> 00:42:54.200
Any questions that you have?
Thanks a lot.

694
00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:06.100
<v 5>I'm just curious,
what is the most long or complicated profane word?</v>

695
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.890
<v 1>The longest and most complicated profane word is surely one in German,
but,
uh,</v>

696
00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:13.300
so German speakers help me out here.
Um,
uh,

697
00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:19.380
so,
um,
in English,
uh,

698
00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:20.850
I don't know you,

699
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.180
so there is a lot of productive use of profanity and there are lots of these

700
00:43:24.181 --> 00:43:27.390
parts of words that you can add on to other parts to make bigger ones.

701
00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:29.970
I couldn't hazard a guess,
but um,

702
00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.330
but I would guess it would be in a language like German that creates words that

703
00:43:33.331 --> 00:43:36.110
have lots of little bits until it probably has something to do with what we're

704
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:39.690
all sort of compounds.
That's right.
They would be compound words.
Yeah,
sure.
Yeah.

705
00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:44.670
<v 5>All right.
Thank you for your talk.
Um,
is there any difference between um,</v>

706
00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:50.480
like taboo words versus um,
like explicative,

707
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:53.840
uh,
like curse words?
So,
uh,

708
00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:58.700
in the former sense where it's more thought out methodical to installed somebody

709
00:43:58.701 --> 00:44:01.280
whose ancestor or something like that.
And the latter being,

710
00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.200
I want to just get my emotion out.

711
00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:06.740
<v 1>Can I ask people about their feelings about words?</v>

712
00:44:06.741 --> 00:44:10.520
And you can get some dissociations between the following two questions.

713
00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.970
How offensive is it?
Is this word to you personally?

714
00:44:13.971 --> 00:44:18.350
How offensive is it versus how taboo do you think it is in the culture?

715
00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:23.200
And there's some words that differ and you find interesting differences in,
um,

716
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:27.350
for example,
uh,
across,
uh,
across genders.
Um,

717
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:29.840
there are certain words that,
for example,

718
00:44:29.841 --> 00:44:34.530
women will find very offensive but not judged to be that taboo and vice versa.

719
00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.800
Um,
that men don't seem to have the same,
the same sensitivity too.

720
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:41.790
So those two things do certainly dissociate.
And in fact,

721
00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:45.500
if you look at the,
if you look at the w,

722
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:48.120
the words that are produced during a copra Lelea,

723
00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:53.010
they're actually more properly described as,
as taboo,
then profane.

724
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:57.090
And the reason that I say that is when you look at corporate Lelea in Japan

725
00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:03.150
where they just don't have that,
you know,
that set of,
of,
of profane words,

726
00:45:03.151 --> 00:45:05.280
the words that come out are often words describing,

727
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:10.030
they can be like childlike words for bodily functions or for sex.
Oregon's,

728
00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:13.200
um,
or words describing,
um,

729
00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:17.160
visual characteristics of a person like fat or you know,
dark or,
you know,

730
00:45:17.161 --> 00:45:19.990
whatever,
whatever it is that they're not supposed to be saying about how,

731
00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:24.600
how another person looks,
those are taboo acts of talking,

732
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:29.040
even if the word itself isn't,
isn't offensive.
So yeah,
the,

733
00:45:29.041 --> 00:45:30.120
to do kind of dissociate

734
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:31.730
<v 6>when you say,
uh,</v>

735
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:36.750
we have this a secondary mechanism which has a different pathway,

736
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:41.660
how does that then work with the Japanese for example?
Yeah.
So you,

737
00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:45.210
you mentioned that,
that,
I mean there's almost no,
no words there.

738
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.200
And then my second question is,
uh,

739
00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:52.800
what would be the difference then a few like saying go fuck yourself versus,

740
00:45:52.801 --> 00:45:54.450
you know,
like go calculate yourself.

741
00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:56.590
<v 1>Ah,
what would be the difference in,
in,</v>

742
00:45:56.591 --> 00:45:58.810
in terms of the brain mechanisms underlying it?
Yeah.
Okay.

743
00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:03.970
So we don't know what happens in the brains of Japanese speakers when they do

744
00:46:03.971 --> 00:46:08.110
whatever is most closely equivalent.
We do know that the,

745
00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:09.100
if you take people,

746
00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:13.750
run them through an Fmri machine and have them either square or produce minced

747
00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:18.340
oaths.
So,
uh,
not fucked,
but frick,
uh,
not,
uh,

748
00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:20.560
not shit,
but shoot,
um,

749
00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:25.480
you don't get anything like the same sort of a limbic system activation.
Um,
so,

750
00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:30.060
uh,
in English speakers,
those alternatives don't count.
Um,

751
00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:33.490
we don't know what happens with Japanese speakers when they use words that are

752
00:46:33.491 --> 00:46:37.810
kind of equivalent to the minced oaths that are kind of like,
oh darn.
Um,

753
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:42.220
it's possible that something,
it could go either way,
a empirical question.

754
00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:47.860
Um,
but we know that the physiology is different.
So when you expose people to,

755
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:53.110
to strong profane words,
uh,
it triggers this,
uh,
fight or flight response.
This,

756
00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:57.070
uh,
this sympathetic nervous system response where,
uh,
you know,

757
00:46:57.071 --> 00:47:01.450
adrenaline starts pumping,
heart rate increases,
blood flows to the extremities,

758
00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:05.080
pupils dilate,
you get,
you know,
narrowed vision and you're ready to,
you know,

759
00:47:05.081 --> 00:47:06.580
ready to react.
That works.

760
00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:12.010
That doesn't work for Japanese speakers with the pseudo profanities that you

761
00:47:12.011 --> 00:47:14.670
could use things like so and so on.
Um,

762
00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:17.470
so there's a good reason to believe that their brain's probably don't do that

763
00:47:17.471 --> 00:47:21.550
thing.
Now their brains would do that for other sorts of emotional vocalizations.

764
00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:25.540
So,
uh,
I imagined that when sumo wrestlers,
you know,
do,

765
00:47:25.541 --> 00:47:28.040
they're like yelling at each other thing,
there's probably,
if,

766
00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:31.430
if it's emotional for,
they're probably activating that,
that,

767
00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.690
that vocalization circuit.
It's not language,
but it's kind of that same thing.

768
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:38.480
<v 7>I guess what I'm asking is,
uh,
you know,
like if they would drop it,</v>

769
00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:41.100
break on their toe rights.
Yeah.
Does it say,

770
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:45.840
<v 1>yeah.
Yeah.
Like I said,
we just,
we just don't know if they were just vocalize,</v>

771
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:49.360
think there were a reaction.
I mean,
even non verbal.
Yeah.
Yeah.

772
00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:52.250
Verbal stuff comes out.
It's just not profanity per se.

773
00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:55.690
So it's either non-linguistic it's like the equivalent of owl,
um,

774
00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:59.850
or it's stuff that is the equivalent of darn.
Um,
and so,
yeah,

775
00:47:59.851 --> 00:48:03.300
what we don't know is what's happening in the brain.
And in the latter case,
uh,

776
00:48:03.301 --> 00:48:04.230
you had another question

777
00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:09.420
<v 7>was the difference between,
uh,
go fuck yourselves.
Um,
go copulate yourselves.</v>

778
00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:12.470
<v 1>Oh yeah.
Well for sure.
Yet huge difference.
So the,
uh,</v>

779
00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:15.750
so the second has to be computed,
uh,

780
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:20.540
compositionally through that left hemisphere is system of critical operations.

781
00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:24.800
Um,
the go fuck yourself could,

782
00:48:24.801 --> 00:48:26.150
could actually happen either way.

783
00:48:26.151 --> 00:48:29.360
You could be deliberating Kekelik how am I most going to needle this person?

784
00:48:29.361 --> 00:48:34.361
Like what is the word that is most likely to get this person riled up to get

785
00:48:34.731 --> 00:48:37.430
into this person's skin?
I'm going to say go fuck yourself.
Right?

786
00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:41.270
You could calculate that entirely rationally,
uh,

787
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:45.770
cortically or it could be produced via hot cognition.

788
00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:48.260
So that actually has two ways to produce it,
which is,

789
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:49.520
which is the really interesting thing.

790
00:48:49.521 --> 00:48:52.900
It's not the profanity is just generated one place and the rest of languages

791
00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.170
generated something somewhere else.

792
00:48:54.171 --> 00:48:59.030
It's that for a particular biological purpose you have,

793
00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:02.720
you have one way to generate the exact same words that you can generate through

794
00:49:02.721 --> 00:49:04.640
a different a assembly line.

795
00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:09.440
<v 7>I think it's really interesting to hear about,
um,
the side of the speaker,</v>

796
00:49:09.441 --> 00:49:12.770
like why people cost or why they swear.

797
00:49:12.771 --> 00:49:17.240
Like it seems like it's like a release almost in terms of trying to get those

798
00:49:17.241 --> 00:49:19.790
emotions out like you said.
Um,
but I'm wondering,

799
00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.940
have you done studies on the other side,

800
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:24.770
the recipient side of people in the room with you?

801
00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.890
If you swear like Joseph's morning in a meeting,

802
00:49:27.891 --> 00:49:32.330
someone like said the swear word and everyone like broke out laughing and I find

803
00:49:32.331 --> 00:49:36.950
that to be like a common occurrence and I wonder is that like why does that

804
00:49:36.951 --> 00:49:39.350
happen?
Why do people,

805
00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:41.960
do people swear to get that kind of reaction?

806
00:49:41.961 --> 00:49:46.520
And I think of like musical artists as well,
like rappers and hip hop artists.
Um,

807
00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.740
but yeah,
just want to get your take on that.

808
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:49.890
<v 1>Yes,
great question.</v>

809
00:49:49.891 --> 00:49:54.891
There has been a lot of a descriptive work trying to characterize why it is that

810
00:49:56.971 --> 00:50:00.300
people respond differently in different contexts to the same words.

811
00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:05.100
So why does a set of words,
when produced by a comedian,

812
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:08.280
uh,
when that you're watching,
you've decided to go watch that comedian,
you know,

813
00:50:08.281 --> 00:50:12.390
that he works or she works blue,
right?
You know that it's Ali Wong,

814
00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.640
you know that it's going to be,
it's going to be really vulgar.

815
00:50:14.641 --> 00:50:18.600
You're prepared for it.
She could say a set of things that when produced by say,

816
00:50:18.601 --> 00:50:23.550
a political candidate,
um,
would have a totally different,
uh,
uh,

817
00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:26.260
physiological response in you.
Um,

818
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:30.470
a large part of it has to do with our expectations going in and particularly the

819
00:50:30.471 --> 00:50:31.670
social dynamics at play.

820
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:36.710
So people use profanity to cement social relations to demonstrate that this is

821
00:50:36.711 --> 00:50:41.360
an informal situation.
They use it to be funding,
uh,

822
00:50:41.361 --> 00:50:45.800
to break the ice.
They use it to display power.
So if,
uh,

823
00:50:45.801 --> 00:50:49.280
if I'm the boss,
then I can,
I can show that I'm the boss,

824
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:51.710
but cause I can use casual language,
I can use profanity.

825
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:56.450
Whereas the person who is not the boss might not get away with that same type of

826
00:50:56.451 --> 00:50:59.210
language and might be a judge to be.

827
00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:03.320
That person might be thought to be misjudging the situation if they think that

828
00:51:03.321 --> 00:51:04.850
they can get away with using the same language.

829
00:51:04.851 --> 00:51:08.120
So there's a lot of social work that people do,
not social work,

830
00:51:08.121 --> 00:51:12.110
but social work that people do with,
uh,
with profanity.

831
00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:17.180
And,
uh,
we are constantly calculating what we,

832
00:51:17.181 --> 00:51:20.750
what we can get away with and what the consequences of our linguistic actions

833
00:51:20.751 --> 00:51:22.970
are going to be.
You know,
you know,

834
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.790
if you've worked in a place for a long time with a particular set of people,

835
00:51:25.791 --> 00:51:28.490
what the rules are,
who's going to be offended by what.

836
00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:32.140
And so those are oftentimes the places that people feel most comfortable,

837
00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:34.910
comfortable using profanity,
um,

838
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:38.060
to do a variety of things like seem funny,
like break the ice,

839
00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:42.700
like a cement social relations in new situations.
Now I'm,
you know,

840
00:51:42.701 --> 00:51:43.760
my first day on the job,

841
00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:46.430
that's probably not going to be a goto because you haven't,

842
00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:49.970
you haven't taken the temperature of the environment yet.
Right?
So,
uh,

843
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:53.690
there's a lot of evidence that in workplaces,
people use profanity,
uh,

844
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:57.200
for lots of different functions.
Um,
and that in general,

845
00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:01.010
people who use profanity or judged to be more accessible,

846
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:04.670
more informal and more powerful,

847
00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:08.390
but depending on the power structure,

848
00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:12.800
it could be that the judge to be brutish or they could be judged to be,

849
00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:17.690
um,
out of touch or inconsiderate or out of control.

850
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:21.800
So again,
it's all about,
you know,
I'm not a sociologist,

851
00:52:21.801 --> 00:52:24.650
but it's really about the social dynamics at play.

852
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.340
What do you feel about the common processes?

853
00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:31.400
Trying to steer children towards the less profane words,
you know,

854
00:52:31.401 --> 00:52:36.260
shoot instead of,
yeah,
well,
well,
I mean it totally works every time,

855
00:52:36.261 --> 00:52:41.150
right?
Because if I don't sweat them,
they're just not going to learn it.
Right?

856
00:52:41.151 --> 00:52:42.320
Yeah.
So,
uh,

857
00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:45.980
so this is something that I have thought a lot about have a two year old at
home.

858
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:50.930
And uh,
so this is a conscious decision that you have to make as,

859
00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:54.350
as an adult around kids.
You have to decide how you want to,

860
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:58.490
how you want to expose them to all of these complexities that we've just been

861
00:52:58.491 --> 00:53:02.750
talking about,
about the social world.
And,
uh,

862
00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:05.840
it's certainly the case that there's certain types of language that can cause

863
00:53:05.841 --> 00:53:09.890
harm to children.
Verbal abuse,
calling children,
worthless,
insulting them,

864
00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:13.190
threatening them.
That's all stuff that's known to cause harm.

865
00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:17.030
Slurs are known to cause harm in kids.
Kids who,

866
00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:21.560
so kids in middle school who are called by homophobic slurs report as a

867
00:53:21.561 --> 00:53:25.060
correlational studies because he can't do this experimentally,
obviously.
Um,

868
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:29.070
but they report rate increases in depression,
anxiety,
detachment from school.

869
00:53:29.071 --> 00:53:33.480
There's lots of stuff that's not good to have around kids linguistically,

870
00:53:33.481 --> 00:53:37.710
but there's no evidence that just the fleeting expletive because you tripped

871
00:53:37.711 --> 00:53:40.200
over a kitty gate in the middle of the night.
Um,

872
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:43.290
is the type of thing that will cause harm to a child.

873
00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:48.420
What will cause harm to a child is if they don't know that using these words in

874
00:53:48.961 --> 00:53:52.080
certain circumstances is going to have consequences for them.

875
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:55.950
And so there are lots of ways that you can teach them what the consequences are

876
00:53:55.951 --> 00:53:56.790
going to be.

877
00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:01.380
My preferred method is to explain what the consequences are going to be.
Um,

878
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:05.670
you know,
kids,
uh,
do a lot of social learning when you potty train.

879
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:08.100
I have a lot of familiarity with this.
When you potty train a two year old,

880
00:54:08.101 --> 00:54:08.934
for example,

881
00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:13.590
most of the learning is about there are certain places and times for particular

882
00:54:13.591 --> 00:54:17.400
activities and lots of other places and times that those activities are

883
00:54:17.401 --> 00:54:21.720
inappropriate,
like on the couch or in the middle of kindergarten,
preschool or,

884
00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:22.913
um,

885
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:27.420
and that's a thing that a two year old can learn and a two year old can learn

886
00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:30.510
that this is a language that I use at home and I use this other language because

887
00:54:30.511 --> 00:54:33.240
I'm bilingual at school.
Kids can learn that.

888
00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:37.260
And so I don't see any reason that kids can't also learn that this is a word

889
00:54:37.261 --> 00:54:38.640
that daddy uses when he's upset.

890
00:54:38.641 --> 00:54:41.910
It's not a bad word and daddy's not bad for using it.
He's not a bad person.

891
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.880
But if you use this word at school,

892
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:49.290
expect that some people might not like it and there might be consequences.
Okay,

893
00:54:49.291 --> 00:54:53.660
go ahead and explore,
you know,
do what you're gonna do.
Uh,
you know,
that,

894
00:54:53.661 --> 00:54:54.494
that's my,
that's that,

895
00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:58.710
that's my general view of what the literature tells us best practices ought to

896
00:54:58.711 --> 00:54:59.544
be.

897
00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:05.350
<v 8>I'm,
uh,
coming up with a sort of linguists direction as I'm sure you know,
uh,</v>

898
00:55:05.351 --> 00:55:09.580
I'm interested in sort of,
it seems like there's,
even from the neural level,

899
00:55:09.581 --> 00:55:13.110
there's kind of two things you could be probing.
There's the,

900
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:16.050
the things that they have this inhibitory response,
which I see,

901
00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:20.890
think it's really your,
your core category.
Those are the forbidden words,
right?

902
00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:26.160
And you have a constant monitor to try to prevent yourself from producing those.

903
00:55:26.171 --> 00:55:28.340
And when you do produce them,
you,

904
00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:32.680
you have to inhibit the inhibition,
so to speak.
Um,

905
00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:37.840
but then there's this other category of sort of limbically produced words,
right.

906
00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:42.670
Um,
are those,
are those really exactly the same?

907
00:55:42.671 --> 00:55:47.280
Or the words like,
ouch.
Get used in like left brain removed people.

908
00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:48.660
<v 1>Yeah.
So they do.
Yeah.</v>

909
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:51.920
<v 8>That's what I was going to say is there's,
there's an exclusive category.</v>

910
00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:55.580
<v 1>Yup.
There's six laminators will often be preserved to interjections are often</v>

911
00:55:55.581 --> 00:56:00.080
presented things like,
uh,
oh no.
Or,
um,
I mean,
uh,

912
00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:04.820
or out she had,
those will oftentimes be preserved in brokers or global aphasia.

913
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:07.400
Um,
not always,
uh,
but they,

914
00:56:07.401 --> 00:56:10.100
but they often are and they seem to be exactly what you're describing.
It's,

915
00:56:10.101 --> 00:56:13.100
I'm in an emotional state,
I'm producing language.
Uh,

916
00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:15.321
this is going to come out.

917
00:56:15.321 --> 00:56:17.270
So it seems to be generated by a different system for sure.

918
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.860
<v 8>So as you became immersed in this work,</v>

919
00:56:19.861 --> 00:56:24.040
did you find your personal production rate of expletives increase?

920
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:28.400
<v 1>And if so,
what did you do to fix that?
As Nancy said,</v>

921
00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:30.310
it was impossible that it could increase,

922
00:56:31.890 --> 00:56:36.390
well increased in a way because now I'm talking about all these words all the

923
00:56:36.391 --> 00:56:40.740
time.
So it increased in professional context.
Um,
no.
If anything,

924
00:56:40.741 --> 00:56:43.110
I think it decreases because the,
okay,
there's this effect,
right?

925
00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:46.650
As you get exposed to these words over and over and over and over and over,

926
00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:48.510
they started to lose their impact a little bit.

927
00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:52.650
This is kind of what's happening with young people and the democratization of

928
00:56:52.651 --> 00:56:53.484
media.

929
00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:58.020
So 20 years ago when you only ever got exposed to language in media that was

930
00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:02.610
filtered through some sensor,
you didn't hear these words much.
Now,
uh,
you know,

931
00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:07.320
the media is in your pocket and uh,
directly from someone's thumbs to your eyes,

932
00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:09.240
you get,
uh,
you get a stream of language.

933
00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.970
And if you're playing video games before,
you know,

934
00:57:11.971 --> 00:57:14.210
network of games before breakfast,
you'll get a,
you know,

935
00:57:14.211 --> 00:57:16.980
a hundred f words before,
um,
before you go to school.
So,

936
00:57:16.981 --> 00:57:20.310
so kids are exposed to a lot more of this.
And as a consequence,
I think that's,

937
00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.710
that's part of the reason that you get this consequence,

938
00:57:22.711 --> 00:57:27.360
which is that those run of the mill profane words start to creep down the list.

939
00:57:27.361 --> 00:57:31.950
The F word isn't judged to be that bad anymore by,
um,
by digital natives.

940
00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:36.390
So that the same has happened to me that you,
that I,
uh,
in a way,

941
00:57:36.391 --> 00:57:39.690
these words just don't really do much for me anymore.
Sorry Nancy.

942
00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:43.000
Thank you for the bad.
Our stock.

943
00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:48.340
So it appears that repeated exposure decreases the impact of profanities.

944
00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:52.570
So I have one or two questions depending on your answer.
The first question,

945
00:57:52.571 --> 00:57:54.790
I might have a second one.
So the first question is,

946
00:57:54.791 --> 00:57:59.791
would English speaking society's be better off or worse off if profanities just

947
00:58:00.461 --> 00:58:02.470
lost their impact or disappear from the language?

948
00:58:02.471 --> 00:58:07.350
Somehow they would be different off.
I mean,

949
00:58:07.351 --> 00:58:09.920
there would be a little bit more like France.
So,

950
00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:14.680
so in France there are profane words that are bad words,
uh,

951
00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:16.620
but they're not as bad as they are here.

952
00:58:16.650 --> 00:58:20.670
So you don't get them to see them censored or bleeped on,
uh,

953
00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:25.730
on daily television that you could see them on the evening news broadcasts,

954
00:58:25.891 --> 00:58:28.350
you could see them around kids,
you could see them produced by kids.

955
00:58:28.351 --> 00:58:30.160
Even the strongest words,
even that,
that,

956
00:58:30.161 --> 00:58:34.050
that f word that our dictionaries have not seen fit to print.
Um,

957
00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:38.790
I have,
I saw the president of the republic say it on the floor of the Senate.
Um,

958
00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.570
so,
uh,
you might end up with something like that where,
yeah,

959
00:58:42.571 --> 00:58:43.980
you can use the words,

960
00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:49.010
they just have a little bit less social cache and so they do a little bit less

961
00:58:49.051 --> 00:58:52.790
emotional work.
That's what you would end up with,
I think.
Okay.

962
00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:56.330
So at least we will unemployed a few sensors,
some perhaps seven,

963
00:58:56.350 --> 00:58:59.520
do something more productive with their lives.
So the second question is,
um,

964
00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:02.410
as you know,
Google has,
um,

965
00:59:02.490 --> 00:59:07.490
made some attempts at d deradicalizing Muslim terrorists by showing certain

966
00:59:09.721 --> 00:59:12.480
neutral search results when they search for radical materials.

967
00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:14.730
So it's a form of mind influence.

968
00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:19.170
If you were at Google and had some control over this,

969
00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:23.990
what would you do to reduce the impact of profanities?
Well,
I mean,

970
00:59:23.991 --> 00:59:26.930
you're leading me down the path of saying,
well,
you should just show more of it,

971
00:59:26.931 --> 00:59:31.220
right?
Um,
but I think that you,
what you need to do is show it in specifically,

972
00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:36.170
uh,
uh,
low emotional arousal contexts.

973
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:37.710
So if it's a,

974
00:59:37.711 --> 00:59:42.711
the reason that we think these words are bad is because early in life we saw

975
00:59:42.861 --> 00:59:47.450
them used or heard them be used in strongly emotional contexts,
right?

976
00:59:47.451 --> 00:59:48.980
Someone was really frustrated.

977
00:59:48.981 --> 00:59:53.810
Someone was in experiencing strong pain or it was really angry or really

978
00:59:53.811 --> 00:59:58.310
excited.
We use them and we got a really strong emotional reaction,

979
00:59:58.660 --> 00:59:59.420
right?
Those,

980
00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:03.170
that emotional substance is what makes us think that they are powerful words.

981
01:00:03.171 --> 01:00:06.770
And that we have internalized,
we've associated because we're heavy and learners,

982
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:09.410
and now we,
uh,
uh,

983
01:00:09.411 --> 01:00:12.080
now we can't help but have that emotional response when we're presented with

984
01:00:12.081 --> 01:00:13.790
that word.
However,

985
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:18.200
the De contextualized presentation,
you know,

986
01:00:18.201 --> 01:00:20.810
you see a list of words and study them over and over and over,

987
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:23.930
that has no reinforcing emotional content.

988
01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.480
And so I guess you would have to,

989
01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:30.500
if you really wanted to deescalate the emotional value of those words,

990
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:34.850
they would need to be presented in an emotional context.
So I wouldn't show,

991
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:39.910
I wouldn't show those words used in strident political discourse,

992
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:43.970
for example.
Um,
or in,
um,

993
01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.430
in other sorts of highly emotional context.

994
01:00:46.431 --> 01:00:51.431
I would show them in lists of words or in analysis context or some sort of like

995
01:00:52.101 --> 01:00:56.720
really boring,
mundane,
anodyne place,
I guess.

996
01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.560
But,
you know,
I'm not an engineer,
so that probably wouldn't work.
I don't know.

997
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:01.873
Thank you so much.

998
01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:03.950
<v 0>Pleasure to talk to you.</v>
