So thank you so much Mo for being here.
I'd like to be here.
Thank you.

13
00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.200
So what qualifies you as a businessman to write about happiness?

14
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.650
<v 0>Hmm.
Okay,
that's a good start for the conversation.
Um,
I,</v>

15
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.493
um,

16
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.070
I think what's happened is I've been a very successful businessman for a very

17
00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:16.940
long time.
I,
uh,
I was one of the most,
as many of you know,

18
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.290
being the chief business officer of Google x is probably the,
you know,

19
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.020
the luckiest you can get in the professional world.

20
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.300
I've been that lucky almost,
uh,
since my very early,
uh,
you know,
uh,

21
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.810
start to in business and,
uh,
you know,
as,
as life,
uh,

22
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.660
was extremely kind to me,
you know,

23
00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:38.690
an Egyptian who is educated in the public schools of Egypt.

24
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.860
I started to become very successful at a,
in my late twenties,

25
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.720
I was a director of a for the Middle East of a major consumer goods company.

26
00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:51.740
I was a day trader making very,
very hefty returns at the time.

27
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.020
And I was miserable.
I was totally,
totally,
totally depressed.
Uh,

28
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.690
you know,
regardless of how much life gave me,

29
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.910
I continued to feel unhappy or,
you know,
I,
I had everything that we work so hard,

30
00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:09.430
all our lives to achieve,
including a wonderful,
a wonderful family.
You know,

31
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.490
a wonderful wife,
uh,
two amazing children,
uh,
who,
you know,

32
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.570
filled our life with peace and happiness and fun.

33
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.610
And I constantly was depressed.

34
00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:24.090
And being a Middle Eastern therapy was not really an option if you want.
Uh,

35
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.831
so I,
uh,

36
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:29.831
I did what I know how to do best at the time to dig myself out of my misery.

37
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:33.400
I sort of started to read,
uh,

38
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.290
extensively about the topic of happiness.
Uh,

39
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.310
I dedicated more than 10 years of my life to reading about the topic.

40
00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:43.040
And that's a lot of hours.
If you think about it,

41
00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:47.090
id that at least an hour or two a day,
uh,
on,
in the first couple of years,

42
00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:51.140
I could not get it at all.
I couldn't understand what they were telling me.

43
00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:54.380
There was a ton of amazing practice,
uh,
you know,

44
00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:56.030
of things you can do to become happy.

45
00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:58.490
Happiness isn't ancient science if you think about it,

46
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.920
but I just couldn't get it.
I,
you know,
it just did not speak to my mind at all.

47
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:07.210
And so I sort of used,
if you want my business background,

48
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:11.350
but more my engineering background to tackle the topic from a very,

49
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:16.020
very different point of view.
I started to look at the topic of happiness.
Uh,
uh,

50
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.710
you know,
from a mathematical scientific point of view,
assuming that,
you know,

51
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.890
being a young man who grew maybe in my mid twenties to be a very happy young

52
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:29.170
man,
and then we ran out of happiness.

53
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.330
That must have meant that something went wrong with the machine,
that,
you know,

54
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:37.660
this was operating fine and then it wasn't working anymore.

55
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.660
So maybe we should unassembled the machine and find a way to find out which

56
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:44.800
parts are not working and then make them work again.

57
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.420
Or maybe the machine was just not suited for the current environment.
Maybe,

58
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.890
you know,
if you take a sports car,
and I'm not a sports car in any way,
but to,

59
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.440
you know,
if you take a sports car and put it out in the middle of the desert,
uh,

60
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.720
it gets stuck.
It gets unhappy.
And so this approach to happiness,

61
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:06.250
that engineering,
scientific,
uh,
experimental approach to happiness,

62
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.460
uh,
reflected a very,
very,
very different back,
you know,

63
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:12.640
very different perspective,
very different,
uh,
you know,

64
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:15.950
approach to solving the problem.
And,
and that's what I summarize in software.

65
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.440
Happy.

66
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.960
<v 2>Hm.
So after all this research,
you a,</v>

67
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:24.400
you found happiness in many ways,
but then something,
something happened.
What,

68
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.230
what ended up making you write this book?
So,
so I,
um,

69
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.160
<v 0>search,
as I said,
took around 10 years or so,
and I,</v>

70
00:04:31.161 --> 00:04:36.161
and I was at the point in my life where almost nothing could dent my hat,

71
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.930
my happiness,
you know.
Uh,
again,
I,
I'm,
I come from a Middle Eastern background,

72
00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:43.640
so,
you know,
post nine 11,

73
00:04:43.641 --> 00:04:47.890
I would travel to the u s for business at least once a month.
You know,

74
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.900
it would take me 12 to 14 hours to get to the u s and then I would almost

75
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.080
always,
you know,
spent two to three hours in random check in,

76
00:04:57.081 --> 00:05:00.950
in a homeland security,
right.
With this silly smile on my face,

77
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.250
nothing would make me unhappy.
I would win a deal,
lose a deal,

78
00:05:04.251 --> 00:05:08.700
gets stuck in traffic.
It doesn't really matter.
I was just constantly a okay,

79
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.670
was life grateful and,
and,
you know,
enjoying every bit of it.
Uh,
um,

80
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.080
and,
and in an interesting way,

81
00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:19.450
I think this must have been my training if you want,
because,
um,
in,

82
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.100
in 2014,
I think I got the ultimate test of,

83
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.670
of being able to stay peaceful and calm that a parent could ever do.
My,

84
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.600
my wonderful [inaudible] who was 21 at the time,
21 and a half at the time.

85
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.820
Beautiful,
handsome.

86
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.540
Why is kind and honest young man who,
uh,

87
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.380
made me proud in every possible way.
Who was my friend,
uh,

88
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.210
much more than my son.
You know,
I,
I,
I that I,
you know,
I had him at the,

89
00:05:47.211 --> 00:05:50.120
at a very young age and so we played video games together.

90
00:05:50.121 --> 00:05:53.240
We played music together,
we read books together.
We,
you know,
he was,

91
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.810
he was a very funny young man.
And so we watched a ton of comedy.

92
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.680
It was always an amazing experience to be with Allie.
Uh,

93
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:05.660
he came to visit us in Dubai in July,
2014 and instead of,

94
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.000
uh,
of going through a wonderful vacation idea,

95
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:11.690
unfortunately he was diagnosed with an appendix,
inflammation.
Uh,

96
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:16.250
we took him to a local hospital and the surgeon made five mistakes in a row,
uh,

97
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.190
in,
in four hours.
Our life turns from planning to for the best,

98
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.660
you know,
time of our life,
uh,

99
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:28.520
to losing the one that meant most to us.
And,

100
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:31.850
um,
and even though the pain was unbearable,

101
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:35.590
I think anyone here who has children will know that,
um,
to,

102
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.900
to lose a child is almost to lose a part of your heart.
Truly.
I,
I'm,

103
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.970
I'm even lost for words today.
Two and a half years later,
I,

104
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:49.030
I honestly cannot describe what it feels exactly there is that lasting pain if

105
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:54.320
you want.
But we were so peaceful and calm as a family.

106
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.070
I wouldn't say we were happy.
We were,
uh,
you know,

107
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.410
that would be a big exaggeration,
but we were not unhappy.
We,

108
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.060
we were not angry at the world.
We were not disgruntled with what happened.

109
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:09.960
We did not want to kill the,
the,
the surgeon or we didn't want to,
you know,

110
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.180
blame ourselves for the rest of our life,
for,

111
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.160
for driving him to that specific hospital.
And,
uh,
in an interesting way,

112
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:20.270
when people came to Ellis Memorial,
they would come in crying and hundreds,

113
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.820
probably more than a thousand people came and they would come in crying and they

114
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:29.570
would then we would hug them and we would explain to them our view of,
of,

115
00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:31.260
of life and the life and death.

116
00:07:31.261 --> 00:07:34.120
And we would explain to them our view of happiness and,

117
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.570
and how we go through life.
And they would smile.
And then,
you know,
if you,

118
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:40.760
if you did not know the background to the event,

119
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:43.790
you would have thought that this is maybe Ellie's birthday or something.

120
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.240
Everyone was smiling and hugging and laughing,

121
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.480
remembering wonderful memories of valley.
And you know,

122
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:54.770
the atmosphere was amazing.
And so my friends basically started to say,

123
00:07:54.771 --> 00:07:58.990
you have to write this down.
And An id had actually asked me before he left it.

124
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.340
It's almost as if he knew he was going to leave.

125
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.340
He sort of dictated his will a few days before and told me you need to continue

126
00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:08.000
to do,
to make a difference to the world.

127
00:08:08.001 --> 00:08:11.600
But maybe you should start to depend on your heart a little more,
you know,

128
00:08:11.601 --> 00:08:15.560
sort of on top of all of the business and finance and technology that you've

129
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:16.730
been doing all your life,

130
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.640
there is another part of you that you may want to share with the world.

131
00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:24.641
And so I sat down to write 17 days exactly 17 days after id left and I could not

132
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:28.510
stop.
And you know,
I suppose local Helio says when,

133
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.470
when you know your life's purpose,
the universe conspires to make it happen.

134
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.090
Everything fell in place for four and half months later I had 600 pages of

135
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.060
manuscript.
I met one of the best agents in the business,

136
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:45.770
Michael Carlisle from inquiry,
who introduced me to publishers across the world.

137
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:46.400
Uh,

138
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.930
today we are published in more than 12 languages even before the launch of the

139
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:55.710
book.
And,
uh,
including some of the top publishers worldwide,

140
00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:00.870
Simon Schuster a Norstar way,
and Andy Mcmillan's bluebird.
So,
uh,

141
00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:04.860
it's definitely been a,
a mission in the making if you want.

142
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.200
<v 2>That's such a beautiful way to honor your son.</v>

143
00:09:08.201 --> 00:09:11.680
And that was such a powerful ask of him to do the work of your heart.

144
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.220
How is it feeling to do that work of your heart?

145
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.580
<v 0>Um,
it,
it,
um,</v>

146
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.200
I th I think what's,

147
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.360
what you realize after a while is that when you lose a loved one,

148
00:09:26.361 --> 00:09:30.710
and definitely when you lose a child,
the pain remains okay.

149
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.160
It doesn't go away.
Uh,
you know,
you,
you,
you know,
most,
most,

150
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:38.690
most of us who have experienced the loss of someone they love would think that

151
00:09:38.691 --> 00:09:40.490
they were given one choice.
Right.

152
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.780
And the choice would be to sort of surrender to the harshness of life and,

153
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.530
and,
uh,
and you know,

154
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:53.050
just accept and cry and close your door and decay.
Right.

155
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.130
Uh,
I think very early on I realized that I was really given two choices.

156
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:03.290
One was to close my door and decay and it wouldn't bring it back.

157
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:08.630
And,
and the other was to do this,
uh,
try and honor Riley in a,
in a,

158
00:10:08.631 --> 00:10:13.250
in a way that sort of tells the world about his way of living.
Right?

159
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.720
I mean,
it was so peaceful and going through life,

160
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.540
he actually had the tattoo on his back that,
that thread,

161
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.630
the gravity of the battery means nothing to those sps.
And unsurprisingly,

162
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.490
when he was going into the operations room,

163
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.650
the last thing he did is he set up and then through his scrubs,

164
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.470
I saw that tattoo.
That was the very last thing he told me.

165
00:10:36.471 --> 00:10:40.960
If you want now we all go through harsh events in our life.

166
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.610
And imagine if you,
uh,

167
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.640
if you can share a way of living with 10 million people who will go through the,

168
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:54.910
the harshness of life and instead of closing their doors and decaying or closing

169
00:10:55.251 --> 00:10:59.120
their doors and feeling unhappy or disgruntled with life,
you know,

170
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:04.180
imagine if I can honor it by having 10 million people remember his way and

171
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.540
hopefully send him a happy wish.
Uh,
I've,

172
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.920
I've spoken to around 12,000 people so far,
uh,

173
00:11:12.921 --> 00:11:17.540
about the concepts of the book.
And every time I speak about it publicly,

174
00:11:17.541 --> 00:11:22.100
I get hundreds of people who will tell me this,
change our life.
You know,
I've,

175
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.610
I've,

176
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:27.610
I've spent a privileged life working on projects like project Lu and,

177
00:11:27.741 --> 00:11:31.680
or you know,
on Google itself in emerging markets to spread the,
the,

178
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:36.320
the amazing knowledge that comes with Google to every language and market in the

179
00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.900
world.
And I will tell you,

180
00:11:38.901 --> 00:11:42.890
I have rarely ever found anything more rewarding than to,

181
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.080
than to show people,

182
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:50.510
sort of the defects that our brains take us through and make us miserable

183
00:11:50.511 --> 00:11:55.480
sometimes for a lifetime.
And once you see through them,
they go away.
Right.

184
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.580
It's nothing is more rewarding.
Yeah.

185
00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.640
<v 2>So we've done a few courses here at Google and I've taken hundreds of people</v>

186
00:12:01.641 --> 00:12:05.840
through with the content and a lot of them,
y'all saying it's life changing.

187
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:10.930
How would you summarize in just a few minutes what your happiness model is?

188
00:12:10.971 --> 00:12:13.610
How is this different from other books about happiness?

189
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:17.830
<v 0>Yeah,
I think,
I think the,
the biggest,
uh,
uh,</v>

190
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:20.760
I mean Googlers and most,
most of us,

191
00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.220
what I call Modern Day warriors today,
people,

192
00:12:23.221 --> 00:12:25.620
people who get stuck on the one on one and you know,

193
00:12:25.621 --> 00:12:28.560
and fight in meetings and have to close deals,
right.
You,
you know,

194
00:12:28.561 --> 00:12:31.050
we don't have the time for eat,
pray,
love,

195
00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:32.910
or to go and live in an ashram somewhere.

196
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:38.240
I think most of us need to understand how something works before we are told

197
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.250
what to do with it to make it work better.
And so,
um,
you know,

198
00:12:44.251 --> 00:12:48.230
my,
my approach started with some very basics by the way.
I mean,
uh,
and,

199
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.140
and we do that.

200
00:12:49.141 --> 00:12:53.490
I [inaudible] recording the trainings is when you ask people what is happiness?

201
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.740
Most people don't even know what,
you know,
what is the,
you know,
the,
the,
the,
the,

202
00:12:58.741 --> 00:13:01.560
the thing they've been searching for.
And so,
you know,

203
00:13:01.561 --> 00:13:04.710
we take a very simple engineering approach to this.
We say,
okay,

204
00:13:04.711 --> 00:13:06.780
let's plot as many,
you know,

205
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:11.880
a arbitrary data points as you can recall about moments when you felt happy and

206
00:13:11.881 --> 00:13:13.590
find the trend line between them.

207
00:13:13.591 --> 00:13:18.510
The equation that describes this trend line is really what happiness is,
right?

208
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:23.010
So,
you know,
and,
and there could be a million ways you can describe happiness.

209
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.430
The one that is common across all human beings,

210
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:30.180
across all moments of happiness,
at least.
The one I found was this,

211
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:35.660
that your happiness is equal to or greater than the difference between your

212
00:13:38.011 --> 00:13:42.930
perception of the events of your life and your expectations from how of how life

213
00:13:42.931 --> 00:13:46.020
should behave.
Right.
So in a very interesting way,

214
00:13:46.021 --> 00:13:49.290
every single moment in your life with your,
what you felt happy,

215
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:52.980
it was a moment where you felt that life was going your way.
Okay.

216
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.920
Regardless of how realistic your expectation from life,

217
00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.680
as if life throws you something,
it's like,
hey,
you know what,
uh,
I,
um,

218
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.250
I should lose 25 pounds in the next two and a half weeks.
You know what,

219
00:14:05.251 --> 00:14:09.330
I have this very important event in Rio de Janeiro and I really need to lose

220
00:14:09.331 --> 00:14:13.470
that.
Right?
If you don't,
you get upset.
It's like,
seriously,

221
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:18.750
who loses 25 pounds in two and a half weeks?
Right?
And,
and you start to go like,

222
00:14:18.751 --> 00:14:23.460
all my metabolism is wrong.
And you know,
I was created in a way where I,
you know,

223
00:14:23.461 --> 00:14:26.310
I,
I really don't eat at all,
but look at me,
I don't know.
You know,
we,

224
00:14:26.311 --> 00:14:31.311
we start to describe things to ourself that are so unrealistic just because life

225
00:14:32.131 --> 00:14:34.290
did not meet what we expect.
Okay?

226
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:39.490
Now with that equation in mind,
you start to realize that most of,
uh,

227
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:43.900
of our hat on happiness truly is a,
in our head.
Okay?

228
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.650
We think of the events of life in a certain way.

229
00:14:46.651 --> 00:14:51.110
We compare that to our expectations of how life should behave.
And when,

230
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:55.550
when the event,
mrs the expectation,
the thought is,
triggers,
triggers,

231
00:14:55.551 --> 00:14:59.780
unhappiness,
you do nothing about it most of the times.
So your brain goes like,

232
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.610
but I told you something was wrong.

233
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.540
It brings it up again and it triggers unhappiness.
And then,
you know,
you,

234
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:09.080
you go through that too,
what I call the suffering cycle.
You know,

235
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.610
an event triggers a thought,

236
00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:13.150
but then the thought triggers suffering and the suffering,
you know,

237
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:16.460
is followed by inaction.
So it triggers more thought,
more suffering,

238
00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:21.140
more in action and so on.
And life continues that way for some of us for years,

239
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.780
for years.
Right?
Um,

240
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.610
so the interesting thing is there is a way to shortcut that cycle.

241
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:34.130
So,
so I work or you know,
I offer a model that I call six,
seven,
five,
six,

242
00:15:34.131 --> 00:15:34.430
seven.

243
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:39.430
Five is basically the six and the seven are the reasons why we more often than

244
00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:46.391
not end up thinking that the events of our life don't meet our expectations even

245
00:15:46.401 --> 00:15:49.260
though most of the time life is okay,
right?
Uh,

246
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:54.350
the six is six grand illusions for us to succeed and be successful Google

247
00:15:54.351 --> 00:15:55.184
employees,

248
00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:00.400
what we do is we learn certain skills that allow us to navigate the modern

249
00:16:01.041 --> 00:16:03.800
world,
uh,
that make us successful.

250
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:09.220
But to do that we have to start dealing with things not exactly as they really

251
00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:15.050
are.
I mean,
let me give you an example.
We all are very proficient to,

252
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.390
you know,
in terms of handling time,
we all,
we all know how to be punctual.
We all,

253
00:16:19.391 --> 00:16:22.430
we all know how to start a meeting on time,
how to end the meeting on time,

254
00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:23.840
how to plan for tomorrow's meeting.

255
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:28.730
But time is nothing like what we think it is.
As,
as a matter of fact,

256
00:16:28.731 --> 00:16:33.230
I use very,
very,
uh,
complex science presented in a very simple way.

257
00:16:33.231 --> 00:16:37.460
In the chapter about time or I basically show you from the theory of relativity

258
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:41.090
that the only slice of time you will ever experience is the slice of now.

259
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.420
The only time you will ever live is now.
You have never lived in the past.

260
00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:45.890
You will never live in the future.

261
00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.800
But because we are so adept at thinking about the future too,

262
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.870
to plan for it and thinking about the past,
to learn from it,

263
00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.670
we end up in those cycles of thoughts that completely destroy our happiness.

264
00:16:58.671 --> 00:17:02.630
They make us efficient,
but who wants to solve for efficiency?

265
00:17:02.631 --> 00:17:04.670
If you're eventually going to end up unhappy?

266
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.890
So six grand illusions put us in a state of sadness.

267
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.610
They put us in a state of confusion,
right?
It's like constant,

268
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.320
uninterrupted suffering.
If you go above those,

269
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:23.350
you end up in a place where you are allowed to think about every event of your

270
00:17:24.441 --> 00:17:27.380
life.
Take every event of your life through the happiness equation.

271
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.190
You take an event,
you compare it to our expectations.
If it's,
if the,

272
00:17:31.191 --> 00:17:34.850
if you end up with a positive thought,
yeah,
this is better than my expectations,

273
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.390
you're happy.
Okay.
If you end up with a negative sort of thoughts that no,

274
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:42.860
this misses my expectations,
you're unhappy.
And that incessant thought cycle,

275
00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.031
you know,
is,

276
00:17:44.031 --> 00:17:48.440
this is a thought is a cycle that unfortunately humans on average,

277
00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.060
this is scientifically research in the University of Texas,

278
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:55.200
will end up thinking a negative thought 60 to 70% of the time.

279
00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:00.830
Not because the world is bad and missing out expectations 60 or 70% of the time,

280
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:05.700
but because there are seven a blind spots in the way we look at life,

281
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.060
we look at life in a way that was designed for the caveman years.

282
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.940
So those blind spots makers,

283
00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.970
let's say they make our brain grumpy,

284
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:19.170
they sort of make our brain constantly come back to us with the results of the

285
00:18:19.171 --> 00:18:21.900
happiness equation that should make us unhappy,
right?

286
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.530
They make us safe and sort of,
you know,
they help with our survival,

287
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:26.940
but they make us unhappy.

288
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.810
And so if you manage to fix the seven blind spots,

289
00:18:30.811 --> 00:18:34.470
if you manage to see through them,
it's suddenly you'll find yourself.

290
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.470
When you compare events to expectations in your happiness equation,

291
00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:40.380
you're constantly going up to the happiness quadrant.

292
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:45.810
The five in my model,
however,
is if you continue to do this long enough,

293
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:50.520
if you continue to compare events to expectations without the six grand

294
00:18:50.521 --> 00:18:52.830
illusions,
without the seven blind spots,

295
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:57.960
very frequently you will realize that most events of life should meet your

296
00:18:57.961 --> 00:19:01.620
expectations,
okay?
Even the harsh ones,
by the way,

297
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.820
if you know the truth about life,
you should expect them.
You know,

298
00:19:05.821 --> 00:19:09.030
we all know that change is the only constant,
right?

299
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.210
That we should expect change tomorrow,
right?

300
00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:17.160
We should expect that tomorrow is not going to be like today.
Now,
if you,

301
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.520
if you allow yourself to,
uh,

302
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:24.330
to look at the world this way,
then when change happens,

303
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:28.830
it doesn't miss your expectations anymore.
You constantly feel okay with it.

304
00:19:28.831 --> 00:19:33.180
You feel happy about it.
And so I say,
if you hang onto those five ultimate truth,

305
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:38.490
you won't even need to solve the equation anymore.
More frequently than not,

306
00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:42.240
you will just be okay.
You will be happy in a state that I call the state of joy,

307
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.310
uninterrupted happiness.
All the time.

308
00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:50.500
<v 2>Okay.
So that's complex stuff that I want to unpack a few things in particular.</v>

309
00:19:50.501 --> 00:19:52.270
So you brought up time,

310
00:19:52.271 --> 00:19:56.290
which was one of the grand illusions and the importance of the present moment.

311
00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:59.140
Why is it so important and how does it relate to our happiness?

312
00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.740
<v 0>It is complex stuff by the way.
So,
so one,</v>

313
00:20:01.741 --> 00:20:05.290
one of the differences between salt for happy,
any other happiness books is,

314
00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:09.970
you know,
it,
it is truly a book for reflection.
So,

315
00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.290
so you read,
you,
you think about it,
you go like,

316
00:20:14.291 --> 00:20:17.740
what did he just say?
I didn't believe that all my life.

317
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:22.090
And then you read it again.
Okay.
And I,
I don't know if I,
if you know,

318
00:20:22.091 --> 00:20:25.840
if you recall,
we spoke about the concept of early readers.

319
00:20:25.841 --> 00:20:30.750
So I wrote this book like a Googler would,
you know how we use the,
uh,

320
00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:35.050
Google docs too,
to review proposals or clients,
you know,

321
00:20:35.051 --> 00:20:38.080
presentations or whatever together.
So I did that actually when I,

322
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:42.870
when I got to version two of the book,
I posted it online.
I put a,
you know,

323
00:20:42.871 --> 00:20:46.180
a message on social media and got 500 early,
there's people that are,

324
00:20:46.181 --> 00:20:50.920
don't even know,
uh,
who basically went into the book and edited it themselves.

325
00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.140
They would go like,
no,
I don't like the sentence.

326
00:20:53.141 --> 00:20:55.060
Maybe you should make it this way.
Or you know,

327
00:20:55.061 --> 00:20:57.940
he is a bit of research that proves what you're talking about or a bit of

328
00:20:57.941 --> 00:21:00.370
research that this proves what you're talking about.

329
00:21:00.371 --> 00:21:02.890
And they would argue between them and you know,

330
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.030
which was an incredible experience.
So,

331
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.610
so I got tens of thousands of comments that made version three of the book

332
00:21:09.611 --> 00:21:13.420
really what almost written by the readers if you want.

333
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:19.740
Now you know,
when,
when you think about,
uh,
about the,
the,

334
00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:24.100
the,
the pressure that we go through,
going back to the topic of time,

335
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:28.300
the pressure that we go through with time is,
um,
you know,

336
00:21:28.301 --> 00:21:33.070
there are various views of time.
Okay.
Uh,
time.
Uh,

337
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:37.960
here in the West we are,
you know,
we are clog based,
we are a clock based culture.

338
00:21:37.961 --> 00:21:41.620
We respond to the clock,
the clock ticks and we follow.
Right.

339
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:47.040
And it's surprising when I speak to someone who is so punctual and so into that

340
00:21:47.171 --> 00:21:47.980
culture,

341
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.920
for them to know that there are other cultures around the world that are not

342
00:21:50.921 --> 00:21:54.460
like that at all,
right?
The majority of the world,
as a matter of fact,

343
00:21:54.461 --> 00:21:58.270
Latin American,
southern Europe,
Middle East,
Africa,

344
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.140
some know Indian subcontinent and so on,
our events based,

345
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:07.090
they would prioritize the value of the event higher than the value of time.

346
00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:11.170
So if we're having a good conversation and someone says,
ops times up,

347
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:15.460
right in Latin America,
or they will say,
hey,
that's okay,

348
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.860
we can take 10 more minutes on this.
It's,
it's worse.

349
00:22:17.861 --> 00:22:22.480
Why that's not the case here.
And so that kind of knowledge of what time is,

350
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.790
allows you to think about it slightly differently.

351
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:30.300
But the deeper knowledge really is when you start to realize how time itself,

352
00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:34.480
from a physics point of view,
what it is,
right?

353
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:38.100
No one really knows what time is.
As a matter of fact,
uh,

354
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.780
we know how to measure it and what,
what we measured,

355
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.710
we don't really measure time.
What we measure is we measure mechanical movements.

356
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.850
If you want that are sort of associated with times,
you know,
whether that's,

357
00:22:48.851 --> 00:22:51.570
you know,
the rising of the sun or the more,
you know,
the,

358
00:22:51.571 --> 00:22:56.560
the change of the seasons or you know,
the very,
very highly accurate,
uh,
you know,

359
00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:00.880
um,
atomic clocks,
you know,
which measured the oscillations of certain items.

360
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.433
Um,

361
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.560
but what we're measuring truly is something that is unknown.

362
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.390
Okay.
As a matter of fact,
if you understand,

363
00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.500
if you understand Einstein's view of relativity,
we,
you know,

364
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.400
what we live in is not a three dimensional space.

365
00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:23.500
We live in a four dimensional space,
one of which is the Arrow of time.
The only,

366
00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:28.120
the only difference between our ability ability to move in space and our ability

367
00:23:28.121 --> 00:23:31.060
to move in time is that we're governed by the Arrow of time,

368
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.680
which basically means that the entire universe with you,

369
00:23:34.681 --> 00:23:38.320
and it is propelled from second to second across the Arrow of time where,

370
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:38.950
you know,

371
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:43.950
he imagines it as a loaf of bread where you cut through the loaf of space time

372
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.130
and every instance is the entire universe at a specific instance in time.

373
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.980
It goes a lot more bizarre when you understand the time is so relative that it

374
00:23:54.981 --> 00:23:58.400
changes for you and for me.
Not only that,
you know,

375
00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:00.320
if what I'm talking about is boring for you,

376
00:24:00.321 --> 00:24:04.500
you feel that the time is moving slower,
but truly,
if you're a,
you know,

377
00:24:04.501 --> 00:24:08.360
an on top of Bosh Khalifa,
the highest tower in the world time,
we'll tick slower,

378
00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.440
uh,
for you.
Uh,
sorry,
we'll take faster for you than if you were at the bottom of,

379
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:16.310
of,
of butch.
Halifa.
If you're moving fast,
time will move differently.

380
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.760
And so time truly is an illusion.

381
00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:24.410
The only truth about time is this second,
I mean this second,

382
00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:29.780
no,
this second,
right?
That's how it is.
Okay.
Yet most of us,

383
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.960
especially the professional thinkers we live in the second that will happen in

384
00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:38.960
two and a half hours from now.
And we think about that and we,
you know,

385
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:43.160
then we shift back to the second that happened two and a half hours ago when you

386
00:24:43.161 --> 00:24:46.970
were,
you know,
coming to work in a taxi and someone was rude to you,
right?

387
00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.990
We are either in regret or in worry all the time.
While the truth is,

388
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:55.510
this is all you will ever experience.
Now what I do is in,

389
00:24:55.511 --> 00:25:00.020
in solve for happy is I don't tell you that mindfulness works for you,

390
00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:04.460
okay?
Because mindfulness does work.
Presence does work.
Awareness does work.

391
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:08.000
This is science.
That's as ancient as humanity itself,

392
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.480
but now you know why.
Now you understand.

393
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:17.080
Why is it that living in any other moments other than the present moment truly

394
00:25:17.241 --> 00:25:18.530
is just living inside your head.

395
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:23.330
Because those moments will never exist until you lived them and have never

396
00:25:23.331 --> 00:25:25.310
existed until you were in them.

397
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.460
And moment in the past truly was a moment of now.
Yeah.

398
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:34.730
Now as we go through this with,
you know,
Modern Day warriors as,

399
00:25:34.731 --> 00:25:37.880
as I say,
people who are engaged in the real world,

400
00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.610
suddenly you understand why presence is important,

401
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.000
but you don't need to do it in the meditation room anymore,
okay?

402
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:46.820
You can do it everywhere.
You can pay attention to a presentation,

403
00:25:46.821 --> 00:25:48.650
you can pay attention to,
you know,

404
00:25:48.651 --> 00:25:52.280
the trees that are around you are around you and you're stuck in traffic instead

405
00:25:52.281 --> 00:25:55.730
of just living inside your head,
cursing the day you lived in that city.

406
00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:01.970
Okay.
So speaking of living in fighter had one of the trickiest delusions is the

407
00:26:01.971 --> 00:26:04.890
illusion of thought.
Yeah.
What do you mean by that?

408
00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:10.500
I think the fundamental,
uh,
um,
um,

409
00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:13.310
premise I'm,
I build,
sought for happy on is that

410
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.530
emotions are the results of your thoughts,
right?

411
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:23.770
And every thought that you have in inside your head is a thought that you would

412
00:26:23.931 --> 00:26:26.840
associate a lot more with if you thought that,

413
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:31.820
if you believed that the person thinking inside your head is you right?

414
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.200
Of course,
you know,

415
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.890
spirituality will tell you the person inside your head is not you.
Okay.

416
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.850
There are so many terminologies for it.
Uh,
you know,
I,
you know,

417
00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.050
some religious beliefs will believe that it's,
you know,

418
00:26:44.051 --> 00:26:48.270
at the devil and an angel who have their conference room inside your head.

419
00:26:48.271 --> 00:26:51.300
You know,
they have chatting all the time.
One of them is telling you to go right.

420
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.140
And the other is telling you to go wrong.
Right?
Uh,
you know,

421
00:26:55.141 --> 00:26:57.800
others will say our quarterly for example,
you know,

422
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:02.550
which definitely is one of my teachers cause it the thinker.

423
00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:04.010
Uh,
you know,

424
00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:09.270
there are lots of ways to associate with sought as if thought is not you.

425
00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:09.930
Okay.

426
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:14.930
Even though the modern Western belief is I think therefore I am now in software

427
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:15.661
happy.

428
00:27:15.661 --> 00:27:20.430
I basically provide very concrete scientific evidence.

429
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:24.240
That's the thoughts in your head are just a biological function.

430
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.120
Just like you know,
you breathe,

431
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:31.010
your lungs are tasked with the uh,
you know,
uh,

432
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:36.170
important survival task of taking oxygen into your blood and taking co two out

433
00:27:36.661 --> 00:27:41.220
of your blood.
Uh,
you know,
your,
your brain is,
you know,

434
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:45.530
it's tasked with the idea of providing you a,
and you know,

435
00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.930
comprehension of the real world in the only building blocks.
You know,

436
00:27:48.931 --> 00:27:52.530
how to understand after you've learned words,
words,
right?
So once,

437
00:27:52.531 --> 00:27:56.910
once we start to comprehend the word word,
word around us in the form of words,

438
00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.780
you need to start company.
You know,
continuing to look at the world this way,

439
00:28:00.781 --> 00:28:04.140
you cannot observe the world silently and make a decision.
Unfortunate,

440
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:09.090
unfortunately your brain is constantly translating that into language,
right?

441
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:13.350
And so that voice inside your head,
you know,
books like thinking fast and slow,

442
00:28:13.351 --> 00:28:17.220
we'll tell you a lot about how that voice,
the conversation,

443
00:28:17.221 --> 00:28:21.150
the almost the conflict inside your head is,
you know,

444
00:28:21.151 --> 00:28:25.380
basically different sides of your brain trying to make sense of the word right.

445
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:30.350
Uh,
once you start to realize that,
um,
um,

446
00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:35.020
that sought is not you thought is just a biological function.
And I,
I,

447
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.920
I'm sorry to use bad English here,
but you know,

448
00:28:37.921 --> 00:28:41.370
I always take the example of saying your colon is uh,

449
00:28:41.371 --> 00:28:45.690
is responsible for creating crap and you know,

450
00:28:45.691 --> 00:28:50.040
your head is sometimes responsible for creating more crap.
And,
and if you,

451
00:28:50.041 --> 00:28:53.280
if you start to see it that way or you suddenly tried to tell you if it started,

452
00:28:53.281 --> 00:28:58.110
suddenly realize that you,
one,
you don't always have to obey by the way,

453
00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:02.520
because your brain's function as a biological function here is to present you

454
00:29:02.521 --> 00:29:06.660
with as many ideas as possible,
right?
It's up to you to choose.
Right?

455
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.680
And tool is you don't have to associate.
So if you,

456
00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:14.970
if you get a a thought that that's a little,
uh,
you know,
crazy,

457
00:29:14.971 --> 00:29:16.230
that doesn't mean you're crazy.

458
00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:20.040
I'm telling you actually put that thought into action.

459
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:24.300
It's just a thought presented to you can tell your brain,
hey,
thanks brain.

460
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.000
Thank you very much.
I realize by the way,
that you're not me.

461
00:29:27.001 --> 00:29:30.600
I realize you're doing your biological function very well.
Uh,

462
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:33.900
thanks for presenting this idea.
Can you bring me a better idea?
Right.

463
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.870
And I know I'm,
I make that sound easy.

464
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.210
And of course there are tons of techniques that I discuss around how you can

465
00:29:39.211 --> 00:29:40.530
make that a common practice.

466
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:45.580
But it's so interesting when you start to see the world from the perspective of

467
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.900
it's not,
I think therefore I am.
It's I am.
Therefore,

468
00:29:49.901 --> 00:29:54.850
I think it's almost an,
it's,
it's,
it's,
I am,
therefore my brain thinks right?

469
00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:56.440
If you make that separation,
your,

470
00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:00.100
your view of the world will never be the same again.
Okay.

471
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:05.170
And so this relates a little bit to control and you are admitted,
Lee,

472
00:30:05.171 --> 00:30:07.180
a retired control freak.

473
00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:12.310
What have you learned about control and the illusion of control?
Yeah,

474
00:30:12.311 --> 00:30:17.040
I apologize for everyone that I tried to control in my life before.
Um,

475
00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.800
I mean don't laugh.
I'm,
I know you're doing it yourself.
So,
uh,

476
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:25.270
we try to control everything in our life,
right?
We believe that,

477
00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:30.460
uh,
you know,
it's almost our function again,
by the way,
this is the expanded,

478
00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:34.030
uh,
um,
um,
functionality of your brain.

479
00:30:34.031 --> 00:30:38.770
The reason why our species survived is not only did we manage to coordinate the

480
00:30:38.771 --> 00:30:41.770
events of the world and run from the tiger when the tiger showed up,

481
00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.860
but we actually managed to plan ahead and say,
hey,

482
00:30:44.861 --> 00:30:48.400
if we go down that path or do we go into that cave that will be a tiger there.

483
00:30:48.401 --> 00:30:50.860
It's not very wise to do this.
We,

484
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.410
there are no more tigers in our cities,

485
00:30:53.411 --> 00:30:57.850
but we continue to plan and control obsessively.
Right?
Uh,
and,

486
00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:02.710
and the funny bit is that we actually somehow managed to convince ourselves that

487
00:31:02.711 --> 00:31:04.930
we have control.
And you know,

488
00:31:04.931 --> 00:31:09.910
one of the exercises I do in the training as Google is I basically allow you to

489
00:31:09.911 --> 00:31:14.800
measure how often things go out of control.
And I get an answer between the,

490
00:31:14.801 --> 00:31:19.330
that falls somewhere between very frequently and all the time,
right?
Uh,

491
00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:21.460
all right.
And,
and of course you can tell yourself,

492
00:31:21.461 --> 00:31:25.560
but I bring it back in control and then you start to think and ask yourself and

493
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:30.280
how much effort exactly did you put into this?
Was it really worth it to control,

494
00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:34.480
you know,
the uh,
um,
arrive the temperature of the coffee.

495
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:36.790
I told you that example about,
you know,

496
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:41.050
can we control the coffee machine so that it fills in a huff announced small so

497
00:31:41.051 --> 00:31:42.160
that it's closer to the top,

498
00:31:42.161 --> 00:31:46.300
to the top so that we have more efficiency for our employees so that they are a

499
00:31:46.301 --> 00:31:49.600
little more awake through one cup of coffee.
Right.
It's crazy really,

500
00:31:49.601 --> 00:31:53.500
when you start to think about all of the things we try to control.
Now,

501
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:58.540
Nassim Taleb in his incredible book,
the Black Swan,
uh,

502
00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:03.570
talks about those massive events that are so they're in their occurrence that

503
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.710
when,
when they occurred,

504
00:32:06.711 --> 00:32:09.740
they would be compared to spotting a black swan instead of all of the white

505
00:32:09.741 --> 00:32:14.740
swans we know,
but that when they occur,
they so drastically change the world,

506
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.960
you know,
Google being one of them by the way,
you know,
so,

507
00:32:16.961 --> 00:32:19.800
so no one expected Google to happen.
And when Google happened,

508
00:32:19.801 --> 00:32:24.190
it completely democratized our approach to inflammation.
World War One is a,

509
00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:28.840
is another one that he,
that he cites,
um,
and,
and every one of us,

510
00:32:28.841 --> 00:32:33.250
not only at the macro level of our economies and politics and what have you,

511
00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:37.540
but even though,
you know,
in our normal personal lives,
we have black swans,

512
00:32:37.541 --> 00:32:42.510
you know,
my,
my black swan was take was losing.
Golly,
okay.
Um,
and,

513
00:32:42.511 --> 00:32:47.480
and,
and on top of that,
we,
you know,
and those dual drastically change your life.

514
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:51.630
But the ones that you don't notice are even more potent if you want,
you know,
uh,

515
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.370
they call them butterfly effects and butterfly effect,
I'm sure you all know is,

516
00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:00.410
are those,
you know,
uh,
when,
when,
when you're doing weather forecasts,

517
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.890
they say that,
um,

518
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:07.090
wind speed changes that are so small that they could be comparable to a

519
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.880
butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil,

520
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:15.140
could cause a hurricane or a sunny day in Florida,
right?

521
00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:20.210
And Butterfly Effects Happen every single second of your life.

522
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:24.440
So many of them,
as a matter of fact,
right?
You,
you came here today,

523
00:33:24.441 --> 00:33:28.250
you sat on a yellow chair,
not a red chair or you came here.
I don't know.

524
00:33:28.251 --> 00:33:31.400
I don't want to disappoint the ones that came a little late,

525
00:33:31.401 --> 00:33:35.840
but you came a little early.
Uh,
you got to,
you know,
your copy of the book,
right?

526
00:33:35.841 --> 00:33:39.530
You came a little late,
you didn't get your copy of the Vulcan.
So,
you know,
not,

527
00:33:39.531 --> 00:33:41.660
it's not only about saving the price of the book,

528
00:33:41.661 --> 00:33:45.020
but maybe you read the book today and it will affect you tomorrow and so on and

529
00:33:45.021 --> 00:33:48.830
so forth.
Right?
Uh,
and so,
and so,
you know,

530
00:33:48.831 --> 00:33:52.580
butterfly effects are endless.
My Butterfly effects are,
you know,

531
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:57.480
whatever it is that Allie has eaten maybe two weeks earlier,
uh,
you know,

532
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.620
that caused his him appendix to be inflamed or you know,

533
00:34:00.621 --> 00:34:03.770
the proximity of our home to that specific hospital.

534
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.690
Maybe if we had chosen a different home,

535
00:34:05.691 --> 00:34:09.800
we would have gone to a different hospital and this was a choice we made years

536
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:13.520
earlier.
Now,
between the two of those,
you realize that you have zero control.

537
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:16.370
Nothing.
There is nothing that you have control over,

538
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:19.670
but has other than two things,
and I discussed those heavily in the book,

539
00:34:19.671 --> 00:34:24.470
I discuss that the only things you can have control over are your actions,

540
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:28.090
not the results of your actions and your attitude,
right?

541
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.860
Your attitude truly is the game changer.
You know,
if you,

542
00:34:30.861 --> 00:34:35.000
if you wake up in the morning and expect today to be a horrible day because

543
00:34:35.001 --> 00:34:37.070
maybe it's raining or whatever,
you know what,

544
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:41.120
it's going to end up being a horrible day.
And at the end of the day,

545
00:34:41.121 --> 00:34:44.450
you're going to tell yourself,
oh,
I told you it was going to be horrible.

546
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.800
You know,
I'm the article.
I know everything.
You know,
just because a train,

547
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:53.210
no,
it ended up being horrible because you wanted it to be a horrible,

548
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:57.230
you spotted everything that was horrible and you acted horrible,
right?

549
00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.290
And then you're going to blame the rain.
Now,

550
00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:04.760
there is a lot of costs for unhappiness when we,
uh,

551
00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:09.260
when we try to control further than our actions and our attitude,
uh,
you know,

552
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:13.990
some of the most profound spiritual beliefs,
you know,
in Hinduism,

553
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.410
for example,
the concept of detachment,
uh,
of,
you know,

554
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:22.450
I'm going to do the absolute best I can and whatever the result is not entirely

555
00:35:23.481 --> 00:35:23.871
up to me.

556
00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:28.871
It's up to me and a few black swans and a million butterflies.

557
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.630
And by the way,
7.2 other,
uh,

558
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:37.750
billion human beings who also have their own view of world and maybe trillions

559
00:35:38.371 --> 00:35:39.660
of other Bx,
right?

560
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:44.730
All of that comes together to create what might be your reality and it will

561
00:35:44.731 --> 00:35:46.110
always be outside your control.

562
00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:50.350
<v 2>So the last thing that I want to,
um,</v>

563
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.300
ask before I open it up for audience questions is about the concept of good

564
00:35:54.301 --> 00:35:58.940
versus bad and our desires.
Humans to constantly label things as good for a spot.

565
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:02.700
You lost your son.
I've lost my brother at immediately felt like,
oh,

566
00:36:02.701 --> 00:36:06.810
this is such a bad,
bad thing.
Um,
can you talk a little bit about your,

567
00:36:06.811 --> 00:36:09.180
your take on that and committed acceptance?

568
00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.440
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
so,
so the,
the,
the,</v>

569
00:36:13.441 --> 00:36:17.140
the illusion that drives us to believe that something is good in some things
bad.

570
00:36:17.141 --> 00:36:19.840
You know,
the fundamental illusion is what I call the illusion of knowledge.

571
00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:24.230
And I think you Google is no that much,
much better than I do.
I actually,
uh,

572
00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:29.170
I sort of understood the illusion of knowledge when I came to Google because I

573
00:36:29.171 --> 00:36:30.670
came to Google from Microsoft.

574
00:36:30.671 --> 00:36:33.550
I was a senior executive who worked in technology for years.

575
00:36:33.551 --> 00:36:37.520
I thought I knew it all right.
I thought I had nothing more to learn.

576
00:36:37.521 --> 00:36:41.380
And I came here in this place,
completely opened my eyes and you know how it is,

577
00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:42.340
right?
You know,

578
00:36:42.341 --> 00:36:47.020
and I joined in 2007 and I would be in a meeting room and the youngest person in

579
00:36:47.021 --> 00:36:49.990
the room who may have started two weeks ago,
we'll say,
Mo,

580
00:36:49.991 --> 00:36:52.660
I think you're an idiot.
And I'm like,
okay,
um,

581
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:56.890
can you tell me a little bit more about that?
You know,
like why?

582
00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:01.720
And he would give me data and information that actually changes my point of
view.

583
00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:04.630
And often a couple,
a few weeks later,

584
00:37:04.631 --> 00:37:08.100
we would realize that he too was wrong and that we missed something else.
Right.

585
00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:12.460
And if you actually look at our entire scientific history,

586
00:37:12.461 --> 00:37:16.720
there is that cycle I call it,
which is basically discovery,

587
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:21.160
debate,
acceptance and arrogance.
Every everything we go through in,

588
00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.760
in our science,
you know,
background is,
you know,
we discover something.

589
00:37:24.761 --> 00:37:28.610
Everyone argues it and says,
oh,
you're absolutely crazy.
The earth is flat.
You,

590
00:37:28.611 --> 00:37:31.420
you know,
this whole earth is round thing.
You're crazy,
right?

591
00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:35.920
And then there is enough evidence provided.
And then we go like,
okay,

592
00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:38.590
let's accept that the earth is round,

593
00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:41.560
but it's the center of the heavenly universe.
Right?

594
00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:45.910
And then we are arrogant about that new knowledge and then someone else comes

595
00:37:45.911 --> 00:37:49.720
and says,
Hey,
by the way,
we might be the one revolving around the sun.

596
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:52.990
As a matter of fact,
it seems that this is what it is,
a new discovery.

597
00:37:52.991 --> 00:37:57.820
And so we debate,
right.
And that cycle continues.
Right?
We don't really know.

598
00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:01.840
And when it,
when it comes to knowledge,
I think the most

599
00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:07.180
eye opening part of knowledge for me it was that whole concept of labeling

600
00:38:07.181 --> 00:38:10.540
something good and labeling another thing bad.
Okay.

601
00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:13.180
I'm not saying right and wrong by the way.
Mortality is different,

602
00:38:13.181 --> 00:38:18.100
but good and bad is,
you know,
I wish this did not happen because it's,

603
00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:22.030
you know,
contradicts my expectations from life.
This is bad.
Okay.

604
00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:27.810
And how often do you recall parts of your own life when something that appeared

605
00:38:27.981 --> 00:38:29.050
the bad,
when it happened,

606
00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.570
it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to you.

607
00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:37.140
As a matter of fact,
quite often,
most of the profound,
you know,

608
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:41.980
fundamental changes that really made you who you are start to lose something

609
00:38:41.981 --> 00:38:44.830
that you labeled as bad.
Okay.
And,

610
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:49.920
and somehow when we label it as bad first we curse life for a few years and then

611
00:38:51.791 --> 00:38:56.110
we go like,
wow,
that was nice.
Um,
I'm okay with that now.
Right?

612
00:38:56.590 --> 00:39:00.580
And of course I refer to a,
an interesting test.

613
00:39:00.581 --> 00:39:04.930
I call the eraser test and I ask the readers to go back and,
and really,

614
00:39:04.931 --> 00:39:09.931
really dig through the events of their life and see which of them would they

615
00:39:10.571 --> 00:39:11.830
really erase.
I mean,

616
00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:16.020
of course there may be one or two that you may still erase that you really,

617
00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.520
that were so bad to you for,
for your life.

618
00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:23.170
But most of the events that were bad that you considered bad at at that point in

619
00:39:23.171 --> 00:39:27.220
the past become good overtime and you would not erase them.

620
00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.440
You would actually look back at them and say,

621
00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:32.950
these were the most important things that happened to me.
More importantly,

622
00:39:32.951 --> 00:39:35.110
of course.
And in an interesting way,

623
00:39:35.111 --> 00:39:40.030
a bit contradictory to the western individualistic view of the world.
Uh,

624
00:39:40.031 --> 00:39:41.030
you know,
the,
the,

625
00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:45.430
the idea of what's good for me is bad for you and what's bad for you is good for

626
00:39:45.431 --> 00:39:48.640
me or what's bad for me?
It's good for you.
Right?
So,
so,

627
00:39:48.641 --> 00:39:53.590
so the whole idea of if we really look at the world much more or the universe

628
00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:58.540
much more as oneness as we're into the,
we're in this together,
okay.

629
00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:01.420
That if we all succeed,
we succeed together,

630
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.210
then there is really nothing that's good or bad.
I mean,

631
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:09.250
I cite the example of how Allie was,
um,
uh,

632
00:40:09.251 --> 00:40:12.070
you know,
idea when he went to the hospital,
he,
eh,

633
00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:16.120
he was fasting for the month of Ramadan.
And so the doctors basically said,
hey,

634
00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:20.270
he might as well continue fasting until,
uh,
the operation because you know,

635
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:24.580
of the anesthesia and all of that.
And so by the time it left our worlds,

636
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:29.320
he was thirsty for almost 24 hours.
And,
you know,

637
00:40:29.321 --> 00:40:33.010
on top of all of the pain I was going through,
that completely pained me.

638
00:40:33.011 --> 00:40:37.780
It completely hurt me that my son had to suffer for 24 hours before,

639
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:43.230
uh,
before he,
uh,
he,
he had to leave us.
And,
and so,
you know what,

640
00:40:43.231 --> 00:40:47.200
what I did sitting outside the ICU is I made a promise that,
you know,

641
00:40:47.201 --> 00:40:51.580
I'm going to try and do something for the people that actually suffer this every

642
00:40:51.581 --> 00:40:52.414
single day.
There are,

643
00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:57.010
there are more than 780 million people around the world who do not have access

644
00:40:57.011 --> 00:40:59.090
to clean water at all,
right?

645
00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.100
So they suffer what I suffered once in his life everyday of their life.

646
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.510
And so,
so,
so basically when you think about it,

647
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:13.060
what happened to Allie was bad for Allie.
Horrible for me.
Okay?

648
00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:16.780
But it might have been good for a few thousand people or tens of thousands of

649
00:41:16.781 --> 00:41:21.460
people that got some blessing of getting some clean water as a result of that

650
00:41:21.461 --> 00:41:24.580
event.
So can you mark it good or bad?
As a matter of fact,

651
00:41:24.581 --> 00:41:26.620
if I went back to Ireland now and I said,
Allie,

652
00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:30.160
would you fast 24 hours for tens of thousands of people to get water?

653
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:34.070
Would say absolutely.
That would be a good thing to do,
right?

654
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:38.390
So our perception of good and bad constantly puts us in a coordinator where we

655
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.070
are so unhappy with life.

656
00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:45.020
So let me just say a bit of a six year old year old attitude,
right?
It's like,

657
00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:49.280
do your homework or eat your vegetables.
Now it's bad.
I don't like my vegetables.

658
00:41:49.281 --> 00:41:52.910
Right?
Come on man.
Seriously,
you're going to need them when you're my age.

659
00:41:52.911 --> 00:41:56.330
So you know,
just go for it and life will go on.
Right?

660
00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:01.660
And so sometimes I wish we look at life a little more holistically and,

661
00:42:01.661 --> 00:42:04.400
and realize that nothing truly is good or bad.
I mean,

662
00:42:04.401 --> 00:42:06.620
check Shakespeare says that nothing's good or bad,

663
00:42:06.621 --> 00:42:09.600
but thinking is what makes it so,
yeah.

664
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:13.520
<v 2>Okay.
Last question is how you came up with this target.</v>

665
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:16.250
You talk a lot about thinking 10 x and you know,

666
00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:18.530
setting targets being really important.
What is your target?

667
00:42:18.531 --> 00:42:19.580
What does success look like?

668
00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:24.450
<v 0>My,
my uh,
yeah,
I'm,
I mean,
I'm supposed to be talking about happiness,</v>

669
00:42:24.451 --> 00:42:28.800
but I still do that as a businessman.
Like I set my cell phone an Okr,
right?

670
00:42:28.801 --> 00:42:31.620
So my,
my,
you know,
I have to say,

671
00:42:31.621 --> 00:42:34.980
I don't know if I came up with the target toward the target came up with me to

672
00:42:34.981 --> 00:42:39.450
be honest.
But,
uh,
there was a point in a,
you know,
as I started to discuss,

673
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:42.900
especially during the process of the early readers,
uh,
you know,

674
00:42:42.901 --> 00:42:46.260
review of the book where I started to realize that the message was actually

675
00:42:46.261 --> 00:42:50.370
working.
Uh,
and you know,
in,
in conversations with my publishers,

676
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.400
they were talking about,
you know,
the reach of books and so on and so forth.

677
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:54.570
And I said,
well,

678
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:58.500
maybe I should set myself a target so that we at least can measure and move

679
00:42:58.501 --> 00:43:03.020
forward.
And I gave myself a target of trying,
you know,
I call it 10 million,

680
00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:04.590
10 million happy.
So I,

681
00:43:04.591 --> 00:43:07.740
I'm trying to reach 10 million people with this message of happiness.

682
00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:11.850
Hopefully to get 10 million people to Click on the counter on my website and
say,

683
00:43:11.851 --> 00:43:16.830
yes,
you made me happy right.
Now,
of course,
you can imagine as a,
as a businessman,

684
00:43:16.831 --> 00:43:20.640
that's cheating because if I actually do get 10 million people and they do go

685
00:43:20.641 --> 00:43:22.320
out and tell two of two friends,

686
00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.810
then hopefully through six degrees of separation,

687
00:43:24.811 --> 00:43:29.490
we can get to hundreds of millions or maybe a billion.
I don't know.

688
00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:33.090
Right.
But,
but,
but to me,
I felt that,
you know,

689
00:43:33.091 --> 00:43:37.200
what would be a better way to honor Ali?
I mean,
and I,

690
00:43:37.201 --> 00:43:41.070
and I'd say selfishly,
I don't think it brings him back.
I don't think it's,

691
00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.170
it takes away the pain,

692
00:43:43.171 --> 00:43:48.171
but at least it somehow makes it feel a little better.

693
00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.010
Okay.
I,
I'm sure,

694
00:43:50.011 --> 00:43:53.140
I'm sure at least that it somehow would make him proud of me and,

695
00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:57.030
and I think that definitely has been driving my life for the last two and a half

696
00:43:57.031 --> 00:43:59.610
years.
I think that to be true.

697
00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:03.440
<v 2>Yup.
All right.
Let's go ahead and open it up for audience questions.</v>

698
00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:04.531
<v 0>Uh,
so you,</v>

699
00:44:04.531 --> 00:44:07.450
you were talking about how the brain produces a lot of different thoughts,

700
00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.140
you know,
that are related to what,
what we're perceiving.
And I'm curious if you,

701
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:12.040
uh,

702
00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:16.570
believe in freewill and how that sort of affects your whole outlook on life.

703
00:44:16.571 --> 00:44:20.530
And then the second question is,
it is,
is if you think freewill even matters,

704
00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:24.880
you know,
to what you're,
uh,
you're trying to talk to venture to happiness.

705
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:26.021
Okay.

706
00:44:26.021 --> 00:44:31.020
So first let's talk about salt and then talk to talk about three ways.
So,

707
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:36.150
so there are two,
there are three types of thoughts right there is that,

708
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:39.360
that chatter,
that incessant thought that happens,

709
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.120
someone somewhere in the midline,
areas of our brains.

710
00:44:42.121 --> 00:44:47.121
This is googleable by Mri where it's the constant useless thinking.

711
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:51.540
It's like,
you know,
the taxi driver was rude to me.
Oh my God,
he was rude to me.

712
00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:52.740
Life shouldn't be this way.
You know,

713
00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:55.290
I should kill myself on why can I live in America anymore?

714
00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:58.350
If the taxi drivers are rude and so on and so forth,
and you don't,
you don't,

715
00:44:58.351 --> 00:44:59.820
you never turn that into action.

716
00:44:59.821 --> 00:45:03.670
You just turn your life into misery because of it.
And,
and as I,
you know,

717
00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:08.200
as I say,
some of us would take days off thinking about an event like that.
Uh,

718
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:13.260
but this is usually start the useful thought happens on the right hand side in

719
00:45:13.261 --> 00:45:18.190
the insula.
So there are two types of,
of,
of useful thoughts.
One is the uh,

720
00:45:18.191 --> 00:45:22.140
insightful thinking where you solve a problem.
Okay.
So you know,

721
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:27.150
you,
you,
you can worry about an exam,
uh,
that you are,

722
00:45:27.151 --> 00:45:30.270
or a presentation that you have tomorrow and it would happen in the incessant

723
00:45:30.271 --> 00:45:34.320
thought space,
but you can move it to the,
uh,
you know,
to the,

724
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:37.020
to the right hand side of your brain and turn that into,

725
00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:39.960
let's put the presentation together.

726
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:43.020
Let's work on what the messages are going to be.

727
00:45:43.021 --> 00:45:45.000
You're actually practically working through that.

728
00:45:45.001 --> 00:45:47.940
And it happens in two areas of the right hand side of your brain.

729
00:45:47.941 --> 00:45:52.380
Or you can actually focus on the experience of preparing a presentation.

730
00:45:52.381 --> 00:45:54.960
Look at the colors of it,
reviewing it and so on.

731
00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.830
Also happens in the right hand side of the brain and in your insula.
So,
so those,

732
00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:03.270
those are useful thoughts,
thoughts are good for you.
Now those thoughts,

733
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:07.380
insightful specifically,
we'll make you,
we'll,
we'll lead you to make choices.

734
00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:08.970
Okay.
Now the,

735
00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:12.540
the whole conversation around ThreeWill is actually quite interesting and

736
00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:16.140
definitely one of the reasons that we sometimes debate freewill is the whole

737
00:46:16.141 --> 00:46:20.580
idea of space time that all of space and all of time has already exists right

738
00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:25.410
now.
The interesting side of,
of freewill.
And believe it or not,

739
00:46:25.411 --> 00:46:28.230
it's actually one of the ideas of what I'm writing next.

740
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.990
I have a three ideas I'm working on.
One of them is,
uh,
is,

741
00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.390
is what I call an understanding fate.
And,

742
00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:39.480
and the concept of freewill basically is that you did make a choice on which,

743
00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.570
which tee shirt you,

744
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:46.230
you chose to wear today you had a choice of blue or black and you make a choice

745
00:46:46.231 --> 00:46:49.050
of blue.
And I call those micro choices.
Okay.

746
00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:53.070
And I then I tend to believe that your fate,
that the,
the,
the,
the,

747
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:57.820
the destination of your final fate is going to be,
uh,
uh,

748
00:46:57.970 --> 00:47:02.280
the sum of three free is one of them is your micro choice.

749
00:47:02.281 --> 00:47:06.540
That's your own freewill plus the freewill of all of the other beings.

750
00:47:06.541 --> 00:47:10.830
Because you know what,
maybe the laundry guy did not bring back the,
uh,
you know,

751
00:47:10.831 --> 00:47:13.890
the black tee shirts.
So you really did not have that choice at all.

752
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.190
And then the third would be,
uh,
the free will of the universe.

753
00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:21.300
If we tend to believe that the universe is following certain equations and

754
00:47:21.301 --> 00:47:23.430
functions,
maybe,
you know,

755
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:27.860
there could be an earthquake in the morning that leads you to rush and take her

756
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:32.440
one tee shirt other than instead of the other.
So do we have freewill?

757
00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:37.360
I tend to believe we have the will to make our micro choices.
Okay.

758
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:38.500
As a matter of fact,

759
00:47:38.501 --> 00:47:42.400
I tend to believe that we have the will to impact on the universe is choices and

760
00:47:42.401 --> 00:47:45.310
definitely on the choices of others.
Okay.
Uh,

761
00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:47.770
and much more importantly in my view,

762
00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:51.580
I believe that we have the will to impact on our thoughts.

763
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:56.590
And that truly is the core of salt for happy that we have the choice.
I mean,

764
00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:57.561
I you,

765
00:47:57.561 --> 00:48:02.561
you chose to sit in this room and focus on my words for the last 45 minutes,

766
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:07.210
right?
Uh,
we,
we can control what our brain does.

767
00:48:07.211 --> 00:48:10.480
You can tell your brain to do something and it will do it.
As a matter of fact,

768
00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:13.900
you've never told your brain to do something.
And it said,
hey,
you know what?

769
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:18.010
I'm really not interested to raise my right arm now.
So No,
no brain series new,

770
00:48:18.011 --> 00:48:21.770
we want the right arm.
And No,
you know,
um,
it,
it,

771
00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:24.950
it raises the right arm.
You'll tell it,
raise the right arm it goes to,

772
00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:29.560
so I'll do what you tell me.
Yet,
when suffering starts to happen,

773
00:48:29.561 --> 00:48:31.300
when the incessant thoughts starts to happen,

774
00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:36.310
somehow we let the brain be the boss.
Somehow we tell it,
hey,
you know what?
Yes,

775
00:48:36.311 --> 00:48:41.190
you can take me to misery.
I will just follow,
right?
As I told you,
you know,
I,

776
00:48:41.191 --> 00:48:45.430
I could have had the choice of letting my brain telling,
telling me things like,

777
00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:49.300
you drove alley there,
you chose the wrong hospital,
you,
you know,

778
00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:52.690
did this or you did that.
Or I could tell my brain,
you know,
what brain,

779
00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:57.550
let's move this to use for thinking and try to do the best out of the situation

780
00:48:57.551 --> 00:49:01.120
we have.
Maybe if we can get 10 million people to be happy,

781
00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:06.160
it will smile upon you.
Right.
So it's a choice and that's in my view,

782
00:49:06.161 --> 00:49:07.540
the biggest part of your freewill.

783
00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:12.220
What about when you're thinking in a dream state?
Yeah.

784
00:49:12.221 --> 00:49:16.600
I'm not qualified to answer dreams yet.
Again,
surprisingly.

785
00:49:16.601 --> 00:49:20.110
You guys are catchy touching on interesting topics that I'm researching at the

786
00:49:20.111 --> 00:49:24.820
moment.
I'm uh,
I don't know.
I th I think that,

787
00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:25.510
um,

788
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:30.070
the dreams are a very interesting indication of something I call the illusion of

789
00:49:30.071 --> 00:49:34.510
self.
That we do exist in forms that go beyond the physical form.

790
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:38.320
Uh,
exactly how that salt happens.

791
00:49:38.321 --> 00:49:43.270
I haven't dedicated enough research for this.
Okay.
Can I,
can I just,

792
00:49:43.271 --> 00:49:47.620
before you ask the next question,
however,
understand this.

793
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:51.220
Sometimes when a,
when a bad dream happens,

794
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:57.130
we go like,
okay,
events missed my expectations and we feel bad.

795
00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:03.130
Surprisingly,
even though there were no events.
Okay.
So it was just a dream,
right?

796
00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:06.970
<v 3>Thanks for talking.
As you know,
Google,</v>

797
00:50:06.971 --> 00:50:11.971
we're now going through purpose season and if I write in my perf results,

798
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.670
well knowledge is an illusion.
Control's an illusion.

799
00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:19.210
I don't actually know or did anything.
And if I'm,

800
00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:23.830
I go into the kind of how can I improve next quarter or next cycle?

801
00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:27.740
And I go,
time is an illusion.
It's a,
it's not predictable.

802
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.420
It seems very kind of contradictory to a successful career at Google.

803
00:50:32.421 --> 00:50:36.410
So how do you reconcile these two seemingly contradictory viewpoints?

804
00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:39.920
<v 0>So,
so I,
I should start by saying I've had a very good career,</v>

805
00:50:39.921 --> 00:50:43.190
so it seems that this,
this stuff works,
right?
Uh,

806
00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.800
but let's put it this way.
Um,

807
00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:50.330
there is nothing better to be successful than to acknowledge the truth.

808
00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:51.710
You understand that?
So,

809
00:50:51.711 --> 00:50:56.711
so the best of us out of those will make decisions based on truly what's going

810
00:50:56.961 --> 00:51:01.550
on,
not what we think is going on.
Now let me tell you this,
in my career,

811
00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:05.030
I will,
I will say that one of the biggest,

812
00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:10.060
biggest things that completely propelled me forward was that complete conviction

813
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:14.690
that I know nothing at all.
Okay.
That you guys know so much more than I do.

814
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:19.400
And so I would sit in meeting rooms and say,
Hey,
this is my point of view.

815
00:51:19.401 --> 00:51:23.570
But because I sit on the top of the table,
it does not mean I know more than,

816
00:51:23.571 --> 00:51:27.770
than,
you know,
as a matter of fact,
most of the time,
you know much more than I do,

817
00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:31.850
most of the time you are so close to the reality that you know much more than I

818
00:51:31.851 --> 00:51:34.760
do.
And that openness to,
I don't know,

819
00:51:34.761 --> 00:51:37.790
someone else might know or the collective wisdom of all of us.

820
00:51:37.791 --> 00:51:41.330
You remember the wisdom of the crowd was something that we built Google on top

821
00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:43.520
of them,
uh,
on top of so,
so,

822
00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:48.230
so the idea of we can get closer to the truth if we actually assume that we

823
00:51:48.231 --> 00:51:52.550
don't exactly know is not a bad thing to do in,
uh,
in Perth.

824
00:51:52.551 --> 00:51:57.350
And often when you look at your own skill set and say to yourself,
hey,

825
00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:00.740
by the way,
I don't know this,
it gives you a target to improve.

826
00:52:00.741 --> 00:52:04.130
It gives you something to start to learn and try to know.
That's one.

827
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:09.470
Control is an illusion is actually the story of my life.
Like I'm a businessman.

828
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:14.210
How often does people who you know,
may have been in my teams in the past,

829
00:52:14.211 --> 00:52:17.210
what's come to me and say,
hey mo,
by the way,
this deed is going wrong.

830
00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:21.530
This is not going the way we want it to be.
We expected it to close this way.

831
00:52:21.531 --> 00:52:23.220
It's going to close that way.
Right?

832
00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:27.530
And you could take this and panic or you could take this and simply say like,

833
00:52:27.531 --> 00:52:32.450
you know Tom Hanks in in a,
in Apollo 13 you'd say,
Houston,

834
00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:35.780
we have a problem,
right?
It's okay to have a problem.

835
00:52:35.781 --> 00:52:40.430
We really don't have much control so let's respond to it.
Let's work on it.

836
00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:44.630
And you know,
normally actually people who worked in my teams or remember that,

837
00:52:44.631 --> 00:52:49.631
I would always say your target in the absence of force majeure in the absence of

838
00:52:49.731 --> 00:52:54.680
something that completely goes out of control is this right time.

839
00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:58.670
There is,
there are two types of time.
That is what I call it,
practical time.

840
00:52:58.671 --> 00:53:02.540
I discussed that at length in the book there is practical time and there is

841
00:53:02.541 --> 00:53:03.374
brain time.

842
00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:08.860
Practical time is when I say to myself I need to be in Palo Alto by four 30

843
00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:13.820
right?
It's Friday.
So the traffic is going to be a little early.

844
00:53:13.821 --> 00:53:18.821
So you know it's going to take me 40 minutes instead of 25 minutes and I need

845
00:53:18.831 --> 00:53:22.610
five minutes to park and two minutes to walk.
So I need to plan 47 minutes.

846
00:53:22.611 --> 00:53:27.330
Let me plan 15 minutes.
There is no emotion in this.
It's practical time.
I,
I,

847
00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:29.160
I look at the world as it is.

848
00:53:29.161 --> 00:53:33.570
I design my time patterns and I deploy them and I execute,
right?

849
00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.520
There is no emotions involved.

850
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:39.300
Brain time is the stress happening.

851
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:43.260
If I'm actually going to Palo Alto and I leave 15 minutes early and there is an

852
00:53:43.261 --> 00:53:47.000
accident on the road and I sit there and I start to curse myself and of course

853
00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:49.620
my life and tell him I said myself,
oh my God,

854
00:53:49.621 --> 00:53:51.090
they're never going to meet me again.

855
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:53.790
They're never going to talk to me as a again.
As a matter of fact,

856
00:53:53.791 --> 00:53:56.040
they're probably going to tell the government and I'm never going to be allowed

857
00:53:56.041 --> 00:53:58.020
in America again,
right?
We will all,

858
00:53:58.021 --> 00:54:02.370
we all allow ourselves to go through that thinking,
but how much of it is true?

859
00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:06.840
Right?
And it's all related to that stress.
The time puts on top of you.
Okay.

860
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:12.770
If you manage to move the stress of time from your thinking back to the past

861
00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:18.210
and,
and regret thinking forward to the future and feel warm,
feeling worried,

862
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:22.740
you know,
that incessant side of your brain to the insightful side of your head.

863
00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:25.560
Make time a practical practice that you work on.

864
00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:27.960
You won't be unhappy and you will perform a lot better.

865
00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.340
How often do you get this?
100% right.

866
00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:33.620
<v 4>Okay.</v>

867
00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:38.380
<v 0>Uh,
never.
Oh yeah,
I mean cds to Yo,</v>

868
00:54:38.381 --> 00:54:43.340
what'd you up?
I'm not his holiness the Dalai Lama by the way.
Okay.
Uh,

869
00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:47.790
no,
I I,
you know,
as I,
as I started,
I uh,
as I started my presentation,
I,

870
00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:50.840
I fight in meetings.
I get stuck on the one on one,

871
00:54:50.841 --> 00:54:54.290
like everyone and occasionally I will find a,
uh,
you know,

872
00:54:54.291 --> 00:54:59.240
my self feeling unhappy.
I all I know is that um,
it's almost like software,
right?

873
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.630
You,

874
00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:03.260
you have an operating system that's running this brain and there is a few lines

875
00:55:03.261 --> 00:55:08.261
of code that every time you will run your brain will do something different than

876
00:55:08.451 --> 00:55:13.040
what's suppose to what it's,
what it normally does.
If,
if let loose.
Okay.
So,

877
00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.910
uh,
so the first few times,
you know,
I discovered my model,

878
00:55:16.911 --> 00:55:19.670
it was very hard to apply and the more I practiced,

879
00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:22.610
the more I told myself this is an illusion.
That is an illusion.

880
00:55:22.611 --> 00:55:26.450
It became a little more second nature.
Okay.
Is it all the time?

881
00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:28.310
I hope to get there someday,
you know,

882
00:55:28.311 --> 00:55:32.060
that would be the Olympian championship of happiness,
but oh no,

883
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:33.980
I don't think anyone is there.

884
00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:35.840
<v 4>Okay.</v>

885
00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:40.430
<v 5>I wanted to ask you a question about consciousness and um,</v>

886
00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:45.810
and how we've apart a large part of what you spoke was sort of,
um,

887
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:51.370
distilling down emotions and sort of having a objective control over it so that

888
00:55:51.711 --> 00:55:56.630
you have,
you can actually solve for happy.
Um,

889
00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:01.720
the other sets of emotions around expanded consciousness would be around say

890
00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:06.100
gratitude or,
um,

891
00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:10.070
where being human and being emotional about those things is a different

892
00:56:10.071 --> 00:56:11.240
experience all together.

893
00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:15.470
I would love to hear some of your thoughts around those aspects of
consciousness.

894
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.940
<v 0>So again,
two,
two parts to the question.</v>

895
00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:22.880
I like to start by talking about emotions

896
00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:26.380
because sometimes I,
you know,

897
00:56:26.381 --> 00:56:30.760
I may come across as if I'm distancing myself from emotions.
As a matter of fact,

898
00:56:30.761 --> 00:56:33.380
I'm not at all.
Uh,
I,
I,

899
00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:36.760
I embrace my emotions fully.
I,
you know,

900
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:40.230
I feed them and experience them.
Uh,

901
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:44.830
as much as I can harsh by the way or happy.
Uh,

902
00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:49.070
there is an interesting approach to going through life.
I,

903
00:56:49.071 --> 00:56:53.980
I normally have the analogy of life and video games.
Uh,
and you know,
it,

904
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:57.300
unless you experience all of life,
uh,

905
00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:01.630
or it's tough times and good times,
it would be a very,
very,

906
00:57:01.631 --> 00:57:04.800
very boring video game.
Uh,
he,
the,

907
00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:09.220
imagine if you started to play Halo and all you had to do is push the forward

908
00:57:09.221 --> 00:57:12.340
button and just go through it until the end of the level.

909
00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:16.450
Where's the fun in debt?
Right?
So emotions are to be embraced but,

910
00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:21.190
but emotions when they become overwhelming,
by the way,
either way,

911
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:24.940
you need to start to become aware where is the emotion coming from?

912
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:28.240
Because every emotion,
by the way,
and we do this exercise in the training.

913
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:32.950
Every emotion stems from a thought,
not an event.
It stems from a thought.

914
00:57:32.951 --> 00:57:35.830
So the taxi driver is rude,
is the event.

915
00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:40.570
The thought might be something like people should not be rude to me.

916
00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:45.640
I should be respected.
This is threatening to my kids and their future.
Okay.

917
00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:49.330
Whatever that thought is,
is what drives that,
you know,

918
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:53.560
a feeling of anger or anxiety or worry or whatever that is that comes as a

919
00:57:53.561 --> 00:57:58.150
result of the route driver.
So,
so we need to be aware of those.

920
00:57:58.151 --> 00:57:59.590
We need to embrace those.

921
00:57:59.591 --> 00:58:02.810
And then when we start to realize that they're taking over and all of a,

922
00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:03.970
an overwhelming us,

923
00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:07.810
we need to start tracing them and finding out why are they doing that,

924
00:58:07.811 --> 00:58:10.570
which starts the stem from,
are those thoughts through at all?

925
00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:15.880
Now consciousness goes way beyond that.
Okay.

926
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:17.270
And consciousness.
I,
I,

927
00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:22.320
I always like to use the example of love because I think love is very,

928
00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:27.130
is a very universal and very understudied a concept.

929
00:58:27.131 --> 00:58:32.080
So I call it my,
uh,
my romantic,
unscientific chapter if you want.

930
00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:37.420
And,
and there is,
there are two types of love,
but there is that,
uh,

931
00:58:37.450 --> 00:58:39.250
that love that happens in your brain.

932
00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:44.380
I love you because let's say I love Google because of the cafes.

933
00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.820
If Larry Decides to cancel the cafe's tomorrow,
I no longer love Google.

934
00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:53.260
There is a reason for my love,
but I love butterflies.
That's it.

935
00:58:53.770 --> 00:58:57.010
There is no,
because I have no idea why.
I just love butterflies,

936
00:58:57.430 --> 00:59:01.930
right when whichever shape,
whichever,
if it's Pale Gray,
I love butterflies,

937
00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:05.290
right?
I don't know,
I admire their story.
I don't know.
Right?

938
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:10.500
There is that kind of love and that kind of love truly is awareness extreme.

939
00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:16.280
That's you connecting with the rest of being okay there.
You know,
I,

940
00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:19.570
I feel as love for me,

941
00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:22.190
even though AI is thousands of miles away,

942
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:25.940
I am my daughter in Montreal right now.

943
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:29.900
Those kinds of awarenesses if you want,

944
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:32.270
are truly the top of all awareness.

945
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:36.350
This is truly when you start to connect with the review,
okay?

946
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:41.210
The one that's not rushing through life everyday trying to get the next iPhone.

947
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:46.640
The real you is the one that's aware beyond this.

948
00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:50.360
Okay.
And it's rare and it takes a ton of practice.

949
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:54.980
And I think the problem is that we dismiss it because it doesn't seem very

950
00:59:54.981 --> 00:59:59.810
scientific.
But you asked about dreams.
Okay.
You ask about all of those.

951
01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:02.210
UN understood,
you know,

952
01:00:02.211 --> 01:00:07.211
miss not an not understood an unexplained events in our life where we go beyond

953
01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:09.950
the physical where we can,
you know,

954
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:13.970
whether you feel that someone needs you to call them or whatever.
Okay.

955
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:19.070
And all of these awarenesses are probably the next stage.
Okay.
I,

956
01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:19.370
I'd,

957
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:24.140
I'd encourage everyone who's a modern day warrior to start by the awarenesses of

958
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:29.120
this.
Okay.
To feel the pain in your neck,
to feel the,
you know,

959
01:00:29.121 --> 01:00:31.970
the coordinates in the room to feel the,
you know,

960
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.380
the time passing by to fill the thoughts popping up in your head to feel the

961
01:00:36.381 --> 01:00:39.890
link between the thought and that emotion.
Okay.

962
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:44.780
To become aware of all of these.
And then as you progress in your belts,

963
01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:48.560
if you want,
you get to the black belt of all awareness,
which is consciousness.

964
01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:53.840
<v 6>The topic is a Mello from the individual level.
But are you,
I know have a,</v>

965
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:54.500
you know,

966
01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:59.500
there's a background or from other culture and also have a emerging market of,

967
01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:03.730
from a society point of view,
we talk about these,
uh,
you know,

968
01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:08.020
happiness a globally,
you know,
if from coucher farms is a global,

969
01:01:08.021 --> 01:01:09.140
from a societal level,

970
01:01:09.141 --> 01:01:13.130
you think what kind of main challenge and we can contribute it,
you know,

971
01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.960
to live to the happiness.

972
01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:20.330
<v 0>It definitely is not a secret that happiness is becoming more and more of a</v>

973
01:01:21.401 --> 01:01:23.070
challenge across all cultures,
but,

974
01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:26.890
but it's also not a secret that there are cultures that are happier than others.

975
01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:27.910
Right.

976
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:32.910
And I wouldn't want to classify cultures by east or west or by,

977
01:01:33.011 --> 01:01:35.680
you know,
Asian or European or whatever.

978
01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:39.130
I'd probably try to pinpoint the industrial revolution.

979
01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:44.560
I would say that between the industrial revolution and World War II where points

980
01:01:44.561 --> 01:01:47.830
before which,
uh,
you know,
uh,

981
01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:52.860
we were a lot more in touch with the reality of being a human.

982
01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:55.030
Okay.
I think,

983
01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:59.260
I think what happened in the industrial revolution is that we started to focus a

984
01:01:59.261 --> 01:02:04.261
lot more on progress and productivity than our own wellbeing and happiness.

985
01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:08.470
Okay.
And why do we realize that by the way,
uh,

986
01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:11.230
those who are happy are 12% more productive.

987
01:02:11.231 --> 01:02:16.120
This is scientific then than those who are not,
uh,
at the aggregate level.

988
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:17.223
Uh,
you know,

989
01:02:17.350 --> 01:02:21.240
a big company might not care much if you're slightly less productive than you

990
01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:25.350
should be because you're unhappy.
Okay.
Now,
um,
the,
the,

991
01:02:25.351 --> 01:02:27.930
the whole approach to chasing more,

992
01:02:27.931 --> 01:02:30.540
the whole approach to being pressured by time,

993
01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:35.541
the whole approach to be more individual focused on your own success is,

994
01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:40.140
uh,
it is a spiral,
right?
Because,
because,
you know,

995
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:44.850
you start in a culture where the society is taking care of each other and then

996
01:02:44.851 --> 01:02:49.500
you end up in a society where if you fail,
you're going to be homeless.
Okay.

997
01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:54.650
And then the importance of you not going through that threat of being homeless

998
01:02:55.231 --> 01:02:57.360
becomes even more important,
right?

999
01:02:57.570 --> 01:03:01.230
And so you strive harder and harder and you fall further and further away from

1000
01:03:01.231 --> 01:03:02.064
your happiness.

1001
01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:06.420
There is a core to this operating system to this machine.

1002
01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:12.140
And the core of this machine is our needs are much less than we think they are.

1003
01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:17.880
And our,
uh,
our universal,
uh,
um,

1004
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:23.390
indicator of wellbeing if you want,
is to feel happy.
You know,
if it's,

1005
01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:27.270
it's almost again,
part of your survival function.
If you're happy,

1006
01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:31.320
that's sort of a signal for your brain that everything's okay,
right?

1007
01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:35.970
But it's not a reason to slack,
right?
We need to worry.
We need to,
you know,

1008
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:38.000
that that's your brain thinking.
We need to worry.

1009
01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:41.490
We need to ensure your survival.
And now in the modern world,

1010
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.140
survivor goes much,
much beyond running away from the tiger.
Okay?

1011
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:49.990
It goes into your four zero one K it goes into your,
you know,
uh,

1012
01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:53.310
the kind of car that you drive it,
it goes into,
you know,

1013
01:03:53.311 --> 01:03:58.020
do I have the ability to get the latest phone or not?
Okay.
And none of that,

1014
01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.260
none of that.
I promise you,
none of that will ever make you happy.

1015
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:05.540
Happy is not to be found outside.
Your Ip is there inside your,

1016
01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:09.870
it's your default state.
It's how we are all born.
How old children,

1017
01:04:10.110 --> 01:04:14.400
you know,
join our world.
And if they're fed,
if they're safe,
if they're loved,

1018
01:04:14.610 --> 01:04:17.310
they're happy,
they don't need the toy to be happy.

1019
01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:21.510
They can play with their toes and be happy.
You understand?
And now,
and now,

1020
01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:24.420
by adding all of the pressures of the industrial revolution,

1021
01:04:24.421 --> 01:04:28.610
I think what we ended and the fears that we got after the world war and,

1022
01:04:28.611 --> 01:04:33.360
and the Great Depression,
we started to aim for that insurance policy.

1023
01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:37.800
I just want to make sure I'm safe.
And if I pay that for my,
with my happiness,

1024
01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:43.170
that's okay.
At least I know I'm safe.
You know what?
Most of us are already safe.

1025
01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:45.570
I mean,
you know,
I,

1026
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:49.140
if anyone is watching this video anywhere in the world,

1027
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.870
they have a screen that they can look at.

1028
01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:57.030
That's probably the luckiest 1% in the world,
right?
Um,

1029
01:04:57.570 --> 01:05:01.860
and we still don't see it that way.
We continue to strive and strive and strive.

1030
01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.270
The cultures that are happier,
our cultures that prioritize the present moment,

1031
01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:10.410
they prioritize their happiness,
they prioritize time with the ones they love.

1032
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:14.820
Okay.
And they understand that life will go on with its harshness.

1033
01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.730
I know that with it's good times and if they can do something about the

1034
01:05:18.731 --> 01:05:22.510
harshness,
they'll fix it.
If they cannot,
they'll accept,
well,

1035
01:05:22.530 --> 01:05:25.900
I called committed acceptance and try again.
Okay.

1036
01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:27.600
These are the happiest cultures in the world.

1037
01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:30.610
<v 2>Um,
so as I understand it,</v>

1038
01:05:30.611 --> 01:05:34.060
you've been on sabbatical working on this book and congratulations on launching

1039
01:05:34.061 --> 01:05:38.050
it.
Curious to hear what the next steps are,
what else you're working on.

1040
01:05:38.051 --> 01:05:42.610
You touched on three additional research projects and also how Googlers can help

1041
01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.200
propel those missions forward.

1042
01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:49.710
<v 0>I'm,
I'm,
I think I've never been more in the state of flow as I am right now.
So,</v>

1043
01:05:49.711 --> 01:05:53.440
so I'm truly moving with the events of life as they happen,

1044
01:05:53.770 --> 01:05:58.090
trying really hard to maximize the impact of salt for happy,
but also really,

1045
01:05:58.091 --> 01:06:01.360
really,
really struggling with so many ideas that I'm taking notes about.

1046
01:06:01.361 --> 01:06:03.810
And hopefully you will sit down and write soon.
Bye.

1047
01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:07.750
Also made a promise to come back and hopefully do the best I can to continue the

1048
01:06:07.751 --> 01:06:11.560
incredible mission of Google.
Right?
Uh,
between all of these,

1049
01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:15.310
all I know is that,
is this,
I have a mission of 10,

1050
01:06:15.311 --> 01:06:19.210
making 10 million people happy.
If I make one person happy,

1051
01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:24.220
I'm very happy.
Okay.
If I make two,
I'm a little happier.
If I make a hundred,

1052
01:06:24.221 --> 01:06:28.120
then I'm even happier and I don't know how far this will go.
Okay.

1053
01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:33.420
I'm hoping to be able to get a happy people that grasp the concepts to be the

1054
01:06:33.971 --> 01:06:38.620
ambassadors of the concept.
Uh,
I'm also hoping to find a technology,

1055
01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:41.790
technological ways,
maybe apps or online,
you know,

1056
01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:45.040
presence or whatever that allows us to spread the message even further.

1057
01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:47.710
And I'm hoping that Googlers,
and many of you,

1058
01:06:47.711 --> 01:06:52.711
I know many of who attended the training have been truly ambassadors of this.

1059
01:06:52.721 --> 01:06:54.680
You know,
uh,
I've,
I've spoken to,

1060
01:06:54.681 --> 01:06:59.050
it's spoken at Stanford and many other places as a result of people spreading

1061
01:06:59.051 --> 01:07:03.220
the words and saying this,
this changed my life.
Right?
So,
um,

1062
01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:08.160
all I know for now is that for the next three and a half months or most,
uh,

1063
01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:12.010
I'm completely dedicated to this,
uh,
trying to,

1064
01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:17.130
to list down my notes on the next few thoughts if I have the time and uh,

1065
01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:22.530
that by July I'm back and I'm trying to put 14 hours a day instead of eight so

1066
01:07:25.121 --> 01:07:27.700
that I can continue to do both as best as I can.

1067
01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:32.050
<v 2>All right.
I think we're going to need to wrap it up now.</v>

1068
01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:35.890
Thank you so much for being here.
For last words.

1069
01:07:35.891 --> 01:07:38.830
Can you let people know where they can get the book and if they were touched by

1070
01:07:38.831 --> 01:07:40.750
this message where they can mark that they were

1071
01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:46.030
<v 0>oh yeah.
Yeah.
So,
so the,
the f forget happiness,
the businessmen now.
Okay.</v>

1072
01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:48.150
I have a counter on my website.

1073
01:07:48.151 --> 01:07:51.630
If you go to solve for happy.com and if I managed to,

1074
01:07:51.631 --> 01:07:54.600
could send you a message that made you a little bit happier,

1075
01:07:54.601 --> 01:07:59.070
click on the counter.
It says you made me happy.
Thank you.
And,
uh,

1076
01:07:59.071 --> 01:08:01.170
and I,
uh,
I,
uh,
of course,
you know,

1077
01:08:01.171 --> 01:08:04.230
the book is launching our in on the 21st of March,

1078
01:08:04.231 --> 01:08:07.320
so you can get it on Google play books or,

1079
01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:10.710
or on Amazon and uh,
yeah,
uh,

1080
01:08:10.770 --> 01:08:15.200
I promise you it will make a difference.
So,
uh,
so I hope,

If your email is shorter than four lines,
and yes,
I do,

1084
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:31.100
I do ask you to get in touch and give me ideas and tell me how I can make this

1085
01:08:31.101 --> 01:08:35.180
better.
Uh,
at the same time,
if you are,
you know,

1086
01:08:35.210 --> 01:08:38.420
reading and finding thoughts that you would like to discuss,

1087
01:08:38.421 --> 01:08:42.830
there is nothing that is more enjoyable for me then learning new perspectives

1088
01:08:42.831 --> 01:08:47.000
and new points of view.
So,
yeah,
do stay in touch and I hope to,
uh,
