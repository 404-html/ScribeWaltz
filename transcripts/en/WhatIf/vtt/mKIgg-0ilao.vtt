00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.270
This is the world 200 million years ago,
no cell phones,

2
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.910
electricity,
or even other humans.

3
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.670
Would you be able to survive in this new world?

4
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.280
Could you get yourself a pet dinosaur?
Wait,
dinosaurs are here.
Okay,

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.910
maybe this won't be so bad.
This is what if,

6
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.840
and here's what would happen if you are alive.
200 million years ago,

7
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.560
the world was pretty different during the late Triassic period.

8
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.920
One of the most notable differences is this right here.

9
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.560
This is pangea a supercontinent containing different parts of today's world.

10
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.990
There's Australia down south,
North America,
in the northwest,

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.830
and Eurasia in the east.
All interconnected.
It would take you a while,

12
00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:53.820
but in theory you could walk from California to France.

13
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.290
You won't see the Hollywood walk of fame or see the Eiffel Tower as they don't

14
00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:00.960
exist yet.
What would you see?

15
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.170
The first thing you'd notice as you're traveling across pangea are all the

16
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:08.430
dinosaurs running about.

17
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.210
You won't have to worry about dinosaurs such as the delong that way.

18
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:15.780
Only 11 kilograms.
They won't pose much of a threat.
Well,

19
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:20.190
watch out for the melanoma Saurus who has a height of 12 meters and would find

20
00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:21.600
you to be a tasty snack.

21
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.640
Scientists say that the late Triassic period was the dawn of the first
dinosaurs.

22
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.220
Dinosaurs of all sizes would be everywhere.

23
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.990
You'd also see some other crazy creatures you've never seen before and some that

24
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:35.850
may remind you of animals you see today.

25
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.470
This species known as the [inaudible] Saurus with its reptile like skin and

26
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.400
arched back might be one of the first versions of birds to ever exist.

27
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.290
The Triassic period was an incredibly important 50 million years of evolution,

28
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.350
uh,
time with none.
A lot of competition between species.

29
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.120
Since just prior to this period,

30
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.290
70% of earth's creatures were wiped out in a mass extinction event.

31
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.580
Many of the animals at the time were able to thrive and grow without having to

32
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:07.250
be constantly wary of other predators.
The further you travel inland in Japan,

33
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.720
gea,
you'll notice the massive weather changes,

34
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.970
the outer edges of the supercontinent,

35
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.280
maybe full of lush forests and green grass.

36
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.160
But the further you go in that begins to change.

37
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.570
Scientists suspect that much of pangea was a dry desert wasteland.

38
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.440
That's because the land mass was so large that the interior wouldn't have

39
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:28.980
received the cooling effects of the ocean.
Speaking of which,

40
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.010
the ocean known as Pan Philoso surrounded all of Pangea and covered 70% of

41
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:37.560
earth's surface.
This ocean was extremely deadly.

42
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.590
It could easily produce super hurricanes and monsoons,

43
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.510
and due to its massive size,

44
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.920
they could gain enough momentum to hit pangea with potentially fatal whether

45
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.940
Pangea was just beginning to separate 200 million years ago.

46
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.570
If you were able to stick around a few million more years for the Jurassic

47
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:57.510
period,
that's when you truly see dinosaurs thrive.

48
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.820
The t rex brachiosaurus stegosaurus.

49
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.570
What would happen if they were still alive today?
Well,

50
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:07.930
that sounds like a question for another.
What if.
