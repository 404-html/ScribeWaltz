00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.310
What if you dug a hole through the earth?

2
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.330
<v 0>Okay,</v>

3
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.410
<v 1>what would it take?
How fast could you travel to the other side of the earth?</v>

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.790
How deep if we made it already,
this is what if,

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.820
and here's what would happen if you dug a hole through the earth.

6
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.070
We all heard the rumor as kids,

7
00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:24.890
that tunneling through the earth would take us to the other side of the world.

8
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.490
Sorry to crush your dreams.
It doesn't really work that way.

9
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.820
Most people would end up in the middle of an ocean if they tried digging through

10
00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:35.960
the earth.
It may work in some places.
If you lived in Beijing,

11
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.320
then you'd surface in Argentina and from Madrid.

12
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.970
It's a direct route to New Zealand,

13
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.500
but how far would you get if you could dig a tunnel through the earth?

14
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.090
It would be 7,918 miles long,
and if you jumped right in,

15
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.630
it would only take you 45 minutes to reach the opposite side of the earth.

16
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.810
Of course in all the excitement and you might forget to grab onto something once

17
00:00:56.811 --> 00:00:59.930
you popped out.
At which point he had fall right back to where you started.

18
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.480
So far,
human digging has only made it 0.1% of the way through the earth.

19
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.290
In the seventies and eighties the Soviets attempted to drill as deep as they

20
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:10.730
could into the earth's crust.

21
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.910
They made it down 40,230 feet before temperatures of 570 degrees melted their

22
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:19.040
equipment.
But with a magic shovel,

23
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.770
a super heat resistance suit and some special boots to hold your footing on

24
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:24.800
Molten Rock,
you might fare a little better.

25
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.820
The Earth's interior is composed of four layers.

26
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.920
The outer most shell is called the crust,

27
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.090
which runs about 30 miles deep and for every 0.6 miles of depth,

28
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.580
the temperature goes up 77 degrees.

29
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.390
The average human would suffer hyperthermia after the first mile,

30
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.720
but since you're so well equipped,
you get to dig down to the Mantel.

31
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.440
Digging through this layer would be a particular challenge since it makes up

32
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.190
over 80% of our planet's volume and it's all hot liquid rock,

33
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.170
also known as the [inaudible] tennis fear.

34
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.190
This layer is responsible for tectonic plate movement and it's the reason why we

35
00:01:58.191 --> 00:02:00.710
have mountains,
volcanoes and earthquakes.

36
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.550
Not only would it be a sluggish task to dig through thousands of miles of molten

37
00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:08.840
rock,
you may have to dodge a shift in continent in the process.
Eventually,

38
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:11.450
you'll make it to the cooler layer and ironic descriptor.

39
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.510
Since the temperatures that Earth's outer core range between 70 209,000 degrees,

40
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.250
this layer won't be any easier to get through.
Then the mantle,

41
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.900
since it's a shell of liquid iron,

42
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.330
but try to do too much damage with your digging.

43
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.350
The outer core gives our planet it's magnetic field and we can't live without
it.

44
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.491
Finally,

45
00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:31.760
you get to the inner core and it's probably where you should consider ending

46
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:33.950
your journey.
We're not quitters at what if,

47
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:37.010
but we do care about your wellbeing and take our word for it.

48
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.680
Digging through the earth's core would not be fun.

49
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.390
The inner core is essentially a large white hot ball of solid iron and nickel.

50
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.600
It's solid because the pressure from 3,218 miles below the earth's surface is so

51
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:54.110
great.
It prevents the iron from melting.
So with every scoop of your shovel,

52
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.740
the liquid iron from the outer core would simply fill in the empty gaps and

53
00:02:57.741 --> 00:02:59.740
solidify in order,
make it through.

54
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.410
You'd have to work much faster than as humanly possible,

55
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.230
but that's no challenge here.
The challenge,
however,

56
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.310
might be mastering the floating dig with a significant amount of the earth's

57
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:12.790
mass above you countering the force of gravity from the rest of the world,

58
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.390
you'd be rendered completely weightless,
hence the floating dig.

59
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.920
But with unlimited time,

60
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:20.620
anything is possible and somehow you make it through the core.

61
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.520
Your journey out of the center of the earth would be even harder since gravity

62
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:26.590
would be pulling you backwards the whole way through.

63
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.560
When you finally break ground on the opposite end of the earth,

64
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.930
assuming you don't surface in the middle of an ocean,

65
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.040
then you better be satisfied because the way back with certainly be closed.

66
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.580
So that's one way to travel.
And we mean one way,
literally.

67
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.440
Please do not try this at home.

68
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.590
If you want to travel across the world by a Piggy Bank,

69
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.080
save your lucky pennies and someday you'll get there.

70
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.770
It may take longer than 45 minutes,
but don't let that stop you from dreaming.

71
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.240
Stay curious,
keep asking questions.
And of course we'll keep digging for you.

72
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.860
View countering the force of gravity from the rest of the world.

73
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.430
You'd be rendered completely weightless,
hence the floating dig.

74
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.100
But with unlimited time,
anything is possible.

75
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.660
And somehow you make it through the core.

76
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.560
Your journey out of the center of the earth would be even harder since gravity

77
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:20.670
would be pulling you backwards the whole way through.
When you find these,

78
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.120
do not try this at home.

80
