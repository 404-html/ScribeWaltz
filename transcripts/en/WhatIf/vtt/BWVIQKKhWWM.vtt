00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.893
Totally

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.000
<v 1>imagine you were able to shrink the sun to the size of a basketball.</v>

3
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.840
At that point,
the earth would be reduced to the size of a sesame seed.

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.180
That's how massive our star is,

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.980
but what if this fiery ball of gas and plasma wasn't the biggest thing in our

6
00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:19.814
solar system?

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.490
Would our planets still orbit the sun or with the sun rotate around the massive

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.530
earth?
What would happen to our planetary neighbors?

9
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.930
This is what if,

10
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.050
and here's what would happen if the sun was smaller than the earth.

11
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.080
It would take the equivalent of 1.3 million earth's to fill up the volume of the

12
00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:39.914
sun.

13
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.840
It's so big that it makes up over 99% of the mass of our entire solar system.

14
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.430
It only looks small from Earth because it's 150 million kilometers away.

15
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.030
If hypothetically the sun was smaller than the earth,

16
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.660
the earth would be uninhabitable and the sun,
well,

17
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.570
this massive star may no longer be a star

18
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.040
in the universe.
Size matters and so does distance.

19
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.270
It just so happens that the earth is close enough to the sun that it doesn't

20
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:10.500
freeze over like Mars.

21
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.010
It's also far enough away that it doesn't get scorched like Venus.

22
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.920
We're fortunate to be in the son's habitable zone.

23
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.640
This means that the size of our planet,
the size of the sun,

24
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.510
and the distance between the two of us is what's made it possible for life to

25
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:29.010
evolve here on earth.
What would happen if the sun was smaller than our planet?

26
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.000
A stars mass determines its color and temperature.

27
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.590
Bigger stars are hotter and bluer while smaller ones are cooler and redder.

28
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.570
The Sun is a white star,

29
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.170
not as big as a super giant and not as small as a red dwarf star.

30
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.050
You might think that by making it smaller in size,

31
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:48.810
it would just turn into a red dwarf with a smaller habitable zone,

32
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.800
but that's not the case.
By definition,
a star,

33
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.280
whether it's a super giant or a red dwarf is only a star.

34
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.810
When there's thermonuclear fusion in its core.
How small can stars get?

35
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.750
Well,
we haven't measured too many red dwarfs at this point,

36
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.780
but the smallest one we came across has a mass of 10 earth's that's very close

37
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:12.360
to the theoretically necessary size of a star to sustain that fusion.

38
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.660
Anything smaller than 10 earth's wouldn't be a star anymore,

39
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.040
but rather a cold and dark stellar remnant.

40
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.480
If for any reason the sun shrink smaller than the earth,

41
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.260
this shrunken son wouldn't have the mass to create fusion and would burn out

42
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:29.010
completely.
Our solar system would lose its only star.

43
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.870
Since the sun is the source of gravity that keeps us all in orbit,
all planets,

44
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.590
the earth included would float away into space in search of another anchor

45
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.020
that's no happy ending for life on earth.
Let's try this again.
This time.

46
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:47.220
Let's make the earth bigger than the sun.
While the sun's size remains the same,

47
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.620
Earth's mass would be at least 333,000 times bigger than it is now.

48
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.000
A planet that big would generate enough heat and pressure and it's core to

49
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:01.240
become a star itself of.
There would be no life left on this hot star.

50
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.950
But here's the cool thing.
Our solar system would have not just one,
but two sons.

51
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.360
It would become a binary star system with two stars orbiting around each other

52
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.710
and planets circling them both
in either scenario.

53
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.080
Life on earth would have no chance to survive,

54
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.920
but life could possibly evolve on other planets or even the moon.

55
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.080
About a third of all stellar systems we found so far are binary or multiple
ones.

56
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.810
Some of them even have stable habitable zones.

57
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.160
How cool would it be to live in a real life tattooing with two suns in the sky?

58
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.430
That's a question for another.
What if.
