00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.120
Ever seen this map.

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.310
This is how the earth luck 200 million years ago before pangea the only super

3
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.050
continent on the planet came apart.

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.600
What if one day the continence join together into one giant land mass again and

5
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:21.570
you could travel from North America to Africa on foot?

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.540
What country would become your new neighbor with this caused natural disasters

7
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:31.140
all over the planet?
How long would this new pangea last for?

8
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.780
This is what if,
and here's what would happen if the continence merged together.

9
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.310
Did you know the land below you is actually moving right now?

10
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.840
This is because all seven continents sit on the tectonic plates that Earth's

11
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:46.920
crust is broken into.

12
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.140
These plates are floating on Molten rock at the same speed your fingernails
grow.

13
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.550
It may sound slow,

14
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.990
but it does add up over hundreds of millions of years in the four and a half

15
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.460
billion year history of earth.

16
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.070
Our comments have changed their appearance many times,

17
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.650
sometimes fusing together and crunching collisions and sometimes breaking apart.

18
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.460
Right now they're slowly moving toward another collision.

19
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.560
What if one day they suddenly sped up and smashed into a super continent?
Again,

20
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.350
would you wake up to find yourself at the Mexican border?

21
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.460
The world would look very different than what you're used to.

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.310
If the plates collided in the direction you're moving.
Now,

23
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.220
the flight from Australia to Asia would never be cheaper.

24
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.000
Since Australia would collide with Japan,
Korea,
and China,

25
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.330
the two continents would no longer be separated by the Atlantic Ocean,

26
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.360
and if you're really into walking,

27
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.960
you'd also be able to travel from Sunny Australia to the world's coldest

28
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:47.961
continent of Antarctica on foot North America would bump into western Africa.

29
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.650
Citizens of New York might wake up to find the Namibian lions roaming through

30
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:56.700
central park.
The northern part of Africa would crash into Europe.

31
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.180
This would create a new Himalayan scale mountain range on the border of the

32
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:01.140
tectonic plates.

33
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.200
<v 1>Okay,</v>

34
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.420
<v 0>thank camels would enjoy a chilly day on a snow hill.</v>

35
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.290
Some of these changes may sound fun,

36
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.120
but there would be some really bad news to the eastern side of the Americas

37
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.170
along with Western Europe and Africa would turn into an earthquake danger zone.

38
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.623
On top of that,

39
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.860
these areas would be devastated by the eruptions of newly foreign volcanoes.

40
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.900
Green slopes of the Appalachians would become giant snow covered mountains

41
00:02:28.901 --> 00:02:30.430
spewing ash and lava.

42
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.200
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

43
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.630
<v 0>This new pangea would be mostly arid and hot as rain.</v>

44
00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:38.560
Clouds would lose most of their moisture before getting too far inland.

45
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.740
The supercontinent would be centered at the equator.

46
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.210
Wildlife would become less diverse as not all species can bear hot temperatures,

47
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.060
but just like the most recent continental Mashup,

48
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.100
this reunion wouldn't last forever.
Well not longer than 50 million years.

49
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.870
Volcanic eruptions would be spewing out large amounts of lava and gas.

50
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.450
I devastating earthquakes to the equation,

51
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.510
and you'd see these dangerous regions start to pull themselves apart and stirred

52
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:07.750
by hot currents below.

53
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.590
The supercontinent would eventually break apart into smaller continents going

54
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:15.310
their separate ways.
If bordering Australia looks like a cool thing to you,

55
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.130
bad luck.
You won't see this happening anytime soon,

56
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.300
but you can always imagine how the world would look if the giant continental

57
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:23.830
pieces of the puzzle came together.

58
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.030
Give the planet 300 million years and they'll be another supercontinent.

59
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.260
Geologists already gave it a name Pangea Ultima.

60
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.360
<v 2>Okay.</v>

61
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.110
<v 0>What would you name it.</v>
