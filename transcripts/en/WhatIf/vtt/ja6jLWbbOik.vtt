00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.960
What if one day machines decided that humans were just a waste of resources and

2
00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:13.940
with that in their artificial mind started a robot apocalypse.
A Robocalypse.

3
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.560
Imagine the total revolt of every automated device you use,

4
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.230
your self driving car refuse to give you a lift.

5
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.650
Your iPhone x ignored your attempts to unlock it with your face.

6
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.260
How bad would this rise of the machines be after robots take over?

7
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.090
Would there be any place for humans?

8
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.070
This is what f and here's what would happen if there was a robot apocalypse.

9
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.910
Some robots can teach themselves chess in a matter of hours.

10
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.200
Others run hotels and assistant surgeons in the operating room and hey,

11
00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:49.370
look around you.
We let robotic cleaners vacuum our floors,
leave it up to litter,

12
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:53.510
robots to take care of our pets and trust Amazon echo and Google home to wake us

13
00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:54.344
up in the morning.

14
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.730
What if one day our devices decided that Cubans were redundant and turned

15
00:00:58.731 --> 00:01:03.380
against us
already picturing if terminator likes scenario,

16
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.020
don't give up so fast.
There are many ways for you to survive a robot apocalypse.

17
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.060
Why not just shut the door behind you?

18
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.090
Despite the fact that robots are mastering math,

19
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.280
a closed door is an obstacle they can't overcome yet.
Well,
most of them can't.

20
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.300
On top of that,
their coordination isn't exactly perfect.

21
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.480
If experimental bots in the robotic labs when preserved,

22
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.580
they would just slam into walls,
doors,

23
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.300
and then the other obstructions they meet on the way,
not so scary as it.

24
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.070
What about our cell phones?
Uh,
phones,
options to harm.
You are very limited.

25
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.760
Posting that embarrassing video you always meant to delete but never did.

26
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.920
It's the worst thing that they can do.
Well,

27
00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:45.890
there's the possibility of them running up huge credit card bills,

28
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.000
which one of those scares you most?
There are computers built into our cars,

29
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.320
but you shouldn't worry about them.

30
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.690
If your car was parked without a human at the wheel,

31
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.310
it wouldn't know where to go anyway.

32
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.100
And if you were on the road at the moment of the robot rebellion,

33
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.190
you'd still be able to control the steering wheel or pull the handbrake.

34
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.810
The biggest robots.
We have work in factories assembling things,

35
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.000
but since they're firmly bolted to the floor,

36
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.390
how would they go about attacking us by assembling even more things?

37
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.040
It doesn't sound that scary,
does it?

38
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.040
The real danger would come from battle robots.

39
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.970
Military drones floating high in the sky at the moment of the robot revolution

40
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.600
would have no trouble blasting missiles towards us.
Luckily,

41
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:26.690
it wouldn't take long until they ran out of fuel and simply fell from the sky.

42
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.100
An automated army of battlebots armed with machine guns could cause major
damage.

43
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.520
Though should we be afraid of nuclear weapons?

44
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.340
Computers are involved in every step of launching the nukes,

45
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.610
but they wouldn't be able to complete the task without humans turning the keys,

46
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.330
even if they managed to trick us into launching nuclear bombs by feeding us

47
00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:45.320
false information.

48
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.800
The robots themselves with suffer from nuclear fall out just like us.

49
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.150
Nuclear explosions create a burst of electromagnetic radiation,

50
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.670
electromagnetic pulse,
or emp.

51
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.380
It would damage the delicate electronic circuits of the robots and put end to

52
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:01.750
the Robocalypse.
Long story short,

53
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.540
a robot revolution would come to an end pretty quickly.

54
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.760
No matter how smarter devices seem to us,

55
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.830
they don't have much in the way of artificial intelligence.

56
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.800
They're specifically designed to focus on a narrow task and our luckily in

57
00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:17.310
capable of destroying humanity.

58
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.210
But that doesn't mean that Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk were wrong to warn us

59
00:03:21.211 --> 00:03:23.820
about a future superintelligent AI takeover.

60
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.970
We may be decades away from conscious machines living among us,

61
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.450
but when we manage to create machines that are smarter and more efficient than

62
00:03:30.451 --> 00:03:35.100
us,
our scenario will be varied,
very different.
What do you think,

63
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.610
would you give a self driving car total control of your drive to work tomorrow?

64
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.400
<v 0>Okay.</v>
