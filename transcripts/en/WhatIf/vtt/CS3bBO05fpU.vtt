00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.370
In a world exhausted a fossil fuels.

2
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.630
Solar panels can provide a sustainable solution to our energy problems,

3
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.200
but they also come with a couple of issues.
For one,

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.820
solar farms are massive and they have to be set up somewhere that gets a lot of

5
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:22.200
sunlight.
Now,

6
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:27.201
if only we had a large mass of unused land that gets guaranteed sunlight every

7
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.100
day.
Hmm.

8
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.480
Could we cover an entire desert in solar panels?

9
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.490
Would that be enough to power the entire world?
This is what if,

10
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.450
and here's what would happen if we covered the Sahara desert with solar panels.

11
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.190
If we covered just 1.2% of the Sahara desert and solar panels,

12
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.600
we can harness enough power to meet the energy needs of the entire world.

13
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.700
How would we overcome the geopolitical and financial obstacles involved and how

14
00:00:56.701 --> 00:00:59.820
could this project thoroughly change the deserts climate?

15
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.910
Usually a solar farm is built to prevent changes in the environment,

16
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.840
but if we built one in the Sahara,
it might cause some changes of its own.

17
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.880
If we lined the desert floor with giant solar panels,

18
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.350
it would double the rainfall in the region and increase vegetation cover by

19
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:24.060
about 20% sound a little unbelievable.
Well,
let me explain.

20
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.090
So Horan sand is unusually light in color,

21
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.260
which means it tends to reflect a lot of light and heat back up into the air.

22
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.140
If we covered the sand in dark solar panels,

23
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.920
it would mean that more sun would be absorbed and the ground temperature would

24
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:38.754
increase.

25
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.440
Warmer air rises to areas in the atmosphere where it's cooler and moisture.

26
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:46.500
They're condenses and falls as rain.
Before you knew it,

27
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.910
one of the most extreme climates on earth would undergo a significant makeover.

28
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.530
So if the solar panels would not only provide sustainable energy solutions,

29
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.560
but also add much needed greenery to our largest desert,

30
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.360
then what are we waiting for?

31
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.720
Shouldn't we be out there building these things already?
Well,

32
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.810
it's a little more complicated than that.
For one thing,

33
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.300
it's great to produce enough energy to power the world,

34
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.510
but then you have to worry about how you're going to get it to everyone.

35
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.250
The most likely place.

36
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:19.080
This energy would travel to first is to Europe exporting sustainable energy

37
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.780
would do great things for a lot of African economies,

38
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.550
but would they have the means to do it?

39
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.530
Currently electrical grids in Africa aren't very reliable and they'd need power

40
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:32.580
lines of around 800 to 3000 kilometers to get where they needed to go.

41
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.010
Transporting power over long distances leads to power loss of up to 10% which

42
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:42.660
means that an already expensive project would get even more pricey and where

43
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:43.740
would all the money come from?

44
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.670
Africa is home to quite a few unstable governments.

45
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.810
The kind that raised some pretty big red flags with investors of multibillion

46
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.100
dollar projects like this one.
On top of that,
this would be a longterm project,

47
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.930
so there'll be a lot of moving parts.

48
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.200
Several countries have to be involved and any one of them might see a changing

49
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:05.890
political landscape over the years that could disrupt or put an end to the whole

50
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:10.240
thing.
As great as this project would be,

51
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.870
it would probably be better to attempt it on a small scale first.

52
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.770
Maybe solar panels could be used to power some small African villages and help

53
00:03:18.771 --> 00:03:23.620
to spread access to electricity,
but that's a topic for another.
What if.
