00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.660
Back in 1846 whaling was one of the most booming industries in the whole world.

2
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.480
It was the fifth largest sector in the United States economy.

3
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.560
Raking in a cool $10 million,
but somewhere along the way,

4
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.450
the whale supplies started to run low and some people began to realize that the

5
00:00:23.451 --> 00:00:25.700
entire thing might be a bad idea.

6
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.170
How did the whale hunt accelerate climate change and why?

7
00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:33.230
We're scientists grade about whale poop shortages.

8
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.210
This is what if,

9
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.960
and here's what would happen if we never started hunting whales.

10
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.780
If the whale hunt never happened,

11
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.800
there'd be less carbon in our atmosphere and our planet would be a lot
healthier.

12
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.520
If we restored whale populations to pre hunt levels,

13
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.910
we could remove about 160,000 tons of carbon from our atmosphere every year.

14
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.360
But how can one species be so important to the entire planet?

15
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.210
Looking back,

16
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.660
it's clear why whale hunting was such an enticing business opportunity.

17
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.420
Whale meat could be used to feed the masses.

18
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.330
Their oil could lubricate machinery and light up a room.

19
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.680
Their intestines could produce perfume and their cartilage was perfect for

20
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:19.530
holding together products like corsets and umbrellas.

21
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.260
With all the money wrapped up in the industry,

22
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.250
you can see why there would be such a backlash when it was essentially banned in

23
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:31.251
1986 some politicians even argued that hunting whales was good for humans

24
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.070
because without whales around to eat fish and Krill,
there'd be more for us.

25
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.750
But as we got rid of the whales,
the fish and Krill started to die too.

26
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.100
You see,
whales are apex predators,

27
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.080
which means that they're the top of their food chain.

28
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.600
When you begin to remove the head of a food chain,

29
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.420
it creates something called a trophic cascade.

30
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.700
Basically circle down effect that can disrupt an entire ecosystem.

31
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.430
Whales don't just eat fish and Krill.

32
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.240
They also play a big part in allowing those populations to thrive.

33
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.913
For one thing,

34
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.330
their poop releases essential nutrients like iron and nitrogen into the surface

35
00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:13.250
waters which fertilizes plant plankton,
which in turn feeds fish and Krill.

36
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.690
Whenever whale swim from the depths of the ocean back up to the surface,

37
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.540
they knock plankton up to the sunny surface waters,

38
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.980
allowing it more time to reproduce.
The more plankton there are in our waters,

39
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.570
the better things are for everyone,

40
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.020
not only to plant and feed lots of marine populations.

41
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.320
They also absorb carbon dioxide from our atmosphere,

42
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.650
taking it down to the bottom of the ocean for thousands of years.

43
00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:40.010
When they die with the carbon reduction doesn't stop there.

44
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.340
Whales also contribute directly to cleaning up the atmosphere.

45
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.900
They store large amounts of carbon and carry it down to the sea floor when they

46
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:49.460
die.
Otherwise,

47
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.970
this carbon would be released into the environment and contribute to global

48
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:55.220
warming.
With all that in mind,

49
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.830
it's clear how vital these elegant creatures are to the planet and how much good

50
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.010
they could have been doing if we hadn't been slashing their populations for

51
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:03.844
decades.

52
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.140
<v 2>Okay.</v>

53
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.310
<v 1>Nowadays,
whale hunting is banned everywhere except for a handful of countries.</v>

54
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.070
Experts say that despite these efforts,

55
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.480
the populations of most species of whale won't even reach half of their pre

56
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:21.481
whaling numbers by the year 2100 maybe one day we'll be able to make up for all

57
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:26.890
we lost with the whale hunt,
but that's a topic for another.
What if.
