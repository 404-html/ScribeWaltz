00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.080
What if one day everyone on nurse pulled their forks away from the stakes and

2
00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:08.914
turn Vegan,

3
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.330
whether for the sake of a healthier lifestyle to alleviate animal suffering or

4
00:00:13.331 --> 00:00:14.560
to fight global warming,

5
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.460
everyone found their own reason to say no to a juicy burger,

6
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.590
a fluffy omelet or a cheesy pizza.
Even ice cream would make the no,

7
00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:27.970
no list.
What a Vegan diet save the planet from climate change?

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.710
Would this improve your health?
What would happen to all those cattle?

9
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.940
<v 2>This is what f and here's what would happen if everyone in the world became</v>

10
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:38.774
Vegan.

11
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.980
There are 20 million vegans in the u s alone six times more than there were in

12
00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:46.730
2015 tofu was filling in for me on restaurant menus.

13
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.630
Dairy free milk alternatives are pushing their way on the supermarket shelves.

14
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.350
What was once a radical diet choice is becoming mainstream?

15
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.270
Did you know food produced by animals is responsible for a quarter of all

16
00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:03.710
greenhouse gas emissions.
Most of that comes from cows.

17
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.940
Every year the world's cattle population leaves a carbon footprint equivalent to

18
00:01:07.941 --> 00:01:12.350
the CEO to emissions of every car,
train,
ship,
and aircraft in the world.

19
00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:17.300
Put together.
Wait,
how exactly does livestock contribute to global warming?

20
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.930
There's about a billion and a half cows in the world.

21
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.210
Each cow releases up to 120 kilograms of methane per year on the climate change

22
00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:31.070
scale.
Methane's negative effect is 23 times higher than carbon dioxide's.

23
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.473
On top of that,

24
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.350
cattle take as much as two thirds of all agricultural land on the planet.

25
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.090
If we all went Vegan,

26
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.230
we'd use most of that pasture land for restoring forests and grasslands to help

27
00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:43.820
reduce carbon dioxide in the air.

28
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.450
We start growing more crops to fill the gaps in our food supply.

29
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.990
Livestock related gas emissions would drop by 70% but what would happen?

30
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:57.350
All those farm animals with no demand for grilled chicken and roast beef,

31
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.870
billions of animals would be slaughtered or abandoned.

32
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.160
Some animals like sheep and pigs might be able to return to the wild,

33
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.580
but their numbers would drop due to predators.
Others though,

34
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:09.920
like broiler chickens couldn't survive in the wild,

35
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:13.010
is they're so far removed from their ancestors,
they wouldn't know what to do.

36
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.550
Their best chance might be in sanctuaries where they'd be taken care of until

37
00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:20.000
they die out.
Your local butcher would have to find another job,

38
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.770
and so with millions of farmers,

39
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.140
they can start growing more crops or restoring forests,
but on a large scale,

40
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.550
rural communities they used to supply you with milk,

41
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.280
eggs and meat would face significant unemployment.

42
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.270
Developing countries who built their lives and trades around livestock would

43
00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:37.070
deal with major economic disruption,

44
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.660
but everyone would be a little bit healthier or Woodway.

45
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.960
Adopting a Vegan diet,
it doesn't automatically make you a healthy eater.

46
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.130
Vegans often miss out on vital nutrients.
They often don't get enough calcium,

47
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:53.570
iron,
vitamin D,
zinc,
vitamin B,
12 or omega three fatty acids.

48
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.860
Since meat,

49
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.130
eggs and cheese would no longer be served as a perfect source of protein.

50
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.350
You'd have to eat lot of beans,
soy and lentils,
but with a proper diet,

51
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.010
we'd suffer from less coronary heart disease,
stroke,
and diabetes.

52
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.900
Global mortality rates would drop by up to 10% this would mean 8 million less

53
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:15.070
deaths per year and up to $1 trillion saved on healthcare and last working days

54
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:17.390
annually.
But not in developing countries.

55
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.150
We're over 2 billion people already faced massive under nourishment without
meat.

56
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.910
For them,
things wouldn't get healthier.
They'd get worse.

57
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.630
Having the entire world go vegan might be a little extreme,

58
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:32.320
but keeping food's produced by animals and our diet means we will eventually

59
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:35.950
have to deal with the gas emissions.
Luckily for those hooked on me,

60
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.270
clean solutions to reduce emissions from the livestock industry already exist.

61
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.340
All that's left is to implement them.
What about you,

62
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.500
would you say no to your meatball?
Pass it tonight.
