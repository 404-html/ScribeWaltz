1
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.483
Yeah,

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.390
<v 1>it might be the worst date on your weekly calendar,
but it's a date.</v>

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.780
You definitely don't want to stand up garbage day.

4
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.120
You Tie it all up into neat plastic bags,
hollered outside and like magic.

5
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.720
Your home smells fresh again and that makes you happy.
Yeah,

6
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.430
we believe in the magical world of trash,
out of sight,
out of mind,

7
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.850
but really we just hide it on in places like this.

8
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.270
<v 2>Did you know the world produces 1.2 billion tons of waste every year by the year</v>

9
00:00:35.181 --> 00:00:39.200
2100 will be producing 3.6 billion tons of waste.

10
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.480
How much longer can we rely on landfills?
What if we need more space?

11
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.920
How much would it cost?

12
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.030
What kind of infrastructure would we need and what could go wrong?

13
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.130
This is what if,
and here's what would happen if we sent our junk to space.

14
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.820
We've got a lot of junk on this planet and it's only getting worse.

15
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.750
So shooting our trash into space sounds like an easy,
obvious solution.

16
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.610
After all,

17
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.570
we've been going into space since the 1950s surely now it's easier than ever.

18
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.410
Yeah,
it's possible.
We can shoot our garbage into space,

19
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.030
but it certainly wouldn't be easy.

20
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.390
The operation would be astronomically expensive,

21
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.150
requiring millions of rocket launches every year,

22
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.670
which would not only be damaging to the global environment,

23
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.980
but could also hinder future space travel.

24
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.370
And all this is assuming that things go according to plan.

25
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.830
Since the start of the space age,
5,038 rockets have been launched into space.

26
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.990
We've sent probes as far as Neptune,

27
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.940
and in 2018 NASA sent a probe on a course to the outer atmosphere of the sun.

28
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.320
So in theory,
the solar system is that our disposal for our disposal.

29
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.990
But how would it work on Ariane?

30
00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:52.400
Five rocket carries a payload of up to 7,000 kilograms to a stable point in

31
00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:56.690
Earth's orbit.
It can do this at a cost of around $200 million,

32
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.100
but since the world produces one point 2 trillion kilograms of trash per year,

33
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.460
we need to launch about 168 million Arriann fives every year to keep the globe

34
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.190
garbage free.
And all this would cost,
oh,

35
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.630
only about 33 quadrillion dollars per year.
We don't have to tighten our belts.

36
00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:19.040
If we want to make this work.
Since worldwide GDP,
it's $77 trillion.

37
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.480
We're a bit short,
but we're not just short on cash.
We're short on resources.

38
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.250
91 orbital rockets were launched in 2017 which might sound like a lot,

39
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.550
but it's nothing compared to the 168 million launches.

40
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.650
We'd have to accommodate the bottom line.

41
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.080
If we want to send our garbage into the cosmos,

42
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.720
we'll need to start building a lot more spaceports,

43
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.600
a lot more launchpads and we've got to do it fast,

44
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.380
but suppose we somehow found a way to supply the infrastructure and foot the

45
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:47.540
bill.
There are some things we can't control.

46
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.830
Russia's Soyuz space launch system is the most successful of all time.

47
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.780
It's success rate is a stunning 97% for every 1000 lunches.

48
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.900
Now apply that percentage to 170 million launches when each rocket is carrying

49
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:04.120
more than 7,000 kilograms of garbage.

50
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.480
That 3% failure rate isn't so reassuring anymore.

51
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:11.800
Is it a few freak accidents a year could have a devastating impact on our

52
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:14.350
atmosphere.
Our oceans and our soil,

53
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.910
not to mention the fatalities and damages that we'd occur when burning plastics

54
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:20.710
and heavy metal or raining from the sky.

55
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.610
And what if a failed rocket was carrying nuclear waste in this space?

56
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.810
What if accidents and emissions from the space waste program made our world

57
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.540
uninhabitable?
Would we be beyond saving?

58
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.650
In 1978 NASA scientists,
Donald Jay Kessler,

59
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:40.360
theorize that the accumulation of space debris over time could become so dense

60
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.590
that we could no longer use satellites or for that matter,
leave Earth's orbit.

61
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.820
We would be trapped in a toxic world surrounded by our own garbage,

62
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.440
and we would decay as well.
We don't like to think about where our garbage goes.

63
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.060
We're just glad to see it disappear,

64
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.230
but of course we can't really make it disappear and we can't just shoot it into

65
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:02.350
space and hope it floats away because what if it comes back?

66
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.820
What would that look like?
Hmm,
that's a question for another.

67
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.720
What if.
