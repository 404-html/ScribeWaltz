00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.210
Where would I be without you,
Mr Mittens.

2
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.960
It's not a meme.
It's a fact.
We can't live without cats.

3
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.240
Do you know why disease,
famine,
cuteness,

4
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:24.420
withdraw,
and you don't have nine lives?

5
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.070
Do you think you could survive if you has no cheeseburger?

6
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.410
This is what if,
and here's what would happen if there were no more cats.

7
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.770
The goddess of war,
the King of the jungle,

8
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.570
the world's fastest creature and your home's biggest sleeper.

9
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.760
Go ahead,
call your cat lazy,

10
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.200
but keep in mind you're talking about the sixth most successful hunting animal

11
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.610
in the world.
Domestic cats kill 32% of their prey.

12
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.380
Compare that to the Tigers.

13
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:59.670
5% kill rate and you'll realize that Millie isn't just a cute little cuddle

14
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:01.920
monster.
She's a deadly assassin.

15
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.490
Cats sleep for roughly 16 hours a day and spend the rest of their time prowling,

16
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.050
hunting,
practicing,

17
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:14.280
and preparing for the worst worldwide rat infestation.

18
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.150
It's not really something we need to worry about.
I mean,
come on,

19
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.010
rats taking over the world.
That's impossible.
Not in a world without cats.

20
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.600
We humans like to give ourselves credit for being innovative and adaptable.

21
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.230
When it comes to solving the world's biggest problems.
And yet,

22
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.460
while rats may or may not have spread a plague that killed up to 200 million

23
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:36.240
people,

24
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.620
we still haven't come up with a foolproof way of controlling their numbers.
Sure,

25
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:42.570
there are rat traps and rat poisons,

26
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.370
but really cats do most of the work killing roughly 20 billion small mammals

27
00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:50.940
every year.
So without them,
we'd be sick,

28
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.020
starving and dying fast from cuteness withdrawal.

29
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.460
You know,
rats are gross,
but how gross put it this way,

30
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.140
one rad carries thousands of pathogens on just one centimeter of its for.

31
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.200
And any one of these pathogens can be fatal to you.

32
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.120
But what are your chances of getting sick?
Well,
at the rate rats reproduce,

33
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.830
the odds are stacked against you.

34
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.050
Did you know that one pair of rats can produce over 2000 offspring per year?

35
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.210
That means that within three years,

36
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.690
that same couple could have over half a billion descendants.

37
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.000
This isn't your average infestation.

38
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.170
It's an epidemic and it's not just rat bites that will make you sick.

39
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.110
Rat excrement can toxify the air you breathe,

40
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.740
causing your lungs to fill with fluid,
resulting in a quick death.

41
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.800
You might've made the infirmary but not famine.

42
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.380
There's a reason why farmers keep barn cats,

43
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.560
and that's to prevent an all out assault on grain stores.

44
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.860
Rats don't just go for cheese.
They go for everything.

45
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.120
Grain and produce are the staples we need and the food's rats.
Love.

46
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.330
Without cats,
there's a lot of rat mouths to feed.

47
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.890
Our agricultural systems would collapse.

48
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.950
And now with disease rampant and food scarce,

49
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.970
humans would be forced to scrounge for scraps,
kind of like rats.

50
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.520
But humans aren't the only ones who have to worry.

51
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.210
Rats are also responsible for 40% and 60% of all seabird and reptile

52
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:20.710
extinctions.
So if we're to stand a chance against this rapture,

53
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.130
we've got a band together.
Hand in Paul,

54
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.310
respect your cat and be grateful for the gifts that leaves on your doorstep.

55
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.710
The world would be bleak without their presence.
