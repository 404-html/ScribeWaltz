00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.570
You might not speak perfect cling on,

2
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.740
but you're probably familiar with science fiction and you probably know why it's

3
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:21.330
called fiction.
What would really happen if you went into space without a suit?

4
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.580
Would your blood boil?
Would your eyes pop from their sockets?
Would you explode?

5
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.070
What are the odds of survival?
This is what if,

6
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.610
and here's what would happen if you stepped into the vacuum of space.

7
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.240
Vacuums are pretty neat,
aren't they?
But do you know why?

8
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.050
Because they're able to create an internal air pressure that's lower than the

9
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:45.600
pressure outside leaving a void that needs to be filled,

10
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.140
generating section and pulling up all the dirt and dust in its path.

11
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.780
The vacuum then can be considered a very small,

12
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.980
very rudimentary simulation of voter space with an average of only a few

13
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:59.580
hydrogen atoms per cubic meter.
Outer space lacks molecules,

14
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.050
atmosphere and pressure.

15
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.010
If you introduce molecules to an area without an atmosphere,

16
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.040
they'll spread out as much as possible in order to fill the void.

17
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.540
So what do you think would happen to your molecules and outer space?
For now.

18
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.110
Let's just ignore the lack of oxygen that would kill you in about 60 seconds.

19
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.120
We'll start with embolism instead.

20
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.020
Embolism refers to the gas bubbles that form in bodily fluids and low

21
00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:26.430
environmental pressure.
At sea level,
water boils at 100 degrees Celsius,

22
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.910
but in space the boiling point is below human body temperature.

23
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.070
That means your blood would boil but no you wouldn't explode.
Luckily,

24
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.260
human skin is much too stretchy for that,

25
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.900
so you'd probably just swell up to twice your size.

26
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.120
Returning to the oxygen issue,

27
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.360
yours would be gone in about 15 seconds causing you to pass out,

28
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.600
looking to fill the deep void of space.

29
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.100
The oxygen molecules in your body would escape very quickly and even if you

30
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:55.380
tried holding your breath,
they'd still find a way out.

31
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.350
Looking beyond your body for a moment,

32
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.860
there's also a giant ball of piping hot plasma that could cause you a lot of

33
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:06.630
damage even if it is 150 million kilometers away on earth.

34
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.250
We've got an atmosphere to protect us,

35
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.610
but in outer space there isn't much that can help you against the suns.

36
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:16.260
15 million degree heat.
Not only would you suffer a wicked sunburn,

37
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.970
but the UV rays and the radiation would cause your genes to mutate and you'd

38
00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:24.390
almost certainly get cancer.
But there is an upshot.

39
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.250
Despite the intense coldness of space minus 270 degrees Celsius,

40
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:30.180
to be precise,

41
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.720
you wouldn't freeze to death since the vacuum of space would slow the heat

42
00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:34.800
transfer from your body.

43
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.760
It's possible you could even survive this whole ordeal as long as someone got

44
00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:40.590
you to safety within the first two minutes.

45
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.890
So if you're someone who likes to take their time to learn,

46
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.000
explore and understand,
maybe an unprotected spacewalk isn't for you.

47
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.810
Maybe this is a mission best experienced from the comfort of your home computer

48
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.930
or the palm of your hand.
But now that you can take a selfie and space,

49
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.030
what other crazy things where we get up to you?

50
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.960
We'll leave that for another episode of what if.
