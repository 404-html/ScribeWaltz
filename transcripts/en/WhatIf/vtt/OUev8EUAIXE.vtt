00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.920
Imagine the possibilities.
They would come with living forever.

2
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.630
You could spend more time with loved ones,
master a variety of careers,

3
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.890
and traveled the entire world.
If everyone on earth,
we're immortal,

4
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.630
we'd all have a chance to recover from our mistakes and our society could save a

5
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.740
ton of money on healthcare.
How close are we to achieving it?

6
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.120
And how would longer lifespans change the nature of our relationships?

7
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.910
Would we ever get bored of living?
This is what if,

8
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.990
and here's what would happen if humans were immortal.

9
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.110
First thing's first achieving a mortality.

10
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:46.300
The way it's portrayed in the movies where you can jump off a building and live

11
00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:49.740
to tell the tale is highly unlikely.
However,

12
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.060
in mortality where people don't die of old age could be right around the corner.

13
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.620
What our planet be able to handle a population of people with ever expanding

14
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:02.220
lifespans.
In silicon valley,

15
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.120
there's a movement of billionaires and biotech companies that are developing

16
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:10.320
drugs to eliminate aging and extend healthy lifespans indefinitely.

17
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.813
In their opinion,

18
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.960
playing around with genetics and reducing caloric intakes have already proven to

19
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:19.020
extend the lifespans of flies,
worms,
and mice.

20
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.430
So why couldn't it work for humans regardless of whether these efforts are

21
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:27.630
successful?
The real question is,
are we ready for longer lifespans?

22
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.690
There are almost 8 billion of us on this planet,

23
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.210
and if we all start living for centuries on end,

24
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.490
life is gonna look a lot different.

25
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.670
Just think of the social implications that would come along with that.

26
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.180
For starters,

27
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.140
the idea of being married to someone your whole life might become a thing of the

28
00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:50.141
past with a lifelong union potentially comprising upwards of 1000 years together

29
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.260
we might start looking at marriages as a bunch of longterm commitments we make

30
00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:55.190
throughout our lives.

31
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.490
Living longer would also mean we'd all be working a lot more.

32
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.360
No pension plan in the world would be able to support you if you stopped working

33
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:07.361
at 65 and then live to 500 longer careers would be a blessing and a curse.

34
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.370
On the positive side with so many skilled workers staying in the workforce,

35
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.390
our economy would be more productive than ever.
But on the other hand,

36
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.240
if people stayed in their positions for hundreds of years,

37
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.270
then there'd be no room for young people to find jobs and move up.

38
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.560
This sort of stagnation would become a problem in other areas like social

39
00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:28.394
progression.

40
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.480
If the same old thinking leaders from the 18th century never died or retired

41
00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:37.130
from power,
who's to say we'd ever be able to progress past problems like racial

42
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:41.970
segregation,
even if our society found a way to regulate it self,

43
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.410
what would the whole immortality experience be like for you as an individual?

44
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.320
If we had virtually endless days ahead of us,

45
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.140
wouldn't that take away a big part of what makes life special?

46
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.460
There'd be less incentive to make every day count,
and as a result,

47
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.120
we might end up with a bunch of unhappy people on our planet.
Oh,
and by the way,

48
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.800
that planet,
it's not getting any bigger.

49
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.290
It's just going to keep getting more crowded.

50
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.320
Earth already has an overpopulation problem,

51
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.330
and if the death rate slows to a halt,

52
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.980
then our resources are going to start running out quickly.
Suddenly,

53
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:18.160
the idea of immortality,
it doesn't seem so great after all.

54
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.760
Eventually we wouldn't have any room for new generations.

55
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.780
Maybe we'd have to start shipping people out to settle on other planets,

56
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.250
but that's a topic for another.
What else?
