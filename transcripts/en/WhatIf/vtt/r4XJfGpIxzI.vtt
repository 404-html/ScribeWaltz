00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.020
There was a time when our city streets sounded like this.
Today,

2
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:14.660
they sound like this,
but what will the streets of tomorrow sound like?

3
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:16.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.650
<v 1>By 2040 it's predicted that 35% of the world's cars will be electric,</v>

5
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.460
and from there it's only a matter of time before the internal combustion engine

6
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.450
sputters out for good.
How much will that change our world?

7
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.800
Could the electric car save our climate?
Will it improve our health?

8
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.020
What does today's data tell us about tomorrow?
This is what if,

9
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.120
and here's what would happen if all cars,

10
00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:45.121
when electric in 2017 carbon dioxide emissions in the United States for the

11
00:00:45.971 --> 00:00:50.710
lowest they've been since 1992 but at 5.1 billion metric tons,

12
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.510
there's plenty of room for improvement.

13
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.130
Fossil fuel cars and trucks accounting for nearly 30% of America's carbon

14
00:00:57.131 --> 00:00:58.750
emissions scientists,

15
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.110
experts in innovators have shown that electric is the way to go.

16
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.000
Electric cars are four times more efficient than gas powered vehicles.

17
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.180
That means that if everyone in the United States made the switch,

18
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.680
the country's carbon dioxide emissions would immediately drop by 8.4%

19
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.070
admittedly,
this wouldn't be an easy transition.

20
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.440
Since today's electric cars are on average,

21
00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:24.010
$20,000 more expensive than most other cars on the lot.

22
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.330
A country full of electric cars would see the demand for electricity jump pipe

23
00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:29.380
are 29%

24
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.990
but with more than half of American electricity being produced by fossil fuels

25
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.740
with the change even be worth it,
it seems like it.

26
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.700
In recent years,

27
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.020
the United States has been turning towards more renewable energy sources to

28
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:48.220
produce electricity and it looks like electric cars are going to become more

29
00:01:48.221 --> 00:01:51.550
convenient.
Car companies like Chevy,
Nissan,

30
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:56.500
and Tesla are set to reveal long range electric models for an affordable $30,000

31
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.200
with everyone driving electric greenhouse gases would go down while green energy

32
00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:05.570
and green jobs would go up.
Even today,

33
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.270
solar panel sales are doubling nearly every year.

34
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.300
Not to mention 50,000 Americans die prematurely every year from illnesses caused

35
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:14.760
by carbon

36
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.593
<v 0>missions.</v>

37
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.970
<v 1>Millions of healthcare costs could be saved by the electric car.</v>

38
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.690
But while all of this may sound too good to be true,

39
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.900
this what if might actually be closer to when electric car sales appear to be

40
00:02:29.221 --> 00:02:31.350
growing by 60% every year.

41
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.820
Ford's model t showed a similar growth rate around the time the car over took

42
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:36.654
the horse.

43
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.690
So buckle up and hold on tight because the future is coming up fast in time.

44
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:45.870
We'll see what the road of discovery has to offer,
but why wait?

45
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.840
Recharge yourself soon with some more.
What if.
