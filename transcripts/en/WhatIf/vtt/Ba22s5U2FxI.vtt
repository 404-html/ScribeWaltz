00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.380
If you were exposed to the harsh depths of space,

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.450
you'd lose consciousness in 15 seconds and be dead within 30 seconds to a

3
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:13.284
minute.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.240
But what if you're wearing an advanced powerful space suit will that would buy

5
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:22.320
you about six hours before your oxygen runs out and then you'd still be dead.

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.740
So what would happen to your body in space?

7
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.690
Would someone come to retrieve it or would it just keep floating through space

8
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:33.450
forever?
This is what if,

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.510
and here's what would happen if you died in space.

10
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.570
The human race has only lost 18 people in more than 50 years of space

11
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:43.404
exploration.

12
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.670
But with upcoming plans for civilian space travel and journeys to Mars,

13
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.240
odds are that we're going to be seeing a lot more space deaths.

14
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.390
How would we hold a funeral in zero gravity

15
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.080
and what complications would be involved

16
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.910
every time astronauts launching to space death is a genuine possibility.

17
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.840
They are essentially strapping themselves to giant rockets after all.

18
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.650
But because astronauts have to be in top notch health for a mission,

19
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.940
the odds of one of them dying on the International Space Station are pretty low.

20
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.720
So low that NASA doesn't even have an official policy for how to handle the

21
00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:26.070
situation.
According to former astronaut Chris Hadfield,

22
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.520
it would be up to the commander of the ISS to decide what to do.

23
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.180
The first problem at hand would be that there's nowhere to store the body.

24
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.060
Space stations don't come with builtin morgues.

25
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.410
One solution would be to keep the body in a pressurized suit and move it

26
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:43.290
somewhere cold,
dead bodies or biohazard.

27
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.550
So you'd want to keep the bacteria as far away and contained as possible.

28
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.230
But what if you don't like the idea of sharing your quarters with a stiff?
Well,

29
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.640
there are other solutions.

30
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
In 2005 a Swedish company proposed a system that essentially freeze dries bodies

31
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.780
and breaks them up into tiny pieces of frozen tissue,
kind of like a cremation.

32
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.720
This would take up far less space,

33
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.700
eliminate the whole biohazard threat and allow for an easier return to earth.

34
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.050
If you don't happen to have any liquid nitrogen aboard the ship to do the

35
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:19.560
freezing,
the ice cold temperature of space will do the trick.

36
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.990
Actually now that we mention it,

37
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.890
could the most obvious solution have been staring us in the face the whole time

38
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.500
sailors used to bury their dead at sea.

39
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.120
So couldn't astronauts do the same and send their debt off into space?

40
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.920
Theoretically,
yes,

41
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:39.921
but space is a little more complicated than the c unless you strapped a mini

42
00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:41.190
rocket to the deceased.

43
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.640
They would end up following the trajectory of the spacecraft from which they

44
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:48.480
were objected.
And if you did that with more than one person,

45
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.010
it would make for an unpleasant journey when you decided to turn back home.
Okay.

46
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:54.780
So maybe that's not the best option.

47
00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.220
So what if we waited until we reached our destination?
We bury people on Earth.

48
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:03.970
So surely we can do the same on other planets,
right?
Well,

49
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.530
the digging would be a little different,

50
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:08.950
but that wouldn't be our biggest problem.
Human bodies,

51
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.870
especially the nonliving variety,

52
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.850
are full of earthly microbes and bacteria that would contaminate any potentially

53
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:16.840
habitable locale.

54
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.970
Even the spacecraft's exploring Mars have to be repeatedly cleaned and sanitized

55
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.580
to protect the alien planet from earthly bugs.

56
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.140
So the only surefire way to safely dispose of a body there would be through

57
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:33.920
cremation.
I hope this hasn't ruined the majesty of space travel for you,

58
00:03:33.921 --> 00:03:38.240
but it's a reality we have to consider as we move further into the age of space

59
00:03:38.241 --> 00:03:42.560
exploration.
Maybe next time we'll focus on something a little more upbeat,

60
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.690
like what if cat's hair never stopped growing?
That's a topic for another.

61
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.530
What if.
