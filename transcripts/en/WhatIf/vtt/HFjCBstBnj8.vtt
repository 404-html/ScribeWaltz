1
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.143
Uh

2
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.773
Huh.

3
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.060
<v 2>What if this football,
field sized space rock and didn't make that term?</v>

4
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.830
What does it get moving towards us?
We need disintegrate in our atmosphere.

5
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.940
If not,

6
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.900
how much time would we have to get out of the danger zone and just how big would

7
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:37.940
that danger zone be?

8
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.450
Clear plan to have any chance of surviving the collision is what if,

9
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.360
and here's what would happen if an asteroid hit.
The earth.

10
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.750
Asteroids are hitting the earth all the time.

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.280
Every day space bombards us with about a hundred tons of dust and sand.

12
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.630
Car size asteroids make it to our atmosphere about once a year they burn up in

13
00:00:58.631 --> 00:01:01.120
the message sphere,
never reaching earth surface.

14
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.160
It's a massive 10 kilometer wide life threatening rocks like the one that wiped

15
00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:10.270
out.
The dinosaurs don't come by too often,
maybe once every few million years.

16
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.160
The ones we do have to worry about are asteroids the size of a football field

17
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.850
that actually make it to earth.
Surface meteorites,

18
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.060
they tend to come down to earth every 2000 years.

19
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.580
What if one of those was to hit us tonight?

20
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.830
The extent of an asteroid's devastation to our planet all comes down to where it

21
00:01:29.831 --> 00:01:33.880
lands.
Just 3% of our surface is populated.

22
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.500
That means in all likelihood,

23
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.240
97 asteroids out of 100 we'll just plunge into the ocean or flatten an

24
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.270
uninhabited forest somewhere in Siberia or northern Canada,

25
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.400
but three out of 100 asteroids would strick a populated city.

26
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.680
Imagine seeing a 100 meter long rock speeding towards you traveling at 30

27
00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:58.180
kilometers per second.
From the moment it past unharmed through the mesosphere,

28
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.970
it would take less than three seconds to crash down to earth.

29
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.190
For a city like New York,
that would mean over two and a half million casualties.

30
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.040
A huge fireball would destroy everything in a three kilometer radius and cause

31
00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:14.800
heavy damage to buildings within a seven kilometer radius.

32
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.310
Maybe it's not all bad,
ever hear of the media,
right?

33
00:02:18.311 --> 00:02:20.320
That slammed into the Russian city of Jellybeans.

34
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.830
That rock exploded with the force of 20 Hiroshima bombs and cost around $33

35
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.780
million worth of damage.
Well,
in our scenario,

36
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.180
the media right is five times bigger.

37
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.610
The freshly fallen space rock may pose the risk of whites,
red radiation.

38
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:37.860
If it were made up of radioactive heavy metals,

39
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.580
of course it wouldn't be as bad as a 10 kilometer wide ass right hitting the

40
00:02:42.581 --> 00:02:44.170
earth.
In that case,

41
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.070
the shockwave would be enough to wipe out a good chunk of humanity right away.

42
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.020
The earth would get a new crater over a hundred kilometers across and a ring of

43
00:02:53.021 --> 00:02:55.900
asteroid debris would give us a Saturn like appearance.

44
00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.850
Most of this debris would rain back down on earth setting cities and forest on

45
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:03.460
fire and cooking everything that's not protected.

46
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.170
You might want to invest in an underground bunker before this happens because on

47
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:10.300
the surface it will be very,
very dusty.

48
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.220
All this Dustin smoke would block the sunlight without the sun.

49
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.680
All plants and a lot of animals would die out

50
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.200
after about a year if the atmosphere would clear up,

51
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.550
but there would be very little food left for humans and if we were resourceful

52
00:03:25.551 --> 00:03:27.710
enough,
this will be the end of our race.

53
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.210
We would suffer the same fate as the dinosaurs did 65 million years ago.

54
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.070
The good thing is we have the atmosphere to protect us from most asteroids and

55
00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:39.710
NASA to keep an eye on all the space rocks flying around us.

56
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.210
Bad thing is it's sometimes hard to detect the incoming rock until it's too
late.

57
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.160
Tell us what you think.
Are you preparing for a sudden blast from space.
