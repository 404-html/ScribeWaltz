1
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.120
In their 4,000 year long history.
Toilets have been through a lot,

2
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.790
but I bet they've never seen something like this.

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.240
What if everyone on the planet coordinated to perform the biggest flush mob in

4
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:22.080
history,
pushing all the wastewater in the world down the drain all at once?

5
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.770
Could the world sewer systems handle this kind of flush apocalypse or with the

6
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:32.781
big flush clog up residential plumbing and flood your home with well waste.

7
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.700
This is what if,

8
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.870
and here's what would happen if everyone on earth flushed at the same time.

9
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.720
Don't be shy.
We humans spend about 13 months of our life going to the toilet.

10
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.360
Flushing may seem boring and routine,

11
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.000
but only for two thirds of the world's population.

12
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.920
About 2.4 billion people lack access to proper sanitation,

13
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.550
but that leaves us with over 5 billion flush mob participants.

14
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.960
What's the worst that could happen?

15
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.930
The effect of the big flush would be anywhere from not much happened to epic

16
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:11.550
pipe explosions and yes,
the waste could back up into your home.

17
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.740
The moment you flush your toilet,

18
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.010
your waste goes down the pipe and flows into a sewer system.

19
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.250
First it goes through a system of pipes under the street.

20
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.510
Then it runs into progressively bigger pipes all the way to your local

21
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:25.750
wastewater treatment plan.

22
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.760
The treatment plant pipes are designed to hold a whole lot of wastewater,

23
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.790
but are they big enough for everyone to flush at the same time?

24
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.000
That's not something we can know for sure until we try.
It could get ugly.

25
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.230
The first thing to get overwhelmed by the vast amount of waste would be the lift

26
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:44.064
stations.

27
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.090
These are stations that serve to push your waist uphill towards its final

28
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:52.590
destination,
the treatment plan,
but you can only push so much poop up the pipe.

29
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.850
Eventually the pipe gets overwhelmed and can't handle any more wastewater.

30
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.080
At that point,
it would back up to where it all started.
Your bathroom,

31
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.550
your toilet would begin to overflow with substances that were supposed to be

32
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:08.310
delivered to the treatment plant and it wouldn't stop there.

33
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.120
The overflow would fill up every wastewater line in your home,

34
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.810
including your shower,
your sink,
even your washing machine.

35
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.080
Not all of our pipes will be able to handle this excess.

36
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.970
Many will begin exploding underground and flooding the streets with waste.
Yeah,

37
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.350
that's quite a mess,
but it's not necessarily going to happen this way.

38
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.710
You see,
we might flush all our toilets simultaneously,

39
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.950
but that doesn't mean that the waste will make it to the sewer system in the

40
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:35.850
exact same time.

41
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.660
Your waist might have to travel a further distance than the waste of your friend

42
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:41.070
who's flushing two blocks away.

43
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.450
This means that the pipes might still be able to handle the flesh apocalypse

44
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.410
depending on how good the sewer system is,
where you live.
In that case,

45
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.310
the worst thing to come out of this flesh mob would simply be a big old waste of

46
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:56.790
water,
and while you're flushing freely without guilt,

47
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.030
some people live each day.
Without that luxury making do outdoors,

48
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.960
they might pollute their own water sources and get sick from waterborne
diseases.

49
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.030
If only we had a cure all for every illness,
would we become a mortal?

50
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.810
Well,
that's a question for another.
What else?
