00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.040
In some of the wealthiest corners of the world,

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.120
the very rich are putting their money towards building underground bunkers to

3
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:13.380
survive the apocalypse.

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.660
These subterranean safe havens are designed to withstand disasters like dirty

5
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:21.060
bombs,
pandemics,
and their aftermath.

6
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.940
But if humanity crumbles on the surface,

7
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.850
could you actually survive underground longterm?

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.520
How could you make sure you don't run out of food?

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.290
Where would you get your power and should you invite your friends?

10
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.510
This is what if,

11
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.930
and here's what would happen if we were forced to live underground.

12
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.950
First things first.
If we want to survive and our new underground homes,

13
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.070
it's going to take some serious planning and supplies.

14
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.120
You'd probably want a team with you to keep up with all the work required to

15
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:54.930
keep things going.
But even if you had all that,

16
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.410
could your mind handle all the psychological dangers involved

17
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.920
before we worry about anything else,

18
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.980
the first thing we need to figure out is how to power our bunker.
Well,

19
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.730
it's safe to assume that any cataclysmic event would have wiped out our power

20
00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:15.230
grid and any power workers are probably dead or hiding in their own bunkers.

21
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.340
So the obvious solution would be just to plop a bunch of solar panels down and

22
00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:21.620
then we'd be good,
right?
Not Exactly.

23
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.740
Depending on what the conditions are like above the surface,

24
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.060
solar panels may not even receive any sun and we probably couldn't venture out

25
00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:32.270
to maintain them.
Instead of looking up,

26
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.890
we might be better off digging further down to take energy from the earth
itself.

27
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.990
Geothermal energy is the heat of the earth extracted from hot water and rock.

28
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.880
It had probably be our best bet.

29
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.290
Once we got the lights on,
we need to focus on access to fresh water.
Again,

30
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.080
seeing that it's probably too dangerous to leave the bunker,

31
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.080
it's going to be more difficult than just setting something up to collect

32
00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:00.470
rainwater.
So we'll dig some more until we hit a source,

33
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.620
but we have to be very careful.
For one thing,

34
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.640
all this water would need to be purified before drinking and we'd also have to

35
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:11.420
contain the source to avoid flooding.
This is a bunker,
not an in ground pool.

36
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.270
All this digging would make us pretty hungry,

37
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.750
so we'd have to stock up on lots of canned food before bunkering down

38
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.340
nonperishable meals would do wonders,
but the supply would only last so long.

39
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.350
If we want it to outlast it,

40
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.730
we'd have to set up some hydroponic gardens to grow fruits and vegetables and

41
00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:32.990
we'd be best to bring some farm animals with us for food.
Hey,

42
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.790
we never said this had to be a small bunker.

43
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.920
One thing most people don't think of in these highly sophisticated survival

44
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:42.230
plans is what we would do with our poop.

45
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.440
If we just let our bodily waste pile up somewhere,

46
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.060
we're probably going to get sick real quick,
so why not put it to good use?

47
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.080
Our waists could be employed to fertilize the soil we wrote our vegetables with.

48
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.600
We just need to install some sort of ventilation.

49
00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.860
Even if we could all this out,

50
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.130
there's still one more thing we could fall victim to our minds because we

51
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:07.900
wouldn't be receiving our daily dose of sunlight.

52
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.980
We wouldn't get any vitamin D and that would make us depressed and irritable.

53
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.271
Add to that,

54
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:17.230
the fact that we'll all be cooped up in the same space and things could get ugly

55
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.243
pretty quickly.

56
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.140
So even though surviving underground is technically possible,

57
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.520
it would require extensive resources and would probably be pretty miserable.

58
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.090
But Hey,
these are billionaires trying to build bunkers right now,

59
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.440
so maybe one of them,
we'll figure out a way to safely replicate the sun's rays,

60
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.920
but that's a topic for another.
What if.
