<v 1>fireworks.
Cool.
Nuclear warfare is not a nuking the moon.</v>

3
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.430
It doesn't that sound just plain crazy.

4
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.670
What would happen?
Would we be able to see the blast?

5
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.250
How would we be affected by the followup when we even survive?

6
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.370
This is what if,

7
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.520
and here's what would happen if we detonated a nuclear bomb on the moon in 1957

8
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.080
the Soviet satellite Sputnik successfully orbiting Earth,

9
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.410
putting Russia ahead in the space race.
Not to be outdone,

10
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.810
the American government decided to nuke the moon.

11
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.220
The U s believed that a lunar explosion visible from Earth with showcase

12
00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:03.740
American firepower and improve morale at home.

13
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.150
How about it would seeing something like this in the sky give you peace of mind.

14
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.020
The most powerful nuclear bomb created,
it has a yield of 50 megatons of TNT,

15
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.050
the equivalent of 3,800 Hiroshima bombs.

16
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.790
Wondering how nuking the moon would affect humanity.
The short answer is this.

17
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.130
It wouldn't.
You're going to need a bigger bomb.

18
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.430
Roughly 10 trillion mega tons of TNT bigger.

19
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.540
An explosion that size would likely push the moon out of Earth's orbit.

20
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.190
Exposing us to meteors affecting our tides while catastrophic Lee affecting our

21
00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:40.040
seasons,
but that's what it for another time.

22
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.900
So while our bomb might not be able to knock the moon off its trajectory,

23
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.890
could our experiment drastically affect it's radiation levels?

24
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.870
That would be a big problem.

25
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.890
Among the many reasons the U s canceled the 1958 plan to nuke the moon,

26
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.310
apart from the worldwide disapproval was the idea that the nuclear followed

27
00:01:58.311 --> 00:02:02.150
would ruin the military's plans to colonize the moon by 1967

28
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.190
but our moon isn't like earth.
It's not protected by an ozone layer,

29
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.670
meaning it's directly exposed to cosmic rays and solar flares.

30
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.800
This results in high levels of space radiation on the moon surface and so much

31
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.850
of it,
the radioactive follow from a single nuclear explosion would hardly make a

32
00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:22.550
difference.
Interestingly,

33
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.360
NASA is still looking for a way around the Moon's radiation problem since it

34
00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:29.210
helps to build and staff a lunar base there in the near future.

35
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.160
If we didn't need it in a new,
on the moon,

36
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.060
the most damage we might do physically is add another crater to its surface,

37
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.660
which is ironic since the moon gets its craters from blocking meter rights

38
00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:39.494
heading for earth.

39
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.390
So maybe we should stop trying to attack it and be grateful for it's defenses

40
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.340
and the seasons and the tides

41
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.043
I made it.

42
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.260
The most damage we might do physically is add another crater to its surface,

43
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.840
which is ironic since the moon gets its craters from blocking meter rights

44
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.693
heading for earth.

45
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.560
So maybe we should stop trying to attack it and be grateful for it's defenses

46
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.570
and the seasons and the tides.
