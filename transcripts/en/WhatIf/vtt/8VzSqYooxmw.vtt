00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.780
What if humanity grew to be so technologically advanced that we were able to

2
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:13.380
leave our solar system and spread across interstellar space?

3
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.860
What'd we hop from one exoplanet to another,
colonizing everything in our way?

4
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.870
How could we make traveling across the universe possible and what would our

5
00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:25.610
space civilization look like?

6
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.690
This is what if and here's what would happen if humanity became an interstellar

7
00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:32.564
society.

8
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.760
No human has ever been outside of our solar system and only a few of us have

9
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:42.300
actually left the earth.
Even those who blasted out of here in a rocket,

10
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.040
it didn't go too far.
There are billions upon billions of planets out there,

11
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.820
but there's so far away.
It would take us a very long time to reach them.

12
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.300
If we jumped into the fastest spacecraft ever built,

13
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.530
it would take us over 70,000 years to get to our neighboring star system,

14
00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.580
Alpha Centaury.

15
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.170
Even if we could accelerate a spaceship to 99% the speed of light over 26,000

16
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:11.721
years would pass until we arrived at the center of our own galaxy and another 2

17
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.840
million years until we set foot in the nearest neighbor,
the Andromeda galaxy.

18
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.980
How could we go about expanding our civilization into space?

19
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.800
If for so terribly slow

20
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.040
to become an inter galactic civilization,

21
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.850
we'd need to break the speed limit of the universe,
but for all we know,

22
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.900
traveling at lightspeed is physically impossible.
Nevermind outperforming it.

23
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.160
The Universe is enormous,
possibly infinite,

24
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.330
and our lifespans are two miserably short to cover those kinds of distances,

25
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.800
even at near Lightspeed's,

26
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.010
but let your curiosity takeover and imagine we were a civilization that could

27
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:52.560
approach lightspeed and travel amongst stars.

28
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.560
We'd start with Alpha Centaury,
our neighboring star system.
Who knows,

29
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.700
maybe the exoplanet orbiting this three star system would turn out to be

30
00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:03.534
habitable.

31
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.880
Then we'd push ourselves out further to discover the billions of other worlds.

32
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.950
Not all of them would be suitable for us to settle in.
In astronomy.

33
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.420
A habitable world is a planet that has just the right distance from its sunlike

34
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:20.970
star to be able to sustain liquid water,

35
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.850
but the reality is humans require so much more than that atmosphere,

36
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.670
gravity,
temperature,
they're all important.

37
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.480
It's unlikely that we'd find another planet just like earth,

38
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.640
but we could build sustaining earthlike biomes on our giant space ships where

39
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:43.380
humans could live for generations
or we could tear a form,

40
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:48.060
some rocky exoplanets.
First we'd harvest water from a few ice comments.

41
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.220
Then we'd alter the planet's atmospheres to resemble Earth's anything to be able

42
00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:57.930
to breathe in fresh air again.
Even though space would be so accessible,

43
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.930
people wouldn't travel the universe much.
Once the new colonies were established,

44
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.730
even at the speed of light,

45
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.390
it would take generations to make a trip to the other side of the universe.

46
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.380
Spaces just too vast.
Remember in this new world,

47
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.490
you'd get to travel amongst stars.
Only a few were a part of a ship's crew,

48
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.950
a colonist or a space minor.

49
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.680
We'd send robots to perform our intergalactic chores.
Robots don't eat,

50
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.330
sleep,
or go to the bathroom.

51
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.200
They can withstand high levels of radiation and extreme temperatures,

52
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.570
all the things that would kill a human being.

53
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.450
But if space travel is something you crave,

54
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.430
considered pursuing a career as a postal carrier because the most reliable way

55
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:43.660
to communicate might be through the mail.
Surprised.
Well,

56
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.260
our satellites rely on radio waves to transmit information.

57
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.320
Even though these waves traveled just as fast as light,

58
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.840
they lose their strength over long distances.

59
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.930
It's like being too far away from your Wifi router.

60
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.560
If humanity did become an interstellar society,

61
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.640
we humans would end up spread out across hundreds of light years of space.

62
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.080
At least we'd give Earth a break and allow it to recover from our mistreatment.

63
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.230
Maybe we don't have to go so far.

64
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.940
Maybe we could create a new society on artificial planets that we built around

65
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:20.530
the sun,
but that's a story for another.
What if.
