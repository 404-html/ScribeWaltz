00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.490
Oceans cover roughly 70% of the earth's surface,

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.110
but so far humans have explored less than 1% of what lies beneath.

3
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.310
Now imagine instead of the oceans looking murky like this,

4
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.130
they were crystal clear like this.

5
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.460
What kind of creatures would we see and how would this clarity affect the

6
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:29.430
ecosystem?
This is what if,

7
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.640
and here's what would happen if the oceans we're transparent.

8
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.850
What makes these water's murky?
Well,

9
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.830
a number of things from floating sand phytoplankton and all sorts of living

10
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:42.450
organisms that aren't just fish.

11
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.180
But imagine if none of this was blocking your view,

12
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.170
you'd quickly be reminded of how much garbage we put into the ocean.

13
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.950
1.4 billion tons of trash is put into the ocean every single year in a clear

14
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:59.490
ocean,
you'd be able to see it clearer than ever.
Not only that,

15
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.860
but think of all the old shipwrecks you'd be able to see.

16
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.690
Hope you brought your scuba gear,

17
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.420
because buried treasure will be much easier to find.

18
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.850
And what about all the ships still afloat?

19
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.140
There are over 100,000 ships on the oceans at any given time.

20
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.970
And standing on the beach looking at them.

21
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.740
They all appear to be floating in midair and how many fish could you see?

22
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.720
Well,
not as many as you might think.
According to a research center in Lowestoft,

23
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:28.020
England,
the ocean has about 5 billion tons of fish in it.

24
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.780
That's enough to fill loch ness in Scotland,

25
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.450
but that's only a tiny percentage of earth's water,

26
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.470
nearly nothing when compared to the vast oceans.
That said,

27
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.280
you'd see a lot of fish,
definitely a lot more than what you're used to today,

28
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.870
but you'd also be surprised by the vast emptiness of the ocean and just how much

29
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:47.100
of nothing that you'd see.

30
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.450
People have been mapping out the ocean floor for decades and thanks to this,

31
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.410
we mostly picture it as a very bumpy,
sometimes mountain a surface,

32
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.810
but if the water was more transparent,

33
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.870
you'd quickly realize the ocean floor is quite smooth.

34
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.390
What kinds of things do you think you'd find on,

35
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.000
say the bottom of the Marianas trench?
No,
you probably won't see a cracking,

36
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.670
but you will see thousands of previously undiscovered species.

37
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.350
According to UNESCO,

38
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.580
roughly 150 new fish species are found in the ocean every year.

39
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.960
They suspect that within the next 30 years they'll have discovered nearly all of

40
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:26.430
them with a transparent ocean.
You could expect that to happen a lot sooner,

41
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.920
but with the water being crystal clear,

42
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.920
it's assumed that the ocean would be lacking in phytoplankton.

43
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.520
Since that's a large aspect of what makes the ocean either blue or green.

44
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.180
Without this organism,
fish could be in serious trouble.

45
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.100
Phytoplankton is one of the biggest resources for food for every single species

46
00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:48.330
in the ocean.
Fish feed off them constantly,
and without them,

47
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.490
the fish would have a much harder time surviving.

48
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.160
Only predators would have a real shot at lasting.

49
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.790
And how would all this sunlight entering the fishes home affect him?

50
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.500
The viability of 90% of all habitats within the ocean is dictated by the sun.

51
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.890
This habitable area is known as the photics zone.

52
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.050
This is where photosynthesis can occur and thanks to photosynthesis,

53
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.550
fish receive oxygen and are able to thrive in its current state.

54
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.210
Only certain parts of the ocean are considered to be in a photics zone.

55
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.860
These areas are generally less than 150 meters below the surface,

56
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.070
but if the oceans where to be completely transparent,

57
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.190
theoretically every part of the sea would be a photics zone.

58
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.910
Sunlight would continue down over 3,500 meters.

59
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.210
This would allow colonies of fish to live all over the sea.

60
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.010
That's if they manage to survive because the other thing that would happen if

61
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:45.400
sunlight traveled all the way to the bottom of the ocean is that the water would

62
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:46.234
warm up.

63
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.980
That's because all the sediment on the ocean floor would be absorbing more heat

64
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.260
than ever before.
At the extreme,

65
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.490
more sunlight in the ocean would increase the temperature enough to decrease the

66
00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:02.320
amount of oxygen in the water with less oxygen.
Fish would be in serious trouble.

67
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.320
You see,
fish need oxygen just as much as we do.

68
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.530
They take in water and extract it dissolved oxygen,

69
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.440
which fuels their cells with less oxygen in the water.

70
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.250
Vast numbers of fish could die,
so are super clear.

71
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:18.340
Ocean may look even more beautiful and exciting that it does now,

72
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.020
but it wouldn't last loud.

73
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.250
Maybe we should just be happy with the murky water we have after all.

74
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.480
Look at all we've seen,

75
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.440
but imagine if we didn't have oceans that they just disappeared.

76
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.870
What would happen then?
That sounds like a story for another.
What if.
