00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.660
Welcome to a world of teleportation where you can wake up in a remote corner of

2
00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:11.660
the world,

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.550
teleport to work in Tokyo and end your day by catching the opera in Rome.

4
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.710
This idea of beating yourself from one location to another used to be just the

5
00:00:21.711 --> 00:00:22.940
stuff of science fiction,

6
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.410
but now scientists are starting to uncover the technologies that can make it a

7
00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:28.244
reality.

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.990
Would it be dangerous and how would it change the look of our planet?

9
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.110
This is what if,
and here's what would happen if teleportation was possible.

10
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.220
The most likely way that humans will start teleporting will be through something

11
00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:45.020
called quantum teleportation.

12
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.670
Quantum teleportation involves scanning an object and transmitting it's

13
00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:54.320
information to another location where that information is used to reassemble the

14
00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:56.720
object from different molecules and atoms.

15
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.900
But would this work for entire human bodies?

16
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.790
The prospect of human teleportation could lead to a pretty different looking

17
00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:05.720
life.
For you and me,

18
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.800
our bridges and roads could become desolate.

19
00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:14.801
Wastelands dense cities might become a thing of the past and space exploration

20
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.140
might accelerate at a pace we're not ready for,

21
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.940
but before we get too far ahead of ourselves,

22
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.010
let's look at how this would actually work.

23
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.150
It all starts with a little thing called quantum entanglement.

24
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.010
Quantum entanglement involves linking particles together and keeping them

25
00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:35.480
connected even across vast distances.
When particles are entangled,

26
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.560
it means that they're forced to hold mutually exclusive states.

27
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.430
So if we know the state of one,
then we'll know the state of the other.

28
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.050
Think of it like this.

29
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.800
If you ordered a beef burger and a chicken burger from a fast food place,

30
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.310
you wouldn't be able to tell which one is which without opening the boxes.

31
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.710
But once you open one box,

32
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.000
you automatically know what's in the other one and that knowledge doesn't change

33
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.230
no matter how far away the other boxes.
Yeah,
it's complicated.

34
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.460
But the main takeaway for us is that once two or more particles are entangled,

35
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.500
we can teleport information between them.

36
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.510
Researchers in China have already proven this to work by transferring properties

37
00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:16.970
of a particle to a satellite in space.

38
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.370
But how does that translate to teleporting human beings?
Well,

39
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.670
every human body is made up of billions upon billions of atoms and each Adam is

40
00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:32.930
a set of data describing the Adam location,
energy state,
and so on.

41
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.370
So theoretically we should be able to scan the atomic information of a human

42
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:42.371
body teleported to a far off location and rebuild the body just the way it was.

43
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.510
But of course it can't be that simple to find out the physical state of every

44
00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:51.590
atom that makes you you,
you'd have to disintegrate your entire body.

45
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.320
That means that every time you teleport,

46
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.610
you'd essentially be committing suicide and getting reborn on the other end.

47
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.860
Quantum entanglement is a finicky process to say the least,

48
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.270
and no one is ever transmitted this much information.
So at this point,

49
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.780
human teleportation would most likely be a pure suicide mission,

50
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.150
but the fundamental technology is there and will only continue to develop.

51
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.540
So don't give up hope yet.
Maybe someday,

52
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:22.960
soon we'll be able to teleport across the world in seconds.

53
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.590
And international borders would disappear because they could no longer be

54
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:27.424
enforced.

55
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.110
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

56
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.960
<v 1>but that's a topic for another.
What if.</v>
