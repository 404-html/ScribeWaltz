00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.060
What if the moon's suddenly began getting closer to Earth,

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.120
to the point where it was on a collision course with our planet.

3
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.980
Would earth survive the crash for what a crash even happened with the moon get

4
00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:18.560
torn up by Earth's gravity?

5
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.140
What would this crumbled up moon look like from earth?
This is what if,

6
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.700
and here's what would happen if the moon fell to earth.

7
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.330
The Moon is earth's only natural satellite and the largest object to brighten

8
00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:33.164
our night sky.

9
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.930
It's the first and only place beyond earth where humans have set foot.

10
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.310
The Moon's gravitational pull causes tides on earth.

11
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.060
Tides that might've been the encouragement for life in our oceans to move on

12
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:49.560
land.
This pool also keeps Earth from wobbling on its axis,

13
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.130
making our climate relatively stable.
In short,

14
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.410
the moon makes earth a more livable place.

15
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.730
So what if it's suddenly spit up and started driving the nurse direction?

16
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.730
The Moon's plan to destroy Earth by bumping into it would break into pieces.

17
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.450
The moment it reaches the Roche Limit,
the moon itself would shatter,

18
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.320
never making it to Earth surface,
and that's going to look very impressive.

19
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.580
The wait.
What does this Roche limit in celestial mechanics?

20
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.730
It's the point at which the gravity holding a satellite together,

21
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.080
he's weaker than the tidal forces trying to pull it apart.
In other words,

22
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.290
the moon can only get as close as 18,470 kilometers away from our planet before

23
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.240
boom,
the tidal forces would tear it apart.

24
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.300
All of the footprints and flags we've left on the moon,

25
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.050
all of its craters and valleys with scatter to form a breathtaking ring of

26
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:44.220
debris above Earth's equator,
37,000 kilometers in diameter,

27
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.510
making earth the second planet in the solar system after Saturn to have this

28
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:52.830
striking ring of beauty.
The difference being that our rings wouldn't last long.

29
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.520
The chunks of our former satellite,
the moon would rain down on earth.

30
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.240
It would be as if hundreds of thousands of asteroids were falling down on us and

31
00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:02.580
wiping out entire city's in the process.

32
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.360
Once the moon began his trajectory towards the planet,

33
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.760
it would increase the title impact it has on us.

34
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.650
By the time it hit the Roche limit,

35
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.100
it would be causing tides as high as 7,600 meters.

36
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.780
Our world would be devastated by an army of tsunamis 10 times a day,

37
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.770
but for a short time,
hardcore surfers would enjoy riding some tasty waves.

38
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.910
On the other hand,
this might be a solution to global warming.

39
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.350
With the moon coming closer and closer,
Earth's rotation would speed up.

40
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.690
Our days will become shorter and shorter.

41
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.380
Global temperatures would go down and no one would worry about climate change

42
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:40.650
anymore.
Unless asteroids burned the earth to a crisp,

43
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.720
then there would be no one to worry about anything.

44
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.020
I really wouldn't worry about it anyway.
In fact,

45
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.620
the mood is drifting away from us at a rate of four centimeters per year,

46
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.340
so it's unlikely we'll get to see those pretty Saturn like rings here on earth.
