1
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.610
Saturn's largest moon.
Titan is unique.

2
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.210
It has its own atmosphere.
Not only that,

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.800
it's the only planet or moon other than earth to have bodies of liquid on its

4
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:21.240
surface.
Would it be possible to take a dip in one of these lakes?

5
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.650
What would the liquid feel like and how far could just whip?

6
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.010
This is what if,
and here's what would happen if you could swim in Titan's lakes.

7
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.970
Titan is the second largest moon in our entire solar system.

8
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.450
It's bigger than our moon and even bigger than the planet mercury.

9
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.410
Despite being so large,
Titan has a weak gravitational pull.

10
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.820
Let's say you weigh 70 kilograms here on earth,
on Titan,

11
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.580
you'd wait just 10 unfortunately,

12
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.120
this means you won't be doing any epic cannon balls into Titan's lakes.

13
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.640
If you could find a cliff to jump off,

14
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.120
it would take you quite a while to float down to the surface of the liquid,

15
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.040
but when you finally reached the lake,

16
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.610
you'll plummet to the bottom extremely fast.

17
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.750
The reason you'd have such a hard time keeping your head above the surface is

18
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:13.080
due to the liquid methane and ethane found in Titan's lakes.

19
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.980
The density of liquid methane is much,
much lower than water,

20
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.360
so you wouldn't be as buoyant.

21
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.650
Swimming on earth is easy because humans aren't as dense as water.

22
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.540
When we're in a swimming pool,

23
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.890
we weigh less than the amount of water that we displace and the force of the

24
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:33.360
water pushing back on us helps to keep us afloat.
In Titan's lakes,

25
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.200
your body would be much more dense than the liquid methane you're attempting to

26
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:42.120
swim in.
It would feel as if you were made of stone on the surface of the lake.

27
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.700
The liquid methane would appear completely clear,

28
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.810
but you still wouldn't be able to see two deep due to the dark rock and thick

29
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:51.210
atmosphere on the moon.
In fact,

30
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.410
Titan only receives 1% of the sunlight we receive here on earth.

31
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.250
I should remind you that you wouldn't even get this far without wearing a

32
00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:00.210
special space suit.

33
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.140
It would have to be strong enough to withstand the temperature of Titan's

34
00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:08.280
surface,
a frosty 178 degrees below zero.

35
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.360
You'd also need it to protect you from the lack of oxygen on the mood,

36
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.560
the deadly levels of nitrogen gas and the gasoline like rains.

37
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.680
Okay,
back to you being underwater or under liquid methane from the bottom of the

38
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:27.060
lake.
To get back up to the surface,
you'd need to swim up 200 meters.

39
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.920
Once he reached the surface,

40
00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:31.950
you'd quickly realize just how big the lake you're in is.

41
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.410
This is cracking Maray,

42
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.550
which is 400,000 square kilometers for reference.

43
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.500
That's bigger than the Caspian Sea,

44
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.730
the largest lake on earth and bigger than the entire country of Japan.

45
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.710
If you don't like this lake,

46
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.700
you have over 50 other lakes to choose from depending on what kind of view

47
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:54.960
you're interested in.
Unfortunately,
there's no surfing on these lakes.

48
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.170
You won't find any waves on titan as it's low gravity makes it resistant to

49
00:02:59.171 --> 00:03:03.670
creating them,
so all in all,
not a great day at the beach.

50
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.170
Swimming in these lakes would be pretty tricky and not a lot of fun.

51
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.610
On top of that,

52
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.970
it's not likely that you'll be able to relax on the shore or Suntan.

53
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.760
Maybe it isn't the best vacation spot,

54
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:19.180
but you certainly can't deny the beautiful view.
Now,

55
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:22.630
what would happen if you were a space tourist and could travel anywhere you

56
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:27.220
wanted?
Well,
that sounds like a question for another.
What if.
