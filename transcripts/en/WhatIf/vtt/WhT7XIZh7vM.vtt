00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.790
In November,

2
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.050
1884 the New York Times ran a pretty interesting story and astronomer,

3
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.040
known only by the name,

4
00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:15.790
aren't claimed to have discovered a cubic planet just beyond the orbit of

5
00:00:15.791 --> 00:00:18.550
Neptune.
Less than 100 years later.

6
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.630
Another discovery was made this time by a man who not only named the planet,

7
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.490
but who also had maps and sketches of it's alien lifeforms,
coincidence,

8
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.630
crazy,
or are cubic planets possible?

9
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.890
Could humans live on a cubic world?
How would our climate change?

10
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.640
How would gravity be effected?
Could we stand it?

11
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.140
This is what f and here's what would happen if the earth was a cube,

12
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.240
all planets around,
but have you ever wondered why?
Let's go back in time,

13
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.160
say four and a half billion years ago,

14
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.440
a big cloud of gas and dust called a nebula collapsed to form a hot star,

15
00:00:56.441 --> 00:01:00.340
which through its gravitational pull attracted all nearby matter and formed a

16
00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:04.570
large rotating disk around its center.
After more than just a few collisions,

17
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.620
the matter orbiting the young son eventually grew into massive bodies with

18
00:01:08.621 --> 00:01:10.300
strong gravitational centers.

19
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.770
They formed planets inside any given planet,

20
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.800
gravity pulls equally from all sides towards its center.

21
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.140
This accounts for their spiritual shape.

22
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.520
So because the earth we live on is a sphere and its gravitational pull is the

23
00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:28.120
same wherever you go.
It means that as long as you're on a flat surface,

24
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.740
you'll be standing straight and tall.

25
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.250
But what do you think happens when you skewed the distribution of gravity?

26
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.090
So you want to live life on the edge,
then pick a side.

27
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.870
The earth has six faces now,
but sadly none of them or any fun.

28
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.860
That's because anywhere you go is going to feel like you're climbing up a steep

29
00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:49.540
hill on the cube earth.
Gravity is strongest at the center of each of its faces.

30
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.840
So the further you are away from the center,
the more you'll feel it's Paul.

31
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.140
Hope you didn't take standing tall for granted.

32
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.640
The landscape along the earth's edges would be rocky and barren since all the

33
00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:04.270
water would be pooled at the center of each face and the atmosphere of quality

34
00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:07.840
along the earth's edges and corners would be too fin to support life or

35
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.240
nonexistent.
We'll come back to that later.

36
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.240
The new climate would depend on how the earth rotates.

37
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.440
If r cubed planet rotated on an access through two of its faces than the climate

38
00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:20.500
would be kind of how it is right now on earth,
only more extreme.

39
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.090
The top and bottom phases would be polar while the remaining four sides would

40
00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:27.430
enjoy an equatorial climate.
However,

41
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.100
if the earth was a cube that rotated through its corners,

42
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.350
then each side would have a temperate climate.

43
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.190
You could say goodbye to extreme temperatures and precipitation.
Sadly,

44
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.360
that means saying goodbye to your equatorial fantasy world too.
On the plus side,

45
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.030
you might just be able to walk into outerspace.

46
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.020
Since our atmosphere has held down by gravity and since gravity is now pulling

47
00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:48.820
from the center of each of Earth's faces,

48
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.980
it means that the atmosphere would be thicker,

49
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.820
where gravity is strongest and thinner towards the edges.
What's more,

50
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.000
if the cubic earth had the same volume as are rounded world today,

51
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.350
then it's sharp.
Steep corners would actually poke out beyond our atmosphere.

52
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.770
These areas would be unprotected and therefore uninhabitable.

53
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.400
But who says he couldn't rent a space suit and stand on top of the world and

54
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:12.250
outside of it at the same time?
Would you do it?

55
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.790
What else could you do on a cubic planet?
Could you adapt?

56
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.940
What would we call ourselves on this six sided earth?

57
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.690
Cubists Cubans will never find out,

58
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.610
and that's probably for the best,

59
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.020
but we'll keep trying things out as long as you're curious new episodes of what

60
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:32.500
if,
or coming soon.
So be there or be square.
