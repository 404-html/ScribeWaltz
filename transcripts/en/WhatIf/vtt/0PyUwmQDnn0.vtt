00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.830
You've seen politics and national borders change all the time,

2
00:00:08.831 --> 00:00:13.360
but have you ever witnessed a continent literally breaking apart?

3
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.770
Well,

4
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.770
it's possible and it's happening to Africa right now in 2005 a 60 kilometer long

5
00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:26.560
stretch of the continent cracked open over a period of just 10 days and it

6
00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:28.240
hasn't stopped expanding since.

7
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.960
Eventually the landmass will break right off giving birth to a brand new ocean.

8
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.240
How soon will this happen and what does it mean for the people of Africa?

9
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.060
This is what if,

10
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.050
and here's what would happen if the African continent broke apart.

11
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.120
The face of our planet is continually changing thanks to the shifting of

12
00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:53.170
tectonic plates,

13
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.500
but it's rarely this noticeable in the years since 2005 more cracks in the earth

14
00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:02.470
have opened up in several countries throughout the African continent,

15
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.510
sparking fear among their populations,
but as scary as the fractures may seem,

16
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.740
experts say they could teach us a lot about how our world was formed.

17
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.310
Have you ever heard of the east African rift?

18
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.660
Neither of most people in Ethiopia until the ground started cracking beneath

19
00:01:19.661 --> 00:01:20.494
their feet.

20
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.330
The East African rift is an active continental rift zone in east Africa.

21
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.940
And judging by the blank look on your face,

22
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.140
it may require more of an explanation before we go any further.
Okay,

23
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.360
so the rigid outer layer of the earth is called the lithosphere and it's broken

24
00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:39.430
up into many tectonic plates.

25
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.120
Tectonic plates are basically large slabs of solid rock that move relative to

26
00:01:45.611 --> 00:01:50.170
each other at varying speeds.
When these plates move apart from each other,

27
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.930
they cause fractures to be formed at their boundaries.

28
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.090
The land remaining in between the two plates starts to sink and forms what's

29
00:01:58.091 --> 00:01:59.440
known as a rift valley.

30
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.520
This can lead to new boundaries being created between plates.

31
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.160
In the case of the east African rift,

32
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.420
the African tectonic plate is breaking up into two smaller ones,

33
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.970
the Malley and Nubian plates.

34
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.910
So what happens when these plates completely break off from each other?
Well,

35
00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:19.570
for one thing,

36
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.800
we won't be around to see it despite the rapid appearance of the surface cracks.

37
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.270
Geologists say that the continent won't fully break apart for about 10 million

38
00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:29.104
years.

39
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.950
They're currently spreading apart at a rate of six to seven millimeters a year,

40
00:02:32.951 --> 00:02:37.900
so don't hold your breath.
As the plates continued to pull away from each other,

41
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.910
the rift valley will sink deeper and deeper and water from the Red Sea will

42
00:02:42.911 --> 00:02:44.950
flood in to create a new ocean.

43
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.710
Africa will become a lot smaller as parts of southern Ethiopia and Somalia will

44
00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:52.690
drift off to form a new island.

45
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.040
What does this mean for all of us in the meantime?
Well,

46
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.850
African residents who live along the rift expect more disturbances,

47
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.800
cracks in their highways and cities,

48
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:06.130
and the emergence of vast canyons where there weren't any before,

49
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.520
but it's not all bad news.
In fact,

50
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.210
most geologists are pretty excited about studying the whole process.

51
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.490
They believe it can lead to some pretty groundbreaking information about how our

52
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.990
earth surface is shaped and how earthquakes and volcanic eruptions work.

53
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.370
One day,
all of our continents will look completely different,

54
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.930
but that's a story for another.
What if.
