00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.020
What if someday we decided that the usefulness of our planet had run its course

2
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.440
and humans needed to scour space to find somewhere new to live,

3
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.510
but instead of finding a potentially habitable earth like exoplanet light years

4
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:22.830
away,
we'd build our own artificial world right here in the solar system.

5
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.210
What kind of technology would we need to manufacture a new planet?

6
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.830
Where would we find enough raw materials for our future world and how long would

7
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:34.860
it take us to finish this planetary construction project?

8
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.920
This is what if,
and here's what would happen if we built an artificial planets.

9
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.470
Rocky planets like earth are born from the leftover material of a newly formed

10
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:51.300
star.
They start off as grains of dust smaller than the width of a human hair.

11
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.790
These grains fuse into larger chunks that keep colliding with each other until

12
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.930
after a few million years they develop into a new terrestrial world.

13
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.750
Theoretically,
we understand how planets are formed in the universe,

14
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.380
but how would we go about manufacturing an artificial one?

15
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.570
If we humans were to build a planetary replica and populated,

16
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.930
we'd have to churn out a rock with an atmosphere of breathable air,

17
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.670
the right temperature,
earth like gravity and a stable orbit around the sun,

18
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.440
and that's just for starters,

19
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.810
we'd start the construction in the son's habitable zone that would help us

20
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:32.600
maintain earth like temperatures on our artificial planet,

21
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.390
but where would we find all the materials to build it?

22
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.390
Asteroids might seem like a good source.

23
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.940
The problem is the earth has the mass of over 2000 asteroid belts.

24
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.930
There's simply not enough asteroids in the solar system to build a new earth

25
00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:51.830
size world,
but there could be enough materials in the Oort cloud.

26
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.960
The swarm of icy debris that hypothetically exists in the outer most reaches of

27
00:01:56.961 --> 00:02:01.730
the solar system with this cloud is so far away that even voyager one that's

28
00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:06.731
been traveling at 17 kilometers per second for the past 41 years won't reach it

29
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:11.810
for another 300 years and it won't make it to the other side of the Oort cloud

30
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.730
for about 30,000 years.

31
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.840
We'd need to build some faster spacecraft to get all that dust and nudge it in

32
00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:22.400
the right direction.
We could also start stealing moons from other planets.

33
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.650
All of Jupiter's moons,
for example,

34
00:02:24.651 --> 00:02:29.030
would give us enough material to craft a planet about 7% the size of earth.

35
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.620
That would be a good start.

36
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.050
If we could manage to pull them out of Jupiter's orbit.

37
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.890
It wouldn't be necessary to build our new world as big as the earth to replicate

38
00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:40.840
the same force of gravity we feel.
Now,

39
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.220
if we could pack one 10th of the Earth's mass into a sphere the size of the
moon,

40
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.740
it would do the same trick.
Still,

41
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.280
it would take us at least several hundred years to finish the construction.

42
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.600
Once all the engineering issues were solved and our newly formed artificial

43
00:02:56.601 --> 00:03:00.040
planet settled into orbit around the sun,
we'd dump in some water.

44
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.920
We'd let it evaporate,
create the atmosphere.

45
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.090
We could even inject some of the carbon dioxide released by polluting industries

46
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:10.060
on earth.
Then we bring in the plants.

47
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.410
Plants would slowly build up oxygen in the atmosphere through photosynthesis.

48
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.770
Finally,
after Millennia of planet building,

49
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.480
the first human colonies with set foot on the new terrestrial human made planet.

50
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.240
Even though it would be smaller in size,

51
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.440
the earth's replica wouldn't see much different from the original earth like

52
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:32.590
temperatures and gravity would make it feel like our home planet,

53
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.020
but it wouldn't be a stable as the earth.

54
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.000
Our artificial world would require active maintenance from the planetary

55
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:43.930
environment to our orbital parameters.
Currently,

56
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.830
there's so much we don't know about the universe and we can only guess how a new

57
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:50.350
planet would form within it.
At this point,

58
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.280
it may be easier to terraform and existing world instead of building a totally

59
00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:58.420
new one,
but that's a story for another.
What if.
