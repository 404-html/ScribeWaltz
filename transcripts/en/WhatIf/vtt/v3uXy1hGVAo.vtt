00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.850
What if your reality was nothing more than a complex computer simulation?

2
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.420
How would you know what kind of technology could make the simulation possible?

3
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.800
And how could you break out of the Matrix?
This is what if,

4
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.250
and here's what would happen if you were living in a simulation.

5
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.570
This is what the very first computer games looked like and this is what they've

6
00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:35.821
come to look like after some 50 years of technological progress today,

7
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.080
it only takes a virtual reality headset to jump into a computer simulated realm.

8
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.960
Our future computers may be able to generate entire simulated universes,

9
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.920
and if we humans,
we're able to simulate complex realities.

10
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.870
How can we ever be sure that our own world wasn't just a computer simulation

11
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.110
designed by another more advanced civilization?

12
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.500
Everything and the world we live in seems to be based on mathematical laws.

13
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.440
Even our genetic code has a mathematical model.

14
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.490
Just like if someone had programmed our reality with a computer code,

15
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.170
see where I'm going with this?

16
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.550
We may be living in a giant video game without realizing it,

17
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.890
but who designed this matrix and advanced alien civilization?

18
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.810
Maybe not aliens,

19
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.950
but a future iteration of humanity simulating the lives of their ancestors,

20
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.640
which would make you a living memory of someone else's.
Great,
great,

21
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.870
great grandmother.

22
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.360
This future humanity would require extremely powerful supercomputers to run the

23
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:42.400
simulation down to the subatomic level,

24
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.600
much more powerful than the most advanced super computer we could imagine.

25
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.920
If we ever got to this level of technological advancement and started running

26
00:01:50.921 --> 00:01:52.480
computer simulations of our own,

27
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.790
that would be very strong evidence that our reality was also simulated a

28
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.310
simulation creating their own simulation.

29
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.780
Chances are our creators would turn out to be someone else's simulation

30
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.910
in the many,
many simulations from the original reality on down.

31
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.050
Each subsequent simulation would turn out less and less advanced.

32
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.680
They just wouldn't be able to match their creators in advancing their

33
00:02:17.681 --> 00:02:21.040
technologies.
If your life was a simulation,

34
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.790
you would know just like there's no proof that you're not living in a
simulation,

35
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.010
but you could try looking for the glitches.
If our world was some computer code,

36
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.250
it could have software bugs every now and then when our simulators decided to

37
00:02:35.441 --> 00:02:39.280
roll it,
update,
something could slip sideways.
It could be a glitch,

38
00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:40.690
like meeting your doppelganger.

39
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.270
Someone who looks like you put isn't related to you.

40
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.840
It might just be a mix and character appearance preferences.

41
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.830
If we ever found out that we were a program on someone's hard drive,

42
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.450
it could be because that's someone wanted us to,
in that case,

43
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.510
escaping the simulation would be well simulated.

44
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.630
We just end up on another level of the Matrix.

45
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.070
Maybe discovering the identity of our creators would make them reboot the
system.

46
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.400
A big control,
alt delete for the entire universe.

47
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.470
Reality may not be a quantum computer simulation,
but if it is,

48
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.960
would it change anything in your day to day life?

49
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.100
Maybe one day we'll discover that we live in the multiverse,

50
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.700
but that's a story for another.
What if.
