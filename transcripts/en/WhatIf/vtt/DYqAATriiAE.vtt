1
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.523
Okay.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.950
<v 1>It feels as if the world is moving at a faster rate than ever.</v>

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.200
Every day smartphones are getting smarter,

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.580
AI is becoming more intelligent and our environment seems to be getting worse

5
00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:18.780
every year.
If you were to travel 50 years into the future,

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.620
what would the world look like?
Would robots have taken over everything?

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.270
Would we still be living on earth?
Would alien life finally be discovered?

8
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.460
This is what f and here's what would happen if you lived 50 years in the future.

9
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.990
Look down at your phone and think how far technology has come in the last 10

10
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:41.040
years.
Have you ever imagined what tech might look like in 50 years?

11
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.020
What about your family and friends?
What will happen to them in 50 years time?

12
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.710
We might actually look back and laugh at how we used to have to hold our phones.

13
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.720
How primitive instead our smartphones will either be worn or implanted in us

14
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.860
through contact lenses.

15
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.210
Imagine being able to have your gps in bedded in your vision instead of having

16
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:03.930
to look down at your phone.
But although this all sounds nice,

17
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.340
there will be problems too.

18
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.520
If you don't want to fast forward yourself into the future because you're

19
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:11.760
worried that your family might not be around where you can rest easy.

20
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.290
Knowing that in 50 years the average life expectancy will be about 80 to 90

21
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:19.350
years.
That's over 10 years longer than it is today.

22
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.240
Since the 1960s our population percentages have always looked like a pyramid,

23
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.440
but 50 years into the future,
that pyramid will look more like a rectangle.

24
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.940
This means that there will be an equal percentage of senior citizens to
toddlers.

25
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.400
This will have a huge effect on the economy.

26
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.240
Grandma and GRANDPA will be retiring much later and when they do,

27
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.470
they'll seniors' homes are going to be packed with more people in the workforce.

28
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.380
Jobs will be harder to find.
Just graduated school,

29
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.810
expect to live at home with mom and dad a bit longer,

30
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.240
especially since AI is expected to be working over 800 million of our former

31
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:54.910
jobs.

32
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.490
By 2030 the world's population will be at an all time high.

33
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.511
By this time,

34
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:04.020
the population of earth will have reached a staggering 9 billion people.

35
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.450
More people means more problems.

36
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.290
There will be a much higher probability of food shortages as we try to grow

37
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:13.440
crops to feed everyone due to increasing temperatures.

38
00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:15.270
Crops will be harder to grow as well.

39
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.840
And with 70% of the world's population living in cities,

40
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.950
crowding will lead to more diseases being spread and being spread faster.

41
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.460
As for the environment,
well that doesn't look too good either.

42
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.840
The Amazon rain forest will continue to be deforested and in 50 years time,

43
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.130
half of it will be gone.

44
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.640
Don't expect you to come back either increasing climate change,

45
00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:37.620
we'll render it a parched shrubland.

46
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.600
Higher temperatures will cause the polar ice caps to melt to less than 50% of

47
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:43.440
what they are today.

48
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.850
And the Dead Sea may actually live up to its name as its water will continue to

49
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:52.740
evaporate.
Thinking about visiting American cities like New Orleans,
Miami,

50
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.380
and Houston,
well sorry,
but you're out of luck.

51
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.500
Hurricanes will get a lot worse in the next 50 years and higher water levels

52
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:03.580
will lead us to abandon the Gulf coast.
But don't worry,
it's not all bad.

53
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.260
Although the world may be dying,

54
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.800
it's not the only place humans will have to live in the next 50 years.

55
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.990
Humans will have begun colonizing Mars.

56
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.310
Private companies will even be attempting to travel to the Alpha Centauri
system,

57
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.360
the closest star system to our solar system.
While we're there,

58
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.110
we'll visit the Proxima Centauri B planet,
which has a good chance of housing,

59
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:25.630
alien life.
If we don't find any little green men,

60
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.550
we might decide to colonize it ourselves.

61
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.630
So we've talked about the human race and the environment,
but what about you?

62
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.160
What's going to happen with you 50 years into the future?
Well,
first off,

63
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.440
you won't have to go to the doctor for your annual checkup.

64
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.830
You'll have a device where you can scan yourself for any diseases.

65
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.480
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

66
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.660
<v 1>watch for body modifications to rise in popularity and no,</v>

67
00:03:45.661 --> 00:03:47.730
we're not talking about tattoos or piercings.

68
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.090
You'll be able to get things like cybernetic eyes that will allow you to see

69
00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:54.600
better and to see things that are invisible to us today,
like radiation.

70
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.450
If you're rich from your bitcoin investment blowing up,

71
00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.920
then you can even get yourself a designer.
Babies.

72
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.350
These babies can be completely customized from simply what they look like to

73
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.940
things like their behavior and intelligence.
Ai will be as smart as humans.

74
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.420
They won't have taken over the world just yet,
but there'll be well on their way.

75
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.680
Ai will constantly be progressing and intelligence soon being smarter than

76
00:04:16.681 --> 00:04:20.850
humans could ever imagine ourselves expect them to be working with us.
Well,

77
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.070
humans have more advanced roles and our jobs.

78
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.840
So are you ready for all the good and bad that comes with the future?
If not,

79
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.703
that's okay.

80
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.160
Just live in the present and slowly grow into it over the next 50 years.

81
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.290
Who knows?
In the future,

82
00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:37.050
we may not even talk about hypothetical scenarios anymore.

83
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.340
Will there be any what ifs or we'll every idea in the universe have already gone

84
00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:45.660
through a computer simulation that sounds like a question for another,

85
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.550
whatever.
