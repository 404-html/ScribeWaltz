00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.800
What if you woke up to an unexpected internet breakdown?

2
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.060
Would you be able to survive without checking Facebook for new postings first

3
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:17.061
thing in the morning with no Google maps to find your way in a strange city with

4
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:21.780
a credit card unable to pay for lunch?
If you're watching this video,

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.250
it means the internet is still going,

6
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.260
but what if someone or something shut it down?
This is what if,

7
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.410
and here's what would happen if the Internet stopped working.

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.090
You could argue this kind of digital detox would be beneficial.

9
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.350
We'd take our eyes off our screens and strike up real life conversations with

10
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:44.610
each other.
We discovered that our smartphones can actually make phone calls.

11
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.560
We'd bring back fax machines and start making notes by hand.
Well,

12
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:53.490
maybe not fax machines and hey,
we'd still have TV to entertain us.

13
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.580
The world would not fall apart.
In fact,

14
00:00:56.581 --> 00:01:00.300
with almost 4 billion people having no access to the Internet worldwide,

15
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.900
half of humanity wouldn't notice a difference in the short term,

16
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.130
but not you mighty Internet user.
You would notice right away

17
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.730
if the Internet suddenly flatlined,

18
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.060
social media users would start calling each other on the phone,

19
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.090
overloading the working telecommunication systems.

20
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.810
Unless cell phone towers and telephone lines were also shutdown.

21
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.860
Then you'd go back to writing letters and sending them via post.

22
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.490
Forget about wireless file transfers with no Wifi.

23
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.170
You'd have to use a physical cable to connect to computers or a CD.

24
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.060
Remember this.

25
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.430
Now think about the economy with financial data generally stored on the server.

26
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.100
Banking services largely depend on the Internet.

27
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.890
Each transfers would be impossible.

28
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.240
Your credit card and debit card would become a useless piece of plastic.

29
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.530
And what about all those bitcoins?
You've worked so hard to mine.
Well,

30
00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.420
you know the answer on top of that.
Large companies like Google,
Facebook,

31
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:05.421
and Amazon would go out of business losing their combined revenue of almost $440

32
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.240
billion.
With Google itself,
having 80,000 fulltime staff,

33
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.760
hundreds of thousands of people would be left unemployed.

34
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.510
Even companies that only rely on the Internet as a means of advertising would be

35
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:16.344
affected.

36
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.390
Developed countries would lose entire industries and face economic crisis.

37
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.990
What about those countries with just a small internet presence,

38
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.280
they would be effected too.
As international trade is dependent on the Internet.

39
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.470
So as the world's transit with no Internet access between airports,

40
00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:37.200
planes,
ships,
trains,
and commercial trucking,

41
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.390
we'd go back to tracking goods on paper.

42
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.140
This would raise the market value on transported products as it would be more

43
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:47.730
complicated to deliver goods to stores.
At least you could still travel.

44
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.690
However,
you won't have Instagram to share your travel selfies anymore.

45
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.780
Wonder if the Internet shutdown is even possible.
Well,
not on a worldwide level.

46
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.840
Some countries have actually introduced a kill switch to intentionally shut down

47
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:03.700
the internet and telephone communications,

48
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.420
but killing the whole Internet is harder than just cutting off a couple of

49
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:08.470
submarine cables.

50
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.490
The Internet is a global network of many other computer networks.

51
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.370
It doesn't depend on a single machine.
Even if one part of it went offline,

52
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.100
others would remain functional.
So don't worry,

53
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.440
you'll still be able to order pizza for dinner tonight.
