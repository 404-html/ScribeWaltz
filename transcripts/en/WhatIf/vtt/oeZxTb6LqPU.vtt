00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.333
Okay,

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.760
<v 1>hold on tight.</v>

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.900
Turn up the elevator music and get ready for a whole new mode of space

4
00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:13.690
exploration.
Forget rocket launches.

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.530
We already use elevators to bring us to extreme heights in our tallest
buildings.

6
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.180
So why can't they take us just a little further into space,
but wait,

7
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.500
how much would that cost?

8
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
Do we even have the kind of technology needed to make that possible?

9
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.530
And what would we gain by building a space elevator?
This is what if,

10
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.980
and here's what would happen if we built an elevator to space.

11
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.760
Would you like to take a cheap vacation to space?
Well,

12
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.870
you might be in luck because although the construction of a space elevator would

13
00:00:43.871 --> 00:00:45.520
be incredibly expensive,

14
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.690
eventually it would make space travel much more affordable and opened up a world

15
00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:50.620
of opportunities.

16
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.120
Put scientists tell us that there would also be a slew of technological,

17
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.650
logistical,
and political hurdles to overcome.
Would it even be worth it?

18
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.540
Every elevator needs a starting point and a destination.

19
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.340
So to make our space elevator,

20
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.690
the first thing we'd need to do is launch a satellite or destination way up into

21
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:15.610
the sky.
But how tall would our lift need to be?
Well,
as of right now,

22
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.330
the tallest structure we've ever built is the Burj Khalifa in Dubai,

23
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.270
which stands at 829.8 meters.

24
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.940
In order to create a successful space elevator,

25
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.150
it would have to be at least 35,786 kilometers tall.

26
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.180
That's more than 40,000 times taller than anything we've ever built.

27
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.660
Besides the obvious necessity of leaving our atmosphere.

28
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.530
The reason the space elevator would have to be so tall is to reach something

29
00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:43.300
called geostationary orbit.

30
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.400
This is the point where an object's natural orbit exactly matches the speed of

31
00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:49.900
rotation of the earth.
Below it.

32
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.310
Reaching this orbit would ensure that our elevator shaft always remains straight

33
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.820
and our destination never moves relative to where we launched from.

34
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.100
Our next step would be to lower a cable or ribbon from the satellite and attach

35
00:02:03.101 --> 00:02:04.840
it to our starting point.
Back on earth.

36
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.340
Clamped to the cable would be a form of elevator car that would carry people or

37
00:02:09.341 --> 00:02:10.450
cargo up and down.

38
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.410
If we can successfully pull this off,

39
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.200
it would completely revolutionize space exploration.

40
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.020
Right now our primary means of getting to space.

41
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:23.920
Our rockets and rockets are expensive.
At current prices.

42
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.960
It costs about $20,000 to send one kilogram and the space to put it in

43
00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:29.794
perspective,

44
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.510
that means approximately one point $3 million to send an average human up there.

45
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.490
After construction,

46
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.120
the cost of sending one kilogram into space with a space elevator would be

47
00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:44.950
reduced to just $200 if we set up a space station at the top of the elevator,

48
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.370
we'll be able to launch all our missions from there and not have to worry about

49
00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:52.990
the costs that are usually involved with propelling out of our atmosphere on top

50
00:02:52.991 --> 00:02:53.830
of easy traveling.

51
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.460
A space elevator would also open up some new energy possibilities.

52
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.970
If we giant solar panels along our ribbon,

53
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.950
they could collect far more energy than panels on earth and radiate it back at

54
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:08.680
low cost.
This all sounds good in theory,

55
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.000
but it also comes with a lot of obstacles.
The main one is the ribbon,

56
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:16.360
the connects at all.
It has to be light,
affordable,

57
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.540
and more stable than any material we can produce right now.

58
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.850
If we don't wait for the right material,

59
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.850
our ribbon could snap and that would be very dangerous.

60
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.530
If it breaks near the base,

61
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.430
the force applied to the satellite will cause the whole thing to rise into
space.

62
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.330
And if it snaps near the top,
the ribbon will fall.

63
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.360
Wrapping around the world and creating dangerous space debris.

64
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.800
So as tempting as it may be to go all in on the space elevator right now,

65
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.970
maybe we'd best wait until we're able to do it right.
In the meantime,

66
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.350
we could almost try it on the moon first,
but that's a topic for another.

67
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.010
What else?
