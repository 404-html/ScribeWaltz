00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.940
What if the dimension of time was no different from the three dimensions of

2
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:09.870
space we live in?

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.790
What have you could travel to the past and of the future the same way you can

4
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:16.440
move right or left up or down.

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.390
Would you be able to change the past and if you did,

6
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:23.100
would it create a time paradox?

7
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.560
What kind of time machine would you need to build anyway?
This is what if,

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.350
and here's what would happen if you could travel to your time.

9
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.850
How many times have you wished you could jump in a time machine and skip that

10
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:40.080
boring meeting or choose a better comeback and that argument last week.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.970
Time travel sounds like some wild fantasy that only happens in Scifi movies,

12
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.340
but we're actually traveling and time every day.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.580
Albert Einstein found that time is not a constant,

14
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.120
but it's continually moving forward and we're moving forward with it.

15
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.510
According guy in Stein time is the fourth dimension.

16
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.480
Together with three dimensional space,

17
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.200
it's fused into a single four dimensional continuum.
Spacetime.

18
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.850
If you think of traveling in space,
moving upwards as a bit of a challenge,

19
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.820
unless we get on a plane or at least take the stairs,

20
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.750
so maybe we just haven't come up with a proper machine to travel in time yet.

21
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.710
Theoretically,
building a time machine is possible,

22
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.860
but it wouldn't look like this or like this rather more like this because the

23
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:28.710
secret to time travel isn't in some exotic form of matter.

24
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.760
What you'd need is a spaceship that could travel almost as fast as light.

25
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.270
Einstein's theory of relativity taught us that the faster we move through space,

26
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.740
the slower we move in time.

27
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.110
Let's assume you were in a space ship traveling at 99.9% the speed of light to a

28
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:49.200
potentially habitable exoplanet,
some 40 light years away,

29
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
you find some primitive lifeforms and speed back to earth to share your

30
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:55.950
discovery,
but when you finally make it back to earth,

31
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.610
you discover that all your colleagues are now very,
very old.

32
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.170
From your perspective,

33
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200
you'd only been gone for about two years for people on Earth,

34
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.970
you'd been gone for 80 this phenomenon is known as time dilation.

35
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.600
It's not likely to happen to you though because traveling at the speed of light

36
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.330
isn't quite possible with the technology we have now.

37
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.080
The fastest pilot vehicle we've ever created,

38
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.190
Apollo 10 reached a speed of 11,000 meters per second.

39
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.470
The speed needed for time travel is somewhere near 299 million meters per
second.

40
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.083
On top of that,

41
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.660
accelerating at that speed would cause an enormous centrifugal force,

42
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.410
a force that would rip you apart before you came anywhere close to lightspeed.

43
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.140
But Hey,
we still have wormholes.

44
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.970
Einstein predicted that these theoretical tunnels Linq two separate places and

45
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:48.690
two different times a short cut to another universe and another time.

46
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.460
The problem with wormholes is they're extremely tiny,
just a billion,

47
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:55.950
trillion trillionths of a centimeter across,

48
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.080
no human would be able to fit through.

49
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.490
I can barely fit in my jeans from last year,

50
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.760
<v 1>eh?</v>

51
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.080
<v 0>If only we could capture a wormhole,
we might be able to enlarge it.</v>

52
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.890
Imagine a giant tunnel above the earth leading to another planet.

53
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.810
And theoretically,
if we put both ends of a wormhole in the same place,

54
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.040
but in different times,

55
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.610
we could step into a wormhole and come out in the distant past.

56
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.740
But wormholes have their issues.

57
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.980
They're very short lived and traveling into the past would create paradoxes like

58
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:29.530
the one in which you go back in time and convince your grandmother never to get

59
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:30.310
married.

60
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.280
Then your grandmother doesn't give birth to your dad and he doesn't have you,

61
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.290
but if you didn't exist,

62
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.800
who went back in time to talk to your grandmother out of marrying your

63
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:43.780
grandfather?
Time is linear.
It only goes forward.

64
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.580
For that reason,
we can only travel into the future,
not to the past.
In fact,

65
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.910
astronauts had spent about a year on the international space station are now

66
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:53.530
living in the future compared to us,

67
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.260
even though it's just 13 milliseconds in the future.

68
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.300
They're proof that traveling at time is possible and maybe wormholes could open

69
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:05.080
up a whole different world where the laws of physics work in different ways and

70
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:06.790
traveling to the past is possible.

71
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.930
Would you dare step into a time machine not knowing where it would take you,

72
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.140
and if you had the choice,
where would you go?
And when?
