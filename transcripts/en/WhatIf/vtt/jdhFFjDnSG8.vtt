00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.470
All of the systems,
beliefs,
emotions,

2
00:00:08.471 --> 00:00:13.210
and experiences that we call life or taking place on a tiny rock floating

3
00:00:13.211 --> 00:00:15.580
through space.
During our time here,

4
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.570
we've discovered that our rock is one of the only ones that has all the

5
00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:21.700
conditions necessary for sustaining life.

6
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.130
What we can't figure out for sure is what sparked brought together all these

7
00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:29.620
conditions that led us into existence.

8
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.280
What clues have we found so far and why does it seem like life on earth came

9
00:00:35.591 --> 00:00:37.510
from something extra terrestrial?

10
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.750
This is what if,

11
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.380
and here's what would happen if life didn't originate on earth.

12
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.170
The earliest signs of life on earth are molecules that are so complex that some

13
00:00:50.171 --> 00:00:52.840
scientists say it's unlikely they just popped up here.

14
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.090
So what if they formed somewhere else in space first and then traveled to our

15
00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.160
planet?
How would they get here?

16
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.100
No one knows for sure how or where life honored started,

17
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.420
but there are plenty of conflicting scientific theories out there to better

18
00:01:10.421 --> 00:01:13.150
understand them.
Let's start with something we can all agree on.

19
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.930
Earth is about four and a half billion years old and some of the earliest

20
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:23.410
fossils we've found our about 3.7 billion years old.

21
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.820
So we know that life started at some point in between and that's where things

22
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.020
start to get complicated.

23
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.490
Some of the earliest evidence for life on earth contains a complex molecule

24
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.370
called ribonucleic acid or RNA.

25
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.630
RNA is made up of thousands of smaller molecules that are connected in a

26
00:01:40.631 --> 00:01:44.980
particular pattern and it was one of the driving forces behind life on earth.

27
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.110
But the big question that divides the scientific community is where did RNA come

28
00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:54.880
from?
Well,
one option is that it came from outer space and no,

29
00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:58.030
we don't mean by way of advanced aliens planting their seeds,

30
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.300
although that would make for an interesting video.
Anyways,

31
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.820
what we're talking about is called Panspermia.

32
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.620
The idea that living organisms or genetic materials could have been transported

33
00:02:08.621 --> 00:02:11.890
to earth through some sort of natural phenomenon like an asteroid.

34
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.950
It might sound crazy,
but it's actually plausible.

35
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.520
In 2012 Danish scientists found the building blocks of RNA in a star system,

36
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.630
400 light years away,

37
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.960
proving that the compounds necessary to forge life on earth.

38
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.510
It could be created in space,
but then how did they end up on earth?
Well,

39
00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:34.690
there are two main theories and both involve asteroids.
Number One,

40
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.320
an asteroid could have brought these genetic materials to earth by crashing into

41
00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:43.060
its surface.
Or number two,
an asteroid could have crashed into Mars,

42
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.841
hit a spot,

43
00:02:43.841 --> 00:02:48.310
the contained micro organisms and sent the debris in this space which eventually

44
00:02:48.311 --> 00:02:49.360
found its way to earth.

45
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.800
Both of these instances have happened before and research shows that some life

46
00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:58.000
forms like bacteria and fungus could definitely survive the trip to our planet,

47
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.700
but some remained skeptical.

48
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.870
Choosing to believe that life on earth was sparked by natural phenomena like

49
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:07.600
lightening or good old fashioned chemical reactions.

50
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.000
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

51
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.930
<v 1>so even if Panspermia doesn't turn out to be our true origin story,</v>

52
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.500
it doesn't mean that asteroids aren't spreading life to any of the other

53
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.490
billions of planets out there right now laying the groundwork for future

54
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:25.960
civilizations like ours.
But that's a topic for another.

55
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.950
What if.
