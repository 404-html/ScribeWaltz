00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.173
Okay.

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.020
What if we never invented this plastic once a revolutionary invention?

3
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.890
It's now filling up our oceans and killing thousands of whales,
birds,
turtles,

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.160
just how much plastic do we have around us?

5
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.860
What our life be less comfortable without it.

6
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.480
Any animal species could we save by getting rid of plastic debris?

7
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.940
This is what if,
and here's what would happen if plastic was never invented.

8
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.530
Your plastic bag is actually chemically processed natural gas or oil.

9
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.340
You can tear it or burn it or throw it away when you're done with it,

10
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.980
but it won't decompose the way this loaf of bread will.

11
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.870
Since the 1950s we've created 6.3 billion tons of plastic.

12
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.340
9% of it,
we've recycled another 12% incinerated.

13
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.360
That leaves us with 4.9 billion tons of plastic waste.

14
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.820
If we could gather it all in one place,

15
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.490
this plastic mountain would be bigger than Mount Everest.

16
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.800
A lot of this waste ends up in the sea killing marine animals who mistake this

17
00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:10.150
indigestible synthetic for food.
If we eliminated plastic from our lives,

18
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.140
we'd save hundreds of marine species from entanglement and plastic ingestion.

19
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.010
But what about us?
What would arm routine and be like without plastic?

20
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.760
How much do we depend on plastic anyway?

21
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.620
Even if you avoided using plastic containers to bring your lunch to work or bag

22
00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:30.940
your groceries with reusable shopping bags,
you'd still be a far cry from going.

23
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.570
Absolutely plastic free plastic is everywhere.

24
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.530
Aluminum cans are lined with plastic resin.
Without it,

25
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.870
your cola would corrode it within three days.

26
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.630
Paper cups hide a thin layer of plastic too.

27
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.640
How do you think the keep the liquid inside?

28
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.770
No plastic would also mean no tea bags since their heat sealed with polyethylene

29
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.940
without plastic grocery shopping would look very different.

30
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.040
Our liquids would come in,
glass bottles,

31
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.110
our meats and cheese would be wrapped in paper.

32
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.770
You pack all your groceries and the paper bags or cardboard boxes.

33
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.180
One of the main benefits of plastic packaging is that it keeps feed fresh
longer.

34
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.700
Without this basic method of food preservation,

35
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.420
a lot of our food would need to be raised or grown locally and much of it would

36
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:14.590
only be available seasonally.

37
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.580
Organic waste would fill up the landfills and become our main environmental

38
00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:23.320
concern.
Our closing would be limited to natural fibers,
no polyester socks,

39
00:02:23.321 --> 00:02:26.920
nylon dresses or acrylic sweaters.
Say Goodbye to your fleece jacket,

40
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.020
heat and water resistant safety.

41
00:02:29.021 --> 00:02:33.370
Where wouldn't exist either without the plastic needed for electrical
insulation,

42
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.670
there would be no inexpensive circuits to build your phone or computer.

43
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.600
Even early electronics in the 1910 [inaudible] who's one of the first plastics

44
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.480
bake light without any plastic,

45
00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:48.040
we'd be stuck in 1870 still using nondurable and hazardous lacquer and rubber

46
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.120
insulator wires.

47
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.720
All the progress we've made with affordable electronics would never have

48
00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:53.554
happened,

49
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.280
but at least we wouldn't be polluting the earth with disposable coffee cups,

50
00:02:57.281 --> 00:02:58.870
water bottles,
toothbrushes,

51
00:02:58.871 --> 00:03:03.700
and plastic stuff and 700 marine species wouldn't be affected by plastic debris.

52
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.360
If the thought of someone taking your plastic away doesn't ruin your day.

53
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.440
Consider moving to Kenya or Bangladesh where it's illegal to use plastic bags

54
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.260
and you might consider getting some of these slimy pets.

55
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.340
6,000 wax worms can eat up a plastic bag and just one hour

56
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.060
and 700 marine species wouldn't be affected by plastic debris.

57
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.720
If the thought of someone taking your plastic away doesn't ruin your day,

58
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.800
consider moving to Kenya or Bangladesh where it's illegal to use plastic bags

59
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.620
and you might consider getting some of these slimy pets.

60
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.670
6,000 wax worms can eat up a plastic bag and just one hour.
