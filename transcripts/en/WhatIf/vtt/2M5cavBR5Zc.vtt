[inaudible]

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.800
<v 1>what if we humans could live somewhere outside of earth?
Say the moon.</v>

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.340
Obviously we can't just pack our stuff and move today,

4
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.060
but what if we tear a formed it reshaped it into Earth's image?

5
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.830
How long would it take us to turn our natural satellite into a habitable place?

6
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.150
What would this Earth Moon looked like?
Would this even be possible?

7
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.130
This is what if,

8
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.720
and here's what would happen if we terraform at the moon wondering why we chose

9
00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:38.350
the moon and not Mars with water.
Ice Buried beneath surface.

10
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.710
The Red Planet seems to be the best candidate to serve as our second earth,

11
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.930
but with zero experience terraforming,

12
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.810
we should consider colonizing our natural satellite first.

13
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.920
It gets twice as much sunlight as Mars and it's just a three day trip from us.

14
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.880
In short,

15
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.930
it would take us less time and money to construct a decent earth on our moon.

16
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.800
So how exactly do we engineer a habitable planet?

17
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.810
Just to be clear,
we're not talking about building a permanent moon base.

18
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.170
We'd go nuts and actually transform the moon into an earth.

19
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.700
Just a smaller one for starters would need to build an atmosphere and here's the

20
00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:16.990
fun part.
To do that,
we'd need to bombard our moon with a hundred water,

21
00:01:16.991 --> 00:01:20.950
ice comments,
ice droids.
We'd find them flying all around the earth.

22
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.190
These comments would crash into the moon surface.

23
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.150
They'd fill the moon's planes with water and disperse carbon dioxide along with

24
00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:30.790
water vapor and a little bit of ammonia and methane.

25
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.520
All these gases would gather near the surface,

26
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.830
creating an atmosphere the newly formed sees would reflect much or sunlight

27
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.800
making.
The Moon appear five times brighter when seen from earth.

28
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.400
These asteroids would also give the moon a momentum.

29
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.580
They'd make our satellite spin close to an earthquake cycle.

30
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.420
The more comments we batter into the moon,
a faster it would rotate.

31
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.080
A Lunar Day would drop down from an incredible 28 earth days to just 60 hours.

32
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.600
Since our satellite wouldn't rotate on its access at the same rate,

33
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:04.440
it orbits the earth anymore.
It would no longer be tidally locked to our planet.

34
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.980
For earthers.
This would mean we'd be able to see the dark side of the moon,

35
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.540
although it wouldn't be dark,

36
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.650
but how do we save the newly built lunar atmosphere from being stripped away by

37
00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:16.080
solar winds?
We'd have a couple of options.

38
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.940
The first one is easy moon's own rotation would generate a dynamo effect that

39
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:24.450
dynamo could awaken the moon's once active magnetic field that would keep the

40
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:26.850
atmosphere in place.
If that doesn't work out,

41
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.980
we'd have to place a gigantic shield in orbit.

42
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.060
That shield would work as an artificial bow shock making up for a missing

43
00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:35.370
magnetic field when that's all sorted,

44
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.150
we'd bring in genetically engineered plants suitable for growing on the moon

45
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:39.984
stony ground.

46
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.200
We'd also dropped some algae that would release oxygen into the air.

47
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.160
That would be the start of life on the moon.
Finally,

48
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.530
after many decades of hard and costly work,

49
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.820
we'd send the first human Connie to settle down on the first manmade planet.

50
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.780
The terraform moon would get very warm from greenhouse effects.

51
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.550
It would be mostly cloudy too,

52
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.270
and with tides as high as 20 meters surfers might want to make the trip.

53
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.030
Living on the moon would be just like living in Florida,

54
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.280
but with one sixth of the Earth's gravity,

55
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.150
the moon settlers would be able to jump as high as three meters off the ground,

56
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.310
remaining in the air for four seconds,

57
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.860
and if they were really fit and full of stamina,

58
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.840
they'd be able to run across the moon's lake.

59
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.770
This is because running on the water requires less muscle power.

60
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.090
If you do it a reduced gravity,

61
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.820
would you move to the moon to experience all that.
