1
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.660
Not too far from Earth.

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.370
It's a giant space rock that is silently played host to just 12 people in its

3
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:12.420
entire history.

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.860
What would happen if we put our cosmic satellite to work by covering it with

5
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:17.820
solar panels?

6
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.020
What would it take to build an enormous power plant on the moon?

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.360
How big would this facility be and how much time would it take to finish this

8
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.750
mega construction?
This is what if,

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.890
and here's what would happen if we covered the moon with solar panels

10
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.070
because the moon has little to no atmosphere.
There's no wind,
no rain,

11
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.990
and no clouds on that space rock.

12
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.790
If a lunar weatherman were to tell you the forecast,
it would always be the same.

13
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.790
<v 1>One more
time.</v>

14
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.220
Tell me,
mommy,
mommy,

15
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.670
<v 0>imagine how much energy we'd collect from a place where the sun never stopped</v>

16
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:03.260
shining,
but how would we even build a solar plant on the mood?

17
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.690
One Japanese company Shimizu already has that covered.

18
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.620
They want to build a so called Luna ring and yes,

19
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.570
it would look just the way it sounds.

20
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.450
A ring of solar panels spinning around the moon.

21
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.000
The construction would stretch for 11,000 kilometers along the moon's equator

22
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.520
and would reach 400 kilometers in width.

23
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.820
That's enough to cover half of the United States.

24
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.250
Where on earth would we even find enough materials for assembling this enormous

25
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:35.990
solar plant?
Well,

26
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.470
the answer lies outside of our planet's natural budget.

27
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.790
Most of the building materials would come from the moon itself.

28
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.550
We'd only have to launch the initial equipment over there,

29
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.560
just enough to start building more equipment and manufacturing lunar robots.

30
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.540
Then a team of robots together with a group of astronauts would handle the rest.

31
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.063
For starters,

32
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.540
they'd construct huge excavator and or processing machines to mine the moon.

33
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.970
Then they begin assembling solar panels from the lunar materials with nothing

34
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:12.740
but lunar,
soil and gravel.
They'd make concrete ceramics and solar cells.

35
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.450
Meanwhile,

36
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.620
astronauts on earth would be working on building spaceports in low earth orbit

37
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.710
to ship the remaining suppliers like hydrogen to the moon.

38
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.060
Even with the most advanced technology we can think of.

39
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.990
The construction would take at least two generations of humans to complete,

40
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.970
but once it's done,

41
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.830
we'd have a super efficient lunar power plant churning out power 24 seven

42
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.490
because there are no bad weather days on the moon ever.

43
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.870
But what about getting that power back to earth?
Well,

44
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.630
that's the fun part on the moon.

45
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.740
The lunar power plant would transmit solar power to the energy converting

46
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:53.750
facilities.
From there,

47
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.550
the converted power would be being to power collecting stations on earth with

48
00:02:58.551 --> 00:03:01.120
lasers,
microwaves.
How cool is that?

49
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.130
Potentially it could deliver so much energy that we wouldn't need any other

50
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:07.300
power sources at all.

51
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.040
Maybe building the lunar power plant would happen.
At the same time,

52
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:16.210
we constructed a human occupied moon base that would one day grow into a fully

53
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:20.770
operational human colony.
But that's a story for another.

54
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.790
What if.
