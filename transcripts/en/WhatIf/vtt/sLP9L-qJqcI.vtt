00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.640
What are you're seeing isn't a watercolor painting and motion.
In fact,

2
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.740
it's the planet Jupiter,
for the most part,
this gas giant is a mystery.

3
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.090
So what would happen if you wanted to discover it for yourself and jumped right

4
00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:23.890
onto the planet?
Or should we say into,
because Jupiter doesn't have a surface,

5
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.770
just a seemingly endless stretch of atmosphere.

6
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.780
What do you fall straight through?

7
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.980
What would you see on your way and how would it make you feel?

8
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.800
This is what if,
and here's what would happen if you fell into Jupiter.

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.130
If you attempted to jump into Jupiter wearing a standard space seat,

10
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.690
it'd be over for you pretty quickly.
First of all,

11
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.190
you wouldn't even make it to the planet.

12
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.470
Roughly 300,000 kilometers from Jupiter radiation would penetrate your suit and

13
00:00:53.471 --> 00:00:55.540
you die.
But that's a boring.

14
00:00:55.541 --> 00:01:00.520
What if we'll give you a special space suit that can survive the fall for now,

15
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.650
here's where the real fun begins.
At first,

16
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.890
you'll be falling from the [inaudible] top of the atmosphere at nearly 180,000

17
00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:10.820
kilometers per hour.

18
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.630
That's a lot faster than you'd fall from the top of earth's atmosphere because

19
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.240
Jupiter's gravity is much stronger than Earth's.

20
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.460
You'd still be able to see the sun,

21
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.690
but don't expect it to heat you up at about 250 kilometers down.

22
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.490
You'd reach the ammonia clouds and experienced temperatures of minus 150

23
00:01:28.491 --> 00:01:32.990
degrees.
Now get ready for the most epic whirlpool of your life.

24
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.560
Jupiter's clouds create powerful winds up to 482 kilometers per hour.

25
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.290
You'd feel as if you were in one giant colorful tornado.

26
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.240
That's because Jupiter is the fastest rotating planet in our solar system.

27
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.410
One day on the planet is equal to nine and a half earth hours.

28
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.000
Let's go down about 120 kilometers more.
Congratulations.

29
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.350
This is the deepest that any exploration has ever sailed into the gas giant.

30
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.890
In 1995 NASA's Galileo probe made it this far before it was destroyed by the

31
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:10.160
pressure of Jupiter's atmosphere,
but don't worry,
that's not happening to you.

32
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.860
You've got the suit.
The further you travel,

33
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.860
the darker it will get until it's completely pitch black.

34
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.410
The only source of light you'll have will be from the lightning storms happening

35
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:21.420
all around you.
At this point,

36
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.260
the temperature will start to increase and it might even feel comfortable if it

37
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:27.450
weren't for the immense physical pressure you'll be feeling.

38
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.280
The pressure you'd experience is more than 1000 times higher than on the surface

39
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:33.114
of the earth.

40
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.350
The only way you'll be able to survive is if your space suit was built as strong

41
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:41.280
as the deepest diving submarine of all time.
By now,

42
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.220
you've been falling for 12 hours and let's be honest,

43
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.450
you're getting a little bored.

44
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.190
You'd probably want to radio someone to come and get you.
Well,
that's too bad.

45
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.710
That's an impossibility inside Jupiter.

46
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.220
Since radio waves get absorbed this deep into the planet's atmosphere,

47
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.140
you'll just have to keep following.

48
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.900
The will keep rising and so will the pressure.

49
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.300
As you reach the inner layers of Jupiter,

50
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.260
there'll be parts that you'll be able to swim through a substance that's not

51
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:13.261
quite liquid or gas known as super critical fluid moving through the strange

52
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:15.970
material,
the temperature will get even hotter.

53
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.920
Eventually it will be equivalent to the surface of the sun.
If that isn't enough,

54
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.430
you'll also be experiencing pressure equal to 2 million times.

55
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:25.420
The pressure on earth.

56
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.290
Metallic hydrogen will begin to form and you'll be surrounded by it.

57
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.640
This relatively unknown substance can be a dense liquid that you won't be able

58
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:36.610
to escape from.
If you do manage to escape,

59
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.240
you'd be falling through it for thousands of kilometers until you reached

60
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:43.270
Jupiter's core,
possibly a solid object.

61
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.980
Some scientists predict it is due to the immense pressure at this level in the

62
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:52.690
planet,
regardless of what it is.
If you somehow did manage to survive all this,

63
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.360
you'd be stuck on it from all the atmospheric pressure,

64
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.070
not a very rewarding trip.

65
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.700
Maybe we should leave the planet and it's a beautiful mystery,

66
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.090
but if you do ever manage to fall into Jupiter and get stuck,

67
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.200
let's hope you have a few more.
What if videos to keep you company good.
