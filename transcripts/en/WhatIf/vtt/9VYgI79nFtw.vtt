1
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.410
There are 79 moons of Jupiter.

2
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.380
What if we moved earth into its orbit too?

3
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.560
How would Jupiter super strong gravity affect our lives?

4
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.720
What would our skies look like?

5
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.090
How long could you survive on a freezing planet that's full of volcanoes?

6
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.240
This is what if,
and here's what would happen if the earth was a moon of Jupiter.

7
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.380
When you run into an old friend and the last place you'd expect to see them.

8
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.910
You figure it's a small world.

9
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.500
When you find out that the planet Jupiter could hold over 1300 earths.

10
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.280
You realize it's a tiny world.
Picture this.

11
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.410
If the earth was the size of a grape,

12
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.330
Jupiter would be the size of a basketball.
We've got one moon,

13
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.280
Jupiter has 79 and counting.
So yeah,

14
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.340
Jupiter's a big deal.
An orbiting.

15
00:00:57.341 --> 00:01:00.040
It would be a dream for all you Instagrammers out there,

16
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.170
but in this case,
a picture doesn't make it last longer.

17
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.490
When every day is a struggle for survival.
It's a really,

18
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.580
really cold morning and that's because Jupiter is 778 million kilometers from

19
00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:16.384
the sun.

20
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.630
That means 25 times less luminosity and 25 times less heat than we currently

21
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:26.170
enjoy at Earth's present location.
Fortunately,
the sun is super bright,

22
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.760
so we'd still get daylight,

23
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.860
but if we were to compare earth to Jupiter is closest moon Oeo days would be

24
00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:35.500
about 40 hours long.
Of course,

25
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.560
that wouldn't really matter because if you were born on the Earth Moon of

26
00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:41.590
Jupiter,
you'd probably grow up not knowing sunlight.

27
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.540
The gravitational pull from Jupiter's other nearby moons and the planet itself

28
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.210
would generate extreme tidal forces.

29
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.500
These would actually generate a lot of heat on our planet,
Moon,
but internally,

30
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.910
so yeah,
that's how you end up in a world where if the cold doesn't get you,

31
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.800
then maybe the daily earthquake tsunami or volcanic eruption will,
well,

32
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.570
either that or you'll just be cooked to death.

33
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.740
Jupiter's magnetic field is 10 times stronger than Earth's,

34
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.310
meaning that it emits a million times more radiation.

35
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.450
So if you really want to make life on Jupiter's earth,
Moon work,

36
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.670
living underground is your best bet.

37
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.930
One year on earth is one month on Jupiter.

38
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.970
Since it takes Jupiter 12 years to go around the sun every month on Jupiter,

39
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.120
the planet gets hit by about 12 to 60 comments or asteroids larger,

40
00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:34.000
small.

41
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.410
Their impacts are much more consequential since Jupiter's gravitational pull

42
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.590
accelerates these objects to a collision speed of about 216,000 kilometers per

43
00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:48.610
hour.
At the minimum,
if earth became one of Jupiter's moons,

44
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.410
we're now in the line of fire,
has a much,
much smaller planet.

45
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.620
We're less likely to be able to absorb these kinds of impacts.

46
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.860
You've done your best living underground,

47
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.160
but there's nowhere left to go when a sizable asteroid or obliterates your home.

48
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.230
So thanks for playing.
Better luck next time.
But really,
what did you expect?

49
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.500
Pitting a grape against a basketball that's just cruel,

50
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.290
but points to you for style,
courage,

51
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.130
and above all curiosity and keep asking questions.

52
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.530
The Sky's the limit on what f.
