00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.520
People on earth like to talk a lot about colonizing Mars,

2
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.570
but what if it had already happened and the first humans had already settled

3
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:16.440
down on the Red Planet?
What would life on Mars look like?

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.520
Would we be able to live on the surface or have to hide underground from all the

5
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:24.960
solar radiation that Maurice gets exposed to?
Would we be able to terraform it?

6
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.000
This is what if,
and here's what would happen if we lived on Mars.

7
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.960
Ever felt like getting off this planet?
Well,

8
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.240
consider Mars fourth rock from the sun.

9
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.360
It can be as close as 56 million kilometers away.

10
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.690
It can also be as far as 401 million kilometers away.

11
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.920
Even if you jumped into the fastest spacecraft ever launched from Earth,

12
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.910
getting there would take anywhere from 40 days to nine and a half months,

13
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.520
depending on the position of the planets.
And after all that time spent in space,

14
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.790
you'd finally see dry and lifeless Mars on the horizon.

15
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.950
Would you be able to survive there?

16
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.260
What would you need to survive on Mars anyway?
First off,

17
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.900
you'd have to figure out how to produce oxygen to breathe.

18
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.610
The Martian atmosphere is very thin and it's 95% carbon dioxide.

19
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.630
You wouldn't be able to just bring the oxygen you need to survive,

20
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.450
but you could extract it from the carbon dioxide with machines like NASA is

21
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.303
Moxie.

22
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.000
Not only would that provide you and other Martian settlers with breathable air,

23
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.820
but also supply you with liquid oxygen propellant.

24
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.390
That's the stuff you'd need to lift a rocket off Mars in case you decide to

25
00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:36.670
return to earth.
There's no fertile soil on Mars to grow food in.

26
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.700
Instead,

27
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.050
you'd use hydroponics cultivating your crops in a mineral and nutrient solution.

28
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.490
No soil required.
Of course,
without running water on the surface,

29
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.700
your colony would only be able to grow 20% of the food you'd need.

30
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.810
The rest of it you'd have shipped in from Earth,
but don't expect fresh meat.

31
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.160
All your food would come dried along with the other settlers.

32
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.070
You'd probably live in inflatable pressurized buildings,

33
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.240
but it's more likely that you'd go underground because Mars has no global

34
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:08.450
geomagnetic field and since its atmosphere is so thin,

35
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.860
radiation levels in the orbit above Mars are two and a half times higher than at

36
00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:14.120
the International Space Station.

37
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.310
That's too much solar radiation for humans to bear.
Forget about suntanning.

38
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.950
The Sun would appear just half as big as it does from Earth,

39
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.860
and if you want to go outside and return alive,

40
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.820
you'd need a space suit to make up for the near Apps and atmospheric pressure

41
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.560
and the block radiation.
Your suit would also keep you warm,

42
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.780
which is important because temperatures on Mars are very low.

43
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.530
The coldest winter on earth is paradise compared to the average Martian winter

44
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.920
temperatures would be as low as 55 degrees below zero,

45
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.370
even colder at the Poles where the temperatures can drop to a freezing minus 153

46
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:52.550
degrees a day on Mars is just 40 minutes longer than a day on earth.

47
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.420
A year on Mars would be almost twice as long.

48
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.980
If you lived in the northern hemisphere,

49
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.030
you didn't join [inaudible] seven of spring and six months of summer,

50
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.140
then there would be a five month loan item and another four months of winter,

51
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.700
and not only are the temperatures their load,

52
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.070
they can also change dramatically within a week.

53
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.570
These variations often result in powerful dust storms.
They wouldn't harm you,

54
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.400
but they'd clog all your electronics.

55
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.620
Remember too that the gravity on Mars is about one third of earth's.

56
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.150
You'd need to learn how to walk again.
Still want to move to the red planet.

57
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.470
Well,

58
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.890
your best bet is to wait until the first human colonies head there to terraform

59
00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:34.080
the planet to make it just like the one they came from.

60
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.520
They'd import ammonia ice from the atmospheres of other planets to heat Mars up

61
00:03:38.521 --> 00:03:39.354
a little.

62
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.590
The heat would convert the dry ice at the marsh in North Pole into gas and give

63
00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:46.410
the planet and atmosphere still on breathable for us,

64
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.860
but at least it would be enough to create atmospheric pressure so that you could

65
00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:51.270
finally take off your space suit.

66
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.320
Then they'd extract water from the vast reserves of water,

67
00:03:55.321 --> 00:04:00.030
Ice Locked Beneath Marza surface water vapor would make the atmosphere thicker

68
00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:04.230
and thicker.
Eventually you'd see it raining and snowing on Mars,

69
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.180
and after maybe a thousand years,
there'd be enough oxygen for humans to breathe.

70
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.910
The planet reengineering would be complete.

71
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.650
Is living on Mars something you'd like to try or would you rather preserve what

72
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:18.600
we have here on earth?
