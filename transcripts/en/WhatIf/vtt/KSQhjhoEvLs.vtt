1
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.120
What is Jupiter gain?

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.160
Just a little bit more mass during its formation period and then ignited to

3
00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:14.340
become a star.
How different,
what our solar system,

4
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:18.750
I've turned out what having another star in the middle of the solar system mess

5
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:22.440
with the orbits of the planets and would we see it from here?

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.460
This is what f and here's what would happen if Jupiter became a star.

7
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.840
Jupiter has more than twice the mass of all the planets in the solar system

8
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:34.674
combined.

9
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.210
It doesn't have a solid ground and is made up of the same elements as the sun

10
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.250
and yet it's not a star.

11
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.290
Jupiter doesn't have enough mass to initiate a fusion reaction in its core,

12
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.680
the necessary requirement to be accepted into the star club.

13
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.020
If only we could find 79 more Jupiters and crash them all into the one we have

14
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:58.530
now,
we'd be able to build a second star in the solar system.

15
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.420
What would that be like?

16
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.850
Ab Jupiter's crushed together would make a star out of the gas giant,

17
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.460
but that star would be nothing like the sun.

18
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.120
Jupiter would be massive enough to become a red dwarf,

19
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.910
a small cool hydrogen burning star,

20
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.990
and as every red dwarf out there,
it wouldn't be too bright.

21
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.300
0.3% of the sun's luminosity is the most light the Jupiter could hope to spit
out

22
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.610
because Jupiter is four times further away from us than the sun.

23
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.180
The earth wouldn't get much heat from it.
By and large,

24
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.080
Jupiter turning into a red dwarf wouldn't change anything for life on earth.

25
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.450
You'd still be able to see it from Earth.

26
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.490
Jupiter Star would appear red and a bit brighter than the moon at its full
phase.

27
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.140
What did at least have a gravitational impact on the solar system?

28
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.360
Not as much as you might think.

29
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.440
The former gas giant would slightly shift the orbits of the other planets,

30
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.790
but not enough to set them on a collision course with one another or to launch

31
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:01.650
them out of their orbits into outer space.

32
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.210
The only threat we'd face would be space rocks from the asteroid belt that

33
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:07.800
Jupiter might send towards the earth.

34
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.760
We'd need to learn how to detect and destroy them before they could reach our

35
00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:16.380
planet.
Other than that,
not much would change for the solar system.

36
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.910
Things would get a lot more fun if Jupiter was replaced with a sunlike star.

37
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.020
If our gas giant became 1000 times more massive,

38
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.270
the solar system would go wild.

39
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.410
Asteroids would crashing the planets and planets would change their orbit.

40
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:32.244
Of course,

41
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.360
it's hard to predict what would happen to earth in this gravitational mess.

42
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.680
It could be anything from being pulled a little too close to Jupiter Star and

43
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:44.880
getting scorched to being left drifting alone in the void of space.

44
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.310
In any case,
it wouldn't be too pretty.
In the real world,

45
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.150
Jupiter is forever destined to be a planet,
and that's for the best.

46
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.860
Maybe someday soon we'll get a closer look and send a man spacecraft inside the

47
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:04.360
gas giant,
but that's a story for another.
What if.
