00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.620
Some 13.8 billion years ago,
a very hot,
smaller,

2
00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:13.580
dense singularity expanded into what we now call the universe.

3
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.620
It hasn't stopped growing since,
but what if it did?
What if all the galaxies,

4
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.880
stars,
planets,

5
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.200
everything stopped moving away from everything else with the universe as it is

6
00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:28.610
just freeze or would it collapse into a single point just like it was before the

7
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:33.410
Big Bang and would that be the end of everything?
This is what if,

8
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.560
and here's what would happen if the universe stopped expanding before the 1920s

9
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.470
when Edwin Hubble observed that the galaxies moved away from each other.

10
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.200
We thought the universe was static.
Years later,

11
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.950
the Hubble Space Telescope showed us that not only is the universe expanding,

12
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.320
but it's growing at an ever increasing rate.

13
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.040
This came as a total surprise for astrophysicists.

14
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.060
They expected that the expansion was actually slowing down due to the force of

15
00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:02.000
gravity to explain the discovery.

16
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.750
They theorized that there's a force speeding up the expansion of the universe.

17
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.760
They called it dark energy.

18
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.450
What if this hypothesized energy suddenly stopped,

19
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:12.810
stopped pulling the universe apart?

20
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.890
Let's assume the strength of dark energy diminished over time,

21
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.080
but was still enough to counteract the force of gravity.

22
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.560
What would that look like?
If that were the case,

23
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.550
the universe would become just like Albert Einstein imagined it 100 years ago.

24
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.210
Before Hubble's discovery changed the game and I'd signs viewpoint,

25
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.370
it would be static.
The universe would neither be expanding nor contracting.

26
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.570
Eventually,
stars would exhaust all the gas needed for their formation.

27
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.380
Fewer new stars would be born and the existing ones with burnout,

28
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.630
the universe would grow darker packed with black holes.
By that time,

29
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:51.930
the earth would be long gone,
absorbed by a red giant star.

30
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.400
They used to be our son.
At some point it would reach its eventual temperature,

31
00:01:56.401 --> 00:02:00.900
minimum absolute zero or zero k on the Celsius side.

32
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.070
That's minus 273 degrees.
At that temperature,

33
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.900
Adam's themselves would stop moving.

34
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.810
The universe will become absolutely lifeless,

35
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.970
but let's go back and assume that dark energy became so weak that it couldn't

36
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:18.600
counteract the force of gravity anymore.
Once the gravity took over,

37
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.470
it would pull everything back.
The universe would start contracting.

38
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.160
Galaxies would draw closer together until they merge into one mega galaxy with

39
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:31.830
the stars melting into each other.
Space would become hotter than the sun,

40
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.120
and again,
packed with black holes.
The result of exploding stars,

41
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.040
these black holes would suck up everything around them.
Planets,
stars,

42
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:45.960
entire galaxies,
even one another.
Eventually they'd form one monsters,

43
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:50.670
black hole that would pull the entire universe into a single point,
hot,
small,

44
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.050
and extremely dense.

45
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.030
The universe would end in a big crunch reverting back into what it looked like

46
00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:58.890
at the start,
and who knows.

47
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.290
The newly formed singularity might explode into another big bag,

48
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.490
creating a brand new universe with new stars,
new planets,
and new life farts.

49
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.220
We don't know exactly how our universe,
universal land,

50
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.430
we don't even understand what the dark energy pulling it apart is.

51
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.180
That's why there's not just one theory explaining the ultimate fate of the

52
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:20.140
universe.
There are several good ones.
Any one of them might be correct,

53
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.670
but they could be wrong altogether.
Join us next time on what if.
