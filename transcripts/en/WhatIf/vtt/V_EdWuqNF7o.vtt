00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.120
How cool would it be to see a real life t rex if only that one fatal asteroid

2
00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:14.030
never hit the earth?
Would dinosaurs still be alive today?

3
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.410
Would they have evolved?
Would humans have survived this long?

4
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.670
Could we ever learn to coexist?
This is what if,

5
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.970
and here's what would happen if dinosaurs never went extinct until 66 million

6
00:00:28.551 --> 00:00:33.260
years ago.
Dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes roam the earth,
intelligent,

7
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.530
adaptable,
and sometimes weighing as much as two jet planes.

8
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.910
It's hard to believe that it only took one rock to wipe them all out.
Of course,

9
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.530
this was no ordinary rock.

10
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.780
The asteroid that took out the dinosaurs was nine miles wide and hit earth with

11
00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:51.080
the destructive force of 10 billion Hiroshima bombs.

12
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.090
The radioactive shockwave obliterated everything for hundreds of miles in every

13
00:00:56.091 --> 00:01:00.380
direction and 75% of all species on earth went extinct.

14
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.820
If that asteroid had hit just a little earlier,
a little later,

15
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.830
or even a few miles off course,

16
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.530
we would be living in a very different world today.

17
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.280
The rock that killed the dinosaurs struck the shallow waters of Mexico's Yucatan

18
00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:17.114
peninsula.

19
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.810
Had it landed a little farther off the coast in a deeper part of the ocean,

20
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.590
the water might have absorbed some of the blast along with its devastating

21
00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:28.070
effects on the atmosphere,
but even if the asteroid missed the earth,

22
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.880
dinosaurs would have to survive several significant global events in order to

23
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:36.080
make it to the present day.
55 million years ago,
temperatures rose.

24
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.830
The climate was eight degrees hotter than it is today.
Rain forests,

25
00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:44.060
sprouted and vegetation flourished.
Herbivores would have adapted and thrived,

26
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.100
but they'd have started to look a little different.

27
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.760
The plants of this period were less nutritious and easier to digest,

28
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.570
meaning dinosaurs would likely shrink in size since they're new diet wouldn't

29
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:56.720
have as much energy.
Roughly 20 million years after that,

30
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.460
South America and Antarctica Split,
creating a cooler and drier world climate.

31
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.830
During this period,
long legged,

32
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:07.520
fast moving dinosaurs would have evolved to travel the huge grasslands

33
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:11.030
stretching out across the globe compared to mammals have this period.

34
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.290
Dinosaurs held significant advantages such as having more teeth and better

35
00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:18.560
eyesight.
Considering the dinosaurs were already so advanced,

36
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.490
scientists wonder whether mammals would have evolved at all if dinosaurs hadn't

37
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:23.324
gone extinct.

38
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.020
It's likely that the big animals we know today would have been prayed to

39
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:28.730
dinosaurs,
but remember,

40
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.910
humans evolved alongside woolly mammoths and saber tooth cats.

41
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.650
While those species didn't survive the ice ages of 2.6 million years ago,

42
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.320
given the evolutionary traits of some dinosaurs,

43
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.940
there's a chance they might have persistent,

44
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.760
but what about us could we handle freezing temperatures and huge terrifyingly

45
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:50.270
vicious predators?
They say running keeps the body warm,

46
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.380
but that might also make you taste better in an alternate universe.

47
00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:57.050
If we did survive alongside these prehistoric beasts,

48
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.760
it's possible we could see a real live to you racks on a protected reserve,

49
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.230
not unlike Jurassic Park.

50
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.970
Human population growth and access of hunting would've driven larger dinosaurs

51
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:11.230
to near extinction today,
they would most certainly be an endangered species,

52
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.890
but those that shrank and adapted over millions of years could coexist

53
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:17.880
peacefully among us.
In fact,
some actually do.

54
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.930
Where do you think pigeon's came from?

55
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.160
It's hard to believe that birds were once the size of biplanes,
but then again,

56
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:26.290
it's hard to believe that with a slight twist of fate,

57
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.000
we might have walked with dinosaurs or we might've become dinosaur chow and not

58
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:35.980
have evolved at all.
But seeing is believing at what if,
so,

59
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.830
if you've got a passion for the incredible,
then keep watching.
