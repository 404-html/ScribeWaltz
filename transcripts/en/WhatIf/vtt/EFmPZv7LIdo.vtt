1
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.880
The moon is a giant rock.
The lights up our night and can even change colors.

2
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.800
So what would it be?
Do without it?
What do we all need?
Night Vision Goggles.

3
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.340
How would it affect the ocean tides are seasons or our sleep cycles or would the

4
00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:22.820
consequences be far more dramatic?
This is what if,

5
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.970
and here's what would happen if we suddenly had no moon as the closest celestial

6
00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:29.270
body to our planet.

7
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.170
The moon exerts a gravitational pull that governs much of what happens here on

8
00:00:33.171 --> 00:00:37.490
earth.
Take the sea,
for example,
if you like surfing,
you can thank the moon.

9
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.610
When the moon's gravitational pull tugs on our spinning earth,

10
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.810
the oceans respond,

11
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.080
giving us high tides and some parts of the world and low tides elsewhere.

12
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.130
And while the wind gives the waves,
their energy,
tides define their shape,

13
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.470
the moon's gravitational attraction also keeps us at a stable 23.5 degree tilt

14
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.920
relative to the sun giving us four seasons and a livable climate.

15
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.340
But what if that livable climate were to suddenly become unlivable with the moon

16
00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:07.300
gone?
It's stabilizing effect on the earth's rotation would go with it.
One,

17
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.070
the good news first,
the weekend just got a whole lot closer.

18
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.680
If the moon suddenly disappeared,

19
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.200
a day on earth would only be six to eight hours long.

20
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.170
Over millions of years shifting tides and their pressure on the earth's

21
00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:24.160
continents have slowed our planet's rotation giving us 24 hour days,

22
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.950
but without the moon strong gravitational influence,

23
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.460
the world would spend three to four times faster than it does now.

24
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.520
Here comes the bad news.
Rotating at that speed,

25
00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:37.000
we would experience winds up to 480 kilometers per hour.

26
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.820
Birds and insects would have no chance of survival.

27
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.350
The luckiest land based organisms would either be deeply rooted plants or very

28
00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:46.300
short,
very stout animals.

29
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.560
Most of our marine life would be wiped out since sea creatures that rely on

30
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.440
ocean currents for survival would lose the privilege of the oceans.

31
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:57.070
Pull currents helps circulate vital nutrients from the ocean floor to the

32
00:01:57.071 --> 00:02:00.790
surface while dragging oxygen rich surface water deep into the sea.

33
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.590
We'd still have tides,

34
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.460
but now they'd be governed by the sun and from a distance of 93 million miles

35
00:02:06.461 --> 00:02:09.790
away,
they'd only be one third is powerful.
And with the moon,

36
00:02:09.791 --> 00:02:10.660
suddenly out of the way,

37
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.230
the oceans would rip towards the sun causing catastrophic waves,

38
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.130
killing thousands and submerging coastlines.
At this point,

39
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.750
we'd have to adjust to new ocean currents,

40
00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:23.710
which circulating at a slower rate would be heating up equatorial waters while

41
00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:25.210
turning polar waters frigid.

42
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.140
These extreme differences would produce a similar effect on land as well.

43
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.820
Since ocean temperatures influenced their regional climates,
along with the sun,

44
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.571
Mars,

45
00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:37.840
and other nearby planets could also claim a share of gravitational influence

46
00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:41.650
over our planet,
pulling on earth in different directions and causing it to tilt.

47
00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:43.030
With increased volatility,

48
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.530
Earth's axial plane would vary some 10 degrees causing dramatic shifts in

49
00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:50.200
seasons and rendering our climate uninhabitable.

50
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.710
Most crops would die with drastic temperature changes.

51
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.600
We'd experienced the worst ice ages,

52
00:02:55.601 --> 00:02:59.860
known demand as huge glaciers from the north and South Poles would encroach upon

53
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:03.880
the earth covering everything except perhaps a small band across the equator.

54
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.300
So while full moons may attract werewolves,

55
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.690
that's still better than an alternative world where the moon doesn't exist.

56
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.160
The next time you look up at the sky,
be glad it's there.
Sleep soundly tonight.

57
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.240
Surf's up in the morning.
