1
00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.203
Hmm.

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.350
<v 1>Space is full of treasures.
Literally,</v>

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.080
if we were able to extract the resources from the rocks in the asteroid belt

4
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:17.610
alone,
we could give $100 billion to every person on earth.

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.280
What if we started mining them tomorrow?

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.050
Could we restore all of earth's natural resources that we've exhausted over the

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.860
years?
How would this change space travel and why haven't we done it yet?

8
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.320
This is what if,
and here's what would happen if we started mining asteroids.

9
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.750
Almost 800,000 asteroids are drifting untamed in the solar system.

10
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.770
The majority of the makeup,

11
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.760
the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter,

12
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.560
but we don't have to go that far.

13
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.890
There are 16,000 near Earth asteroids laced with anything from gold to water,

14
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.520
just waiting to be harvested.

15
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.780
But even if we overcame all the technical challenges on the way to these gold

16
00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:00.990
mines of space,
would we even bring these goods back to earth?

17
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.290
Well,
we could bring some resources back to earth for profit especially important

18
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.970
would be phosphorous,
zinc,
tin lead,
silver,
gold,

19
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.310
and everything else that our planet is running out of,

20
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.900
but transporting all these precious commodities to earth in large quantities

21
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.020
might significantly decreased their market value on the planet.

22
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.970
There would be much more value and asteroid mining if we use those resources to

23
00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:30.630
further explore space.
Sorry Earth,
we'll come back to you later.

24
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.460
With all the water and building materials floating untamed in our solar system,

25
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.370
we'd have no problem colonizing the moon and Mars.

26
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.740
We'd send a crew to explore Jupiter's moon,

27
00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:45.480
Europa and finally we traveled beyond the solar system to the billions of star

28
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:50.040
systems and exoplanets out there,
but back to earth for just a moment.

29
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.930
Scientists suggest that in the early years of the solar system when earth was

30
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:59.160
just as lifeless as Venus asteroids were the ones to fill our oceans with water,

31
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.690
they were constantly hitting the young earth,
bringing not only water,
ice,

32
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.240
but also some complex organic molecules.

33
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.670
Asteroids made life on earth possible and they can make life in space possible

34
00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:15.060
to imagine you were making a road trip around Europe,

35
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.970
but there were absolutely no gas stations along the way.

36
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.910
You'd have to bring all your fuel with you.
Well,

37
00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:24.930
traveling in space is even worse.
We are trapped in the earth's gravity.

38
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.970
It's so strong that it takes us more energy to escape the first 300 kilometers

39
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:32.940
from earth than the next 300 million kilometers.

40
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.410
It's just not efficient to burn all that fuel for only one trip to an asteroid.

41
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.210
On the other hand,
traveling beyond Earth's gravity is almost effortless.

42
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.410
If we started mining asteroids,
we wouldn't have to carry so much fuel around.

43
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.530
We'd be able to go farther than we've ever imagined.

44
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.590
We'd mine asteroids for water,
ice to get water.

45
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.550
An essential element for sustaining human life anywhere in space.

46
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.020
Water would help us maintain good hygiene,
grow food,
and produce breathable air.

47
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.000
It would also give us fuel.

48
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.740
We just have to refine the water molecules into high efficiency propellant.

49
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.210
In a way.
Asteroids would be our space gas stations.

50
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.230
They would also be our main space supplier of building materials.

51
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.880
We've used asteroid metals like iron to construct low cost structures of any

52
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:26.530
size we want.
We'd also look for precious metals like gold,
silver,
and platinum,

53
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.480
but not to make a ring or a necklace for our new alien girlfriend instead to

54
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:36.250
manufacture high end electronics,
spacecraft components and laboratory equipment.

55
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.780
It's only a matter of time before we can extract the resources that space has to

56
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:42.340
offer.
First,

57
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.460
we'll need to learn more about the asteroids and their gravitational polls.

58
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.480
Determine what kind of mining equipment to use and figure out which asteroids

59
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.100
have the most resources to mine.

60
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.090
When we figured out the technical side of things,
one question remains,

61
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.890
who will own the asteroids?

62
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.720
What if a company or a nation won the race to space mining and privatizing all

63
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:03.820
the space resources?
Well,

64
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.910
expect an economic disruption because that company,

65
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:10.810
our nation would run the whole world on earth and in space.

66
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.490
Maybe instead of mining asteroids,
we could terraform and populate them,

67
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.820
but that's a topic for another.
What if.
