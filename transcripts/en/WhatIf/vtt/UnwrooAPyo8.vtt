What would happen if you flew into a wormhole?
Would you ever hear back?

2
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.080
Where would you end up back in time?
Another galaxy.

3
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.540
This is what if,

4
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.500
and here's what would happen if a wormhole formed in our solar system.

5
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.250
You've probably heard of wormholes through Thor interstellar,
Star Trek,

6
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.780
or if you're really old school.

7
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.960
Albert Einstein in 1935 Albert Einstein and physicist Nathan Rosen came up with

8
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:38.370
the idea of bridges in spacetime WTF.

9
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.840
O m g sounds like you're catching on because an Einstein Rosen bridge or a

10
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:48.340
wormhole is also a shortcut through space time.

11
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.020
A wormhole is less like a bridge and more like a tunnel.

12
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.580
It's a tunnel that links to different points in space time and if you were to

13
00:00:56.581 --> 00:00:59.520
pass through it,
you could end up in a different galaxy,

14
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.120
a different universe or 14th century Europe,

15
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.890
but only if you found a way to keep the worm hole from collapsing on you.

16
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.510
The trouble is no one's ever seen them wormhole before and we probably won't

17
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:13.950
find one anytime soon.

18
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.000
The other problem is if we're most do exist in our solar system,

19
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.010
they're probably microscopic.

20
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.080
Any wormhole that could accommodate human travel would require a crazy amount of

21
00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:26.760
mass.
Think about it,

22
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.030
the smallest black hole is thought to be the size of an atom,

23
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.310
but with the mass of a mountain.

24
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.660
So while we can't really calculate the mass of a wormhole that could fit a few

25
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:37.830
of us and a spaceship,

26
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.660
just know that it would be astronomical and its gravitational pull would

27
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:46.890
probably redirect the tilt and rotation of all the planets in our solar system,

28
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.590
but things would go back to normal soon enough.

29
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.520
Wormholes are incredibly unstable and are prone to collapse quickly.

30
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.910
This is because the walls of a wormhole attract each other,

31
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.720
which is why the wormhole would probably close shortly after it opened,

32
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.640
unless you had some exotic matter.
Don't get too excited.

33
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.080
Exotic matter is negative energy and it's what you'd need in order to repel the

34
00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:13.590
gravitational forces trying to bring the walls of the wormhole together.

35
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.650
Unfortunately,
it's unlikely that such matter even exist in our universe,

36
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.400
but if you're already set on making a trip across the universe,

37
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.290
there's just one more thing you should know.

38
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.130
The Laws of physics say that you wouldn't be able to put enough negative energy

39
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.790
into a wormhole to keep it from collapsing.
But on the bright side,

40
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.170
that rule hasn't been tested yet.
So giddy up space cowboy right on,

41
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.100
prove their existence and we'll try to develop the necessary technology in your

42
00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:48.030
absence.
But even if we could create wormholes and travel through them,

43
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.110
would it be worth it?

44
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.340
Is it worth tilting the earth and rearranging the solar system just to visit

45
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:57.240
another galaxy or go back in time,
read your history,

46
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.700
read your science fiction,
see all movies and play all the games you won.

47
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.850
But let's be glad our solar system is the way it is.

48
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.260
Would we even be here if it wasn't?
Yeah.
