1
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.170
What if it was more like this?
We don't notice the Earth's spinning now,

2
00:00:11.171 --> 00:00:14.710
so what would life be like if it's spun a little faster?

3
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.530
Would we all just get really,
really dizzy?

4
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.750
How would we cope with shorter days and less sleep?

5
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.470
How would it affect our climate or geography?

6
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.060
If this is modern life,
can we survive any faster?

7
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.000
This is what if,
and here's what would happen if the earth spun twice as fast.

8
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.930
We don't feel the earth spinning because along with everything else on this

9
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:42.710
planet,
we're spinning right along with it.
At the equator,

10
00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:45.740
if the world turns out roughly 1600 kilometers per hour,

11
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.090
completing a full rotation in 24 hours,
so if you stood on the equator,

12
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.650
you would travel about 40,000 kilometers in one day,
spending twice as fast,

13
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.730
you'd lose half your day.
Time would fly,
but you wouldn't be having any fun.

14
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.620
Let's start with the good news.
Weight loss.
That's right.

15
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.070
If the world's spun twice as fast,
you'd weigh a lot less all day.
Everyday.

16
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.600
Centrifical force from the Earth's rotation threatens to shake you off the

17
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:15.110
planet.
Luckily gravity is stronger and keeps you grounded.

18
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.610
Still at the equator you weigh about a half kilogram less because more

19
00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:22.850
centrifical force is generated where the earth is spinning faster,

20
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.910
which ever so slightly decreases.

21
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.850
Gravity's hold on you so double the speed of earth spin and we're all the

22
00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:32.840
biggest loser.
That is because things are about to get a lot worse.

23
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.190
I think of all your favorite TV shows and try to come to terms with the fact

24
00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:39.170
that you'll never catch the next episode.

25
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.320
Most of our satellites that are used for communications,

26
00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:45.980
military intelligence and television broadcasting are synchronized with the

27
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:46.814
earth's rotation.

28
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.180
Even the smallest increase of speed would cause them to spin out of orbit,

29
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.410
but who's even got time for TV these days when days are only half as long?

30
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.590
Do you think he could function on four hours of sleep instead of eight?

31
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.290
How about one or two meals a day instead of three?

32
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.460
Humans would have to design new schedules and new calendars because instead of

33
00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:06.230
365 days in a year,

34
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.390
there would now be 730 hopefully there'd be twice as many holidays as well.

35
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.530
Adjusting to a new biological clock would be tough and not everyone would make

36
00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:16.730
it.
For example,

37
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.540
nocturnal species would have fewer hunting hours and may face extinction if they

38
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:23.750
couldn't adapt,
but humans would need to become more efficient too,

39
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.650
especially in terms of energy.
For the average person who drives to work,

40
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.760
they would now have to commute twice as often doubling fuel consumption and its

41
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:32.720
effect on our climate.

42
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.550
But really the climate would be beyond saving for starters,
extreme,

43
00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:42.500
whether it would be much more well extreme due to the curvature of the earth,

44
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.800
wind and water curve too,
as they travel across her the surface,

45
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.650
this is the Coriolis effect and it's the phenomenon that gives hurricanes there

46
00:02:49.651 --> 00:02:53.630
spin.
So the faster the rotation of the earth,
the more the winds curve,

47
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.720
the more hurricanes spin,
and the more energy they carry with them.

48
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.240
Put simply deadlier disasters.

49
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.930
But if you'd like to think of yourself as a storm Chaser,

50
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.210
well then hopefully you're a strong swimmer too.

51
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.630
With the Earth spinning at 3,200 kilometers per hour,

52
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.290
the centrifical force would essentially pull all the water from the northern and

53
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:15.490
southern hemispheres towards the equator.
Countries like Ecuador,
Columbia,

54
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.940
Venezuela,
Brazil,
Kenya,
Indonesia,
Singapore,

55
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:20.590
and Australia would be partially,

56
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.040
if not completely submerged on top of this,

57
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.420
reduced gravity and the Ecuadorian region would produce more moisture of ring of

58
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:32.410
dense fog and constant rain would permanently cover the earth's waistline.

59
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.610
So the next time you have a long day,
be glad it wasn't shorter.

60
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.600
Our way of life depends on it live in the moment,
24 hours a day,

61
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.490
365 days a year.
