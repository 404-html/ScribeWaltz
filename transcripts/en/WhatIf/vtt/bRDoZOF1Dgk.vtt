00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.200
Ever wondered what he was thinking

2
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.720
or maybe you've always wanted to express your feelings without saying a word.

3
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.830
What if you could read someone's mind and they could read yours?

4
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.810
Would there be no secrets left?

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.030
Would mind control become possible to and how could you keep your privacy if

6
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:25.500
everyone knew what was on your mind,

7
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.350
this is what if and here's what would happen if brain to brain communication was

8
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:35.850
possible.
Let's be honest.
The way we communicate is pretty slow.

9
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.880
It takes time.
From the moment that thought comes to your mind,

10
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.840
to the moment you say it to someone even longer with your two finger typing,

11
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.480
our brain is much faster than that.
On average,
you have 50,000 thoughts a day.

12
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.260
That's 35 thoughts per minute.
You can't type all of them,

13
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.060
nor can you put them into words.

14
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.590
Imagine how fast we could exchange information if we can just transmit our

15
00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.390
thoughts directly to another brain.

16
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.570
Once we started communicating through thought,

17
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.270
we'd turn into a giant mind melding network.

18
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.000
Humanity would become much more innovative.

19
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.430
Since the more people shared their ideas,

20
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.040
the more other people would be able to improve upon them.

21
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.700
This would boost technology to a level we can't yet imagine.

22
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.610
Sharing our knowledge through thoughts would also make us more coordinated.

23
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.920
This would not only benefit all military structures,
but also emergency services.

24
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.270
You'd be able to think nine one one instead of calling them very handy.

25
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:34.200
If your phone's dead,

26
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.310
we'd be learning much faster and easier instead of verbally explaining a

27
00:01:39.311 --> 00:01:40.320
difficult concept.

28
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.270
Your teacher could give you a better representation of it through thought and

29
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.700
don't forget things with artificial intelligence.

30
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.750
If your car had a mind of its own,
you'd be able to control it with your mind.

31
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.140
Same goes for your phone,
computer,
robot,
pet,

32
00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.000
anything that might have an AI while controlling things.
Sounds awesome.

33
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.350
What if this led to controlling people's minds?
They might sound interesting,

34
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.180
but it wouldn't seem that great if you the one being controlled.
Luckily,

35
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.720
the way it would work,
work would be that just like we can choose what to say,

36
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.630
we'd be able to choose what thoughts to share with others.

37
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.920
No one would read your thoughts unless you let them.
That's a relief,
isn't it?

38
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.410
This new era of mind reading would be pretty silent without the need to push air

39
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:27.240
through our lungs and into our voice box.

40
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.210
We might eventually for debt language and the sound of it,

41
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.380
but at least you'd never struggled to tell your crush exactly how you felt about

42
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:36.900
them.
You'd literally show them your feelings.

43
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.350
We don't know much about our bundle of neurons.

44
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.070
We don't fully understand why we sleep or how our consciousness marks,

45
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.790
but we do know how to read our brain.
Yep,
you heard it right.

46
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.010
Our brain fires neurons that receive transmit and process information through

47
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:56.640
electrical and chemical signals,
and we can read those signals.

48
00:02:56.641 --> 00:03:01.180
With the help of this method
or Eeg,

49
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.470
what's more,
we can now transmit information from one brain to another.

50
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.300
We have a method for that.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation or tms.

51
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.040
This stimulation sends electrical current to the receivers brain activating a

52
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:18.310
small area of it,
the same one that was active in the senders brain.

53
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.060
That might not exactly be the telepathy from science fiction,

54
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.350
but that's what talking through thought would look like in real life and we

55
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:29.410
don't always talk.
We use devices to communicate with each other.

56
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.440
Eventually we just switched to faster technologies.

57
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.500
The ones that would let you send your thoughts,
the way you send your emails.

58
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.630
Do you think you'll still be around to use EEG and tms is instead of your mobile

59
00:03:41.631 --> 00:03:42.050
phone?
