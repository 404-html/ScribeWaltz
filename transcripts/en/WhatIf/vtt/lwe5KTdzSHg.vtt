00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.380
How much do you know about black holes?

2
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.350
What would happen if you fell into one?
Say One day you were exploring space,

3
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:15.510
looking for a new planet for humans to inhabit,

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.260
but came across a black hole and decided to check it out?

5
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.000
Would you have any chance of survival?
How would you get out?

6
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.310
Would there be a short cut to another universe?
This is what if,

7
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.040
and here's what would happen if you fell into a black hole.

8
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.330
Despite being black and a hole.
A black hole is not a dark,
empty space.

9
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.000
In his theory of relativity,
Einstein predicted how black holes are formed.

10
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.710
When a massive star dies,
it leaves a smaller remnant core behind.

11
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.720
If the core mass is at least three times bigger than the mass of our sun,

12
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.610
gravity overwhelms all other forces and turns the core into a black hole.

13
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.350
But don't let its name for you.
A black hole isn't a hole at all,

14
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.200
but rather a huge amount of matter packed into it.
Very small space.

15
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.180
Think of the Sun with its gravitational field 28 times stronger than Earth's.

16
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.800
If you were to walk on the son,
you'd be 28 times heavier than you are on earth.

17
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.110
Now imagine squeezing four sons into something that's just 15 miles in diameter.

18
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.280
The distance you can cover in a 30 minute drive,
what would the gravity be like?

19
00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:31.870
They're a black holes.
Gravity is so strong that even light can't get out.

20
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.430
That's why you'll never see one,

21
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.780
but you can detect it from the gamma rays bursts that the whole limits these

22
00:01:37.781 --> 00:01:42.220
bursts discovered by Stephen Hawking.
Now carry his name,
hawking radiation.

23
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.480
Stephen Hawking himself believe that black holes can be passages to another

24
00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:49.030
universe.
So if you were to fall into one,

25
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.280
would you find yourself in an alternate dimension?

26
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.760
Every black hole has an event horizon.

27
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.030
The point at which gravitational pull becomes so strong,

28
00:01:58.031 --> 00:02:01.240
you can't escape from it.
The point of no return.

29
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.150
If you found yourself outside of that point,

30
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.600
you'd see that stars are twisted around a perfect circle of darkness.

31
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.250
As you start being pulled toward a black hole,
you'd be moving faster and faster.

32
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.080
Accelerated by the force of gravity.
That's the first bad news for you.

33
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.850
Brave space traveler.
The gravitational force of a black hole is very good,

34
00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:24.660
very strong.
If you fell feet first,

35
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.930
your legs would be feeling a stronger gravitational pull,
then your head,

36
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.030
your body would be stretched apart.

37
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.360
The most common black holes are called stellar.

38
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.860
They can stretch about nine miles across and be as heavy as 20 sons.

39
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.740
If you happen to be pulled towards a stellar black hole,

40
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.310
you'd be completely torn apart before you even reached the event horizon.

41
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.590
So make sure to choose a supermassive one,

42
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.400
the one that's a million times heavier than our sun.
In this case,

43
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.090
your body would remain unharmed as you cross the event horizon as the gravity

44
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:57.600
wouldn't be pulling both your feet and your head with almost the same strength.

45
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.730
And if you're wondering where to find one,
you don't have to look too far.

46
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.890
There's one right at the center of our Milky Way galaxy of luckily it's 165

47
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:09.490
quadrillion miles away from us and we'll suck in neither of the sun nor the

48
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:12.010
planets,
but don't pack your suitcase just yet.

49
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.190
Crossing the event horizon is just the beginning of the challenge.

50
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.790
There's a gravitational singularity at the center of the black hole where

51
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:20.170
density becomes infinite.

52
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.040
You'd be squashed into that center and become one with the black hole.

53
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.970
You wouldn't be able to tell anyone about your experience.
However,

54
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.340
a person observing you from outside the event horizon,

55
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:33.700
we'll see a very different picture as you were falling into a black hole.

56
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.090
They'd see you slowing down,
getting dimmer and redder.
In the end,

57
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.760
you just freeze,
never crossing the event horizon.

58
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.100
This is because space and time in a black hole swap the roles at the event

59
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:49.180
horizon.
Time comes to a standstill.
While space on the other hand moves forward.

60
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.020
You wouldn't be able to turn around and escape the black hole any more than you

61
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:56.590
could travel back in time.
Even when the black hole eventually died,

62
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.770
emitting all the particles it had absorbed including your body,

63
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.210
it would be impossible to tell whether those particles where you Stephen
Hawking,

64
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:07.810
however,
found a way in which the information about your body wouldn't be lost.

65
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.770
He theorized that there are alternative universes with different histories.

66
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.030
This means in one reality,
you fell into a black hole.
In the second one,

67
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.200
there was no black hole.

68
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.650
It's impossible to be certain from outside of the event horizon,

69
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.230
whether there's a black hole or not until you fall in there.

70
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.070
If you cross the event horizon and there was a black hole CNR,

71
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.460
but if you happen to be in a reality where the black hole didn't exist,

72
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.130
you'd still be alive just in a different universe.

73
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.620
There would be no way for you to get back to ours.

74
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.810
Would you dare explore the possibility?

75
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.850
Are you drawn to black holes in the universe?
Very soon.

76
00:04:41.851 --> 00:04:43.980
We'll take you on your next hypothetical adventure.
