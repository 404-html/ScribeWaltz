1
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.780
At least 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe.

2
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.470
There are nearly 500 billion planets in the Milky Way alone,

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.970
and at least 10 billion of them are earthlike all these planets,

4
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.950
and yet we've discovered exactly zero alien life forms.
But what if we did?

5
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.870
What if NASA announced that they found microbes and the oceans of Europa or

6
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:29.700
ancient alien ruins on Venus?

7
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.940
What would that mean to our human civilization here on earth?

8
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.610
Would we consider that good news?
This is what if,

9
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.520
and here's what would happen if we discovered alien life

10
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.890
since humans began searching for extraterrestrial life within our solar system

11
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.640
in the 1890s we're still waiting to encounter an alien life form.

12
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.230
But if we did find one,

13
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.760
that would be very bad news because in that case we might as well be dead.

14
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.450
It wouldn't look anything like the alien invasion.
You might imagine

15
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.610
nobody would blast.
They're super advanced weapons at us,
hopefully not.

16
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.923
Even if they did,

17
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.620
it wouldn't be that much of a problem because by the time we found alien life,

18
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.260
we'd already be on our way to self destruction,

19
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.140
all because of the great filter.

20
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.600
What kind of filter is capable of killing our entire civilization and why?

21
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.910
Let me go back a little bit.

22
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.430
Basically probability asserts that alien life must exist somewhere in the

23
00:01:27.431 --> 00:01:29.380
universe.
If that were the case,

24
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.950
wouldn't we be able to see some signs of life out there,
but we don't.

25
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.620
The university seems endlessly empty.
It's this contradiction.

26
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:39.900
It's been blowing scientists minds ever since.

27
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:43.080
They realize that the universe is very,
very big.

28
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.660
They called it the Fermi paradox.

29
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.860
It also says that all species in the universe go through the same evolutionary

30
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:52.890
path,
no matter where they're from.
First,

31
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.310
the development of life anywhere in the universe starts with the right star

32
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:58.990
system,
planet that has just the right conditions.

33
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.030
Then organic compounds assemble themselves into self replicating patterns and

34
00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:08.350
eventually evolve into more complex multicell organisms all the way up to the

35
00:02:08.351 --> 00:02:12.010
species with the big brain that eventually take over their own planet and change

36
00:02:12.011 --> 00:02:16.480
it according to their needs here on earth.
That happens to be us humans.

37
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.960
Then there's the last step space colonization.

38
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.850
That could happen for many reasons,

39
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.650
overpopulation and the need to spread out to survive conquest of solar systems,

40
00:02:26.651 --> 00:02:30.850
one after another,
or even simple curiosity,
whatever the reason is,

41
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.240
all civilizations,
we'll end up trying to call a nice space.

42
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.440
Some alien species may have been around for billions of years longer than us,

43
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.090
but they still haven't shown up here on earth.

44
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.780
Looks like something is making it very hard to colonize a galaxy,

45
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.520
maybe even impossible.
It's a great filter.
Yup.

46
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.020
The thing that might wipe out all of humanity,
it's something very dangerous.

47
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.160
Something that happens to every civilization that's advanced enough to go beyond

48
00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:00.280
their planet.
One of the steps on evolutionary path,

49
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.560
something that takes maybe billions of years to go through.

50
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.470
Having never met life on other planets means that the hypothesized great filter

51
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:10.450
didn't wipe us out.
Instead,

52
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.650
we might be the first civilization to pass it safely and the first to reach this

53
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:17.020
level of technology in the entire universe,

54
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.390
but just because we haven't seen them,

55
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.360
it doesn't mean they don't exist or never existed.

56
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.440
There's a chance of some aggressive alien species might've been on the way to

57
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:30.490
earth to destroy us all,
but since they never showed up on our planet,

58
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:34.090
that means something destroyed their entire civilization before they reached

59
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:36.070
earth.
The great filter,

60
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.000
it doesn't look like we're going to find anyone as advanced as we are.

61
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.630
If there was a more advanced civilization than ours,
we'd know it by now.

62
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.330
The most we can hope for is bacteria on Mars or multicellular animals in the

63
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:52.540
oceans of Europa.
Both options would be disturbing,

64
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:56.350
but the worst thing to find would be the ancient ruins of an advanced alien

65
00:03:56.351 --> 00:04:00.730
civilization because if they didn't get past the great filter,
neither did we.

66
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.080
The only difference is that they're long dead and we're just on our way to self

67
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:05.914
destruction.

68
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.690
The more complex and advanced the discovered alien life was more likely it would

69
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:12.730
mean that we're behind the great filter.

70
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.990
Maybe that filter starts once the species take control of their own planet.

71
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.010
Ai destroying its creator,
genetic engineering gone wrong,

72
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.130
climate change.
It could be anything.

73
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.150
It might have happened to those dead alien civilizations and might happen to us

74
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:32.950
too.
Alien life might sound like the most exciting discovery of our time.
However,

75
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.940
it might be better for us if the universe is absolutely sterile aisle and that

76
00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:39.820
there are billions of new planets to be discovered and terraform,

77
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.270
but that's a story for another.
What if.
