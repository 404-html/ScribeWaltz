1
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.170
Ah,
the good old days before electricity.

2
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.040
Did we actually have it better before the first power plant started running?

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.940
What if everyone on earth tried getting by with all their lights turned off?

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.640
We'd start the challenge with a perfect earth hour,

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.090
60 minutes of complete darkness,
no artificial light allowed.

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.990
Would we reduce the light pollution enough to be able to see the milky way in

7
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:28.290
the night sky?
How much electricity would we save?

8
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.840
Would it help us fight climate change?

9
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.180
This is what f and here's what would happen if everyone in the planet switched

10
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:37.500
off the lights for an hour.

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.840
Humanity has spent the last 100 years increasing our dependence on electricity.

12
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.520
Look around your computer,
microwave,
fridge,
elevator traffic lights,

13
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:51.030
public transportation,
everything relies on electrical power.

14
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.230
Going completely without power,
even for an hour would be pretty uncomfortable.

15
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.910
So let's just limit humanities.
Light usage,
hit the lights and let's begin.

16
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.800
On average,

17
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.180
humanity consumes 62,000 terajoules of electricity per hour.

18
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.290
That's how much energy your gas powered car would need to drive to Pluto and

19
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:14.460
back twice.
One fifth of all this energy goes towards lighting.

20
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.590
That's a lot of energy and producing.

21
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:19.380
It means spewing a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

22
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.020
Obviously clean energy from the sun.

23
00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:25.080
Wind and water don't effect co two concentration in the air,

24
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.290
but they only make up one third of global electricity production.

25
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.140
The rest of it releases greenhouse gas emissions.

26
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.800
The thinking is if we gave our power plants and our break,

27
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.190
we'd significantly reduce those co two emissions on a global level.

28
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.730
What an easy way to fight climate change together or is it turns out it's rather

29
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:46.980
complicated.
If this worldwide earth hour cut you at night,

30
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.430
getting by with the light of some cozy candles is not the best idea.

31
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.850
Not only are they a hundred times less efficient than your light bulb,

32
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.050
but guess what?
They also emit co two in theory,

33
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.440
you could even the score by using just one candle for every light bulb he turned

34
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:03.750
off,
but if you lit up twice as many candles,

35
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.860
you'd actually be admitting Morrissey too.
What if you didn't light any candles?

36
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.030
You might think we'd admit less carbon dioxide into the air,
but you'd be wrong.

37
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.870
Again,
that's not how power plants were.

38
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.240
The coal burning ones would in fact emit less co two during the dark hour,

39
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.050
but then everyone would turn the lights back on for power stations.

40
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.580
This sudden increase in demand would mean firing up more generators.
As a result,

41
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.050
they would admit even more co two and this extra carbon waste would start to

42
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:34.590
trap more heat in our lower atmosphere,
possibly speeding up climate change,

43
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.070
and that's if power plants were able to cope with such a rapid increase in

44
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:40.110
demand.
In a worst case scenario,

45
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.250
they'd need to perform an emergency shutdown leaving us with no electricity for

46
00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:46.380
days.
When that happened,

47
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.470
you would at least get to enjoy a view of the milky way at night of view.

48
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:54.270
That light pollution prevents one third of the world's population from seeing so

49
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:56.460
maybe you shouldn't pledge yourself back into darkness.

50
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.950
There are better ways to fight climate change than off all the lights.

51
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:01.810
At the same time.
For starters,

52
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.810
you could try replacing all your incandescent light bulbs with compact

53
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:07.600
fluorescent ones or take public transportation more.

54
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.390
What do you do to reduce your carbon footprint?
