00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.160
Imagine
traveling at the speed of an airplane,

2
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.610
but on ground level and in a giant tube.

3
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.210
That's the idea behind the hyperloop and network of incredibly fast moving pods

4
00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:20.310
that can carry passengers to destinations all over the world,

5
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.380
reducing travel times from hours to minutes,
but how would that work?

6
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.330
Would it be safe and what would it be like to ride in one of these pots?

7
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.220
This is what if,

8
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.910
and here's what would happen if earth had a global hyperloop network.

9
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.180
A hyperloop consists of pods,

10
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.290
the travel through pressurized tubes using electromagnetic propulsion.

11
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.730
This may sound like the stuff of science fiction with several companies are

12
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:51.420
surprisingly close to making it a safe,
viable reality.

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.070
Once completed,

14
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.330
this giant transportation system would connect all major cities around the
globe.

15
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.090
How would it change the way we live our lives?

16
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.650
<v 1>If all goes according to plan,
a hyperloop system would be cheaper,
faster,</v>

17
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.640
and more environmentally friendly than planes,
trains,
and automobiles.

18
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.320
The first ones would be built on a relatively small scale covering shorter

19
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:18.690
journeys like Los Angeles to San Francisco,

20
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.380
traveling at over 1200 kilometers per hour.

21
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.820
These speedy pods would take the pressure off gridlocked roads making travel

22
00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:28.860
between cities much easier for everyone.

23
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.030
Populations would have the ability to spread out further from city centers.

24
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.260
Since faster travel times would mean people aren't forced to live where their

25
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:38.160
jobs are located.

26
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.140
We also have a lot more time to be productive because we wouldn't waste as much

27
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.640
of our days getting to where we needed to go,

28
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.050
but the real exciting prospects of the hyperloop come into play when you look at

29
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:51.720
it on a global scale.
First off,

30
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.980
international travel would become a whole lot more accessible.
Elon Musk,

31
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:59.850
one of the founders of the project says that tickets would be kept affordable in

32
00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:03.030
order to open the service up to everyone.
On top of that,

33
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.350
international deliveries would be completely revolutionized with the hyperloop.

34
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.940
We could autonomously ship packages across the world at the cost of trucking and

35
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:12.774
the speed of flight,

36
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.410
but before we get too far ahead of ourselves with all the possibilities,

37
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.430
what would it be like to ride the thing?
Well,
for one thing,

38
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.110
the pots would be pretty small.

39
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.780
They'd have to be narrowed to travel at such high speeds.

40
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:29.390
So things might get a little cramped and you wouldn't have any windows.
Instead,

41
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.410
there would be augmented reality screens,

42
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.230
the consumer late scenery or provide entertainment,

43
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.460
but the seats would be comfortable and that's a big deal considering how intense

44
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:39.294
the ride gets.

45
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.510
The designers behind the hyperloop say that writers would only experience unease

46
00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:46.170
during the acceleration and deceleration of the trip.

47
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.100
A span of only about two minutes,
but what about when it turns?

48
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.520
Have you ever made a sharp turn in your car at 50 kilometers an hour?

49
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.600
We'll imagine what that would be like at 1200 kilometers per hour.

50
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.840
One way to smooth it out would be to make huge curves in the track to make long,

51
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:02.980
gradual turns,

52
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.090
but that would make for a much larger impact on the areas the tunnels run

53
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:07.924
through.

54
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.460
And what if it needed to make an emergency stop a sudden halt at these speeds

55
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.810
would be 10 times worse than a car crash at 110 kilometers per hour.

56
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.700
These concerning questions coupled with the obvious issues that would come with

57
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.720
building giant tunnels that span across oceans and numerous governments are

58
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:30.010
signs that the hyperloop might just be a fantasy for now.
In the meantime,

59
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.460
maybe someone will come up with a better idea for rapid global transit,

60
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.910
but that's a topic for another.
What if.
