00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.330
We've heard about terraforming the moon and Mars as we attempt to colonize
space,

2
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.610
but what about Venus?
If we did manage to terraform our neighbor one day,

3
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.720
it could look like this.
Could we live here one day?

4
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.180
How different would it be from life on earth?
This is what if,

5
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.130
and here's what would happen if we terraform Venus,
believe it or not,

6
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.580
earth and Venus are very similar at times.

7
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.850
Venus is even referred to as Earth's sister planet.

8
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.590
They're both roughly the same diameter,
have the same mass,
same gravity,

9
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.960
and they're both made out of the same material,

10
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.560
a central iron core and a rocky mantle.
Unfortunately,

11
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:49.770
the comparisons end there.
Unlike earth,

12
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.690
Venus is extremely hot,

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.310
has an incredibly dense atmosphere and toxic fumes on its surface.

14
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.430
What would we need to do to make it habitable?

15
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.670
Scientists and astronomers have been theorizing how to terraform Venus for over

16
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:06.690
half a century.

17
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.890
The two biggest issues that need to be solved or the atmosphere and the

18
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:13.170
temperature on Venus.
Currently,

19
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.070
the surface of Venus is a sweltering 462 degrees,

20
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.670
hot enough to melt lead and the atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide is

21
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:27.891
93 times as heavy as earth's one proposed way of altering Venus's atmosphere is

22
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:31.920
to bomb it with hydrogen hydrogen bombs.

23
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.970
When reacting with the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would create graphite

24
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.620
and water.
This would fall down to the planet surface and cover 80% of it.

25
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:44.550
With oceans.
Mind you,
they wouldn't be nearly as deep as earth's oceans.

26
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.030
Venus would only have 10% the amount of water that earth has.

27
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.370
This would take a lot of hydrogen.

28
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.390
The only way we could get enough is if we were to harvest the resource from

29
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:58.860
Jupiter or Saturn.
This approach would also require iron aerosol,

30
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.300
a material that can be mined from asteroids.
If all went according to plan,

31
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.440
the dense carbon dioxide atmosphere would be reduced to being just three times

32
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:10.230
as heavy as earth's okay,
that's manageable.

33
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.880
This would also help clear the clouds of sulfuric acid that hang over the
planet.

34
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.720
Okay,
the atmosphere's clear.
Now,
what about the temperature?

35
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.080
One way to cool the surface is with solar shades,

36
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.820
a series of small spaceships or one large lens that would divert the rays of the

37
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:27.654
sun.

38
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.740
The solar shades can be placed on the surface of the planet or in the atmosphere

39
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.250
slowly working to cool down the planet and reduce radiation.

40
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.820
Another issue that would need to be resolved before we started living on Venus.

41
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.830
In addition to solar shades,

42
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.580
NASA thinks that we could build floating cities above the clouds of Venus,

43
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.290
these woodwork as a safe living space as we learn and attempt to terraform the

44
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:53.460
environment to cool the planet even more and to speed up the process.

45
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.040
Cooling pipes could be put on the surface of the planet.

46
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.400
These pipes would take heat from the surface and bring it up to colder parts of

47
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:03.160
the atmosphere.
Now we have a suitable atmosphere,

48
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.990
a proper temperature and clean air,

49
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.890
but there's one other huge issue that humans might have if they move to Venus,

50
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.620
they'd have extremely long days and nights.

51
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.820
Since Venus rotates once every 243 earth days,

52
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.480
meaning a day on Venus is 5,800 hours long.

53
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.550
Not to mention it's the only planet in our solar system to rotate clockwise,

54
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.530
meaning that it's extremely slow.

55
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:30.760
Sunrise would happen in the West and sunsets would be in the east.

56
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.070
We could create the illusion of a 24 hour day cycle by using massive mirrors and

57
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:40.120
having them rotate to reflect the sun.
If this managed to work correctly,

58
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.960
Venus would feel just like home with maybe a touch less gravity.

59
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.190
After all this,
Venus would finally be habitable.
Sure,

60
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:51.640
the planet would rotate differently and you'd get a different view of the sun,

61
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:54.310
but it could be another place for humans to live.

62
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.120
Scientists theorize that it could be a backup plan at one day,

63
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.140
studying more about Venus could teach us something about earth.

64
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.890
Venus suffers incredibly strong.
Greenhouse effects,

65
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.710
the cause of its extreme temperatures and dense atmosphere.

66
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.320
By learning more about cooling this planet,

67
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.690
it may unlock the secrets to cooling our own and maybe make our home last even

68
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:20.740
longer,
but that sounds like a story for another.

69
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.850
What if.
