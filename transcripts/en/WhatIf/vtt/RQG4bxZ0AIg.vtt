00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.030
Not once has a single black hole disturb our planetary routine,

2
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.550
but what if it did

3
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.290
with this uninvited guest swallow up everything on its way through the solar

4
00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:20.200
system or would it just slightly disrupted?

5
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.480
This is what if,

6
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.440
and here's what would happen if a black hole appeared in our solar system.

7
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.110
Black holes aren't exactly holes.

8
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.670
There are a large amount of matter that has been crammed into a very small
space.

9
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.140
Being so compressed gives them an incredibly strong gravitational pull.

10
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.550
Not even light can escape a black holes grasp and if you get too close to a

11
00:00:42.551 --> 00:00:46.750
black hole,
you yourself would get compressed to an infinitely small dot.

12
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.980
A black hole entering our solar system would not be good news,

13
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.690
but just how bad would it be?

14
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.960
The extent of the havoc that a single black hole with Rick on the solar system

15
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.490
depends on how big that black hole was and how far into the solar system it got.

16
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.830
If we're talking a supermassive black hole like to one residing at the center of

17
00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:11.520
our Milky Way Galaxy,
our chances of survival are slim.

18
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.040
A monster that size would cause us trouble even from a distance of a few light

19
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.930
years away.
Presumably supermassive black holes have stars,
planets,

20
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.060
asteroids,
and comets orbiting around them.

21
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.380
All the debris that a supermassive black hole picked up on its way through space

22
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.210
would bombard our solar system.

23
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.430
Then that gigantic black hole would tug whatever was left into an orbit around

24
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:37.920
it.
We belonged,
gone by that time,

25
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.950
wiped out by some rogue planet that smashed into Earth.

26
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.170
Let's try our chances with a stellar black hole.

27
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.400
This is a black hole that's up to 20 times more massive than our son.

28
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.510
If this kind of black hole made it to the outer reaches of the solar system,

29
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.300
it would cause a gravitational mess in the Oort cloud.

30
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.940
The area of icy comment like objects,

31
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.170
a stellar black hole would hurl more comets and asteroids into the inner solar

32
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:08.160
system where they could strike the planets.
Earth might take some hits too,

33
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.740
but that would be just a warmup.

34
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.010
As the black hole made its way through the solar system,

35
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.830
it would disrupt the orbits of all the planets in it.

36
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.120
Likely our space intruder would tangle with the biggest planet in the system.

37
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.080
Jupiter.
The black hole would pull all the gas from the giant planet,

38
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.540
turning it into a swirling hot disc.

39
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.350
It would keep pulling until it consumed Jupiter entirely.

40
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.890
What would happen to our own planet in this gravitational mess?

41
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.960
Things wouldn't be good for earth.

42
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.400
The black hole would start effecting us even from a distance of Pluto's orbit.

43
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.540
First,

44
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.200
it would pull us out of the habitable zone and we humans might not be ready to

45
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:49.500
adapt to this change.
We wouldn't have much time to complain though.

46
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.580
Since there would be worse things ahead as the black hole approaches earth,

47
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.950
it would cause the cracking of the planet's crust.

48
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.070
We'd see extreme earthquakes and eruptions.

49
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.560
The ocean tides would be devastating to by the time the black hole past Earth's

50
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:07.990
orbit,
there would be nothing left of our planet,

51
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.510
but a stare all surface paved with magma.

52
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.140
Maybe earth would be ejected from the solar system altogether.

53
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.610
That would probably be for the best because when the black hole got close enough

54
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:20.620
to the sun,
it would start drinking up.

55
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:25.060
The Sun's flaming gas and pulling our center of gravity into it's insatiable

56
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:28.990
stomach.
If somehow birth stuck around for the after party,

57
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.120
it would be torn to shreds and consumed by the black hole.
Luckily,

58
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.910
black holes don't seem to be very numerous in the universe.

59
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.720
The chances are better for a rogue planet to enter our solar system,

60
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.230
but that's a story for another.
What if.
