00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.773
Okay.

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.620
<v 1>Are you one of those people who hate these little crawling things or maybe these</v>

3
00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:11.390
ones with the stingers creep you out more?

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.260
Have you ever wished that all the insects would just die out?

5
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.560
Picnics would be much more pleasant and so what?
Gardening.

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.300
Could the world become a better place if insects disappeared or would this have

7
00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:26.570
terrible consequences?
Not obvious for us at first glance,

8
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.490
this is what if,

9
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.000
and here's what would happen if all insects disappeared from the planet.

10
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.740
If you think bugs only exist to give you the creeps and the chew and the lettuce

11
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:39.860
in your garden,
you're wrong.
Well not totally wrong.

12
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.620
Some of them are in fact meant to destroy crops,

13
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.300
give you a skin irritations in addition to painful stings and even worse spread

14
00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:49.310
diseases like Zika and malaria,

15
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.350
but 90% of them are not only harmless but beneficial to us and to the planet.

16
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.830
They say without insects,
the world would fall apart.

17
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.350
Just how bad would that be if we put all the insects on the planet together on a

18
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:07.820
scale,
they would weigh approximately 300 times more than all humans combined.

19
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.270
If you haven't set a phobia,
you probably want me to stop right here.

20
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.320
Just let me add that the ants alone would weigh more than all humans.

21
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.590
If our planet suddenly had all this weight off it's shoulders,

22
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.570
farmers would be the first to celebrate.

23
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.890
They'd no longer need to pour chemicals on their crops to save the harvest from

24
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:25.724
hungry pasts,

25
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.260
but that celebration wouldn't last long because without insects we'd all starve

26
00:01:30.261 --> 00:01:33.710
pretty fast
and no,
we don't mean that.

27
00:01:33.711 --> 00:01:37.100
Those bold adventurers who snack on crickets and grasshoppers somewhere in

28
00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:40.730
Thailand would starve.
Humans might be predators in the food chain,

29
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.010
but insects are the ones to hold this chain together.

30
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.150
They are food for some reptiles,
small birds and frogs.

31
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.700
If all insects vanished,

32
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.020
those animals would cease to exist to the animal's feeding on frogs and reptiles

33
00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:57.050
would be the next to die off and then the ones further up the chain.

34
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.200
Eventually this disruption would work its way up to humans.

35
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.950
Think you could survive by going Vegan wrong again.

36
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.210
80% of all plant life on the planet is made up of flowering plants,

37
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.790
meaning they require pollination to reproduce.

38
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.530
Insects are the ones who make this happen by physically transferring pollen from

39
00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:19.940
a male anther to a female stigma.
You can argue the birds and bats,

40
00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:24.800
even wind can pollinate too,
but most of the work is done by bees.
WASPS moths,

41
00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:29.030
butterflies and flies.
Without them,
it's game over for most plants,

42
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.790
depending on what your food preferences are,

43
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.060
50 to 90% of your diet comes from those flowering plants.

44
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.380
There would be no fruit,
no vegetables,
no rice,
and no weep.

45
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.320
This also means no food for cows,
chickens,

46
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.470
most freshwater fish and all the animals we humans eat.

47
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.470
It doesn't matter if you're a vegetarian or a meat lover.

48
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.070
If the insects disappeared,
you'd have no chance of long term survival.

49
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.260
You'd be left to slowly starve on a planet heaped up with piles of organic
waste.

50
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.870
Because not only do insects feed small animals and pollinate plants,

51
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.070
there are also major decomposers of dead stuff from leaves to corpses.

52
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.690
That wouldn't be the world you'd want to live in,
and to be honest,

53
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.120
not all the insects are gross looking.
Wouldn't you agree?

54
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.230
Join us next time on what if.
