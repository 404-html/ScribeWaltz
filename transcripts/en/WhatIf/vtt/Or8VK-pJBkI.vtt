00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.350
Have you ever met someone who always feels cold even when everyone else is

2
00:00:09.351 --> 00:00:12.540
warming?
We tend to joke that these people are cold blooded,

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.550
but do we even know what that means?

4
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.120
Having called blood involves more than just needing a few more blankets than

5
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:22.050
everyone else.
If we all suddenly became cold blooded instead of warm,

6
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.670
our lives would be completely different.
Why would we need to eat less food?

7
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.400
Could we only survive in warm climates?

8
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.170
And how might our cold blood help with space exploration?
This is what if,

9
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.350
and here's what would happen if humans became cold blooded.

10
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.680
When our body temperatures get too hot or too cold,

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.400
we have built in processes like shivering and sweating to help regulate them,

12
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.900
but cold blooded or exothermic creatures don't have that same luxury.

13
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.450
That means that if we became cold blooded,

14
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.980
our lives would be a lot more limited and in the winter a good heater could be

15
00:00:55.981 --> 00:01:00.060
the difference between life or death.
Do you think we'd be able to survive?

16
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.140
If you were to wake up tomorrow with cold blood,

17
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.650
there'll be a lot of new things to get used to.
Some good and some bad.

18
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.240
For one thing,

19
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.540
your grocery bill would be a lot smaller as you wouldn't have to eat nearly as

20
00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:15.051
much as you do.

21
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:19.370
Now warm blooded animals eat a lot because they need all that energy to keep

22
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:20.660
their bodies at the right temperature.

23
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.000
But what if you like your three meals a day?

24
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.160
Sure you can keep eating as much as you like,

25
00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:29.270
but with no use for all those calories,
all that food would go straight to fat.

26
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.100
If you're smart about it,

27
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.280
you probably wouldn't have to worry about visiting the doctor as much anymore.

28
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:38.870
Either are warm blooded bodies provide a nice constant temperature for germs to

29
00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:42.160
breed in as opposed to the variable temperatures of the cold blooded.

30
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.170
If bacteria and viruses can't get used to your buddies climate,

31
00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:48.930
then your chances of getting sick drop significantly.

32
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.740
But that's not to say that you'd be invincible if you don't make a conscious

33
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:53.940
effort to keep yourself warm.

34
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.080
You're low body temperature could slow down your immune system allowing bacteria

35
00:01:58.081 --> 00:01:59.790
and viruses to creep up and infect you.

36
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.810
So you may have become a less desirable host for these pathogens,

37
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.070
but now you also have an active responsibility in fighting them off.

38
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.860
Keeping yourself at a proper body temperature would become a crucial part of

39
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:17.520
your everyday life.
Since you'd be relying on external sources of heat,

40
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.340
your house would have to be kept much warmer than you're used to.

41
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.640
Your thermostat would not only control the temperature of your house,

42
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.910
it would be setting the exact temperature you want your body to be too.

43
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.403
During the winter,

44
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.130
any money you would've saved on groceries would be quickly gobbled up by a sky

45
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:33.060
high.
Heating Bill.

46
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.530
Cold blooded land dwellers tend to do best in temperatures between 21 to 40

47
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:38.430
degrees Celsius.

48
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.060
So to make things easier for ourselves and to live more active lives,

49
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.370
we'd all be best to move closer to the equator,

50
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.530
except that'd be a lot of people to move to one area of the planet and soon we'd

51
00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:52.470
be running into the usual issues that come along with large scale human

52
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:55.140
migration.
It'd be overcrowded,

53
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.040
our resources would be running out and who knows how long it would take before

54
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.910
political instability came into play.

55
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.380
So maybe it'd be better if some of us just move to another planet altogether.

56
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.020
Yeah,
it's a little ambitious,

57
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:11.980
but bear with me because space travel should actually be much easier for cold

58
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:15.430
blooded humans.
When cold blooded animals hibernate over the winter,

59
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.090
they lower their body temperatures to that other surroundings and enter a state

60
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:22.300
called torpor.
In this catatonic state,

61
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.470
they're breathing and heartbeats slow down and they can survive for long periods

62
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:29.320
on stored body fat.
By employing this method,

63
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.800
a cold blooded space crew could survive much longer than a warm blooded one,

64
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.820
allowing them to travel for months or even years on minimal resources.

65
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.260
Maybe out there in space,

66
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:41.260
they'd find a planet that's perfectly suited for cold blooded creatures,

67
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.970
and maybe there are already some living there,
but that's a topic for another.

68
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.810
What if.
