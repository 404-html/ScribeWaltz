00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.240
Ever since the first astronaut went to space almost 60 years ago,

2
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.330
over 500 people and blasted out of earth's atmosphere.

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.020
They lived and worked in space at different times,

4
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.760
but nobody's ever been born there.

5
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.050
What if you were the first space baby to be carried aboard a space station?

6
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.340
How would your young body develop in microgravity and would you be able to visit

7
00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:28.790
your relatives on planet earth?
This is what if,

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.390
and here's what would happen if you were born on a space station.

9
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.460
So what's so different about being born in space anyway?
No gravity.
Well,
in fact,

10
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.810
gravity on the International Space Station is about 90% is strong as it is on

11
00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:45.770
the surface of the earth.
So why do we see astronauts floating around inside it?

12
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.100
That's because they're actually falling.
Let me explain.

13
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.740
Earth's gravity is pulling the ISS down,

14
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.210
but the ISS is moving very fast at the same speed that the earth's surface is

15
00:00:56.211 --> 00:00:59.960
turning underneath it.
The space station is constantly falling to earth,

16
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.040
but we'll never hit it.
The free fall is what causes microgravity.

17
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.630
Making the astronauts float around.

18
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.420
So what would it be like to be born weightless?
Before we get to the birth part,

19
00:01:11.421 --> 00:01:14.960
let us just say nobody's ever had sexual intercourse on a space station,

20
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.680
let alone made a baby.
It wouldn't be any kind of out of this world.

21
00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:22.040
Experience fluids work differently in micro gravity.

22
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.220
You may not have the blood flow to get you or your partner or aroused.

23
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.930
Sweat would build up around your body making it wet and sticky all over and

24
00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:33.320
that's if you could figure out how not to push your partner away upon contact.

25
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.340
Conceiving a child would be a whole other problem.

26
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.380
In addition to a low gravity environment,

27
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.400
there's also so much radiation in space that it can affect immense sperm count,

28
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.700
possibly even cause infertility and we don't even know exactly what kind of

29
00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:51.920
changes space conditions would cause to a human embryo.

30
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.030
Let's imagine you're pregnant mother arrived on a space station to give birth to

31
00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:59.390
you.
The trip to space alone would be hard enough on your mother.

32
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.720
Pushing you out of her body without the help of gravity wouldn't be a piece of

33
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:05.720
cake either.
If you made it out of the womb.

34
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.020
A low gravity environment would affect your body systems as you grew up,

35
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.870
including your muscular development and eyesight.

36
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.530
When grownup astronauts work on board the space station,

37
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.590
their bone density depletes at a rate of 1% per month because it takes no effort

38
00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:24.620
to float in space.
They also tend to lose muscle strength.
Now,

39
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.890
since there's no way to force a baby to run on a treadmill to keep its muscles

40
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:32.000
forming as you grew on the space station,
your skeleton might become deformed.

41
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.690
Your heart would be weak as it's never had to work against Earth's gravity.

42
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.850
Then there's space radiation.

43
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.750
It would increase the probability of cancer dysfunction of the heart and central

44
00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:43.850
nervous system and eyesight problems.

45
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.600
If after surviving all that you made the trip to Earth,

46
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.060
you wouldn't be able to walk or balance properly.

47
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.210
You might also struggle trying to interact with people on earth.

48
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.270
Since you grew up crammed into a very small space your whole life,

49
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.920
until somebody invents a gravity degenerate,

50
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.200
artificial gravity fields on a space station,

51
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.610
we probably shouldn't think about having babies in space,
but once they do,

52
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.480
how long do you think it would take for us to become a galactic civilization?

53
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.200
That's a question for another.
What if.
