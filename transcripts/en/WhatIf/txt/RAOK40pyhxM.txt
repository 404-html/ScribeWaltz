Speaker 1:          00:04          Every day you move about 37 trillion cells are working hard inside your body to keep you going. These cells are constantly replicating, living and dying as directed by your deoxyribonucleic acid, your DNA. What if one day you suddenly lost it? Would you feel anything at all? How long could you stay alive? This is what if, and here's what would happen if your DNA suddenly disappeared for a start, you'd lose weight just a third of a pound or about 150 grams, not the best weight loss strategy. DNA isn't just a series of perfectly structured molecules. It's your body's library. It stores your genetic information and tells yourselves how to grow and function. The moment your DNA vanish from your body, you likely wouldn't notice a thing, not until your body started dying cell by cell and you became a walking ghost. How long do you think you would last for?

Speaker 1:          01:03          Think of radiation poisoning? Gamma radiation destroys your DNA, but you don't die from it immediately. Your body still works or your immune system slowly collapses. The same thing would happen to you if all your DNA disappeared to keep you alive. Your body cells constantly replicate themselves by dividing nearly 2 trillion cells divide every day. Some of them like your bone marrow cells, which are responsible for producing blood divide more often than others. They all need instruction from your DNA to function properly. Without those instructions, they just stopped working on the bright side. No one would be able to steal your genetic information to violate your privacy. What? After 24 hours without a 100 billion new cells producing blood, your immune system would collapse. At this point, even an ordinary infection could kill you. After five days, all of the cells lining your stomach would die out to your body would be unable to digest food. You'd suffer from gastrointestinal disease, resulting in nausea, heartburn, bloating, and constipation and say goodbye to your hair. Since your hair follicle cells would stop reproducing. In a normal state, you lose about 40,000 dead skin cells per hour without being able to generate new cells. You could scratch your skin right off within a week. Luckily for you, you wouldn't last long enough to experience those horrors. Rapid infection or system wide organ failure would kill you within days, possibly even hours. You Die, writhing and abdominal pain, dizziness and nausea. The good thing is no one has ever lost all their DNA yet.

Speaker 2:          02:55          Okay.
