Speaker 1:          00:04          There are sunsets on other planets, even more spectacular than the ones on earth. What if we could see not just one, but two sons falling below the Earth's horizon? What our planet get much warmer with two stars heating it up. Would we ever experience nighttime again? It could. Our binary star system be able to sustain life. This is what if, and here's what would happen if we had two sons. Not all star systems form around a single star. Some scientists even suggest that our son once had a star companion, a long lost wharf star called Nemesis. It broke free of the sun's gravity and melted into the milky way billions of years ago. Our search for earth size planets throughout the galaxy showed us that not only our most our systems binary, but they also have habitable zones and planets within them. It looks like the earth could sustain life with two sons instead of just one, but only under certain conditions.

Speaker 1:          01:09          In a binary star system. Earth's fate would depend on many factors from the masses of the stars to their position relative to Earth, and each other. Chances are high that Earth's orbit would be very unstable if one of the sons was bigger and brighter and had a much stronger gravitational impact on us. That son could pull the planet towards itself. We get pretty crispy before disappearing and it's solar flares. On the other hand, if neither stars, gravitational pull was strong enough, the earth would fly out into space, would become one of those rogue planets that traveled the universe all alone with no star system to call home. Let's assume that the Earth's orbit would be stable. This would be possible if the earth orbit had just one of the sons, but that's no good for complex life on the planet because at some point, the stars would face both sides of the planet at the same time.

Speaker 1:          01:58          Not only would that take away our nights, but it would also bring double doses of UV radiation and solar winds. No sunscreen could prevent you from getting toasted by two sons. The Earth's orbit could be stable. If the planet rotated around the two stars, the stars would have to be close together and the Earth's orbit would be further away. Just how far away most likely beyond the habitable zone where the heat of the sons wouldn't be enough to keep our water in a liquid state. The planet would turn into a frozen lifeless rock feeling hopeless yet? Well, we have some good news for you. The best case scenario for our planet would be if we replaced our son with two closely matched stars. Each half is bright as the sun. This would keep our planet warm enough to sustain life because of the total gravity of the two stars would be stronger.

Speaker 1:          02:47          It would take the earth 280 days instead of 365 to make a whole circle around them. The distance between the stars would have to be less than 15 million kilometers apart that the orbits of all the other planets in our system would be stable. Even Mercury's, but let's play safe and assume the distance between the stars was about 5 million kilometers in that scenario. The two stars would orbit each other once every 10 days, every five days. One Star would pass in front of another from Earth that would look like a solar eclipse, but instead of our moon blocking the sun, it would be one star blocking another, and instead of seven and a half minutes, that eclipse would last for about five hours. Under those conditions, the earth could be just fine orbiting two sons. The only question is whether the earth would have formed in a binary star system in the first place. As far as we know, the smallest planets circling two sons is a gas giant, much bigger than earth. Maybe there is a small rocky planet like earth orbiting two sons somewhere in the universe. We just haven't found it yet. It might even sustain life intelligent enough to send a signal to our planet, but that's a topic for another. What if.
