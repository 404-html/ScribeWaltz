1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,090
There are sunsets on other planets, even
more spectacular than the ones on earth.

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,370
What if we could see not just one,

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,370
but two sons falling
below the Earth's horizon?

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,450
What our planet get much warmer
with two stars heating it up.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,860
Would we ever experience nighttime again?
It could.

6
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:25,740
Our binary star system
be able to sustain life.

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,560
This is what if, and here's what
would happen if we had two sons.

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,210
Not all star systems form
around a single star.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,100
Some scientists even suggest that
our son once had a star companion,

10
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,830
a long lost wharf star called Nemesis.

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,960
It broke free of the sun's gravity and
melted into the milky way billions of

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,793
years ago.

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,780
Our search for earth size
planets throughout the galaxy
showed us that not only

14
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:56,340
our most our systems binary,

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,370
but they also have habitable
zones and planets within them.

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,440
It looks like the earth could sustain
life with two sons instead of just one,

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,320
but only under certain conditions.

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,620
In a binary star system.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,390
Earth's fate would depend on many factors
from the masses of the stars to their

20
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,550
position relative to Earth,
and each other.

21
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,860
Chances are high that Earth's orbit
would be very unstable if one of the sons

22
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:26,490
was bigger and brighter and had a much
stronger gravitational impact on us.

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,010
That son could pull the
planet towards itself.

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,520
We get pretty crispy before
disappearing and it's solar flares.

25
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,780
On the other hand, if neither stars,
gravitational pull was strong enough,

26
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,940
the earth would fly out into space,

27
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,810
would become one of those rogue planets
that traveled the universe all alone

28
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,430
with no star system to call home.

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,910
Let's assume that the Earth's
orbit would be stable.

30
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,270
This would be possible if the earth
orbit had just one of the sons,

31
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,080
but that's no good for complex life
on the planet because at some point,

32
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:58,140
the stars would face both sides
of the planet at the same time.

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,420
Not only would that take away our nights,

34
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,650
but it would also bring double doses
of UV radiation and solar winds.

35
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,810
No sunscreen could prevent you
from getting toasted by two sons.

36
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,290
The Earth's orbit could be stable. If
the planet rotated around the two stars,

37
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,010
the stars would have to be close together
and the Earth's orbit would be further

38
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:17,844
away.

39
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,380
Just how far away most likely beyond
the habitable zone where the heat of the

40
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:25,170
sons wouldn't be enough to keep
our water in a liquid state.

41
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,570
The planet would turn into a frozen
lifeless rock feeling hopeless yet?

42
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,520
Well,
we have some good news for you.

43
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,050
The best case scenario for our planet
would be if we replaced our son with two

44
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:40,200
closely matched stars.
Each half is bright as the sun.

45
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,360
This would keep our planet warm enough
to sustain life because of the total

46
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:47,340
gravity of the two
stars would be stronger.

47
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,610
It would take the earth 280 days instead
of 365 to make a whole circle around

48
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:53,694
them.

49
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,720
The distance between the stars would have
to be less than 15 million kilometers

50
00:02:57,721 --> 00:03:02,020
apart that the orbits of all the other
planets in our system would be stable.

51
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,130
Even Mercury's,

52
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,020
but let's play safe and assume the
distance between the stars was about 5

53
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,060
million kilometers in that scenario.

54
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,620
The two stars would orbit each other
once every 10 days, every five days.

55
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,520
One Star would pass in front of another
from Earth that would look like a solar

56
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:21,190
eclipse,
but instead of our moon blocking the sun,

57
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,330
it would be one star blocking another,
and instead of seven and a half minutes,

58
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,730
that eclipse would last for about
five hours. Under those conditions,

59
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,980
the earth could be just
fine orbiting two sons.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,240
The only question is whether the earth
would have formed in a binary star system

61
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:40,000
in the first place.
As far as we know,

62
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,800
the smallest planets circling two sons
is a gas giant, much bigger than earth.

63
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,120
Maybe there is a small rocky planet like
earth orbiting two sons somewhere in

64
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:50,860
the universe.
We just haven't found it yet.

65
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,930
It might even sustain life intelligent
enough to send a signal to our planet,

66
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,200
but that's a topic for another.
What if.
