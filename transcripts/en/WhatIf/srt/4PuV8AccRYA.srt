1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,570
What if we could engineer a gigantic mega
structure capable of harvesting every

2
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:13,590
bit of the sun's energy,
something known as a Dyson sphere?

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,710
How long would it take to
construct this mega shell?

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,490
Where would we find all the materials
needed and what can we do with the

5
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:24,240
structure? Once we finally
built it, this is what if,

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,230
and here's what would happen if we could
build a Dyson sphere around the sun.

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,460
The idea of a Dyson sphere was well
stolen from aliens in 1960 astrophysicist

8
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:40,920
Freeman Dyson theorized
another civilization that
found a way to meet their ever

9
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:45,150
increasing energy and space demands.
They rearranged their solar system.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,040
This hypothetical advanced civilization
built a hollow sphere around their own

11
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:54,390
son and provided themselves with an
incredible amount of energy and habitable

12
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:56,670
real estate.
But what about us?

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,980
How would we go about building this
space level structure? Theoretically,

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,480
if we built a Dyson sphere,

15
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,720
we'd have access to a colossal 400
septillion watts of solar energy.

16
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,740
That's a trillion times more power than
our entire civilization consumes today.

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,630
The problem is no known material is
strong enough to handle all the space

18
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:23,010
radiation, and even if we created
one in very large quantities,

19
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,420
a tiny gravitational pull towards
the sun would make our solid sphere

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,960
uninhabitable. Not to mention
that it would be totally unstable.

21
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,040
Every meteor strike would push a
part of this fear towards the star,

22
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,520
but all these issues can be
solved with a simple adjustment.

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,080
Instead of building a solid Dyson sphere,
we could build a Dyson swarm,

24
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,550
a myriad of solar collectors with
their individual orbits around the sun.

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,070
Let's start with a small station,

26
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,060
one that's able to provide
the energy needed for this
whole construction project.

27
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,330
We'd begin on Mercury.
It would become our space,

28
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:01,200
mine for the iron and oxygen
would need from those elements.

29
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,690
We'd make highly reflective
solar collectors.

30
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,340
The giant mirrors would reflect
light into a small solar power plant.

31
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,460
From there, it would beam the
energy to where we need it.

32
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,510
We'd probably demolished mercury entirely
before we moved on to Venus Mars and

33
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:21,750
the outer planets,
even nearby asteroids would be decimated.

34
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,160
However,

35
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,330
even just deconstructing mercury would
supply us with enough energy to power up

36
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:30,300
our super computers and boost
interstellar exploration.

37
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,570
Maybe we'd even built earthlike oases,

38
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,530
large rotating space colonies in the
habitable zone of our solar system.

39
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,750
Maybe if we're lucky,

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,430
we'd find other more efficient sources
of energy to help us master space travel,

41
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,440
like artificially generated black holes.
But that's a story for another.

42
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,220
What if.
