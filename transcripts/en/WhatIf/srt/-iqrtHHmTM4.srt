1
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:10,040
What if all the earth's land became
ocean and all the oceans became land,

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,410
and what if our mountains turned into
deep trenches while trenches grew to the

3
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:20,090
highest peaks on the planet? Imagine
what this new world would look like.

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,700
Where on the sprawling land mass would
humanity live and why would this planet

5
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,440
have such a hard time sustaining life?
This is what if,

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,250
and here's what would happen if
Earth's typography was inverted.

7
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,690
Of course, with the volume of
water in the earth's oceans,

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,080
inverting our topography would mostly
look like we flooded the planet.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,670
Where's the fun in that?

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,110
Let's eliminate some of the world's
water so that the seven continents become

11
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:52,640
oceans and the seabed becomes
one big interconnected landmass.

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,440
It's fun to think about,

13
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:59,360
but what if I told you that a world like
this would have one major design flaw?

14
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,540
As far as we know,
the ocean floor is pretty boring.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,150
Topographically speaking by and large,

16
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:11,070
it's mostly a vast plain at an average
depth of 3,700 meters below sea level.

17
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,130
That means,
except for the Mariana mountain range.

18
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,020
Our upside down world would be a huge
plateau and that would be well above the

19
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:20,160
sea level.
We're used to.

20
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,480
The thing is the human body doesn't
handle high altitudes. Well,

21
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,340
most of us live about 840 meters
above sea level are inverted.

22
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:31,680
Continent would be more than
four times higher than that.

23
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,920
There would be less air
pressure and less air to,

24
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,610
we'd have to adapt to living in a low
oxygen environment if we want it to

25
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:41,910
survive, but that's just the
beginning of our problems.

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,570
An inverted earth would be
barely covered with water.

27
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,410
The Himalayan trench would turn out deep,
but the rest of the seabed would,

28
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,050
we'd be left with four shallow oceans
and one vast never ending continent.

29
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,560
On the bright side, you'd be able
to walk to any part of the world,

30
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,480
but with little oceans left,

31
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,650
you probably wouldn't want to go
too far inland anyway. Right now,

32
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,710
71% of earth's surface
is covered with water.

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,180
The surface of an inverted earth
would only be 29% submerged.

34
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,370
Oceans control our climate,

35
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,430
distributing the heat from the
sun evenly throughout the planet.

36
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,950
Less water surface would
mean less evaporation and
precipitation. As a result,

37
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,620
most of the land would
become a scorching desert,

38
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,230
too hot and waterless
for humans to survive.

39
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,390
You'd want to live close to the oceans,

40
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,120
away from the unbearable
temperatures of the hot land,

41
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,260
but you might not stay there too
long either. With so little water,

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,660
oceans wouldn't absorb
enough carbon dioxide.

43
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,020
Greenhouse gases would build
up and stay in the atmosphere.

44
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,760
Slowly cooking the planet. Life on
earth might resemble life. On Venus,

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,130
there'd be no fresh water left to drink.

46
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,420
All the plants would die and all the
animals would follow shortly after humans

47
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:58,710
could build a shelter to hide from the
unbearable heat. But food would be scarce.

48
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,740
It would be hard to figure out how
to preserve the exist in life in such

49
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:06,580
conditions, but could life have
emerged on an inverted earth?

50
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,130
Theoretically, yes, and it would have
transitioned from c to lamb much earlier.

51
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,950
There simply wouldn't be enough real
estate at the bottom of the ocean.

52
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,970
If that evolutionary cycle lab
all the way to homo sapiens,

53
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,370
human anatomy would be very different.

54
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,450
Maybe we would have evolved to be cold
blooded to be able to take on the high

55
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:29,590
temperatures of our inverted planet,
but that's a story for another.

56
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,700
What if.
