1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,800
What if the sun disappeared right now?

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,700
Would you be able to handle eternal
darkness, cold temperatures?

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,740
How about flying off into space?

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,650
The son is the only star in our solar
system and it gives life to everything

5
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:22,800
here on earth.
Would we even be alive if it vanished?

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,420
This is what if, and here's what
would happen if the sun disappeared.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,170
The truth is we wouldn't even notice
for the first eight and a half minutes.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,320
This is how long it takes
sunlight to travel to our planet.

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,630
So even if the sun disappeared,

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,740
it's last ray of light would take
510 seconds to reach your skin.

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,210
And what about gravity?

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,840
The Sun is the dominant gravitational
force in our solar system.

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,800
It has all eight planets moving around it.
So if the sun disappeared,

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,850
would we fly off into space?
Yes, but not right away.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,390
The force of gravity turns
out to have speed to it.

16
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,010
His theory of general relativity,

17
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,630
Einstein proved that gravity is just as
fast as light and not instantaneous as

18
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:04,770
was previously thought.

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,030
This means the earth would still be
orbiting a recently vanished star with no

20
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:12,810
clue of the upcoming darkness,
but just for eight and a half minutes.

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,150
When the last of the sun's
rays reached the earth.

22
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,130
Eternal night wouldn't
be our only problem.

23
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,920
The very same moment the sun
disappeared from the sky.

24
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,000
Earth would start traveling into
space at 18 miles per second.

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,840
Assuming the earth didn't collide with
any other planets or asteroids or get

26
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:29,010
sucked into a black hole,

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,810
it would be moving in a straight line
for 43,000 years before it found another

28
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:37,620
start orbit, but you wouldn't have to
worry about that within two seconds.

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,800
The moon would go dark since there
would be no sunlight to reflect,

30
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,150
but the stars would still shine and
your electricity would still work unless

31
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:47,280
it's powered by solar panels.
However,

32
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,610
gravity and illumination aren't the
only things we rely on the sun for.

33
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,250
Plants need the sun for photosynthesis.

34
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,690
Turning light into energy is how
plants stay alive. Without sunlight,

35
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,240
most small plants would
be dead within days.

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,320
Larger ones like trees would survive
for several decades due to their slow

37
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:07,680
metabolism. This would knock out
the bottom tier of the food chain.

38
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,080
Most animals would die off slowly.

39
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,280
Only scavengers feeding on the dead
would remain until they froze to death

40
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,780
because within a week,

41
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,980
the average temperature on earth would
drop to a own chilling 32 degrees

42
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:22,260
Fahrenheit,
and by the end of the first year,

43
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,090
minus 150 degrees would be the new
norm and it would keep dropping until

44
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:30,300
stabilizing at minus
400 degrees Fahrenheit.

45
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,870
The oceans would grow colder too,
but just on the surface,

46
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,820
thanks to geo thermal vents,

47
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,450
they would remain liquid
underneath despite being
buried under a thick layer of

48
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:43,530
ice. So if you're lucky enough to survive,
consider moving to the ocean floor.

49
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,580
In the end,

50
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,970
the organisms living around those geo
thermal vents would be the only living

51
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:49,770
beings not to notice any difference.

52
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,850
They don't need the sun to live and
could continue to thrive for billions of

53
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,360
years until the planet became a frozen
chunk of rock drifting and space.
