1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,050
You've heard all the scary
rumors surrounding vaccines.

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,920
They cause autism.
They contain toxins,

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,640
even that they can give you the
disease that they're trying to prevent.

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,590
It's misinformation like this that has
caused American vaccination rates to drop

5
00:00:21,591 --> 00:00:24,200
significantly over the
past couple of decades.

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,430
Some people believe their children
would be better off in a world without

7
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:32,600
vaccines. What do they fully grasp?
What that world would look like?

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,680
What kind of diseases would be
welcomed back into our lives?

9
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,040
This is what if,

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,700
and here's what would happen
if we stopped vaccinations.

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,030
Through the years,

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,960
vaccines have been successful in reducing
the spread of deadly diseases like

13
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:53,640
measles, diptheria and rubella
to the point where they've
nearly disappeared from

14
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:57,180
America.
When people stop seeing these diseases,

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,710
some start to wonder why we're still
vaccinating against them. Well,

16
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,430
if you want to see how a so called
controlled disease can make a comeback,

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,560
just ask the people of Japan.
Let me paint a picture for you.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,920
It's 1974 in Japan and 80% of people
were getting the whooping cough vaccine

19
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,660
with only 393 cases of whooping cough
and zero related deaths throughout the

20
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:25,620
whole country. That year, the Japanese
started to let their guard down.

21
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,450
By 1979 only 10% of children
were being vaccinated.

22
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,020
The result was a whopping 13,000 cases
that year and 41 related deaths shocked

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,880
by the whole ordeal.

24
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,590
The Japanese quickly turned
back to routine vaccination
and the disease numbers

25
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:44,790
dropped.
Once again.

26
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,160
People usually see the decision not to
vaccinate as a very personal individual

27
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:53,610
matter thinking they shouldn't have the
right to be able to control what goes

28
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:56,670
into their child's
body. Sure, we get that,

29
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,570
but what a lot of people don't understand
is that if everyone made the same

30
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,860
individual decision,

31
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,810
it would have catastrophic effects and
eventually spell far more danger for your

32
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:11,400
child. The fewer people who get
vaccinated, the more opportunities, uh,

33
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:15,150
disease has to spread.
When you decide not to get vaccinated,

34
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,780
you're not only accepting the possibility
of contracting a disease yourself,

35
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,390
but also the chance of
spreading it to others.

36
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,180
Around you and playing
a part in an epidemic.

37
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,470
There are hundreds of thousands of
people who can't get vaccinated due to

38
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:32,640
treatments for cancer or other conditions
and their safety relies on the rest of

39
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:33,780
us being vaccinated.

40
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,950
The next time someone tries to convince
you that vaccines are too dangerous,

41
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,850
just let them consider what our world
would look like. Without vaccines,

42
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,280
we'd be transported back to a world we
thought we had overcome where life for

43
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:51,720
children was especially brutal in America.
Every year,

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,700
48,000 people would be hospitalized
with measles and 500 would die.

45
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,410
The chicken box would cause 10,000
children to be hospitalized and between 70

46
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:07,411
and 100 would die and hepatitis A and
B would reemerge as silent epidemic

47
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,420
affecting millions of people.

48
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,130
These are just a handful of
the old diseases that would
come back to wreak havoc

49
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,150
if we all stopped vaccinations.
So why stop?

50
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,560
There hasn't been a single credible
study linking vaccines to longterm health

51
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:25,420
conditions.
In fact,

52
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,580
the paper that started the theory that
vaccines cause autism was so discredited

53
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,430
that the author

54
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,870
lost his medical license.

55
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,670
Maybe one day we'll be able to
eradicate all diseases from our planet,

56
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,930
but with new challenges just
come to take their place. Well,

57
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:44,870
that's a topic for another.
