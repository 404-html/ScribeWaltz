00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,740
Over the past century,

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,480
astronomers have speculated about the
existence of a mysterious ninth planet

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,180
lurking and the outer
reaches of our solar system.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,170
Although we've never directly
observed the elusive planet x,

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,220
researchers keep finding more strange
phenomena that seemed to support its

6
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:25,370
existence.
If this giant planet exists,

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,350
what does it look like and how could it
change our understanding of space itself?

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,540
This is what if, and here's what
would happen if planet x was real.

9
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,230
Scientists believe that planet x also
referred to as planet nine is about 17

10
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:45,200
times bigger than earth
and made entirely of gas.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,380
You'd think it would be easy
to spot something so big,

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,090
but it orbits the Sun about 10 to
20 times farther away than Pluto.

13
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,320
Finding this planet would teach us
more about how solar systems evolve,

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,050
but could it also bring
about the end of days?

15
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:03,800
[inaudible]

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,580
so far,

17
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,630
our hunt for planet x has been mostly
based around the idea of if there's smoke,

18
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:10,490
there's fire,
and in this case,

19
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,210
the smoke is a bunch of weird
things going on amongst the stars.

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,600
In 1972 astronomers noticed
some irregularities in the
course of Halley's comet

21
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,350
detours that they figured were caused
by the gravitational pull of an unseen

22
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,280
distant planet.

23
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,940
Fast forward 10 years to
1982 when scientists were
once again forced to consider

24
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:32,810
the existence of a hidden planet,

25
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,460
they hypothesized that an unknown outer
planet could be orbiting within our

26
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:42,260
solar system and causing the orbits of
Uranus and Neptune to deviate from the

27
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:43,310
laws of physics.

28
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,820
But the most concrete evidence came
in 2014 when astronomers noticed some

29
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:53,330
distant dwarf planets and IC objects that
all seem to follow orbits that cluster

30
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:55,610
together.
Upon closer inspection,

31
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,230
they estimated that the powerful
gravitational pull of a hidden planet,

32
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,580
it must've been the cause
of these unusual orbits.

33
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,870
So with all these signs pointing to
the existence and location of planet x,

34
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,730
why haven't we been able to
see it yet? Well, it's really,

35
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:14,350
really far away and out in space.
Things get dark pretty fast,

36
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,020
okay?

37
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,460
The intensity of the Sun's light weakened
by a factor of four going out and then

38
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:24,030
four times. Again, reflecting
back to put that in perspective,

39
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,650
a planet that's twice as far away as
our moon would be 16 times fainter.

40
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,113
On top of that,

41
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,200
the planet could be lost in the light
pollution of the Milky Way or the glare of

42
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:37,050
a bright star,
but with modern technology,

43
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,220
astronomers believe we'll be able
to find planet x in 10 to 15 years.

44
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,630
Deleting team in California uses one
of the most powerful telescopes in the

45
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:49,920
world and has released a map of where to
look to increase the chances of finding

46
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:53,730
it through crowdsourced
astronomy. If planted x, Israel,

47
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,350
it would redefine our knowledge of our
solar system's evolution and give us key

48
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:01,810
insights into how other solar systems
are formed throughout the universe.

49
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,580
Okay.

50
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,910
For as long as serious scientists
have been looking at planet x,

51
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,090
there have been others who have
proclaimed that it's strange orbit will

52
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:11,620
eventually collide with Earth,

53
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,820
but this has been rejected as nothing
more than pseudoscience and an internet

54
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,654
hoax.

55
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,260
Scientists say that planet x would be
kept well beyond Neptune throughout its

56
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:25,090
orbit, even when it's closest to the
sun. So even though we can't see it,

57
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,550
it doesn't mean our
ninth planet isn't there.

58
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,770
Maybe one day we'll develop technology
that can identify worlds even further up

59
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:37,090
than planet x, but that's a
topic for another. What if.
