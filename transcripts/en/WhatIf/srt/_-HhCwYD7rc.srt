1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:05,780
What if the flappers were
writing in fact flat?

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,860
How would gravity,
Burke,

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,620
would we still have times
change of seasons with the
conditions for life here on

4
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:18,220
earth exists at all? This is
what if, and here's what the

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,200
look like if it was flat,
first of all,

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,090
forget about walking to its edge.
Gravity with simply not let you wait.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,200
He drive it even be possible on a flat
earth. The answer is yes, of course.

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,280
The force of gravity is what keeps our
plant or any other planet together.

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,860
It's what forms a planet
in the first place.

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,230
In the case of a pancake shaped earth,

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,340
the force of gravity would pull you to
the center and will become stronger as he

12
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:47,880
tried to walk away from it.
Pulling the top of your body backwards.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,250
It would feel as if you
were climbing a hill.

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,850
A Hilda was getting steeper
and steeper and steeper.

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,690
By the time you reach the edge down and
behind you would be the same direction.

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,793
Sound Weird?

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,450
How about water being sucked into the
center of the earth or diagonal trees

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,560
growing in the opposite
direction of gravity's pulling
and then there's the sun.

19
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,800
How would a flat earth behave in space?

20
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,820
One flat earth theory is that the
sun revolves around the earth,

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,900
not the other way around.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,820
What if the sun orbited the earth
just like the moon does? In that case,

23
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,120
you'd never suffered jet lag because
there'd be no such thing as time zones.

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,970
The Sun would light up both the
top and the bottom of the planet.

25
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,330
This would mean constant light,
no day and night cycle.

26
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,960
Also no seasons or solar eclipses.

27
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,510
The Sun itself would
have to be much smaller,

28
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,850
otherwise it would burn
the earth to a crisp.

29
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,770
It would probably fry the planet anyway
as there would be no geomagnetic field

30
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,570
to protect earth from its radiation.

31
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,550
The geomagnetic field is generated in
the solid core of the earth and keeps our

32
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:56,280
atmosphere from escaping.
Without it,

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,290
cosmic rays would bombard our bodies
causing everything from cancer to DNA

34
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:02,124
damage.

35
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,110
The oceans would escape into space and
so with the air and all our oxygen,

36
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,580
but let's assume that a flat earth had
an alternative to our magnetic field.

37
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,780
This way you'd still be alive to notice
some of the strange flat earth affects

38
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,950
like your shadow.
Say you had a friend just as tall as you,

39
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,180
but they lived a thousand miles
away. On a sunny day, your shadow is,

40
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:28,230
would be the very same length because
unlike here on a spherical earth,

41
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,700
the sun's rays would hit both of you at
the same angle and if you were to meet

42
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:34,830
up,
traveling would turn out very different.

43
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,090
Let's take a map introduced by
the flat Earth Society. Yeah,

44
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,650
the one that shows the Arctic
at the center and Antarctica
as an ice wall around

45
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:45,390
the edges in this world,

46
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,780
it would take you 32 hours to
fly from Australia to Argentina.

47
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,730
Did we mentioned there'd be
no gps satellites wouldn't
be able to orbit a flat

48
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:57,870
earth leaving humanity with no
navigation and no synchronized time.

49
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,180
This means no a tms,
no credit cards,

50
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,320
no high speed stock market transactions
on the bright side with a good pair of

51
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:09,340
binoculars. You could see Dubai Burj
Khalifa from any part of the flat world,

52
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,290
but let's be honest,

53
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,530
you don't need to build your own rocket
to see that the earth is not flat.

54
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,050
The evidence is all around us.
