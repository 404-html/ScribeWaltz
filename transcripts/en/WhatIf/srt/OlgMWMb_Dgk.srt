1
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,950
What if one day you turn on the news
channel to see this volcanic eruption

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,330
already caused 2 million casualties.
Airports are closed.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,030
If all the volcanoes on
earth erupted at once.

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,140
What our planet survive all the Ash
Multan, Lafa and scorching gasses.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,320
How far up into the
atmosphere with the ash go?

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,840
Would there be anyone left to
report the news? This is what if,

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,920
and here's what would happen if all
the earth's volcanoes erupted at once.

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,150
Not all volcanoes would pose a danger,
extinct volcanoes.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,230
Those that have interrupted in the last
10,000 years just don't have any magma

10
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:46,350
left to her up again.
However, at any given time,

11
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,820
there are 10 to 20 volcanoes erupting
somewhere on earth. In total,

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,920
there are 1500 active volcanoes on land
and an unknown number of them underwater.

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,200
What if all of them are updated at once?

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,780
What would this apocalypse
look like exactly?

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,100
If all active volcanoes on
earth went off at the same time,

16
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,050
there would be a lot of explosions.

17
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,770
Explosive eruptions would
churn out walls of rocks,

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,530
ash and gas wiping out the nearby areas.

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,270
You wouldn't be able to outdrive that
giant hot cloud rocks is hot as 1000

20
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:21,540
degrees would be traveling faster
than 700 kilometers an hour,

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,090
but not all volcanoes would are up
that powerfully instead of violently

22
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:31,140
expelling magma. Some volcanoes would
steadily ejected onto the ground.

23
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,280
That's called an effusive eruption.
If your local volcano erupted that way,

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,490
consider yourself lucky,
but not for too long.

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,990
Other eruptions would be sending
plumes of ash up into the air.

26
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,740
These would travel for
thousands of kilometers and
cover the earth with a thick

27
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:47,730
blanket of ash.

28
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,410
Ashy clouds would block the sunlight
plunging the whole planet in the complete

29
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:56,280
darkness. Without sunlight, there's
no chance of photosynthesis.

30
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,600
All the plants would die, including all
the crops that feed us and the animals

31
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,220
because volcanic ash is
actually tiny rock particles.

32
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,550
It would be very heavy if enough
ash where to fall on your roof,

33
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,630
your home would collapse and you're
not escaping this in an airplane.

34
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,200
The hot clouds of ash would
melt car and plane engines,

35
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,530
I'll flights would be cancelled
anyway because of the low visibility.

36
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,420
Deep Ocean volcanoes make the water
acidic in this kind of environment. See,

37
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,090
life would suffer huge losses.

38
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,750
The entire food chain would be devastated
because no sun rays would reach the

39
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:33,774
earth surface.

40
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,590
The planet would significantly cooled
down to the point where we might end up in

41
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,530
a new ice age. In the longterm, though,

42
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,850
the global temperatures would change
again this time getting much hotter with

43
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:47,310
all the carbon dioxide
released during the eruptions,

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,060
we'd see a tremendous greenhouse effect
that would start roasting the planet.

45
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,250
Now, if you survived the
volcanic explosions and didn't
die from breathing in the

46
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:57,030
ash,

47
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,850
the safest place for you and might be on
a ship in the middle of the ocean or in

48
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:03,430
an underground bunker,
just make sure you have enough food,

49
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:05,470
supplies and warm clothes
to keep you alive.

50
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,620
In this post apocalyptic
world before coming out,

51
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,280
you'll need to wait until the atmosphere
clears up. That's going to take a very,

52
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,870
very long time and you wouldn't be
seeing the earth you once knew prolonged

53
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:17,830
volcanic eruptions,

54
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:21,220
spewing from the planets mental would
dump this partly molten layer on the

55
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:25,870
surface, causing a mass imbalance. As
a result, our planet might tip over,

56
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,540
just like Mars did about three
and a half billion years ago.

57
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,680
Paris might end up on the North
Pole. Of course, as always,

58
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,620
such a scenario was very
unlikely to happen. At least.

59
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,430
There's no evidence of all volcanoes
erupting at once in the 4 billion year

60
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:42,700
history of earth. But is it better
to be prepared for everything.
