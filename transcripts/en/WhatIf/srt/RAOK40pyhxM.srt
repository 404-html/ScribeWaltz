1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,220
Every day you move

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:12,300
about 37 trillion cells are working
hard inside your body to keep you going.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,000
These cells are constantly replicating,

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,500
living and dying as directed
by your deoxyribonucleic acid,

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,860
your DNA.
What if one day you suddenly lost it?

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,210
Would you feel anything at all?
How long could you stay alive?

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,190
This is what if,

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,050
and here's what would happen if your
DNA suddenly disappeared for a start,

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,250
you'd lose weight just a third
of a pound or about 150 grams,

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,500
not the best weight loss strategy.

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,040
DNA isn't just a series of
perfectly structured molecules.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,540
It's your body's library.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,280
It stores your genetic information and
tells yourselves how to grow and function.

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,300
The moment your DNA vanish from your body,
you likely wouldn't notice a thing,

15
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,830
not until your body started dying cell
by cell and you became a walking ghost.

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,960
How long do you think you would last for?

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,500
Think of radiation poisoning?
Gamma radiation destroys your DNA,

18
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,300
but you don't die from it immediately.

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,680
Your body still works or your
immune system slowly collapses.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,590
The same thing would happen to you if
all your DNA disappeared to keep you

21
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:20,280
alive.

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,280
Your body cells constantly replicate
themselves by dividing nearly 2 trillion

23
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:30,330
cells divide every day.
Some of them like your bone marrow cells,

24
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:34,140
which are responsible for producing
blood divide more often than others.

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,070
They all need instruction from
your DNA to function properly.

26
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,320
Without those instructions, they just
stopped working on the bright side.

27
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,740
No one would be able to steal your genetic
information to violate your privacy.

28
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,600
What? After 24 hours without a 100
billion new cells producing blood,

29
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,680
your immune system would collapse.
At this point,

30
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,190
even an ordinary infection could kill you.
After five days,

31
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,240
all of the cells lining your stomach
would die out to your body would be unable

32
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:08,560
to digest food. You'd suffer
from gastrointestinal disease,

33
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:12,310
resulting in nausea, heartburn,
bloating, and constipation

34
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,120
and say goodbye to your hair.

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,610
Since your hair follicle cells would
stop reproducing. In a normal state,

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,390
you lose about 40,000 dead skin cells
per hour without being able to generate

37
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:27,630
new cells. You could scratch your
skin right off within a week.

38
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,190
Luckily for you, you wouldn't last long
enough to experience those horrors.

39
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,260
Rapid infection or system wide organ
failure would kill you within days,

40
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,580
possibly even hours. You Die,
writhing and abdominal pain,

41
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,930
dizziness and nausea.

42
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,280
The good thing is no one has
ever lost all their DNA yet.

43
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:55,740
Okay.
