1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,110
You are one of 7.6 billion people on
this earth, but what does that mean?

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,370
How can those 10 digits properly
reflect the size of our species?

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,030
Can we truly grasp our impact on this
planet currently to better understand our

4
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:21,060
presence on earth?

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,200
We consider a variety of statistics like
how many cars are on the road at once

6
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:29,820
or how many emails are sent per day of
maybe it would tell us more to take all

7
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,970
that away.
This is what if,

8
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,080
and here's what would happen if all humans
suddenly disappeared from the earth.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,200
The second humans disappear from
Earth. Chaos ensues. Planes, trains,

10
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:47,880
and automobiles without drivers would
collide, derail and tumble out of the sky.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,800
Within the first hour, massive blackouts
would start to occur across the globe.

12
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,120
Electricity generated from coal plants
would fail once their fuel rat out,

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,930
while wind and water powered systems
would also shut down without human

14
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:03,900
supervision.
The next day,

15
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,680
computers would act on their own
accord to shut down nuclear reactors.

16
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,670
In order to prevent disaster. The world
would be completely without power,

17
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,390
but nuclear crises would at
least be temporarily averted.

18
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,483
On Day three.

19
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,540
London's Big Ben Rings for the last time
since it needs to be wound every three

20
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:26,220
days. Big Ben would sound over streets
now populated with roaming animals.

21
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,970
Thousands of pets and zoo creatures
would have to break free or suffer

22
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:32,430
starvation within 10 days.

23
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,580
Security measures in nuclear
power plants would finally fail.

24
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,080
Setting off a chain of
explosions and releasing toxic
radiation across the globe.

25
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,890
Wildlife in affected regions would die,
but elsewhere.

26
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,300
Other species would prevail.

27
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,800
Domesticated cattle and livestock would
take to the North American great plains

28
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:51,090
where they could graze freely.

29
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,710
Supermarkets would be infested with
mice and rats and former pets would turn

30
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:59,850
feral in their bid for survival.
Within a few years,

31
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,140
the city's we so easily recognized today
would look like converted natural theme

32
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:04,974
parks.

33
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,060
Nuclear radiation would have cleared and
vegetation with sprout across the urban

34
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:09,894
sprawl.

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,400
Moss would overtake the streets while
trees and flowers would travel up at along

36
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:17,310
abandoned towers.
After 30 years,

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,000
the satellites we set up to explore would
fall back down to earth with no one to

38
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:23,580
collect their data.
Homes and skyscrapers,

39
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:26,670
we'll have rotted or collapsed
in some coastal areas.

40
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,420
Entire cities will have been
reclaimed by the sea and old ships.

41
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,140
Sunk or ran aground would be the
foundation of new coral reefs.

42
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,120
Despite our absence,

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,270
global warming would continue for
another 40 years after we're gone.

44
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,960
The Earth's temperature would
rise about another 0.6 degrees,

45
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,560
but the environment would nonetheless
be improving drastically by your 64 real

46
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,110
life would have nearly recovered from
decades of over fishing and will be

47
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:54,840
thriving in 150 years.

48
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,680
Urban environments would be restored to
their natural status. Before human time,

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,190
London would revert to swamp land and
in northern cities like Vancouver,

50
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,540
skeletons of buildings would poke out
from layer upon layer of snow and ice.

51
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,520
Las Vegas might look like a
giant sand castle in 230 years.

52
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,780
Vegetation that has thrived and humans
absence will have eliminated excess

53
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,370
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

54
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,970
Huge forest will have reclaimed
the eastern half of North America,

55
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,260
and the only evidence we ever existed,
it would be leftover steel and plastics.

56
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,130
Once glorious landmarks would
slowly succumb to decay.

57
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,820
500 years after humans disappeared,

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,930
the world's forests would
be the healthiest that
they've been in 10,000 years.

59
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,460
The natural world would have succeeded
in a racing most of the final traces of

60
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:46,510
human existence. Of course,
even after 25,000 years,

61
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,080
some of our plastic objects might still
be found along with everything we've

62
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,580
left on past trips to the moon.

63
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,350
So if you've ever wondered what it means
to be one of the 7.6 billion people on

64
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:57,970
this earth than think of it this way,

65
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,590
it would take more than 25,000 years to
hide the fact that we were ever here.

66
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,890
Our domination of the land
is huge and incredible.

67
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,560
And while humans might not
disappear into thin air,

68
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,330
we shouldn't take our planet for granted.

69
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,630
How will you help to make
our world a better place?
