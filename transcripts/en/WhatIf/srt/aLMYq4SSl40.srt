1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,120
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,780
deep beneath the earth's surface.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,920
There's a scorching ball
of iron surrounded by an
ocean of boiling hot liquid

4
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:12,660
metal,
the earth's core.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,800
It's as toasty as the surface of the
sun with enough heat to brew more than a

6
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:18,660
trillion cups of coffee per hour.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,320
That's over a hundred coffees for
every single person on the planet.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,800
What if the sizzling cores
suddenly cooled down?

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,210
Could our planet still function with
a frozen core or would we just become

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,590
another lifeless rock orbiting the sun?
This is what if,

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,830
and here's what would happen if
the earth's core cooled down.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,690
Ever since it was formed, the inner
core of the earth has been losing heat,

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,070
but it's still blazing hot
around 6,000 degrees. Of course,

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,260
no one has ever been to
the center of the earth.

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,220
The unbearable heat is one of the reasons
you don't want to get any closer to it.

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,200
If only a cool down a bit,

17
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,830
maybe we could go and see what's inside
our planet and if all our guests is

18
00:00:58,831 --> 00:00:59,970
about the earth,
we're right.

19
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,750
There are many things on
earth to make life possible.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,040
Our geomagnetic field is one of them.
It protects us from all kinds of space.

21
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:12,150
Radiation, including highly
charged particles, constantly
blasting from the sun.

22
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,160
The magnetic field acts as a shield and
to flex them around our planet. That way,

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,530
no solar winds can strip
away our atmosphere,

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,370
which is also an essential element for
life here on earth. And guess what?

25
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,430
This magnetic field is
generated by the earth's core.

26
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,880
As the planet spins the
two parts of the core,

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,050
the inner solid core and the outer
liquid one move at different speeds

28
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,550
generating electric currents. Those
currents generate our geomagnetic field.

29
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,270
If the earth's core cooled down,
it wouldn't produce any currents.

30
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,390
The Earth would lose its
magnetic field if that happens,

31
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,860
be ready for all kinds of bad things
because no magnetic field means no

32
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:53,010
atmosphere and no atmosphere.
Well in short,

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,680
the earth would start looking
a little more like Mars.

34
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,970
No breathing exercise could calm you
down since you wouldn't even be able to

35
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:02,280
breathe without a pressure
suit and an oxygen mask.

36
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,540
Since the frozen core wouldn't
heat up rocks, water, gas,

37
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,430
and other geological material anymore,

38
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,240
the earth itself would be getting
colder and colder. On the other hand,

39
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,400
volcanoes would no longer be spewing lava.

40
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,730
Continence would stop drifting away
from each other and earthquakes would

41
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:21,690
completely disappear. Nobody could
survive on that earth for too long,

42
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:25,350
but it would be a good simulation
of life on Mars. Who knows?

43
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,360
Maybe we'd have enough
time to pack up our stuff,

44
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,320
jump on a space ship and get off of this
planet before it became absolutely dead.

45
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,300
But if someone very curious,

46
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:36,420
decided to stay on earth and to
finally drill a hole into the core,

47
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,990
try to convince them not to the
core may have lost all a team,

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,220
but the pressure there and would still
be 3.5 million times higher than it is on

49
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:45,054
earth surface.

50
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,450
Anyone bold enough to go down there
would be squeezed into the core.

51
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,890
Becoming one with the earth literally
looks like the plan is core would be

52
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:56,730
better off if it remained as blisteringly
hot as it is and maybe drilling

53
00:02:56,731 --> 00:03:00,690
through the earth isn't the best idea
either. But that's a question for another.

54
00:03:00,691 --> 00:03:01,350
What if.
