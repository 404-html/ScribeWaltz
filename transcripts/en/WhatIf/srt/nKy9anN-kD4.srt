1
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,330
See that bright object in
the sky that's Andromeda.

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,620
The closest major galaxy to our Milky Way
and the most distant thing you can see

3
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:18,510
with the naked eye and it's racing towards
us at the rate of 110 kilometers per

4
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:19,344
second.

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,420
Eventually 4 billion years from now and
drama will merge with our Milky Way in a

6
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:25,770
huge galactic collision.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,790
But what if these galaxies
where to collide tomorrow?

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,880
What all the stars and planets
suddenly plow into each other?

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,410
Could our solar system survive this
massive crash and what would this galactic

10
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:40,920
light show looked like from earth?
This is what if,

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,790
and here's what would happen if the Milky
Way and the Andromeda galaxy collided.

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,680
There are at least 100 billion
galaxies in the observable universe,

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,720
all colliding with each
other. Larger galaxies merge
about every 9 billion years,

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,680
while smaller ones slam into
each other even more often. Wait,

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,910
what about dark energy?

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,440
Isn't this hypothesized force pulling
the universe and everything in it apart?

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,560
It's your is for nearby galaxies though.

18
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,370
Gravity takes over and drama and
the Milky Way are no exception.

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,930
They both contain central supermassive
black holes that will eventually mesh the

20
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:17,220
two star systems together.

21
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,340
Imagine if that gigantic
collision were to happen tomorrow.

22
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,570
What would that look like?
And drama is pretty far away.

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,560
It couldn't just overcome a distance of
two and a half million light years in a

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,160
single day.

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,090
Let's assume that somehow the supermassive
black hole in the center of the Milky

26
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:37,260
Way increased its gravitational pull
on Andromeda's black hole and the big

27
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:41,640
crunch happened 4 billion years
earlier than expected. What's next?

28
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,360
First, there would be no
milky way and no Andromeda.

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,590
The two spiral galaxies would become
a totally different type of galaxy and

30
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:54,130
elliptical one you can call the
new galaxy Macomeda or milk dramas,

31
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,470
whichever one you prefer. Once Andromeda
invaded milky waste personal space,

32
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,310
the sun and our entire solar system
would be forced to the outskirts of the

33
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:06,240
newly formed Galaxy 26,000
light years further away,

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,720
and that's the best case
scenario. In the worst case, one,

35
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,940
we might end up in a galactic Siberia,

36
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,170
160,000 light years away
from Macomeda Center.

37
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,300
What about all the stars in both galaxies?
Would they collide with each other?

38
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,613
Some of them would,

39
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,900
but even though milkyway counts around
250 billion stars and Andromeda drama has

40
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:28,980
over a trillion of them.

41
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,340
All the stars are separated
by light years of empty space.

42
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,550
It's unlikely that many of
them would merge. Instead,

43
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,870
they'd just get scattered into different
orbits. Ooh, I forgot to mention.

44
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,910
We invited a third galaxy to this party,

45
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,220
the triangular galaxy or m 33 a
smaller satellite galaxy of Andromeda.

46
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,350
This is shaping up to be a massive
galactic Mashup for us earthlings.

47
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,440
This would look just incredible.
The bright core,

48
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,370
the new super galaxy with
set the night sky, a blaze.

49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,130
Eventually the two supermassive black
holes at the center of these galaxies

50
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,810
would come so close to each other that
they themselves would merge all the gas

51
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:11,920
taken up by this monstrous black hall
would form a Bright Quasar at the center

52
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:15,970
of the galaxy. Another spectacular
show for us here on earth.

53
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,350
Too bad in reality, our planet won't
live long enough to see any of it.

54
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,020
By the time Andromeda
slams into the Milky Way,

55
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,130
the sun would have already turned into
a red giant and swollen it up the entire

56
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:30,370
earth. But that's a story
for another. What if.
