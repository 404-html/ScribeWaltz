1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,100
What if all the oceans disappeared
from the Earth surface?

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,790
What would a world with
no high seas look like?

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,180
What would happen to all the
creatures that live underwater?

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,140
Could humanity survive on the planet
if there were no options left?

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,510
This is what if,

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,500
and here's what would happen if
all the earth's oceans and factory

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,890
in the early years of our planet,
the earth was flat,

8
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,540
but not in a way you might think the
earth just didn't have any mountains and

9
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:40,890
was mostly covered with water.
Then about a billion years ago,

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,970
land emerged from under the seat
and change the planet's atmosphere.

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,190
This led to the debut of the first
life forms here on earth. Eventually,

12
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,310
the planet will heat up and
all the oceans will vanish.

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,460
This isn't scheduled to happen
for another billion years,

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,930
but how bad would it be if all
the oceans evaporated? Right now

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,570
today, oceans cover about
70% of the earth's surface.

16
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,500
If you put all that water into
Olympic sized swimming pools,

17
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,390
you'd need over 500 trillion of them.
With all the oceans gone,

18
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,220
we'd still have some water available.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,120
Oceans account for 97% of
all the water on the planet.

20
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,070
The remaining 3% is held in
rivers, lakes, underground water,

21
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,270
even the ice caps,

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,650
but that wouldn't be enough to
make up for the loss of the oceans.

23
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,730
The world's oceans act as a
global climate control system.

24
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,860
They absorb most of the sun's heat and
distributed evenly around the planet so

25
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:44,260
that no one area it gets
too hot or too cold.

26
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,750
They also sustain the water
cycle evaporating into
clouds and then reigning back

27
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:50,584
to Earth,

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,030
but you won't need to keep your
umbrella at hand expecting a big storm.

29
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,060
Once all the oceans
evaporated in our scenario,

30
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,120
the earth wouldn't be able to keep
all that vapor in the atmosphere.

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,640
Oceans would leave our planet for good,
turning it into a vast scorching desert.

32
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,143
Okay.

33
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,840
Sea creatures would be the obvious first
casualties in these conditions then

34
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,210
with no oceans to absorb
the heat from the sun,

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,690
the earth would slowly roast
until it turned into Venus.

36
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,210
How long would we have until our
planet became uninhabitable? Well,

37
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,630
whatever water was left would
evaporate in a matter of days,

38
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,060
leaving humanity to die from dehydration.

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,260
Most animals would go extinct
without water. Who knows?

40
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,150
Maybe camels would become earth's
next civilization. After a few days,

41
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,440
plants would give up their attempts to
survive without water. After a few weeks,

42
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,240
the same would happen to our forests.

43
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,500
Eventually they'd catch fire and
would keep burning until there was no

44
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:54,580
vegetation left.
In about a year's time,

45
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,580
the earth would turn into
a burnt and lifeless rock,

46
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,800
and without it, probably wouldn't get
the chance to produce life ever again.

47
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,773
Maybe one day,

48
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,160
another life form might visit our solar
system and wonder what happened to our

49
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:13,300
once glorious planet,
but that's a story for another.

50
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,350
What if.
