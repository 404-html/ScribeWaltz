1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,103
Okay.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,200
What if we lost all our
coral reefs overnight?

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,530
Ocean diving would become less impressive,
that's for sure.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,590
But what about the marine
ecosystems they sustained?

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,770
How many sea animals
would face extinction?

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,680
Could the corals rebuild
themselves from scratch?

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,560
How would this massive die off
affect humanity? This is what if,

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,040
and here's what would happen if
all the coral reefs disappeared.

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,560
Corals are not rocks.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,710
They're huge colonies of a
distant relative of the jellyfish,

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,110
coral polyps and like all living things,
they die.

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,700
The warmer oceans get,
the faster coral reefs die out.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,440
It only takes a water temperature spike
of one degree above average to upset

14
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:49,980
corals and make them turn white.
This process is called bleaching.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,120
It makes corals more vulnerable to hot
temperatures and causes their death.

16
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,380
If the water doesn't cool down,

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,910
climate change has already killed half
of the great barrier reefs coral in just

18
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:00,840
the last two years.

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,820
It's only a matter of time until the
last coral vanishes from the oceans.

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,540
But what if an abrupt heat
wave destroyed all the reefs?

21
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:14,040
Overnight coral reefs take up just
1% of the world's marine environment.

22
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,500
So no big deal, right, wrong.

23
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,690
Just that 1% is enough to
sustain a quarter of all
marine animals in the ocean.

24
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,670
2 million species live in on
and around the reefs for them.

25
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,540
Corals have been providing food
and shelter for 50 million years.

26
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,760
The day the reefs disappeared, marine
biodiversity would suffer huge losses.

27
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,060
The ocean bottom would be taken
over in my forest of seaweed.

28
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,320
Maybe it's time to give jellyfish soup a
try since there would be plenty of them

29
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:46,740
in the ocean, but for many unique
species of fish in the ocean,

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,580
corals are their only safe habitat.
A lot of them would be lost for good.

31
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,040
Same goes for sea turtles. Since coral are
filter feeders, they cleaned the water.

32
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,390
Remaining species,

33
00:01:57,391 --> 00:02:00,570
including dolphins would be left
to survive in very murky waters.

34
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,290
They might soon disappear as well
since when the corals disappear,

35
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,250
there would be very little fish for
them to feed on. But what about us?

36
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:13,320
What humans on land be effected too?
Absolutely. Since reefs support fish,

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,420
they also support the fisheries feeding
and giving jobs to 500 million people in

38
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:22,800
tropical countries like Indonesia,
Malaysia. And the Philippines. Of course,

39
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,780
the local tourism industries you've crash.

40
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,980
No one wants to dive into a forest
of seaweed with no quarrels.

41
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:33,981
Less coastal countries would lose
$375 billion of annual income.

42
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,090
Coastlines would no longer be protected
from flooding and extreme storms.

43
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,160
Oral provides a natural break water and
a buffer against erosion. Without it,

44
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,720
water would push local
residents out of their homes.

45
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,440
As the ocean spread out,

46
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,710
the residents of these densely populated
islands would have nowhere to go.

47
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,340
The countries might vanish from
the planet together with the reefs.

48
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,133
Without seafood,

49
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,300
there would be increased pressure on
farms to make up for the shortfall in

50
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:04,720
protein.
This might turn into a global food crisis.

51
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,790
It's hard to predict what else.

52
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:10,300
The disruption to the food chain and
biodiversity of the oceans would lead to.

53
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,980
Sure enough,
it wouldn't be pretty.

54
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,240
The truth is this hypothetical
scenario is getting very real.

55
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,230
The corals of the Great Barrier Reef are
bleaching quickly and are unlikely to

56
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:23,650
recover. Can Humans help
their survival? Well,

57
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,250
we aren't able to regrow 500 year
old corals and just 15 years,

58
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,570
but we can at least try to pollute
our air and is less that way.

59
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,440
The coral reefs might be around to give
enjoyment life to future generations of

60
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:37,180
fish and humans.

61
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,380
The next time you're looking
for a place to go on vacation,

62
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,930
think about the impact you're making and
try to support local communities that

63
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:47,190
protect the oceans and
ecosystems they depend on.

64
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,150
And if you go diving or snorkeling,
don't stand on the corals.

65
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,240
Always marvel at their incredible
beauty from a distance.
