1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,680
It's no secret that humans are the most
dominant species without proof of life

2
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:12,040
anywhere else in the universe.

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,970
We can probably consider ourselves the
most dominant species in space too.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,900
But what if there were others just
like us millions of years ago?

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,500
How do we even know that we're the
first advanced civilization to call the

6
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:26,410
planet Earth Home?
And if there have been others,

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,940
what kind of traces of they left for us
to find this is what f and here's what

8
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:34,750
would happen if an advanced civilization
had already existed on earth.

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,430
We know that complex life has existed
on earth for about 400 million years,

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,590
but how can we look that far back?

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,220
Ancient Ruins and artifacts only
take us back a few thousand years.

12
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,350
Geologic records only about 2 million.

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,650
So if we can't rely on direct evidence,

14
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,580
then where else could we find traces
of a potentially extinct civilization?

15
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,780
And what can we learn to make
sure we avoid the same fate?

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,510
Okay,

17
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,670
here's some numbers to make
your brain hurt for a second.

18
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,120
The Universe is about
13.8 billion years old.

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,790
The earth is four and a
half billion years old,

20
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,740
and humans have only developed
our industrial civilization
in the last 300 years.

21
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,880
With all that in mind,

22
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,690
it seems like there was ample opportunity
for another advanced civilization to

23
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:24,380
emerge, flourish and Di all
before we even showed up,

24
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,730
but finding any proof of a past civilized
species seems like it could be harder

25
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:30,860
than even starting this
civilization itself.

26
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,570
Physical artifacts would be
the most concrete evidence
of past intelligent life,

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,990
but it's not very likely that
we'll ever find any. Over time,

28
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,080
even our tallest buildings will crumble
and our strongest materials will

29
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:45,770
disintegrate. Our city's cover less
than 1% of the earth's surface,

30
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:49,790
so any comparable cities from past
civilizations would be easy for

31
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:53,570
paleontologists to miss,
even if we knew where to look.

32
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,320
It's unlikely that these artifacts
would last any longer than a few million

33
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,330
years. Sure, there's always fossilization,

34
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:03,710
but it only provides a limited record
of the past due to variables like when

35
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:08,120
they lived and where an industrial
civilization that lasted 100,000 years,

36
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,200
that's over 300 times longer than us.
They might leave no fossil trace at all,

37
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,890
so maybe we're better off looking
for more indirect evidence.

38
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,940
The best way to find that would be to
look at what traces our own civilization

39
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:22,280
would leave behind if it
collapsed in its current state.

40
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,060
One place we're leaving a clear trail
is in the sediment to the bottom of our

41
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:26,900
bodies of water.

42
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,860
One look at this stuff and
you would immediately see
the wacky chemical balances

43
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,040
that would imply some sort of
outside influence. For instance,

44
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:38,000
the nitrogen fertilizers that we use to
grow food or running off into our bodies

45
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:41,450
of water and producing low oxygen
dead zones that would be visible and

46
00:02:41,451 --> 00:02:43,640
sedimentary layers.
On top of that,

47
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,560
we'll be leaving long lasting synthetic
molecules from radioactive fallout

48
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,880
steroids and all the plastic
we dump in the ocean. So yeah,

49
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,630
future species are going to have a
great impression of us in case we're not

50
00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:57,410
embarrassed enough.

51
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,120
Our technological advances are changing
the environment which is brought on

52
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:05,530
widespread extinctions that would be
visible at fossil records. Ironically,

53
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,340
perhaps the most promising marker of an
advanced civilization could be one of

54
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:13,420
the very things that brought on its
downfall. When we burn fossil fuels,

55
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,220
we are releasing carbon back into the air.

56
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,630
Fossil fuels ultimately derived
from decayed plants and animals,

57
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,630
which contain a variety of carbon
that has a different atomic mass.

58
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:26,710
Then most carbon in our atmosphere.
When this kind is released,

59
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,400
it changes the molecular makeup of the
atmosphere and leaves a clear signal to

60
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:32,950
future scientists.
In a 2018 study,

61
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,300
scientists hypothesize that civilizations
could even have fossil fuel driven

62
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:40,840
life cycles. When fossil fuel
use leads to climate change,

63
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,680
the oxygen levels decrease in the ocean
and help create a breeding ground for

64
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:47,020
new fuels like oil and coal.
In this way,

65
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,400
a civilization and its demise might sell
the seed for new civilizations in the

66
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:54,730
future. In our search for
intelligent neighbors from the past,

67
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,900
we may never actually find any evidence,
but we can learn a lot about ourselves.

68
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,160
Analyzing our own longterm ecological
footprint can have practical benefits.

69
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,970
It helps us recognize where we can do
better to achieve a balance with our

70
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:10,150
planet so that we don't become the
forgotten civilization of tomorrow.

71
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,810
While it doesn't seem likely that
intelligent life was here before us,

72
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:15,070
that doesn't mean there wasn't any.

73
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,280
For All we know they were so advanced
they were able to clean up their mess as

74
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:19,114
they went.

75
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,990
The only verifiable way to check if
someone was here before us might be to rev

76
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:27,130
up a time machine and go see for yourself,
but that's a story for another.

77
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:27,940
What if.
