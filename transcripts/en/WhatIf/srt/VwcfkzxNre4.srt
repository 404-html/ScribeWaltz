1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,900
Unlike earth,
which is orbiting the sun.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,110
There are billions of rogue
planets roaming the Milky Way,

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,450
not bound to any host star.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,810
One of them has been spotted on
the edge of our solar system.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,110
What if this interstellar
object swung through it?

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,010
How would this space invader
affect the orbits of the planets?

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,490
Could it possibly push earth
out of the habitable zone?

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,830
This is what if,

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,640
and here's what would happen if a
rogue planet entered our solar system.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,430
If a planet doesn't belong to any star
system, it's considered a rogue planet.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,030
This is an interstellar
planet with a catchy name,

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,040
just 20 light years away from us.

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,470
It's nearly 17,000 times the size of
earth and has a powerful magnetic field

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,100
that makes the planet glow
with incredible Aurora's what?

15
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:57,120
F This massive alien planet trespass
the borders of our solar system.

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,940
Would this mean the end
of life here on earth?

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,500
Once the interstellar planet
invaded our solar system,

18
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,360
things could go very wrong.

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,830
This rogue planet would likely be moving
at hundreds of kilometers per second.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,400
If we were unlucky enough to be on a
collision course with this massive alien

21
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:18,570
object, the earth would be completely
demolished, but don't worry.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,920
Our solar system is quite big and the
chances of the rogue planet bypassing us

23
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:26,400
without a fatal collision are pretty high.
Instead,

24
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,000
our interstellar guests would be busy
disturbing the orbits of all the planets

25
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:32,850
in the solar system.
That's because of rogue planet.

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,140
Nearly 13 times bigger than Jupiter
would have a huge gravitational impact

27
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,590
making other planets orbits,
including Earth's more elliptical,

28
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,830
and that's when the bad news
begins for life. Here on earth,

29
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,950
the earth is orbiting.
The Sun's relatively narrow,

30
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:50,880
habitable zone within the zone,
also known as the goldilocks zone.

31
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,360
It's not too cold, so our water
doesn't turn to ice and not too hot,

32
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,860
so it doesn't get vaporized,

33
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:00,990
and neither do we just perfect changed
the Earth's orbit and the conditions for

34
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:02,250
life won't be so great.

35
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,610
The road planet may not push
us out of the habitable zone,

36
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,510
but it would bring us much closer to
the sun for very short and exceptionally

37
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:10,410
hot summers.

38
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,390
Those extreme summers would be followed
by long and super cold winters.

39
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,070
Quick Summers would leave us less time
to grow crops by the end of our first

40
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:24,090
never ending winter. Humanity could
face food shortages, even extinction.

41
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,830
The earth might be thrown into the next
ice age. Instead of global warming,

42
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,630
we'd be worried about global cooling.

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,580
We'd rethink our energy sources and try
to pump out more greenhouse gases to

44
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:36,361
warm the planet up.

45
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:41,100
A little solar energy on the other hand
would be considered very inefficient in

46
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:41,934
the wintertime,

47
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,230
but could be used very effectively
during the short blaze of summer count on

48
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:49,440
things being much worse. If the earth
gets knocked out of the habitable zone.

49
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,010
At that point,
the earth would consider a bleak cooldown.

50
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,830
All our water would
freeze and so would we.

51
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,560
This would be the end
of most life on earth.

52
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,140
The only way we could survive would be
if we learn to live at the bottom of the

53
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:06,040
ocean next to deep sea thermal vents
that push out extremely hot water.

54
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,570
Maybe eventually we'd evolved
into a different life form
that would take control

55
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:14,830
over the frozen planet. Lucky
for us, the universe is enormous.

56
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,940
There's a lot of space between rogue
planets and other objects in our galaxy,

57
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,850
and that makes this
scenario very unlikely.

58
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,620
But what if something did cause us
to evolve into another species? Well,

59
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,230
that's a story for another.
What if.
