1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,430
What if one side of the earth always
faced aside while the other side was

2
00:00:09,431 --> 00:00:11,320
forever shrouded in darkness?

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:16,510
Just how hot would it be on the bright
side and how cold with the dark one get

4
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,030
what part of the planet would still be
able to sustain life and will this be the

5
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:26,110
eventual fate of the earth?
This is what if,

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,250
and here's what would happen if the
earth was tidally locked to the sun.

7
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,570
Ever wonder why we only
see one side of the moon.

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,040
That's because the moon is so close
to our planet that the side facing us

9
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,400
experiences a much stronger
gravitational pull to earth.

10
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,440
It takes the moon just as long to make
one rotation on its own axis as it does

11
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:52,150
to make a full orbit around the earth
that makes the moon tidally locked to our

12
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:55,990
planet. Imagine if the earth
became tidally locked to the sun.

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,000
How long would you have before the extreme
weather made the planet uninhabitable

14
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,640
as one of the earth sides started getting
all the sunlight while the other side

15
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:08,320
was thrown into a never ending night?

16
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,750
Everything on the planet would change from
weather patterns to water composition.

17
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,270
The immediate downside of tidal locking
is will the absence of a day and night

18
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:23,590
cycle ever stayed out in the sun to loan
to the point where you can feel your

19
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:24,820
skin burning?
Well,

20
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:28,610
this is what would be happening all day
and all night on the earth's bright side.

21
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,640
The Sun would be constantly cooking the
bright side until the temperature became

22
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:38,500
so high that no life would be able
to survive. How high are we talking?

23
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,760
Well, it depends on how close
we were to the sun. Most likely,

24
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,870
well above 100 degrees Celsius.
The boiling point of water,

25
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,910
such intense heat would vaporize the
water on the hottest spots of the planet.

26
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,260
Meanwhile,

27
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,010
the dark side of the earth
would experience temperatures
well below zero degrees

28
00:01:57,011 --> 00:02:01,660
Celsius, turning all of its water
into ice. Even if the atmosphere,

29
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:05,200
it didn't freeze completely on that
frosty side, the cold air would sink low,

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,210
increasing atmospheric pressure because
the atmosphere on the other side would

31
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:11,860
be continuously exposed to light.

32
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,700
It would heat up and expand causing
atmospheric pressure to drop.

33
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,440
Significant differences in that Miss
Ferric pressure would lead to hellish

34
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:21,880
storms all over the planet.

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,150
You better hold onto something if
you don't want to get blown away.

36
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,310
We'd be fortunate not to lose
our atmosphere altogether
in such harsh conditions.

37
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,480
Without it,

38
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,980
we'd be long gone because our atmosphere
is one thing that could keep the planet

39
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:38,890
livable by distributing
the heat across the earth.

40
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,960
The only possible place for life on
earth surface would be in the twilights

41
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:45,730
strip of land between day and night,

42
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,900
but given that 71% of our
planet is covered in water,

43
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,830
it's not likely that there would be much
habitable land in that twilight zone

44
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:56,200
anyway.
Lucky for us,

45
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,770
there's no way the earth will become
tidally locked to the sun anytime soon.

46
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,060
We're far enough from the sun that its
gravitational pull doesn't latch on to

47
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:08,140
just one side, but the earth's
rotation is actually slowing down.

48
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,610
What if one day the earth stopped
rotating altogether? Well,

49
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,570
that's a question for another.
What if

50
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,780
stop rotating altogether? Well,
that's a question for another.

51
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,710
What if.
