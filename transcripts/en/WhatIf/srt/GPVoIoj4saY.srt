1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,980
[inaudible]

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,860
what if our moon had a
twin seeing not just one,

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,490
but two of these satellites in the
night sky might be spectacular,

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,610
but how would the second moon
affects the ocean? Tides?

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,260
Would months on earth become longer or
shorter and would these two satellites

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,020
inevitably collide to
cause a massive explosion?

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,630
This is what if, and here's what would
happen if the earth had two moons,

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,890
despite what you think the earth isn't
really the monogamous type along with the

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,340
moon earth has another
moonlight companion, a small
asteroid wandering around it,

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,440
but it's so far and so small that it can
only be considered a quasi I satellite

11
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:46,450
to our planet.
In our scenario,

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,220
we're talking to real moons just like the
earth had during its formative period.

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,600
Yup. We likely had two satellites once
both of them formed when a Marseilles

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,070
protoplanet slammed into earth
and shattered into small pieces.

15
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,900
So what exactly would happen if the
earth had another moon parked in orbit

16
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:05,734
around it?

17
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,320
Let's assume our second moon would be
around 1000 kilometers wide and about one

18
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,120
30th the mass of our current moon,

19
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,980
it would be about the same distance from
Earth to just like the sister satellite.

20
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,170
Our Moon had four and a
half billion years ago.

21
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,220
Would we see this devil moon from earth?
Absolutely.

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,510
The second moon would just appear
about three times smaller. Still,

23
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,540
it would be a spectacular view along
with two moons would come some big tides.

24
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,170
The newly captured moon would have a much
smaller tidal effect than that of our

25
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:38,860
moon,

26
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,860
but the tidal force from both satellites
combined would make waves literally,

27
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,580
although those waves would be bigger,
they wouldn't be devastatingly big.

28
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,150
In the end,
I think surfers will be pretty happy.

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,080
The second moon might stay in Earth's
orbit for tens of millions of years until

30
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:02,050
eventually as the moon retreated
further from the earth,

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,570
it would destabilize
the other moon's orbit.

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,950
Then just like they did
over 4 billion years ago,

33
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:14,080
the two satellites would collide in slow
motion because they'd be moving slowly

34
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:18,160
towards each other. The debris from the
collision wouldn't shower back on earth.

35
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,500
The small moon would splatter itself
across our moon as an extra layer of solid

36
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:24,334
crust.

37
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,240
The new mountains of crushed rock visible
from the near side of our moon would

38
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:31,510
be the only reminders of its existence.
Now,

39
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,620
what if the second satellite happened
to be the same size as the moon and

40
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:37,990
orbited the earth at
half the lunar distance?

41
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,540
This time things wouldn't be so pretty.

42
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,160
The second moon alone would produce tides
eight times greater than what we see

43
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:49,900
right now that would force people away
from the coastal areas because the

44
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:54,901
difference between high and low tides
would now reach 300 meters constant tidal

45
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:58,900
flooding,
which shrink the habitable area on earth.

46
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,450
But once we adapted to this new world,

47
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,380
we'd get to enjoy a beautiful
double moon this time.

48
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,040
The second satellite would look bigger
from Earth due to its closer orbit.

49
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,800
The moons would also
have different phases,

50
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,120
which means we'd have to come up with
another way to measure a month and then

51
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,410
there's some worse news.

52
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,910
The two moons would be slowly moving away
from earth and eventually would crash

53
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:26,680
into each other. This collision
would send debris back to earth.

54
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,340
It would be a shower of media
rights of epic proportion,

55
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,530
and it could wipe us out entirely.

56
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,570
Whatever debris didn't fall to earth
would form yet another new moon in Earth's

57
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:39,400
orbit.
At that point,

58
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,200
a new post human life form may begin
to evolve and become earth's next

59
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:48,520
civilization, but that's a
story for another. What if.
