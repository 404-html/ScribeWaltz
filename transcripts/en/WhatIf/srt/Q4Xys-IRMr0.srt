1
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,560
On Earth. If you were to fall
into it's magma filled center,

2
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,270
your body would quickly bubble
up and disappear without a trace.

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,690
So if they're so good at
getting rid of things,

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,700
why aren't we using them to get rid of
our garbage? Has anyone tried it before?

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,080
How would we transport all our trash to
them and what dangers would be involved?

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,540
This is what if,

7
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,890
and here's what would happen if we
dumped our trash into volcanoes.

8
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,610
Americans alone generate about 254
million tons of trash per year,

9
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,170
and although dumping it into volcanoes
might sound like the perfect way to get

10
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:54,210
rid of it,
it wouldn't be that easy.

11
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,990
Volcanoes might look like
nature's garbage incinerators,

12
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:01,710
but in reality they're much
more dangerous and unstable.

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,230
Not to mention a lot harder to get to.

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,410
Would overcoming these obstacles be
worth it or would dumping our trash in

15
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:13,530
volcanoes just cause even
more harm to our planet?

16
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,290
The first obstacle in our quest for
volcanic garbage disposal would be finding

17
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,360
an active volcano that
can get the job done.

18
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,060
There are only about 1500 potentially
active volcanoes worldwide and most of

19
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:30,450
them aren't located anywhere near humans.
For obvious reasons.

20
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,160
That means getting all our trash to
an active volcano could turn out to be

21
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,010
pretty expensive,
and once we get there,

22
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,340
we might find out it's not even
the right kind of active volcano.

23
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,960
The kind of volcano we'd be looking
for is called a shield volcano,

24
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,210
a slow erupting variety that contains
the iconic lava lakes that gradually spew

25
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:55,140
out onto the earth. Unfortunately,
these aren't very common.

26
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,030
You're more likely to come across.

27
00:01:57,031 --> 00:02:00,000
They're angry cousins known
as straddle volcanoes.

28
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,930
Straddle volcanoes are known for their
explosive eruptions caused by the buildup

29
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:09,450
of pressure from hot gas and magma.
In other words,

30
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,390
they're probably not the safest
location for the town dump,

31
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,820
but let's say we're lucky enough to find
ourselves a nice act of shield volcano

32
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,600
before we worry about the logistics
of getting our trash there.

33
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,200
Let's figure out if it's even
a good idea to dump it inside.

34
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,520
If you are one of the first
waste collectors hired to
drive up to the vent of a

35
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:33,450
volcano, you'd quickly start to
question your career choices.

36
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:40,150
The vent of a volcano is a treacherous
environment full of poisonous gases,

37
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,010
Lavis splatter and projectile rocks and
things only get worse once you start

38
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:46,240
throwing stuff inside.

39
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,990
In 2002 a group of Ethiopian researchers
through a 30 kilogram bag of trash into

40
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:55,600
a volcano and the results were explosive.

41
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,880
Lava lakes are unstable.

42
00:02:57,881 --> 00:03:01,540
So if you pierce surfaces with
something cold like trash,

43
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,250
you'll trigger a chain reaction
of explosions involving
pressurized and acidic

44
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,084
steam.

45
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,500
So can you imagine how big
these explosions would be
if you through an entire

46
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:15,190
nations trash in there? Well,
to put it in perspective,

47
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,290
rock falls into level. Lakes and Hawaii
have sent lava 85 meters into the air,

48
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,020
so it probably look something like that.

49
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,010
Even if you could safely get
your trash into the volcano,

50
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,820
you'd still have to worry about all the
air pollution created by burning our

51
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:33,370
waste without filters.
Plus,

52
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,250
not all materials will
completely break down in lava,

53
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,810
which means that the polluting remnants
could erupt out and contaminate the

54
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:44,950
surrounding landscape. Not Ideal. If
you were hoping to burn nuclear waste,

55
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:45,784
for example,

56
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,230
add these environmental impacts on top
of the fact that shipping all our trash

57
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:54,070
to these volcanoes would significantly
increase the carbon footprint of the

58
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:57,280
waste disposal and the whole
thing looks like a terrible idea.

59
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,130
If we're going to burn our trash,

60
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,850
why not at least do it someplace where
we can use the heat released through

61
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:06,490
incineration to create
new sources of energy,

62
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,500
or instead maybe we could just
shoot our garbage out into space.

63
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,070
Surely there can't be any harmful
effects there. Right. Well,

64
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,220
that's a topic for another.
What if.
