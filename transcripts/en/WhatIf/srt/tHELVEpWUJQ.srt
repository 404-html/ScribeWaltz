1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,960
High speed Internet, supersonic
jets, instant coffee,

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,510
and some noodles. Would you
believe our world is slowing down?

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,130
They say time flies when you're having
fun. But over the past 100 years,

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,900
including the twenties the sixties and
the eighties or days have actually gotten

5
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:25,440
longer before you say you're telling me,

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,970
let's just clarify,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,080
the average length of a day has
only increased by 1.7 milliseconds.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,120
But what if you could get more out
of your day? What if a great night,

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,320
never had to add?
What if one day lasted an entire year?

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,720
And in that time you could walk around
the whole earth. This is what if,

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,230
and here's what would happen if the
earth were to suddenly stop spinning.

12
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,170
The earth rotates at an average speed of
1000 miles per hour giving us night and

13
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:58,320
day while harnessing wind,
tides and temperature.

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,890
So what would happen if these revolutions
that are so vital to our existence

15
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,750
were to suddenly stop?
Okay.

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,440
Imagine owning the fastest, sexiest
sports car in the world. Pretty Nice, Huh?

17
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,720
The open road calls,

18
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,410
there's no traffic and sight and
no highway patrol officers either.

19
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,630
So you decide to test its top speed
driving at 1000 miles per hour out of

20
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:26,800
nowhere an obstacle, you hit the brakes,
your car stops suddenly, but you don't.

21
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,430
That's what would happen at the moment.
The earth stops spinning.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,470
Everything that isn't safely secure or
tied down will be suddenly sent flying

23
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:39,790
eastward at 1000 miles
per hour. Humans, cars,

24
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,870
even pigs.

25
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,880
The fastest wind ever recorded
was 253 miles per hour.

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,570
In this scenario, we're talking
about wins four times as strong,

27
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,380
feeling similar to an atomic
blast in less than a minute,

28
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,040
towering tsunamis would sweep
more than 17 miles inland,

29
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,970
all the water from the world's
oceans with surge towards the Poles.

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,400
Since the globe bulges at the equator,

31
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,270
the north and South Pole are closer to
the center of the earth and therefore

32
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,100
have a stronger gravitational pull.

33
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,320
The seven seas would turn into two
forming one mega ocean in the north and

34
00:02:14,321 --> 00:02:16,750
another in the South Canada.

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,340
Most of Europe and Russia would be
completely submerged. Boston, Chicago,

36
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:25,720
and Seattle would also be underwater
along with parts of Argentina, Chile,

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,673
and New Zealand.

38
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,780
The oceanic displacement would form a
massive supercontinent along the equator

39
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,640
wrapping around the entire earth.

40
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,680
While this might make it easier for
any surviving humans to work together,

41
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,320
there'd be little anyone
could do to improve their lot.

42
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,540
Resources would be scarce. The world
would experience widescale drought,

43
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,750
and most species would be
endangered if not already extinct.

44
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,520
Agriculture would be nearly impossible
to maintain since a full day would now

45
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:56,950
last an entire year.
In other words,

46
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,880
you'd see the sun for six straight and
spend the other half of the year in

47
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:05,260
darkness. This would also inhibit the
natural transition between seasons.

48
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,360
The final fatal consequence would
be the loss of our magnetic field.

49
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,430
Aside from giving us a sense of direction,

50
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,660
Earth's magnetic field ensures our
survival by deflecting solar wind,

51
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,380
which would otherwise rip through our
ozone layer and blast us with harmful

52
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:21,214
radiation.

53
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,170
Deadly cosmic rays would effectively
kill all living things on the planet and

54
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:29,740
over time the world is, we know it
would turn into Mars as we know it.

55
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,330
Wait a minute. Are we trying to travel
to Mars and possibly live on it?

56
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,150
Our Mars and earth?
Just going to switch places.

57
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,700
If this what it means to come full circle.

58
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,100
Even if we don't come
to a screeching stop,

59
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,170
the world will one day stop spinning
in about 18.5 billion years.

60
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,910
So for now, enjoy the time you have,
seize the day and make every night great.
