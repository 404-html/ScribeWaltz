1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,270
Imagine what it would be like to have a
miniature version of our son right here

2
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:12,060
on earth with this artificial star.

3
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:16,440
Provide us with an infinite supply of
clean energy. What do we even need?

4
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:19,740
All the coal and nuclear power plants
that give us electricity today.

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,350
Could the energy from a mini sun replace
rocket fuel and could we control it?

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,540
This is what if,

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,620
and here's what would happen if we
built a replica of the sun on Earth.

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,130
The Sun is an enormous nuclear
fusion generator. Every second.

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,190
It fuses 620 million tons of hydrogen
into 606 million tons of helium in its

10
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:44,640
core,

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,640
releasing a vast amount of energy in the
process to create a replica of the sun

12
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:53,670
on Earth. We just need to squeeze atoms
of hydrogen hard enough to make them.

13
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:56,760
Fuse shouldn't be too hard, right? Well,

14
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,000
this fusion is only possible
at extreme temperatures.

15
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,370
Even the sun's coldest part.

16
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:06,060
It's surface burns at an
incredible 5,500 degrees.

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,940
Not even a space suit can protect
you from that kind of heat,

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,710
but we could engineer a high temperature
super conductor to tame our scorching

19
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:18,300
mini sun. What would it take to bring
this brighter future into reality?

20
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,550
Having an artificial sun on our hands
would provide us with almost limitless

21
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:27,210
amounts of energy. Of course, it
would be much smaller than the sun.

22
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,920
Our replica could fit inside a machine
the size of 60 football fields and would

23
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:35,040
have the weight of three Eiffel Towers.
To make it work,

24
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,240
we'd need to specific hydrogen isotopes.
One of them called Deuterium.

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,590
We'd extract from water.

26
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,210
The other one Tridium we'd brew from
Lithium during the fusion reaction itself,

27
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,860
we'd give them any sun, its own magnetic
field with the help of huge magnets,

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,400
at least a thousand times more powerful
than those you put on your fridge.

29
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,450
This field would keep the artificial sun
in place while we're heating it up to

30
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,250
150 million degrees.

31
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,730
Few materials could handle the
scorching plasma of our son.

32
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,550
We'd have to create a
robust blanket for it,

33
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,190
one that wouldn't melt
during the scorching fusion.

34
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,070
Once we had all the
engineering issues figured out,

35
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,270
the artificial sun would completely
change the way our energy system works.

36
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,050
It wouldn't admit any greenhouse
gases and there would be no hazardous

37
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:22,500
radioactive waste left to the case.
Slowly over a thousand years,

38
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,920
unlike fossil fuels,
we'd never run out of hydrogen,

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,140
the most common element in the universe.

40
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,780
With this clean and safe source of energy,

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,430
we'd stop adding fuel to climate change
and maybe give our planet a second

42
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:37,380
chance.
Next,

43
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:41,700
we'd build fusion engines
for our spacecraft and go
on to explore space faster

44
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:45,870
than we ever imagined with hot
plasma fueling up our rockets,

45
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,300
it would take us just
30 days to get to Mars.

46
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,500
Huge progress compared to a nine month
trip with our current technology.

47
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,670
Sound like science fiction.
What if I told you,

48
00:02:56,671 --> 00:03:00,700
physicists around the world have been
working on recreating a miniature star for

49
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:05,260
decades. We already have reactors
capable of producing some like fusion,

50
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,000
but so far none of them have produced
more energy than they needed to consume to

51
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:11,980
make this reaction happen
in the first place.

52
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,810
Everything could change with a new class
of high temperature superconductors

53
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,610
that would bring nuclear fusion from an
expensive science experiment to a viable

54
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:23,650
source of energy available to everyone.

55
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,710
By the time scientists figure it out,

56
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,470
we may have moved off earth
and onto the nearest planet,

57
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,010
but that's a story for another.
What if.
