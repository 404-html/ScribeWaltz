1
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,050
Where did everybody go? Zombies. Rapture.

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,540
One big surprise party off the planet.
For whatever reason,

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,920
you are the last human on earth.
So what do you do? Eat like a king.

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,350
Move into Buckingham Palace. Drive fast.
Blow things up. Be naked all the time.

5
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,210
Or would you pretend you weren't alone?
How long would you last?

6
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:36,000
This is what if, and here's how you can
survive as the last person on earth.

7
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,470
So you wake up one day and find your
the only person left in the world.

8
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,570
Kind of cool, right? No
obligations, no rules, no limits.

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,370
Go nuts. Step one, enjoy the good things.

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,000
While you can go for
the exotic fruits first,

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,970
if your mangoes and bananas
are imported from overseas,

12
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,040
chances are there'll be hard to come by.

13
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,090
So eat them while you can
and enjoy every last bite

14
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,470
step to find a secure source of fuel.

15
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,860
You might think that with
no one's stopping you,

16
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,330
you could go anywhere but not so fast.
All those abandoned cars,

17
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,540
boats and planes you see lying around,
we'll be useless.

18
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:22,650
And about two years when their fuel goes
stale, guess he'll be sticking around.

19
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,510
But for how long?
Step three find a place to live.

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,190
If water, food, and shelter
are your basic needs,

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,350
shelter would be the easiest to come by.

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,260
You'd literally have a world
of homes to choose from,

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,630
but be careful where you settled down.

24
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,960
Cities will become dangerous
since without proper maintenance,

25
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,550
they'd start to fall apart pretty
quickly. Nature's elements, rain, frost,

26
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,110
and he would take their toll.

27
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,210
Rot and mold would become widespread and
vegetation would crack through concrete

28
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,410
and breakthrough glass.

29
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,970
But even if you were able to fight back
against nature's reclamation of the land,

30
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,470
all it takes is one bolt of lightening
to start a citywide fire and you can't

31
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:09,420
call the fire department, so
run for the hills. Step four,

32
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,040
get yourself some protection,

33
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,670
but even the country isn't all that safe.
First of all,

34
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,470
there are predators you'd need to
defend against wild dogs, feral cats,

35
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,573
bears,

36
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,120
but you'd only have to worry about them
as long as you could still breathe.

37
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,540
There are more than 400 nuclear
power plants in the world,

38
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,810
and once they're automated,
safety systems began to fail.

39
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:35,290
Without human supervision, there
would be meltdowns across the planet,

40
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,300
rendering many regions simply
uninhabitable. Step five,

41
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,240
find some food
in terms of food.

42
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,890
The city would be your best bet.

43
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,760
Supermarkets have enough canned and
frozen food to last you for decades,

44
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,470
whereas in the country,

45
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,640
crops and livestock would start to
dwindle without proper care or protection

46
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:58,580
from predators.
But if natural is more your style,

47
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,900
you'd have to go back to the old
ways of hunting with a spear or bow.

48
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,750
Since ammunition would be
limited and harder to come by,

49
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,210
maybe you could grow your
own little vegetable garden,

50
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,650
but that would cut into your
water resources. Step six,

51
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,030
it's all about the water.
Without other humans,

52
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,380
you'd be without electricity.

53
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,730
Water pumping stations and treatment works
with shutdown and the freshwater kept

54
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:23,890
in reservoirs would go
stale quite quickly.

55
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,940
You could rely on bottled water and you'd
probably have thousands of liters to

56
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,300
go through, but eventually you'd
have to learn how to purify your own.

57
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,080
Step seven,
start learning.

58
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,830
You don't have to teach yourself a
lot of things, but lucky for you,

59
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,490
you've got a lot of time on your hands
and millions of books out there with all

60
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:46,160
the information you'd need to
survive effectively on your own.

61
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,620
So while it might be hard at first,

62
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,860
you could technically survive
as the last human on earth,

63
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,540
but would you really want to,

64
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,530
humans evolve together as social
creatures in order to survive?

65
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:01,310
We joined forces against hunger and
harsh weather and build families and

66
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:06,260
communities to share stories, empathize
and keep each other happy and healthy.

67
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,540
Human contact has been scientifically
proven to build trust and reduce stress.

68
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,860
So while it's apt to cramp your style,
be glad it's a small world.

69
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,410
We need each other more than you think.
