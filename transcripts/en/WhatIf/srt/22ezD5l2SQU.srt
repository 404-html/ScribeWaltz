1
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,270
Oh Man.

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,590
Hor One giant special effects budget.
Can you believe that after 50 years,

3
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:20,680
conspiracy theories about the
moon landing are still in orbit?

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,980
Roughly 6% of Americans believe the moon
landing was faked while another 5% are

5
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:29,620
undecided. What do you think it
would take to pull off such a hoax?

6
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,640
How many people would have to keep
quiet and how much would it cost?

7
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,110
This is what if,

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,310
and here's what would need to happen
to fake the moon landing lights,

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,390
camera action.
July 16th,

10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,130
1969 exterior launchpad, Neil Armstrong,
Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins Board,

11
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,640
the Apollo 11 spacecraft bound
for the moon across the world.

12
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:55,990
600 million people watch live as the
three men are launched into space.

13
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,580
Land safely on the moon, plant the stars
and Stripes and make it home safely.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,370
Come to think of it.
That does sound a lot like Hollywood,

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,140
but can you think of a studio with
a $150 billion operating budget?

16
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,680
In total, the Apollo program was
allocated $24 billion to get to the moon.

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,350
Roughly 60% of NASA's budget at the time.

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,470
That equals 150 billion
in today's dollars.

19
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,410
Assuming all that money went into
pulling off the perfect hoax,

20
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,770
how would they have spent it? Let's
start with payroll. At the time,

21
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,360
NASA had about 411,000
employees and Oxford physicist,

22
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,320
Dr. David Grimes,

23
00:01:33,321 --> 00:01:36,830
calculated that the secret might have
had a chance to stay quiet for as long as

24
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:39,080
three years and eight months
with that many people.

25
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,090
So how do you keep 411,000 employees quiet
about a fake moon landing mission for

26
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:47,300
longer than three years?
A bribe might be able to buy some silence.

27
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:52,690
Today's NASA employees earn an average
of $62,500 if you divide the Apollo

28
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:56,900
budget in today's dollars amongst
a workforce of 411,000 people,

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,010
it comes to a payout of
roughly 365,000 per person.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,481
Of course,

31
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:06,260
employees would have had to accept much
less given the cost of the equipment and

32
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:08,090
the production needed
to fake a moon landing.

33
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,390
You may have noticed that the shadows
in the photographs of the moon landing

34
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,880
appear to be parallel image forensics.

35
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,350
Say these shadows accurately reflect
the sun's position from 93 million miles

36
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:22,820
away. Under conventional studio lighting,
the shadows would appear more divergent,

37
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,570
meaning NASA would have to step up their
game in order to achieve a convincing

38
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:31,571
look to properly fake the sun's lighting
in the 1960s would require a wall of

39
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:35,180
millions of powerful laser
lights so close together.

40
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,190
They'd be like pixels
on a computer screen.

41
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:42,170
Now consider that the 150
billion committed to the
Apollo program was spent on

42
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:46,400
six separate visits to the moon, so
whatever the cost of the first conspiracy,

43
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,390
bribes equipment, et Cetera,
multiply that by six.

44
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,070
In 2009 NASA's lunar reconnaissance
orbiter sent back high resolution

45
00:02:55,071 --> 00:02:58,760
photographs of each of the Apollo
Moon landing sites showing boot marks,

46
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:03,250
left astronauts to fake these NASA would
have had to send something to the moon,

47
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,800
like a robotic rover to make some tracks.

48
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,370
The combined cost of the vehicle and the
mission to put it on the moon would be

49
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:11,170
roughly $68 million.

50
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,070
Then another 504 million for a
lunar orbiter to take the pictures.

51
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,510
The bottom line of this prolonged spending
spree is that the cost of faking the

52
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:23,590
moon landing far outweighs the
cost of doing it for real. Luckily,

53
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,960
we are a species that puts
its money where its mouth is,

54
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,680
especially when we get curious.
And how's your appetite for adventure?

55
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,970
Are you ready for another one?
