1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,750
What does everyone on the planet said?

2
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:10,680
No to their gas powered car
right now and not just cars,

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,400
gas dryers, water heater's,
gas stoves, lawn mowers.

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,480
What if we stop burning
fossil fuels all at once?

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,300
Would this make our lives
that much more inconvenient?

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,770
What would happen to the climate?
Could it help us beat global warming?

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,570
This is what f and here's what would
happen if we stop burning fossil fuels

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,463
right now.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,000
So you probably know that fossil
fuels are spewing carbon dioxide.

10
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:40,080
Indoor air co two stays in our atmosphere
and heats up the earth's surface.

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,780
But the greenhouse effect,
the main cause of that climate change,

12
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:47,250
everyone's talking about the earth is
an average of one degree hotter than it

13
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:51,270
was in the 1880s before our factories
started belting greenhouse gases into the

14
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:54,090
air doesn't seem that bad.
Well,

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,570
it only took a four degree increased to
put an end to the most recent ice age

16
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:02,280
12,000 years ago
with all our power plants,

17
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:06,300
cars and appliances. We humans are the
main cause of today's global warming.

18
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,710
What if we banded together and eliminated
the use of fossil fuels once and for

19
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:13,590
all? Would this be the
solution to climate change?

20
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,150
Want to know what life would be like if
we stop burning fossil fuels right now?

21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,700
First off, there would be no
transportation, no cars, no
trains, no planes, no ships,

22
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,110
nothing.
Your local grocery store,

23
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:29,820
it wouldn't get fresh food delivered
for you to buy your electric car would

24
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:32,370
likely be useless to y.

25
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,060
But just think about where your
electricity comes from. Did you?

26
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:39,930
No more than two thirds of the world's
electricity production comes from burning

27
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:43,020
fossil fuels.
So there would be no electricity,

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,550
not quite with one third of electric
power generated by renewables and nuclear

29
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:50,010
stations. We wouldn't go
completely electricity free.

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,910
The party would still be going strong
in countries like Costa Rica, Norway,

31
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:57,990
and Iceland, they run almost exclusively
on renewable power. So head there,

32
00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:59,040
if you need to charge your phone,

33
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,940
the fossil fuel industries
would cease to exist.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,340
So with their $5 trillion
of annual revenue,

35
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,380
it's not just large energy producers like
Russian Gazprom or American Exxon who

36
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:11,280
would go bankrupt.

37
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,550
Millions of people are employed in those
industries who would lose their jobs.

38
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,180
Coal miners may want to get some
training in solar panel installation,

39
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,320
say goodbye to plastics and a
lot of your favorite gadgets.

40
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,490
Since plastic has made from oil and gas,
we wouldn't be making any more new toys.

41
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,100
Eliminating a stable and cheap source
of energy right now seems a bit extreme.

42
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,060
What's more, it wouldn't solve our climate
change problem. Not In the short term.

43
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,960
The global warming we've already
inflicted on our planet is irreversible.

44
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,570
Even if we stop burning fossil fuels,

45
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:45,840
the earth would continue warming up for
another few decades because of all the

46
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:47,100
heat we've already produced.

47
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,600
Global temperatures would climb finally
stabilizing at a level much higher than

48
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:56,280
we've ever known,
although that's far into the future.

49
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,680
The reality is if we don't
start burning less fossil now,

50
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,420
the result will be devastating.

51
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,010
Luckily, or not, someday we'll run out of
nonrenewable coal, gas, and oil anyway.

52
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,620
Are you ready to rock
some solar panels yet?

53
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,990
How do you help combat climate change?

54
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:21,760
Okay.
