1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,140
What if south was north and North was
south just like 780,000 years ago,

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,870
the world didn't come to an end then,

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,650
but how would it react now that
we rely so heavily on technology?

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:23,190
Would this electromagnetic disruption
kill us all with solar radiation?

5
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:27,930
Make the planet uninhabitable?
This is what if,

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,790
and here's what would happen if Earth's
magnetic poles flipped over night. Wait,

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,740
didn't we say had already happened before?

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,750
Earth's magnetic field has been
around for at least 4.2 billion years.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,010
It acts as a giant shield to protect
our planet from being burned by cosmic

10
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:44,844
radiation.

11
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,250
The fields north and south poles used to
switch places every 200,000 to 300,000

12
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:51,084
years,

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,680
but the current polls have been holding
steady for the past 780 millennia.

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,690
If the polls suddenly reversed, should
we be ready for a geomagnetic apocalypse?

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,590
Spoiler alert,
humanity wouldn't die out,

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,730
but the world as we know it would
flipping the polls wouldn't make the

17
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:10,440
geomagnetic field disappear,

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,740
but it would strip away at
least 10% of its current force.

19
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,520
Everything on earth would be exposed
to higher levels of radiation,

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,230
but wouldn't we still have the
atmosphere to protect us while we would,

21
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,120
but with a weak magnetic field,

22
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,200
flaming hot particles from the sun would
slam into our ozone layer and puncture

23
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:32,760
it. Extra ultraviolet radiation would
damage human tissue and cause mutations.

24
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,820
Skin cancer could become
as common as the flu.

25
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,750
Would our technology be in danger?
Absolutely.

26
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:44,040
Solar particles would rip
through sensitive electronics
of orbital satellites.

27
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,220
The damaging them heavily
for the u s economy alone,

28
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,780
a single big solar storm would cost
as much as $42 billion per day.

29
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,370
Eventually,

30
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,600
all communication systems would fail as
would the electrical grids that rely on

31
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:01,950
satellite timing systems. These grids
are all tightly connected to each other.

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,460
If even one of them was critically
damaged, the others would fail to.

33
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,150
This would cause a domino run
of blackouts around the world.

34
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,460
Blackouts that could last for decades.

35
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,900
Rapid magnetic polar reversal with
throw us back three centuries.

36
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:17,100
In terms of electronics,

37
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,180
you wouldn't be able to charge
your phone or use your computer.

38
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,110
Even your flush toilet would be useless.
It would quickly get backed up.

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,550
Since most sewer systems rely on
electricity to move waste on top of that,

40
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,450
high UV exposure could make some
parts of the planet uninhabitable.

41
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,170
And what about animals with the
polar flip affect them at all?

42
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,210
Some of them for sure. Along with many
other species, migratory birds, turtles,

43
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,840
whales, bees, and salmon use
magneto reception to navigate.

44
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,770
If north turned to south, they'd
be quite confused. However,

45
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,680
since many of these species were
around for the last pole flip,

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,380
it's possible they'd figure it out.
The truth is,

47
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,770
the power of our geomagnetic field has
been getting weaker for the last hundred

48
00:02:58,771 --> 00:03:01,660
and 60 years.
Are we moving towards a reversal?

49
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,410
Scientists believe we could be less
than a thousand years away from one.

50
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,980
The polls wouldn't flip overnight,
but as they move,

51
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,920
Earth's magnetic field could
be compromised for centuries.

52
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,140
The cool thing about it all,

53
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,680
you'd be able to see incredible
Auroras at much lower latitudes.

54
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,710
You might choose to go to Tahiti rather
than Iceland to see these epic nighttime

55
00:03:21,711 --> 00:03:22,330
skies.
