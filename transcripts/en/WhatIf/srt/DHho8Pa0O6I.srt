1
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,860
Imagine no possessions.
I wonder if you can,

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,830
what would a world without money look
like? Would society be better off?

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,750
Would it eliminate greed or hunger?
Would we be happier?

4
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,940
How would you get the things you need?
This is what if,

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,340
and here's what would
happen if we had no money,

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,700
dollars, cents, savings,
debt. Like it or not,

7
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,970
this is our society today,
but it wasn't always that way.

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,980
Several thousand years ago, we were a
species of hunters and gatherers tracking,

9
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:45,580
foraging, keeping only what we
could carry. But along the way,

10
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:49,720
we started experimenting with agriculture
and learned how to grow our own food.

11
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,100
We stopped moving and settled down,
forming organized communities.

12
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:59,050
Life got easier, but we still wanted
more than we had. So we began to barter.

13
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,100
Fast forward a few thousand years
to the first minted coin in 600 BC,

14
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,960
cash became king.
And today money's still does the talking.

15
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,230
So what would you say if the
world suddenly went broke?

16
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,190
Okay,

17
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,220
understandably, it isn't easy to
imagine a world without money.

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,560
So we went ahead and did
the hard work for you.

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,480
One thing is certain looting and crime
would skyrocket. Humans have needs.

20
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,390
We get hungry, we get
cold, we get jealous.

21
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,360
Law and economy normally
keep these drives and check,

22
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,450
determining what we can afford
and what we can get away with.

23
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,550
But suddenly everything is lost.

24
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:42,320
Its value and whoever's job it is to watch
the goods or maintain order no longer

25
00:01:42,321 --> 00:01:46,250
has an incentive to do so. No one wants
to work for free without paychecks.

26
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,840
We lose important services. No police,
no fire department, no doctors,

27
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:55,700
no military. And what about technology
powers and free, neither is running water,

28
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,440
definitely not gasoline and Ditto
for cell service and the Internet.

29
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,690
So our world would be thrown into a dark
anarchic chaos in this survival of the

30
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:06,590
fittest scenario.

31
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,250
Gun Owners would fare the best and it
would be in their best interest to band

32
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:13,760
together to claim a greater
share of resources at lower risk.

33
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,370
With humans forming into factions,

34
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,420
we can already begin to see a
repetition of early sedentary societies.

35
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,220
The streets would no longer be safe.

36
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,420
You'd have a high chance of being
ambushed and anything worth taking would

37
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:28,430
likely already be under armed watch,

38
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,300
so humans would establish stationary
communities in fortified positions.

39
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,290
They may send teams out to raid nearby
communities or established partnerships

40
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:40,580
with neighbors. We'd have to
reestablish the barter system only.

41
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:45,290
It's harder to do in modern society.
Early civilization had fewer commodities,

42
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,730
making fair trade easier,

43
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,150
but since we're used to so many
different goods and services,

44
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,000
it might be difficult to
establish a proper exchange rate.

45
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,140
It's not simply a matter of trading
apples for oranges is a granny Smith worth

46
00:02:57,141 --> 00:03:01,180
as much as a blood orange? What if
apples organic and the orange is GMO?

47
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,380
What protections would we have against
counterfeit goods and how could you save

48
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:08,290
for the future if everything
in the market has a shelf life?

49
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,890
These are only some of the concerns that
we've more or less resolved since the

50
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:12,970
introduction of currency,

51
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,870
but maybe a world without currency would
be an opportunity to restructure our

52
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:17,704
society

53
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,090
today.
We produce enough food to feed everyone,

54
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,440
yet people still go hungry and there's
enough shelter for all of us to sleep

55
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,750
soundly. Yet. Some of us are homeless.

56
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,370
Without money we might learn to be
comfortable with less. Without fortunes,

57
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,061
there'd be fewer,

58
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:40,560
less fortunates we might enjoy working
freely for a greater good. Of course,

59
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,650
a better world doesn't have to be a what
if scenario through trade we've learned

60
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:49,860
to cooperate and when hard work pays off,
we're encouraged to innovate.

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,730
The challenge then is to improve upon
the existing system and empower more

62
00:03:55,731 --> 00:03:58,460
people within it.
Do you think we can do it?

63
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,530
Where should we start a penny for
your thoughts and pay it forward

64
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,700
a penny for your thoughts
and pay it forward

65
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,770
only it's harder to do.
