1
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,630
How many times have you
heard this classic tale?

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,920
Some sort of apocalypse wreaks havoc
on our planet and before you know it,

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,780
all the people are gone except for
this guy, the last man on earth,

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,050
he somehow manages to run
into the last woman on earth.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,720
They decide that it's up to
them to save the human race.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,160
So they start making babies and soon
enough the earth is repopulated and

7
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:30,460
everyone lives happily ever after.
But is that even possible?

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,170
What kind of awkward problems would be
involved and why would our new population

9
00:00:35,171 --> 00:00:37,990
be so different?
This is what if,

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,110
and here's what would happen if
you had to repopulate the planet.

11
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,330
Repopulating and entire planet would
be no easy feat in this scenario.

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,760
Assuming the two remaining
people are actually for towel.

13
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,960
The first generation of
this new population would
all be brothers and sisters

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,940
and the second would be cousins.

15
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,390
If the world's new population
is just a product of inbreeding,

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,860
does it even stand a chance?

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,930
So our last couple on earth has as many
babies as they possibly can. That's fine,

18
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:08,960
but we can't stop there.
I mean that's nice for a family picnic,

19
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:11,000
but we're trying to
repopulate the world here.

20
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,170
Taking the next step means that all their
kids now have to have babies with each

21
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:16,004
other

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,330
in order to understand
just how deadly that is.

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,800
Let's have a little lesson in genetics.
We all have two copies of every gene,

24
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,280
one from each parent.
Some of these copies can be bad genes.

25
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,080
The carry genetic disorders carrying these
variants on their own isn't a problem

26
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,810
as long as we only have one copy.
In fact,

27
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,710
most people watching right now are
carrying one or two genetic variance that

28
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:43,280
could be deadly if we're born with
an identical pair of these variants,

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,670
that's when we run into trouble and
if our parents are brother and sister,

30
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,660
their genes are much more likely to be
similar as more and more relatives in

31
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:51,920
breed,

32
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,300
the chances of their offspring receiving
identical copies of bad genes and being

33
00:01:56,301 --> 00:01:58,730
born disabled or diseased
keeps increasing.

34
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,670
That doesn't spell good news
for the future of humanity.

35
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,310
But if we have as many
children as possible,

36
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,700
odds are that some of them will
come out healthy, right? Sure.

37
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,900
But what happens when this inbreeding
continues over hundreds of years for that

38
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:15,590
answer, all we have to do is look
at the European royalty of the past.

39
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:16,970
For centuries,

40
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,900
European royal families would intermarry
to keep the power within their ranks

41
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,700
and that quickly led to problems.

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,510
Okay.

43
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,300
The biggest victim of this was Charles,
the second of Spain,

44
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,310
who after generations of interbreeding
had less genetic diversity than he would

45
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:35,400
have if his parents had been siblings.
As a result,

46
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,580
he was born with a slew of
physical and mental disabilities.

47
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,140
He couldn't walk until he was eight years
old and his impotence led to the end

48
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:47,100
of the very dynasty his ancestors
were trying to preserve. All right,

49
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:48,990
so we get it.
Interbreeding is bad,

50
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,140
but what if we introduced a couple
more people pull to help with the

51
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:53,940
repopulation with that work?

52
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,750
Not really because our small group
of people would become vulnerable to

53
00:02:57,751 --> 00:03:02,710
something called the founder.
In a small isolated population,

54
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,180
obscure and harmful traits become common
because the founder population limits

55
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:10,570
the number of possible genetic
combinations, even if they survive.

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,540
All the other fun that a post
apocalyptic world has to offer.

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,130
Odds are that the founding members genes
would eventually combined to pass down

58
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,880
some sort of deadly condition to the
children and with medical care being a

59
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:22,750
thing of the past.

60
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,130
The new humanity would probably only
last a couple of generations, but hey,

61
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,850
don't give up hope yet because history
shows that several small groups of

62
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:33,820
survivors have managed to grow
and beat the odds of genetics.

63
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,690
Maybe it would be possible to
recover from the apocalypse.

64
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,580
What would our new society look like?

65
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,210
Maybe our entire planet would speak
the same language or have the same

66
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:46,930
government, but that's a
topic for another. What if.
