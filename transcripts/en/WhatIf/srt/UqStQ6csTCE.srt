1
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,050
With all the work to do, people to
see traffic jams to get stuck in.

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,340
We all sometimes wish we could
be in two places at once.

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,150
We've already cloned
sheep, cows, even monkeys.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,770
What if we cloned ourselves with clone,
have feelings and be self conscious?

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,100
Could you genetically modify them
to become better than yourself?

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,900
This is what if, and here's what
would happen if you cloned your body.

7
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,520
Cloning is reproducing a genetically
identical copy of an organism.

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,120
Scientists are doing that all the time,
but they aren't cloning humans.

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,140
They're mostly making copies of cells
or DNA fragments for research purposes.

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,160
Occasionally, they'll clone an
animal too. In the case of Dolly,

11
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:50,480
the sheep scientists took a somatic
cell from an adult sheep and inserted it

12
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,100
into an egg that had all of its DNA
information removed. Since then,

13
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,780
we've cloned dogs, cats, horses,
and just recently primates.

14
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,440
It looks like researchers have
figured this cloning thing out.

15
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,980
What if one day they decided
to start cloning humans?

16
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,110
It turns out some organisms are harder
to genetically duplicate than others.

17
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,000
Dogs are harder to clone them. Cats and
rats are even harder to clean than dogs.

18
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,290
Humans are also among the
toughest tough but possible.

19
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,680
What if you were the first one
ever to make a clone of yourself?

20
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,640
Would it be an exact copy of you?
I hate to break it to you,

21
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:31,130
but not only would your clone
have a different personality,

22
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,130
but they'd also look different.
Think about it this way,

23
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:38,120
just how identical are identical twins.
You may not notice at first glance,

24
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:39,230
but when you look closer,

25
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,950
one of them has a birthmark on their cheek
and the other one is a little toddler.

26
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,160
While you won't notice much of
a difference in a sheep clone,

27
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,440
once you look to your fresh from the lab,
you, you'd see that it's, well not you.

28
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,300
You're more than just a product of your
genetic code, your character behavior,

29
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,300
even your appearance depend on the
environment in which you were raised.

30
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,880
You can make a copy of your genes,

31
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,960
but copying your memories and
experiences is impossible. Oh,

32
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,810
and you realize that your clone
wouldn't be your grown up self, right?

33
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,860
You'd have to raise that clone baby before
they got to your age, if they ever do,

34
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,500
because clones are
typically very unhealthy.

35
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,730
Most likely they'd have a defective heart,
liver and brain,

36
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,650
as well as a very weak immune system.

37
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:26,210
Many cloned animals had their cells age
much faster than normal. You're cones.

38
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:31,010
Body would probably get old
and deteriorate much sooner
than you. Unfortunately,

39
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,820
your clone would be very
sick and die early, and they
may not even look like you.

40
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,130
Not to mention a totally
different personality.

41
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,210
Human cloning is illegal
almost everywhere on earth now.

42
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:44,300
And then a group of researchers will
claim to have cloned a human successfully,

43
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,880
but with no scientific
information to prove their claims.

44
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,790
Human cloning remains in the
realm of science fiction.

45
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,630
So if you're ever on a trip abroad
and meet someone who looks like you,

46
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,020
don't panic. The chances that
you were cloned or close to zero,

47
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,040
have you seen your lookalike?
What if everyone in

48
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,450
the world had a double? Well,
that's a story for another. What if.
