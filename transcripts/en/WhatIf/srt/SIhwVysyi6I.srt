1
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,710
2018 saw the emergence of the
first hundred billion dollar man.

2
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,790
The idea of that much money is
enough to make your head spin,

3
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,360
but don't tell me you've never
dreamed about it. The question is,

4
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,560
what would you do? What could you
do? Would you buy the crown jewels,

5
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,720
a giant house or a private plane?
Would you make the world a better place?

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,700
Could you even live long enough
to spend it? This is what if,

7
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,250
and here's what you could
buy with $100 billion.

8
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,620
It seems like those with money are
often judged by how they use it.

9
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,610
Some people spend more than the cost
of a college education on a car,

10
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,260
and then the ro campaigns,

11
00:00:57,261 --> 00:01:01,490
like the giving pledge that has seen
175 of the world's wealthiest people

12
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,990
pledging to donate the majority, they're
fortunate to charitable causes. So far,

13
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,020
the members of the giving pledge have
collectively promise more than $365

14
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,660
billion, but for a lot of us, it's
hard to quantify that type of money.

15
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,940
So to help put it all in perspective,

16
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,270
here are some of the things you
could buy with $100 billion.

17
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,130
You've been thinking about that dream
vacation for awhile and now you can

18
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:27,740
finally go wherever you want
for as long as you want.

19
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,660
But what does it mean to travel
in style? Well, for $100 billion,

20
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,920
you could buy around 250 Boeing
seven 40 sevens in other words,

21
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,540
establish your own private airline.

22
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,900
But if you're seriously
considering a kingly existence,

23
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,310
why not buy an entire country
with a GDP of $90 billion?

24
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,110
You could practically own Costa Rica,

25
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,530
and while you're busy turning
the world into a monopoly board,

26
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,280
why not add another game to your
collection with $100 billion?

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,150
You could furnish a real version of the
classic board game battleship with the

28
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:02,990
cost of to small fleets each with its
own aircraft carrier coming in at about

29
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:04,220
$50 billion.

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,640
It's up to you how much you want to spend
on fuel ammo and personnel with just

31
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,590
half of your fortune. You could buy
the world's largest royal domain,

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,060
the palace of Versailles with
its 700 rooms, 600 paintings,

33
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,230
400 sculptures, and
1400 fountains. In fact,

34
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,370
you'd still have enough leftover for
the White House, Buckingham Palace,

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,780
Saint Peter's Petersburg winter palace,
and Tokyo's Imperial Palace.

36
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,830
Or You could just buy the loof and
its contents for a modest 45 billion,

37
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,830
but if art isn't your thing,
how about sports?

38
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,000
With the average cost of an American
football franchise at $1 billion,

39
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,540
you can own every team in the national
football league and still have enough

40
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,000
leftover to buy all the teams
in Major League Baseball,

41
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,490
the National Hockey League and
the English Premiere League.

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,680
While you might call that a win win,

43
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,900
it's important to remember
that for some people,

44
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,800
a billion in the bank is not just a
reality, but a serious responsibility.

45
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,400
$100 is enough money to put roughly
757,000 students through American colleges

46
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,500
for four years.

47
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,810
You could triple America's
proposed foreign assistance
budget for 2019 offering

48
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:15,250
three times the amount of food medicine
and security to a wider range of

49
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,110
recipients in over 100 countries.

50
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,210
Considering that it would only cost an
estimated $60 million to save the Great

51
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:22,480
Barrier Reef.

52
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,220
Think how far $100 billion could take
us along the path of sustainable living

53
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:30,160
and environmental protection.
Of course,

54
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:33,490
we could always diversify and
tackle several world issues at once.

55
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,230
A team of some of the world's
top economists claim that
an annual investment of

56
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:43,231
$3 billion could reduce malnutrition in
the developing world by 36% saving over

57
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:48,190
100 million children from starvation
each year. On top of that,

58
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,210
an additional $2 billion every year
towards agricultural research and

59
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:55,240
development would not only
increase global food security,

60
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,840
but also protect biodiversity
and prevent deforestation.

61
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,650
These are trends that could only become
more cost effective as they continue to

62
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:03,484
be funded.

63
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,840
It may seem like a sad reality to consider
that money really does make the world

64
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:08,590
go round,

65
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,340
but that doesn't mean we have to think
selfishly put towards a good cause.

66
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,200
Money can make a world of difference.

67
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,640
Lifting people out of poverty
and stimulating growth,
education and innovation.

68
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,640
As long as enough people
remain willing to give back,

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,540
then we should all consider
ourselves fortunate. So how about it?

70
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,730
What would you do with $100 billion.
