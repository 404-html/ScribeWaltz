1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,270
On average, you produced just over
two kilograms of waste every day.

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,400
That may not sound like a whole lot,

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,670
but multiplied by every person on earth
and suddenly you've got 14.8 billion

4
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:20,070
kilograms of waste being
produced every 24 hours.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,800
But what would happen if we
suddenly stopped recycling?

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,110
Would the world be quickly flooded with
garbage? Would we fire it into space?

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,210
This is what if, and here's what would
happen if everyone stopped recycling.

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,980
Nearly everything we buy has some
recyclable component, glass paper,

9
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:40,140
plastic metal,
and other materials.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,880
The United States where cycles about
65 million tons of waste each year,

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,100
which is just 30% if it's 200 million
tons of yearly waste around the world.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,900
Recycling is a massive industry.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,550
Countries in Europe like Austria and
Germany recycle over 50% of their waste

14
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:57,930
every year.
Now,

15
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:01,710
what would happen if everyone in
the planet just decided to stop?

16
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,660
If the world stopped recycling,

17
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,320
every single scrap of waste
would end up in a landfill. Well,

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,720
most of it with a larger amount of trash,

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,070
it's inevitable that we'd get more in
places where it shouldn't be. At first,

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,160
you probably wouldn't notice anything.
In a best case scenario,

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,820
most landfills around the world
expect to last 30 to 50 years.

22
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,220
One of America's largest landfills
began accepting garbage back in 1957 and

23
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:30,780
finally stopped in 2013
that's 56 years of trash.

24
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,210
It may take a couple of years,

25
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,940
even decades before garbage
starts piling up everywhere.

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,760
So what happens when those
landfills finally fill up?

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,450
When landfills become too full
to take on any more garbage,

28
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,270
they're covered with clay
and soil to form large hills.

29
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,360
You might think the job is done at that
point that you'll never need to think

30
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:52,350
about that stinky garbage ever again.
But sadly that isn't the case.

31
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,320
While the garbage is
tightly packed underground,

32
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,060
it remains in an oxygen list environment
there it creates methane gas,

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,100
a huge contributor to global warming.

34
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,150
Landfills are the third largest
producers of methane gas on the world.

35
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,640
And as the planets
landfills continue to fill,

36
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,870
they have the potential to eclipse farming
and fossil fuel production and become

37
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:16,170
the highest producers
with our landfills full.

38
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,160
Where would the rest of our garbage go?
Well, we wouldn't bless it up into space.

39
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:22,440
That's far too expensive.
Instead,

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,310
we'd most likely burn it a practice that
some European countries are currently

41
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:29,100
doing. However, if
every landfill did this,

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,210
it would create even more
potentially deadly pollution
making the air we breathe.

43
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:38,211
Toxic recycling prevents
almost 200 million metric
tons of greenhouse gases from

44
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:39,930
polluting our environment each year.

45
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,400
That's the equivalent of the fumes
produced by over 39 million cars on the

46
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:45,234
highway.

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,860
A lot of our trash would end up in places
where it's not supposed to go like the

48
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:51,420
ocean.
Right now,

49
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,710
the world's oceans are home to millions
of floating pieces of plastic with no

50
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:56,544
one recycling.

51
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,400
Even more of this debris would end up in
the water killing millions of fish and

52
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:04,660
making the water and swimmable, but
these might be the least of our worries,

53
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,740
at least in the short term.

54
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,370
What we would start to notice quickly
would be our natural resources being

55
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:13,750
destroyed. You see, recycling isn't just
about keeping trash out of landfills.

56
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,260
It also helps us sustain our
natural resources like timber.

57
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,330
It's estimated nearly 7 billion trees
are cut down globally each year.

58
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,790
In 2017 the United States recycled
over 68 million tons of paper.

59
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,930
Without this,

60
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,800
more trees would have to be cut down to
sustain the paper supply leading to an

61
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:35,350
even higher amount of
deforestation than we have today.

62
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,910
You can say goodbye to fossil fuels.
In addition to making our cars go,

63
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,610
they're the source of
all our plastic products.

64
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,560
Fossil fuels are currently expected to
deplete by 2050 but without recycling,

65
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,340
fossil fuel consumption would be higher
than ever leading to the precious

66
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:55,030
resource being gone much sooner.
So with no one recycling,

67
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,480
the world would have no choice
but to change. For instance,

68
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,290
new water bottles being researched
today are being made out of biopolymer,

69
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,600
a material that's composed of bacteria.

70
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,170
These bottles are designed to
biodegrade in just 18 months.

71
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,640
That would help a lot as the world is
currently using over a million plastic

72
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:14,110
water bottles per minute.

73
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,650
Other materials and products would
eventually have to follow suit.

74
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,340
Maybe one day we'll live in a world
where everything is biodegradable,

75
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,690
even electronics, but that's
a story for another. What if.
