1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,260
What if we lost our entire
atmosphere all at once?

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,610
Let's say the years magnetic field took
a break and allowed strong solar winds

3
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:15,070
to come and strip away our
protective space, blanket

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,700
with earth instantly turn
into a big lifeless rock.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,500
Would you still be able to breathe?
Could our atmosphere ever come back?

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,050
This is what if,

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,620
and here's what would happen if our
atmosphere vanished into thin air.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,810
Just how important is the atmosphere
to our planet? It's absolutely vital.

9
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,070
It protects us from asteroids and solar
radiation. It regulates our climate.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,370
It makes life on earth possible.
Our nearest neighbor,

11
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:45,760
Mars lost most of its atmosphere
some 4 billion years ago,

12
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,020
and look what's become of it once warm
and wet in eight the planet it used to be,

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,040
it's atmosphere has advantaged completely.
There's still a very thin layer left,

14
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,710
but have you ever heard
of any life found on Mars?

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,540
What exactly what happened to Earth
when the atmosphere went away? Well,

16
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,370
it's far from a happy ending.

17
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:08,620
Take away the earth's atmosphere and
suddenly it would become very, very quiet.

18
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,330
You wouldn't hear a thing.

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,440
That's because sound waves are actually
vibrations in the air, but no air,

20
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,500
no sound.
There's no sound in space.

21
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,990
The Star Wars universe
just isn't accurate.

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,840
The Sky would turn black because there
would be no particles in the air to

23
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:32,340
scatter the blue light of sunshine. Planes
would plummet to the ground and birds,

24
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,080
they need air pressure to
support them as they fly. Oceans,

25
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:41,310
lakes and rivers would start acting weird
as well with no atmospheric pressure.

26
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,030
The boiling point of water would
drop significantly from 100 degrees.

27
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,360
All of our swatter would start
boiling away like a forgotten kettle.

28
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,090
Not all of it would turn to vapor.

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,780
Soon we'd reach an equilibrium with
enough vapor to prevent the water from

30
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,650
boiling, but with zero
atmospheric pressure, the
water wouldn't remain liquid.

31
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,990
What's left of it would turn into ice,

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,340
grab a winter coat as it's going to get
pretty chilly without an atmosphere to

33
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:06,660
trap heat near the surface,

34
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,950
Earth's temperature would drop to
an average of minus 18 degrees and

35
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,770
temperatures would see extreme
shifts between day and night.

36
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,060
Now slather on the sunscreen because
even with temperatures that low,

37
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:21,450
you can still get sunburned without
the atmosphere to filter solar.

38
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:24,060
Radiation sunbathing would become lethal,

39
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,790
but would you even survive that long?

40
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,590
Only if you had a pressure suit and an
oxygen mask on. Without those two things,

41
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,290
you're no longer with us.
In order to inhale,

42
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,010
your diaphragm uses the
pressure difference between
the air inside your lungs

43
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,040
and the air outside of your body.
Without outside pressure,

44
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,250
you wouldn't be able to breathe even
if you are hooked up to our respirator,

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,690
but don't hold your breath. Your lungs
would pop in a matter of seconds.

46
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,170
Exhaling would help your body stay
alive for about three minutes,

47
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,900
but you'd be unconscious
after just 15 seconds.

48
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,160
Everything that needs oxygen would
die. All animals, all plants.

49
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,060
That includes everything
in the oceans too,

50
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,220
but there's still be some bacteria left.

51
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,590
Maybe it would evolve into
something intelligent.

52
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,300
Eventually solar radiation would break
the water vapor down into oxygen.

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,470
Combine that with the carbon dioxide
pumped for volcanoes and from geothermal

54
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,690
vents,
and it would create a new atmosphere,

55
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,400
but this would be long after humans
are gone and too thin for us to breathe

56
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:25,110
anyway.
Now take a deep breath because

57
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,103
can

58
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,393
and relax.

59
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,450
No massive media or coronal objection
is likely to strip away our atmosphere

60
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:36,130
anytime soon. And from now on, try
to appreciate every sunset you see.

61
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,860
If we ended up fleeing this
planet to colonize Mars,

62
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,060
they won't look this beautiful.

63
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,170
Okay.
