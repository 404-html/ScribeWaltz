1
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,570
Where do you go?

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:07,750
Hmm.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,270
The kitchen sink,
the local bar,

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,460
the mineral rich springs of Bergamo,
Italy in the 21st century.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,230
You don't have to go that far for fresh
water, but still supply is running out.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,770
What if we didn't have to
worry about water consumption?

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,490
What if you could drink and
shower as much as you wanted?

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,900
What if a trip to the well and a trip
to the beach, we're one and the same.

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:37,000
You might give a lot for those privileges,
but how much would it really cost?

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,730
This is what if,

11
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:44,110
and here's what would happen if
all seawater became fresh water.

12
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,020
The first big question we have to ask is
why is the ocean so salty to begin with?

13
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,640
Well, it wasn't always like that.
About 3.8 billion years ago,

14
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,350
Earth surface had finally cooled to the
point that water vapor turn to liquid,

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,340
no salt added. That's right. A
really, really long time ago.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,060
The oceans were fresh water,
but that wasn't going to last.

17
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:11,950
Whenever it rains, carbon dioxide from
the air dissolves into the falling water.

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,490
This makes the rain slightly
acidic and when it falls,

19
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:20,550
it causes rocks to erode from their
rainwater slides towards nearby rivers and

20
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:24,880
streams taking loose salt and
minerals along with it. From there,

21
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,730
this runoff flows from
rivers into the ocean.

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,510
Add to that any additional salt and
minerals that would be expelled from

23
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:34,000
hydrothermal vents or submarine volcanoes,

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,900
and then consider that this whole
process has been recurring more or less

25
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:41,890
consistently for 3.8 billion years.
That's a lot of salt.

26
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,090
In fact,

27
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,930
there's so much salt in the ocean that
if you spread it evenly across all the

28
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:50,500
land on earth, it would amount
to one tower in layer of salt.

29
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,060
That's 40 stories tall.

30
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,580
97% of all the water on earth is salient
and we've got to assume it's for a

31
00:01:57,581 --> 00:02:02,000
reason. So what would our world look
like if we took the salt out of the sea?

32
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,280
Fresh water oceans sure do.
Sounds like a godsend. Right now.

33
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,210
It's predicted that a third of the world
will be facing chronic water shortages

34
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:13,540
by 2025 at our current
rate of consumption,

35
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,170
the global demand for fresh
water doubles every 20 years.

36
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,970
So maybe freshwater oceans would actually
yield a good outcome this time. Nope.

37
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,950
Uh, c without salt would decimate marine
life and dramatically affect our weather

38
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:31,210
and temperatures making human life on
earth very difficult, if not impossible.

39
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,870
There are roughly (220) 800-0450 species
in the ocean and as many as 2 million

40
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:41,230
more to be discovered. But if the
ocean were to become desalinated,

41
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,450
we'd never find them.
Salt water,

42
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:46,930
fish and other ocean creatures evolve
to be able to drink salt water,

43
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:49,510
to stay hydrated and
get rid of excess salt.

44
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,850
Not all sea creatures
do this the same way,

45
00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:56,170
but being able to pump out excess salt
is crucial to surviving in the ocean.

46
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,450
Some species like salmon have to
tolerate freshwater and salt water,

47
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,750
but for the most part,
all saltwater species would perish.

48
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,080
This includes underwater algae,
which believe it or not,

49
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,230
accounts for half the
photosynthesis that occurs on earth.

50
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,190
Photosynthesis plays a vital role
in supplying our planet with oxygen.

51
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,240
Since trees and plants convert carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere into the air,

52
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,930
we breathe. So without algae,
not only did we get less oxygen,

53
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,260
we also have a lot more carbon
dioxide in our atmosphere.

54
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,700
This intensification of the greenhouse
effect would make some parts of the world

55
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,230
unbearably hot. You definitely notice
this intense heat near the equator.

56
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,950
Since our ocean currents
wouldn't be circulating warm
water and air the way they

57
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:43,510
used to. Convection currents help warm
water from the equator get farther north.

58
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,530
While colder water from the north is
able to cool hotter areas down south.

59
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,680
At the equator,
warmer water can carry more salt.

60
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,540
So this denser water sinks lower while
cooler water flows over top of it.

61
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,440
And in the far north, the water
gets cold enough to freeze and form.

62
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:02,980
Sea ice salt gets left
behind as the water freezes,

63
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,100
and naturally this makes
colder water up north denser,

64
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,300
allowing it to sink to the bottom to
make room for the incoming warmer water

65
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:13,240
that's worked its way up from the south.
But without salt,

66
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,070
the whole process breaks down.

67
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,940
Earth's extremities would freeze
while weather around the equator would

68
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:20,980
intensify.
For one thing,

69
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,840
hurricanes would be a lot more frequent
and a lot more deadly. At this point,

70
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,230
our weather and our climate
would be totally different
from how we know it. Now,

71
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,490
how long would we survive to see
all these changes? Not long at all.

72
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,530
You'd either freeze, overheat, die in
a natural disaster or starve to death.

73
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,520
Yeah.

74
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,300
With significantly less photosynthesis
and climates that are either extremely

75
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:44,740
cold or extremely hot,

76
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,580
our weather would no longer support
the diverse plant life it has now.

77
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,330
The entire food chain would collapse.
Most species would die off,

78
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:56,380
including humans. Since crops we rely
on for sustenance would all disappear.

79
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,860
So when we say ocean
colonization is important,

80
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,300
don't take it with a grain of salt. Of
course we respect the scientific method,

81
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,280
so keep questioning the world and its
properties on land and beyond and come

82
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:11,680
back soon for another.
What if.
