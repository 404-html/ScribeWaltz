1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,940
Are you an organ donor?
How much have you,

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:12,470
are you willing to part with your
heart and lungs, skin and bones,

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,080
cornea genitalia?

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,210
Why not just give away your entire body?
Yes.

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,670
This neurosurgeon says
he's close to achieving the
world's first successful body

6
00:00:24,711 --> 00:00:25,544
transplant.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,230
Most doctors are calling this
endeavor unethical if not impossible,

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,810
but what if it is possible?

9
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,860
What if you could replace any
body part without any trouble?

10
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,860
What if you could replace your whole body?

11
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,330
This is what if and here's what would
happen if there were no limits to organ

12
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:51,521
transplantation since the very first
successful organ transplant in 1954 the

13
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:57,500
list of body parts that you can give to
those in need has expanded significantly.

14
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,480
Almost everything from heart to
hands and eyes to intestines has been

15
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:04,430
transferred from one body to another.

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,120
In 2014 a mother made history by giving
birth to the first live baby from a

17
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:11,570
transplanted uterus.

18
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,980
It took decades of research and practice
to be able to pull off such procedures

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,940
and even the ones that have become
commonplace still face complications.

20
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,950
But now neurosurgeons,

21
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:26,870
Sergio Cannavaro and Shao Ping Ren
claim that they will soon transplant one

22
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:30,530
patient's head onto a new body.
Organ.

23
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:34,940
Transplants have come a long way but
swapping heads and bodies seems closer to

24
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:39,320
science fiction than anything like
real medicine. So how would it work?

25
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:45,010
How much would it help you and who
would you even be in one operating room?

26
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,680
A team of surgeons will prepare your
host body while in another room.

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,070
A different team will be tasked
with safely removing your head.

28
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,480
Your head will be chilled to about 10
degrees to minimize the risk of brain

29
00:01:56,481 --> 00:01:58,700
damage.
Once blood stops circulating to your head,

30
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,510
your head will have to be drained of
blood to prevent any clots from forming

31
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:03,410
during the transition.

32
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,970
The biggest physical obstacle to a full
body transplant will be connecting your

33
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:10,880
head to a new spinal cord.
At this point,

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,410
no doctor has ever succeeded
in reconnecting a completely
severed spinal cord

35
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,280
and that's because there are millions of
nerve connections that would need to be

36
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:23,960
fused together perfectly in order to
restore full functionality to make the

37
00:02:23,961 --> 00:02:27,440
cleanest cut possible.
Surgeons will use a diamond edge blade,

38
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,770
which should be sharp enough
to cut through the spinal
cord without fraying any

39
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:32,780
nerves.
Once that's done,

40
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,580
the next step is to glue your head onto
the new spinal cord using polyethylene

41
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:42,320
glycol, which is considered
to be a fusajiro capable
of rapidly refusing severed

42
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:44,960
neurons,
but so far in animal tests,

43
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,670
this part of the process has only
restored functionality to about 15% of the

44
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:50,840
nerves and the spinal cord.

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,820
So you can see why almost every doctor
who's read up on this procedure doubts

46
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,800
it's success and we haven't
even had an identity crisis yet.

47
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,160
Suppose your head gets a new body.
What happens to you?

48
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,750
We've been debating questions of identity
and consciousness for centuries and

49
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:09,160
we're nowhere near consensus.

50
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,120
Is your identity attached to
your mind or is it all of you?

51
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,260
Even if your brain stays the same,
you're going to have some new DNA.

52
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,400
If you decide to have children,
your new bodies genes will be passed on.

53
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,710
So are they really your descendants?

54
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,740
It's likely that your
personality would change.

55
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:29,920
To do you know about your
second brain medically,

56
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:33,550
it's called your enteric nervous system
and it's a bundle of nerves in your gut

57
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,590
that gives you, well those gut
feelings. 95% of Serotonin,

58
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,320
which helps regulate your emotions,
is housed in your gut.

59
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,700
So with your brain upstairs and
someone else's second brain down below,

60
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,620
who would this hybrid person B,

61
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,280
but suppose you can stomach
the existential confusion.

62
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,720
Can you really be sure that your new
body will accept you with any organ

63
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:56,380
transplant?

64
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,070
Patients are prescribed a variety of
drugs to prevent the immune system from

65
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:02,320
rejecting foreign parts.
So yeah,

66
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:05,140
you're going to have to hope your new
body can get along with your head,

67
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,580
but isn't the idea of your body not
wanting to be around you just a little bit

68
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,870
psychologically traumatic.

69
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,650
Thankfully these questions or nothing you
need to worry about today while a full

70
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:18,790
body transplant may one day be possible.

71
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,100
We've got other problems
to solve on our way there.

72
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,060
Meeting the current demand for organ
donation is one step successfully.

73
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:29,110
Reconnecting the spine is another.
We'll keep moving in the right direction,

74
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,240
but if you want to jump ahead and
join us again on another, what if.
