1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,830
In today's interconnected world,

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,210
we're constantly barraged by conflicting
information on what we should and

3
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:15,810
shouldn't be eating, but if there's
one thing that we can all agree,

4
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:20,730
should definitely not be part of our
diets, hits nuclear waste in the movies,

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,170
ingesting radioactive materials like
uranium results in all sorts of crazy

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,360
hi-jinks like a painting superpowers,

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,020
but what would happen if
you ate it in real life?

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,260
How would it change your body and how
do we know that we're not eating it? Oh,

9
00:00:36,261 --> 00:00:39,480
ready.
This is what if,

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,600
and here's what would
happen if you ate uranium.

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,680
Uranium is a naturally
radioactive material.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,490
That was one of the main elements used to
make the nuclear bombs of World War II,

13
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,910
but you don't have to be a mad
scientist to be exposed to it.

14
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,010
The environmental protection agency says
that the average person eats up to 1.1

15
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:00,930
micrograms of uranium per day.

16
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:06,540
How was it getting into our food and how
much can we eat before it starts to do

17
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,530
damage?
I know what you're thinking.

18
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,970
I wash and inspect every piece of food I
put into my body and I've never noticed

19
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:18,770
any glowing green materials. Well,
it's not that simple. For one thing,

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,900
contrary to what pop culture tells you,

21
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,010
uranium and most other radioactive
materials do not actually glow,

22
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,510
and on top of that,

23
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,590
the uranium we eat isn't being secretly
sprinkled on top of our food by some

24
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:34,400
covert organization so you can
remove your tinfoil hats. For now.

25
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,530
Instead, the uranium wheat is coming from
within our food and it's getting there

26
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:40,364
naturally.

27
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,710
Uranium occurs naturally in soil rock
and water and it can be released into the

28
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:50,420
air through wind and water erosion
and volcanic eruptions in the air.

29
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,900
Uranium exists as dust that
falls under plants and land,

30
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,680
especially during heavy rainfalls.
Once on land,

31
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,120
the uranium seeps into the soil and sticks
to plant roots making root vegetables

32
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:04,520
like potatoes, radishes, and turnips.

33
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,660
It's primary means of getting
into our diets, but don't worry.

34
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,830
The amount of uranium we ingest on a
daily basis is not nearly enough to do any

35
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:14,870
damage.
Luckily for us,

36
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,490
almost 99% of the uranium that enters
our body through food also makes a quick

37
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:24,470
exit through our feces and 70% of the
remaining uranium that doesn't go through

38
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:29,030
the back door just leaves a bit later
through urination, a tiny amount.

39
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:32,360
We'll stay within your bones for a few
months or even years after eating it,

40
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,220
but won't have the same toxic effects
you'd experience if you inhaled it. Now,

41
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:39,520
just because we all survive
ingesting it every day,

42
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,980
it doesn't mean we should be eating big
chunks of it and starting the uranium

43
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:47,630
challenge online. Eating large doses
of uranium would be very dangerous.

44
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,060
If you consume 25 milligrams of it,

45
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,560
you'd immediately start to experience
kidney damage and anywhere past 50

46
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:57,800
milligrams could cause complete
kidney failure and even death.

47
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,950
If you did those meals,

48
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,330
you still wouldn't be in the clear because
long term radiation exposure can lead

49
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:08,950
to increased chances of cancer and
changes in brain chemistry. So yeah,

50
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,710
if someone plops a big chunk
of uranium on your plate,

51
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,520
you're probably best to pass and tell
them you've had your share for the day.

52
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,613
And who knows?

53
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,430
Maybe there are a whole bunch of other
strange materials secretly entering our

54
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:25,630
bodies on a daily basis,
but that's a topic for another.

55
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,823
What if

56
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,280
we should be eating big chunks of it and
starting the uranium challenge online

57
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,850
eating large doses of uranium
would be very dangerous.

58
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,310
If you consume 25 milligrams of it,

59
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,780
you'd immediately start to experience
kidney damage and anywhere past 50

60
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:52,050
milligrams could cause complete
kidney failure and even death.

61
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,180
If you did survive those meals,

62
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,560
you still wouldn't be in the clear because
long term radiation exposure can lead

63
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:03,180
to increase chances of cancer and
changes in brain chemistry. So yeah,

64
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,940
if someone plops a big chunk
of uranium on your plate,

65
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,750
you're probably best to pass and tell
them you've had your share for the day.

66
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,873
And who knows?

67
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,660
Maybe there were a whole bunch of other
strange materials secretly entering our

68
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:19,860
bodies on a daily basis,
but that's a topic for another.

69
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:20,820
What if.
