1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,100
Imagine if all the earth's oxygen
disappeared just for say five seconds.

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,970
Would we just hold our breath?
What would happen to the atmosphere?

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,260
What would happen and the environment.
This is what if,

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,250
and here's what would happen if the
world lost oxygen for just five seconds.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,420
Take a nice deep breath.
Feel how satisfying that is,

6
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,890
what you're breathing in his oxygen
and it takes up roughly 21% of our

7
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:35,500
atmosphere was 78% being nitrogen.

8
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,530
Although it's not the most
abundant gas in our atmosphere,

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,120
it is the most important. Without
oxygen, plants, animals, water,

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,890
and us humans wouldn't
be where we are today.

11
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,640
Five seconds may not sound like a
whole lot of time to be without oxygen.

12
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,640
Most of us can go at least 30
seconds without taking a breath,

13
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:54,280
so it would happen too fast
for your body to even notice.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,850
Your breathing would actually remain
normal, but as for everything else,

15
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,130
not so much
in just five seconds,

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,640
the earth would look completely different.
Without oxygen,

17
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,400
you can say goodbye to the Hoover dam,
the Pantheon Dome,

18
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,570
and anything else made of concrete.
These structures would instantly collapse.

19
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,950
Oxygen Acts as a special binding
agent to concrete. Without it,

20
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,980
concrete is just dust.
Speaking of buildings,

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,010
any untreated metal would
instantly be fused together.

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,790
This is because there's a
layer of oxidation on metals
that prevents them from

23
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:30,720
welding together. Without that layer,
metals would instantly bind to each other.

24
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,580
If you happen to be relaxing at the beach
at the time, expect to severe sunburn.

25
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,260
The ozone layer, our protection against
the sun's UV rays is made of oxygen.

26
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,980
Take away the oxygen and the earth
would become extremely dangerous.

27
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,220
There would be nothing protecting
us from the sun's UV rays.

28
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,550
In addition to a sunburn,
our inner ear would explode.

29
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,650
Losing oxygen means losing 21% of our
air pressure. A change in air pressure.

30
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,910
That drastic is equivalent to being at
sea level and dropping down 2000 meters

31
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,710
instantly. Our ears wouldn't have enough
time to adapt. Having a good time yet,

32
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,250
well, don't expect it to last long
without oxygen. There's no fire.

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,490
The combustion process in vehicles
wouldn't be able to occur.

34
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,240
Any mode of transport that isn't
electric will automatically fail.

35
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,260
Planes will fall from the sky and
millions of cars will be stopped in their

36
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:23,820
tracks. The Sky would be completely
dark before it hits the Earth.

37
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,871
Light from the sun,

38
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:28,770
bounces off multiple particles in the
air without oxygen in the atmosphere.

39
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,730
There are less things to bounce off
and the sky will appear dark. Oh yeah.

40
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,540
And while all this is happening, the
Earth's crust would completely crumble.

41
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,530
That's because Earth's crust
is made up of 45% oxygen.

42
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,520
The crust would crumble and continue
to crumble until there's nothing left

43
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,320
sending you and everyone on the planet
into a free fall. Sound like fun.

44
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,333
Probably not.

45
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,690
But luckily you can take a deep breath
of 21% oxygen knowing this will never

46
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:58,860
happen. For more things that are fun to
speculate on. Keep checking back with what

47
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,530
the sky would be completely dark before
it hits the Earth light from the sun,

48
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:20,430
bounces off multiple particles in the
air without oxygen in the atmosphere.

49
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,390
There are less things to bounce off
and the sky will appear dark. Oh yeah.

50
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,230
And while all this is happening, the
Earth's crust would completely crumble.

51
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,220
That's because Earth's crust
is made up of 45% oxygen.

52
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,180
The Cross would crumble and continue
to crumble until there's nothing left

53
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,980
sending you and everyone on the planet
into a free fall. Sound like fun.

54
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,023
Probably not,

55
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:46,350
but luckily you can take a deep breath
of 21% oxygen knowing this will never

56
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,960
happen for more things that
are fun to speculate on.

57
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,910
Keep checking back with what if.
