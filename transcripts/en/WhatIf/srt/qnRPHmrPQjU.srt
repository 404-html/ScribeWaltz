1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,180
Mm.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,980
What if a dramatic surge of climate change
melted all the earth's ice overnight?

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,640
Would you wake up to find
yourself drowning underwater?

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,340
Would most of your country be submerged?

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,200
How would you enjoy slowly
choking to death? This is what if,

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:26,470
and here's what would happen if all the
world's ice melted ever watched an ice

7
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:29,150
cube melt and a glass of water
that's filled to the brim.

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,110
How does it change the water level?
The truth is it doesn't.

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,600
Above or below the waterline,

10
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,110
a melted ice cube replaces
exactly the same volume of water.

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,300
Now let's add salt to the mix.
In the case of a one cubic inch ice cube,

12
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,860
the water level in the glass
will rise by 0.03 cubic inches.

13
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,500
That rise is displaced saltwater.

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,210
It's an increase in volume of nearly
3% fairly small amount, isn't it?

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,900
But what if you apply this to the
glaciers and floating sea ice?

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,150
5.8 million square miles of
our planet is covered with ice.

17
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,190
If all of it were to melt overnight,

18
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,210
the global sea level would
rise approximately 230 feet.

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,970
That's enough to cover
London's tower bridge.

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,240
All seven continents would
be partially underwater.

21
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,820
There'd be no Miami and no London.

22
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,830
The coast of Australia would be washed
out together with 80% of its residents,

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,890
so would Venice and the Netherlands.

24
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,860
Things wouldn't be that bad for Africa,

25
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,580
but with the extreme heat waves that
follow most of the continent would be

26
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:38,990
uninhabitable. Think floods
would wash out humanity entirely.

27
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,300
Well, not all of it, but whoever's left,
we'll have plenty of dangers to deal with.

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,050
All that melted ice. Nice would
release carbon dioxide into the air.

29
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,620
Ice needs high co two concentrations
to melt in the first place.

30
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,130
Given that oxygen content in the
atmosphere would remain the same,

31
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,220
you would slowly start to
choke from breathing the air.

32
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,940
You'd have very little time
to climatize to the new world.

33
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,830
Ocean currents would change
their direction affecting
sea life with no time to

34
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:08,660
evolve to such extreme changes.

35
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,930
Sea creatures and polar animals
would face massive extinction.

36
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,460
The ones still alive would have to leave
their homes and find a better place to

37
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:20,600
live. This would result in a
decrease of human food supply.

38
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,260
A change in secret. It would also
mean dramatic weather changes.

39
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,480
Heavy rains would hit the desert,

40
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,210
and areas with significant
rainfall would dry out.

41
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,930
This would devastate agriculture
and cause a global famine.

42
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,120
Wind patterns will change too with
no ice to reflect the sun's rays.

43
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,140
The Sun would draw more moisture from the
oceans, making more clouds in the sky.

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,670
The clouds would gather first near the
mountain areas and eventually rainfall

45
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:50,870
would flood them. Oceanic hurricanes
would occur more often causing it,

46
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,010
even more floods.

47
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,200
Even the smallest earthquake off the coast
could devastate nearby regions with a

48
00:02:57,201 --> 00:02:58,280
massive tsunami.

49
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,370
All of this would force a global migration
that governments would not be able to

50
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:06,430
deal with. The world is,
we know it would collapse.

51
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,620
Luckily all the ice camp melt overnight,
but it is melting.

52
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,360
Even the oldest ice corn that has been
storing information about the earth's

53
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,730
climate for one and a half million years,

54
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,830
if we keep adding fuel to the
climate change fire in 5,000 years,

55
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:25,330
the earth will be ice free.

56
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:37,120
Okay.
