1
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,593
Up.

2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,510
Sometimes we wish we never had to
deal with this morning struggle,

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,730
but what if you just never went to bed?

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,390
What if you figured out how to
keep yourself awake forever?

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,520
How long could the sleepless forever last?

6
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,030
Could you even be productive while
they were charging every night?

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,980
When would your friends start telling
you to get some rest and what exactly

8
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:34,030
would happen to your boss?

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,680
This is what if and here's what
would happen if you stopped sleeping.

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,140
How often have you needed just a few
more hours to finish off a project?

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,510
Get ready for a date
or enjoy your day off?

12
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,650
If you took sleep out
of your daily routine,

13
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,730
you'd have all 24 hours in the day to
do everything he never had time for.

14
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,520
What's a few yards and some
minor tiredness. If in men,

15
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:00,910
you never have to waste any more
time lying in bed for no good reason.

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,810
Turns out there are plenty
of good reasons to sleep.

17
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,830
The average person spends one
third of their life lying in bed.

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,760
I shut snoring away.
Sounds like a waste of valuable time,

19
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,830
but not for your body. While you sleep,
your body releases hormones and repairs,

20
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:22,360
tissues, replacing your old cells with
new ones. If you worked out that day,

21
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,120
you need a good sleep to let your
muscles grow and your fat burn.

22
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,060
So what happens if you don't sleep?
Not much at first, after just 24 hours,

23
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,270
you'd feel completely fine. In
fact, you'd feel better than fine.

24
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,470
That's because sleeplessness stimulates
the mesolimbic pathway in your brain.

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,460
This pathway would release dopamine and
you'd feel happy and full of energy,

26
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,690
but don't be fooled by all that
happiness is not going to last long.

27
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,160
Soon after reaching the 24 hour mark,
all your reactions would slow down.

28
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,150
Your brain would start to forget
what you were doing outwardly.

29
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:59,890
You'd appear to be drunk. Wait
where? Where are we right now?

30
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:02,410
What about two days without sleep?
At that point,

31
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,970
your body would start shutting down.

32
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,780
It would stop metabolizing
glucose properly leaving
you with no energy supply.

33
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,030
You'd start looking very pale. Your eyes
would turn red and then more bad news,

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,420
your wrinkles,
it would become more visible on day three.

35
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,890
That's when the real fun begins.
Hallucinations starved of rem sleep.

36
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,920
Your brain would bring all your dreams
and nightmares to life at around the 72

37
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:31,440
hour mark, you start breaking down
your own protein, your muscles.

38
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,980
So say goodbye to all that muscle mass
you've worked so hard to build up.

39
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,390
Your body would keep using up all the
energy sources that could find glucose,

40
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:44,040
leftovers, your muscles, fat
tissue. After about two weeks,

41
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,490
your immune system would be so weak.
You could die from the common flu.

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,730
Eventually,
three weeks after your last sleep,

43
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,650
you'd probably die of a heart attack.

44
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,470
If you've got a little extra
muscle or fat on your body,

45
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,360
you could stay alive just a bit longer.

46
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,070
But we don't recommend anyone
try this at home anyway.

47
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,010
So grab yourself a
pillow and take a siesta.

48
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,080
If it seems like you're always tired,

49
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,380
make sure you're getting the prescribed
six to eight hours of sleep per night.
