1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,130
How do you distinguish between
past, present, and future?

2
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,870
Is there really an order to time?
Does it only move forward?

3
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,370
Does it move in any direction at all?
Stop the clock,

4
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,430
abandoned all assumptions
and try to stay calm.

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,500
This mind blowing experiment will only
take a few minutes, whatever that means.

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,570
This is what if,
and here's how time could be an illusion.

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,700
In 1915 Albert Einstein published
his general theory of relativity,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,350
which changed changes and will
change the way we perceive time.

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,420
In this groundbreaking theory,

10
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,680
he proposed that the laws of physics
are the same for all non-accelerated

11
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:52,810
observers. This basically explains why if
you were to watch a car drive past you,

12
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,890
you would interpret the car's passengers
as moving at the same speed as the car.

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,150
Since their speed is relative to your
position as an observer on still ground.

14
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,520
Meanwhile,
inside the car,

15
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:08,080
the passengers feel like
stationary objects since
their motion matches the car's

16
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:10,090
motion relative to the outside world,

17
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,740
but while Einstein's theory of relative
motion could be applied to all objects

18
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:19,210
in the universe, he also realized that
one exception to relativity was light.

19
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,480
Light always moves at a constant speed.

20
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:27,760
These two principles led Einstein to
conceive of a link between time and space,

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,650
also known as spacetime.

22
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,630
And one of its tricky implications is
that the perception of how time passes can

23
00:01:34,631 --> 00:01:38,860
be different between two observers
depending on how much faster one is moving

24
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,760
compared to the other.

25
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,920
So if it's possible for two observers to
have to accurate perspectives of time's

26
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:47,740
passing, but for those
perspectives to be different,

27
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,940
who's clock is right and who's is wrong?
Oddly enough,

28
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:56,380
they're both right after all the fact
that different times zones exist are

29
00:01:56,381 --> 00:02:00,250
enough proof that your watch and someone's
watching across the world will read

30
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:02,440
different times every second of the day.

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,360
We're inclined to think of the passing
of time as objective or universal since

32
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:11,290
humans of all more or less agreed on the
same system to organize our busy lives

33
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,800
and to be on the same page with our
neighbors either next door or a few

34
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,634
countries over.

35
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,930
But while time is a convenient tool
for keeping track of the past, present,

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,470
and future, the true nature
of time is trickier to grasp.

37
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,050
Once you realize that the past,
present,

38
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:31,000
and future could all exist at once.
When you look up at the sky,

39
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,050
you might be able to point out
Proxima Centauri after the sun.

40
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,640
Proxima Centauri is the closest star
to earth and it's only about four light

41
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:44,470
years away, so the light you see now
is actually four years old in our time.

42
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,690
If Proxima Centauri exploded, we would
know about it until four years later.

43
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,860
That's because the speed of light is
constant no matter where you are in the

44
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:57,730
universe. Another thing you need
to know is the faster you move,

45
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,200
the slower time does.

46
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,790
This explains how astronaut Scott Kelly
spent a year in space and came back to

47
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:08,770
earth 13 milliseconds younger than
his twin. Now with these two examples,

48
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,160
let's put an astronaut on a planet
that's four light years away.

49
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,030
That means his present is
unfolding four years ahead of you.

50
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,110
Anything you do now on earth
is already in his past,

51
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,990
put simply the past,
present,

52
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,630
and future all exist at once.

53
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,690
Now before you have an existential crisis,

54
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,470
there's a theory that might make living
in the past, present, and future.

55
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:36,730
All at once, a little easier. It's
called moving spotlight theory,

56
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,510
and it basically argues that there
is only one absolute present,

57
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,230
which changes moment by moment as
if the spotlight is moving over it.

58
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,030
So with that information,

59
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,990
you can begin to see how the passage
of time might be an illusion.

60
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,730
There's no single objective, past,
objective, present, or objective future.

61
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,800
The illusion of time is crafted by our
memories and our experiences and our

62
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:04,420
upcoming plans, which helped us organize
our life into a neat sequence of events.

63
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,990
But depending on where you
are or how fast you're moving,

64
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,990
that sequence will be very,
very different.

65
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,840
So whether you're new age or nostalgic,
or if you just prefer the present moment,

66
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,350
don't worry, there's a place for
you somewhere in the universe.

67
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,370
It might take you a hundreds of years to
get there, but if you move fast enough,

68
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,750
you'll get there in no time.
