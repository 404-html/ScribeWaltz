1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,510
They said humans to walk on the moon
flew by every single planet in our solar

2
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:13,230
system and delivered the first residents
to the international space station.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,470
What else could NASA have done
if it had a bigger budget,

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,200
say the budget of the u s military,

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,380
how close would we be to colonizing Mars?

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,690
Would you be spending
your vacation on the moon?

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,600
What about visiting other solar systems?

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,350
This is what f and here's what would
happen if NASA had the u s military budget

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,860
in 1969 NASA spent over $25 billion or
about 170 billion in today's money so

10
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,470
that the whole world could see this.

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,970
But once a small step for man
became one giant leap for mankind,

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,980
the budget of the American led space
agency started shrinking. Today,

13
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,690
NASA gets less than $20 billion annually
to explore and colonize what's out

14
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:01,020
there.
Is that enough for humanities ambitions?

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,200
Not if you plan on buying a
piece of land on the moon.

16
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,530
What if due to a printing
error in the federal budget,

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,550
all the money destined for the u s
military went to the space agency instead,

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,140
what would $600 billion pay for?

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,060
Here's the International Space Station,

20
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,950
the largest artificial satellite that's
ever orbited earth over 200 people have

21
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:27,120
lived and worked here since it launched
in 1998 but it may be defended as of

22
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:32,010
2024 and then no one's going to set
foot on it with another hundred billion

23
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:32,070
dollars.

24
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,540
NASA could afford to keep
doing the research on the
ISS for at least another 20

25
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,150
years. Uh, military size
budget would cover that.

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,810
Not only would it allow the space
station to remain up and running,

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,310
but it would also allow them to send more
astronauts and there'd still be enough

28
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:48,500
money leftover for NASA.

29
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,210
Biggest ongoing projects developing the
space launch system that would carry us

30
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:55,880
to the moon and deep space,
not a problem.

31
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,110
And then there's Mars
together with space X.

32
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,200
Nasa could restore the UNHCR ood red
dragon mission that would mark the

33
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:04,940
beginning of Mars colonization.

34
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,660
Sending the first humans to Mars would
cost NASA around $450 billion with $600

35
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,830
billion of annual funding accrued mission
to the Red Planet would become NASA as

36
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:20,240
next Apollo. Very quickly, we
build a human colony on the moon,

37
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,820
turning it into a base for
our trips into deep space.

38
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,050
It would so serve as a
blueprint for Mars colonization.

39
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,430
We'd move up the launch date on the
Europa Clipper, a mission to Jupiter,

40
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:34,390
smallest moon in search of signs of
alien life in the oceans of liquid water

41
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:35,650
beneath its icy shell.

42
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,700
Maybe Europa would become our next
destination for the crude missions.

43
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,720
Just imagine regular commercial space
flight unscrewed missions to other solar

44
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:47,854
systems,

45
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,460
increasing biological and physiological
studies to figure out how humans can

46
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:55,060
survive away from Earth.
Wouldn't that be awesome?

47
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,090
What else do you think we can
achieve with a military budget?
