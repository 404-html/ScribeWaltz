1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,750
The earth sits comfortably in its orbit,
tilted on its access at 23 degrees,

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,650
knock the planet over, and it
wouldn't be the earth as you know it.

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,050
How can a slight change in its actual
tilt make the planet uninhabitable?

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,450
This is what if,

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,830
and here's what would happen if the
earth's axis was tilted by 90 degrees.

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,480
Only two planets in the solar
system lie on their sides,

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,020
Uranus and the Dorf Planet Pluto.
Now,

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,330
if something took the earth off its stand,

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,590
the blue planet would have no chance
of developing any complex life on its

10
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:43,110
surface.
But let's start at the beginning.

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,870
This actual till or obliquity is what
drives the seasons here on earth.

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,810
Before the collision
that created the moon,

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,360
the Earth's axis was
slowly wobbling around,

14
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,970
somewhere between zero and 85 degrees.

15
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,180
Then our newly for moon stabilized it.

16
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,870
But if that collision
happened at a different time,

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,870
things would have turned out
very different here on earth.

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,240
It would be a strange new world.
As the earth made its way through orbit,

19
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,150
it's poles would be pointing
straight towards the Sun.

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,960
One hemisphere would be shrouded in
darkness for six months straight,

21
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,620
while the other would be getting
cooked by the blazing sunlight.

22
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,890
One day on earth would last a whole year

23
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,950
at the North Pole.

24
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,750
The daytime temperatures would rise
to a broiling 50 degrees a day.

25
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:38,160
At the South Pole would be even worse
because the South Pole would be located

26
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,470
away from climate
controlling ocean currents.

27
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,560
It would heat up to an
almost boiling 80 degrees.

28
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,570
The polls would soak up so much heat from
the sun that they wouldn't even freeze

29
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:50,220
during the six month long night.

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,280
You wouldn't recognize the steaming
equatorial tropics with a 90 degree axial

31
00:01:56,281 --> 00:02:00,510
tilt. Part of the equator would
stay in Cayston ice all year round.

32
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,140
At some point in this earth's existence,

33
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,500
our continents would get clumped
together around one of the Poles.

34
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,100
Inland temperatures in the
daytime would get truly hellish.

35
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,170
Reaching the boiling temperature of
water clouds could help the situation and

36
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,410
not let all the water vapor off
the planet, but you wouldn't know.

37
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,800
You wouldn't stick around that
long in this scorching heat.

38
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,730
The best case scenario with see just
a few kinds of bacteria survive.

39
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,720
Those bacteria might evolve
into more complex lifeforms,

40
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,320
but they wouldn't be anywhere close
to how complex we turned out to be.

41
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,020
The reason would be a lack of oxygen.

42
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,920
Green plants would be having a hard
time surviving during the six months of

43
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:45,450
complete darkness. They dropped their
seeds at nightfall to grow after sunrise,

44
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,960
but in these conditions, would they
even have evolved in the first place?

45
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,270
Interestingly enough,

46
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,690
if the earth was 60 million
kilometers further away from the sun,

47
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,900
a 90 degree axial tilt wouldn't be so bad.

48
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,890
The temperatures at the polls would never
raise above 46 degrees during the day.

49
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,950
The coldest it would get at
night would be three degrees.

50
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,610
The only place covered with ice
would be the highest mountains.

51
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,070
So you see simply orbiting a star in
the habitable zone doesn't mean that a

52
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:17,530
planet is actually capable
of sustaining life.

53
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,140
We're the lucky ones living here on earth.

54
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,400
Maybe one day we'll discover another
exoplanet just like our home,

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,060
but that's a story for another.
What if.
