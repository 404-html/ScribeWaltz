1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,190
What makes the perfect human immaculate
features indomitable intelligence in

2
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:15,180
comparable wit or irresistible charm.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,340
How about all of the above?
What if you could modify your genes?

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,530
What if everyone could?
What are the consequences of being better?

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,500
This is what if,

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,520
and here's what would happen
if genetically modified
people became the norm.

7
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,980
Many bacteria are able to combat viral
infection with a defense system called

8
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:40,230
Crispr CRISPR records,

9
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:44,940
viral DNA that a bacteria has been
exposed to and enables a protein complex

10
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:49,500
called cas nine to basically search
for the viral DNA and destroy it.

11
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,340
Enter Dr Jennifer Doudna who started
research and Crispr in 2005 by 2012 she

12
00:00:56,941 --> 00:01:01,941
cofounded CRISPR cas nine a life changing
technology that allows humans to edit

13
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:07,341
genes as more research on CRISPR
comes forward so to new possibilities.

14
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,120
Could we cure genetic diseases?
Could we cut out cancer?

15
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,150
Could I finally get the Blue Eyes?
I've always wanted,

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,780
but what happens when gene editing goes
too far for genetically modified people

17
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:25,290
to become the norm? Gene editing
wouldn't only have to be legal.

18
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,420
It would have to be relatively affordable.

19
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,200
Some countries might even choose to
subsidize it for life saving medical

20
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:33,120
procedures.
After all,

21
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,920
technology like CRISPR cas nine may be
able to be used to prevent any genetic

22
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:40,170
disease or disability we know of today,

23
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,820
the genes responsible for Huntington's
disease or cystic fibrosis can be wiped

24
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:48,750
out and prevent it from being passed on.
Economics aside,

25
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,260
every newborn could have the chance
to live a normal, healthy life.

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,020
Imagine creating a super race of people.

27
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,890
If everyone on the planet was genetically
engineered to be the strongest version

28
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:02,280
of themselves, would we still have
competitions like the Olympics?

29
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,400
If we could modify the
intelligence of everyone on earth,

30
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,070
could we solve all of
humanity's greatest challenges?

31
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,210
Could it finally be your turn
to be Miss Universe or the hulk,

32
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,840
but as Crispr cas nine really a cure
all or a catch 22 when you use CRISPR to

33
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:23,400
edit out unwanted jeans, you destroy
thousands of DNA bases in one go.

34
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,800
Yes,
CRISPR is pretty precise,

35
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,640
but there's still a risk that you could
silence some genes that are meant to be

36
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:32,730
active and activate genes
that are meant to be dormant.

37
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,960
What researchers are finding is that
in trying to save yourself through gene

38
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:40,800
editing, you might just cut
out a key anticancer mechanism.

39
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,440
Not only does CRISPR pose a cancer risk,
but in reprogramming or rearranging DNA,

40
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,320
we might even end up
creating new diseases.

41
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,670
Whether it's a new procedure or routine
operation or an over the counter cold

42
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:54,180
pill.

43
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,810
We tend to accept the risk of side effects
or complications if it means getting

44
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,310
better.
But with gene editing,

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,580
don't you think that getting
better might get a bit weird?

46
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,960
What happens when parents start to
choose their kid's height, eye color,

47
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,200
hair color, skin, pigment, or gender?

48
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,270
What happens when those with financial
means can buy better cures that are

49
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:19,870
features and ultimately better futures?
Well,

50
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,080
that future if possible,
is very far away.

51
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,970
CRISPR technology is still in its
infancy and our understanding of genes is

52
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:32,200
still too limited to start choosing
height and hair color. It will eye color,

53
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,490
hair color,
height,

54
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:36,970
and other physical features are
associated with a combination of genes,

55
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:40,810
not just one, but forget science
for a moment. Ask Yourself,

56
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:41,770
which is more important,

57
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,540
pure cold perfection or true
emotional human connection.

58
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,680
It might not be perfect,
but it certainly can't be hacked.
