1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,900
Food for type pills three times a day.
All your nutrients,

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,270
all your favorite flavors,

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,390
feel like having lobster for breakfast
done trying to like mushrooms,

4
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:16,850
but you can't stand the texture.
Problem solved.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,860
Meal replacement pills are the future.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,380
At least that's what people have
been saying for the past century.

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,820
So what if we got them now? How would they
affect our diet? Would we be healthier?

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,600
Could they solve world hunger?
Will we see them in our lifetime?

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,310
This is what if,

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,430
and here's what would happen if
you could get your meals in a pill.

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,040
Mill pills began as a feminist
ideal leading up to the
1893 Chicago world's fair.

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,190
The American Press Association asked
writers to predict the world of 1993 so

13
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:49,610
American suffragette Mary Elizabeth lease
described a world of synthetic food,

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,900
freeing women from kitchen work and
other domestic chores in the decades that

15
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:57,610
followed science fiction,
novelists, playwrights, filmmakers,

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,430
and others from different disciplines
all experimented with the idea of meal

17
00:01:01,431 --> 00:01:05,720
replacement pills. The best we've
come up with so far is soylent.

18
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,100
Soylent is a thick and creamy concoction
that contains all the fat, carbs,

19
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,600
proteins, vitamins, and minerals you need
in a day. So if we can drink our meals,

20
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,740
why can't we pop them?

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,940
It wouldn't be hard to replace a portion
of your diet with nutrient pills.

22
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,690
After all,

23
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,140
you can pick up every essential vitamin
in pill form at your local grocery store

24
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:26,150
or pharmacy.
In doing so,

25
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,580
you might think you're pretty
nutritious and intelligent,

26
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:32,570
but you wouldn't look at, you'd
grow irritable, depressed, tired,

27
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,620
and you'd eventually die of starvation
because it's not just nutrients we need

28
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:38,750
to survive.
Calories are crucial.

29
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,830
The average adult needs 2000
calories per day to survive.

30
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,930
What does that look like? Here's the
breakdown for breakfast. Eat two eggs,

31
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,300
a slice of bread,
two tablespoons of peanut butter,

32
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:54,530
and a glass of juice for lunch. How
about a Turkey Sandwich? Carrots and dip,

33
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,860
a chocolate chip cookie and a
glass of milk. And then for dinner,

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,130
you could grow up some salmon, add a
baked potato, some steamed Broccoli,

35
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,850
and a cup of ice cream for dessert.
And if you need a snack during the day,

36
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,090
grab an apple and a Granola bar
and you've hit 2000 calories.

37
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,770
So how do you fit all that into
one pill? You don't. You can't.

38
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,920
Even if fat is the most
concentrated source of calories,

39
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,960
you can't fit enough of
it into a single pill.

40
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,900
But if you were set on
subsisting on a pill only diet,

41
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,060
then you'd have to eat 450 calorie pills
a day plus other vitamins to get your

42
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:28,970
needed nutrients.
That's sort of how soylent was invented.

43
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,390
Living in San Francisco with high
rent and a high grocery bill.

44
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,910
Rob Rhinehart thought to
economize through chemistry.

45
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,160
He found out what the
body needed to survive,

46
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,970
ordered the raw ingredients mostly in
powdered form, tossed them in a blender,

47
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,120
added water and mixed up
a healthy hardy cocktail.

48
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,050
Reinhardt's grocery bill went from
$470 a month down to $50 with a meal

49
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:51,374
replacement pill.

50
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,220
We could imagine a much more efficient
world and one with greater food security

51
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,060
since future meals would be easier and
cheaper to manufacture and send around

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,913
the world.

53
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,550
The effects of climate change today
are beginning to limit what we can grow

54
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,410
mangoes and Avocados, for example, are
among the fruits that are in decline.

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,280
While farms around the world are seeing
fewer yields due to global warming and

56
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:16,030
increased drought, we may never get
it in one pill, but it's possible,

57
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,510
if not likely, that full meal
replacements are the way of the future.

58
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,420
And if you're afraid that all your
favorite flavors would disappear,

59
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:24,250
if all your food came in a pill,
don't be.

60
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,450
Researchers at the Institute of Food
Research and Nora England recently found a

61
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:32,590
way to put multiple flavors into a single
capsule and have them released one at

62
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:36,460
a time at different intervals. So
what's the future of food? Fast,

63
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,220
frugal and flavorful won't have fatigue.
