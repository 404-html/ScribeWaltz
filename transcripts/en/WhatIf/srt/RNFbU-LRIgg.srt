1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,460
What if we found a way to drain all the
earth's oceans through some mysterious

2
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:10,500
portal at the bottom
of the Mariana trench?

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,920
How long would it take
years, centuries, millennia?

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,760
Would there be any life left on
earth when the pumping was over?

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,130
What if it happened overnight?
This is what if,

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,340
and here's what would happen if
we drained all the world's oceans.

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,920
Ocean water makes up 70% of the earth's
surface. How much liquid is that?

8
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:39,480
Exactly? Well, if you could put all that
water into Olympic size swimming pools,

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,370
you'd need this many of them.

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,320
Even if we opened a portal about
the size of a basketball court,

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,010
it would take us hundreds of thousands
of years to drain the oceans.

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,640
They hold over a billion
cubic kilometers of water.

13
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,440
But what if we had a pump powerful enough
to drain all the oceans in a minute?

14
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,660
What would happen then? Sure
enough, swimmers, sailors,

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,830
cruise passengers,

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,820
everyone out on the ocean would feel
the effects quickly within a second.

17
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,090
Boaters and swimmers in shallow
water would crash onto the bottom.

18
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,770
They'd get away with a few broken bones.
Deep Ocean ships wouldn't be so lucky.

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,510
A titanic sized liner would hit the
bottom in 30 seconds and smash into tiny

20
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:22,344
pieces.

21
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,910
The same thing would happen to just about
every large ship on the ocean within

22
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:31,650
the first minute. What about all the sea
creatures? You already know the answer.

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,760
It would literally be raining fish.
Since all the whales, dolphins,

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,380
and other big aquatic animals,

25
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:40,620
curiously exploring the surface
would be falling to the ocean floor.

26
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,230
As for those already near the bottom,

27
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,380
they'd be lucky not to get sucked
down the drain along with the water.

28
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,710
But what comes next is where
the real trouble begins.

29
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,020
Our oceans have to life supporting roles.
First,

30
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,320
they regulate global temperatures
by absorbing energy from the sun.

31
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,880
They push warm tropical waters north and
south and circulate Coldwater's back to

32
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:07,320
the equator. This way, no place on
earth gets too hot or way too cold.

33
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,330
Global climate control.

34
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,760
Second Oceans feed the water
cycle evaporating into the
clouds and reigning back

35
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:17,880
to Earth.
The moment the oceans disappeared,

36
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,980
the earth would turn into a vast desert.

37
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,140
Go ahead and throw away your
umbrella since it's never
going to rain again. Wait,

38
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,270
what about all the lakes and rivers?
Can we get by with those? Well,

39
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,780
without oceans,
the world loses 97% of its water.

40
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,740
The small amount of liquid left would
not be enough to sustain the water cycle.

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,900
The pools of drinkable
water would evaporate pretty
fast. In a matter of days,

42
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,110
people and most animals with die from
dehydration plants would have a few weeks

43
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:51,630
before they started decaying in
the dry air. Within a few months,

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,700
forests would begin massive die offs
and all this dry dead vegetation would

45
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:59,650
eventually ignite.
In a of years,

46
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:02,080
most of the world's forests
would be burned out.

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,650
As these huge bonfires
sparked all across the planet,

48
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,980
the atmosphere would become less and less
oxygenated if there were still humans

49
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:11,824
at this time,

50
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,310
the unbreathable air and scorching
temperature would wipe us out for good.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,390
All in all the earth would
end up just like Venus cooked,

52
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,440
so why don't I take a few days off and
enjoy a little seaside vacation while you

53
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:27,340
can?
Isn't it time to explore how your,

54
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,600
what if scenario would turn out.
