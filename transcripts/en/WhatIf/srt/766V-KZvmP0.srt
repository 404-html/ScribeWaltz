1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,490
What if humans had gills and could
breathe underwater just like fish?

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,320
How cool would it be to swim alongside
dolphins and sea turtles for as long as

3
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:16,320
you want? What? Breathing under water,

4
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:18,900
meaning we could finally
explore all of earth's waters.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,370
Would we give up this terrestrial life
and move to the bottom of the sea?

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,450
Maybe we'd see how polluted our
oceans are and cleaned them up.

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,390
This is what if, and here's what would
happen if we could breathe underwater.

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,830
Humans for sure aren't
qualified for aquatic living.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,590
How long can you hold your breath?
Well,

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,620
if you're not a professional free diver
and you don't belong to the Badjao

11
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:46,290
people who can stay under
water for up to 13 minutes,

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,110
then you can probably only hold
your breath around two minutes.

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,340
But with no practice, it's likely you'd
want to give up after just 30 seconds.

14
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,550
If only we could take a
deep breath underwater.

15
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,970
Our lives would never be the same or
would they turns out just having the

16
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:05,400
ability to pull oxygen out of the water
wouldn't be enough to turn you into a

17
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:09,090
fulltime aquatic resident. Why? Well,

18
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,090
if you move to the deep ocean,
you'd suffer from hypothermia.

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,690
That's when your body temperature
falls below 35 degrees.

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,650
Your heart and your nervous
system malfunction and your
organs are on their way

21
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:24,300
to complete failure. You couldn't survive
in cold water longer than 90 minutes,

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,580
but what if he didn't go that deep? Could
you settle down near the surface? Well,

23
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,460
when we set, our bodies aren't quite
suitable for living underwater.

24
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,930
We didn't mean just breathing.

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,100
Not only do we not have enough body hair
or fat to warm us up and cold water and

26
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:41,910
prevent hypothermia, but we
also lack flippers. Of course,

27
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:44,130
he can buy a pair of these,
but let's be honest,

28
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,880
our limbs aren't too efficient
when it comes to swimming. Also,

29
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,830
our eyes aren't adapted to see underwater,

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,220
but if you weren't near the coral reefs,
there wouldn't be much to see anyway.

31
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,340
Expect 24 hours of darkness,
partly money.

32
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,330
You need to learn sign language as
you wouldn't be able to say a thing.

33
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,580
There would be nothing to
make your vocal cords work,

34
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,020
not after your lungs filled up with
water and forget about text messaging.

35
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,230
In fact, forget about any electronics
that aren't water resistant.

36
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,590
If you've ever dropped your phone in a
pool, you know that it just won't work.

37
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,170
And just imagine having your
dinner served under water.

38
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,600
Ever tried eating pasta
at the bottom of the sea.

39
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,710
Gil's wouldn't let us move under water,
but they help us in many other ways.

40
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,110
Underwater construction
would be much safer.

41
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,780
Falling off a skyscraper in
the ocean wouldn't kill you.

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,130
We might switch to a new public
transportation system, underwater subway.

43
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,860
The rushing waters would
take you to your destination.

44
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,210
Just don't forget your neoprene jumpsuit
to keep you warm on these underwater

45
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:42,540
commutes. We'd see how polluted
our oceans are. Sooner or later,

46
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,990
we'd start cleaning up all the plastic
we've been throwing in the oceans and all

47
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:47,310
the chemicals we've dumped in there.

48
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,700
We'd start growing a lot
of salt tolerant crops.

49
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,060
Keenwah beats CKL to feed ourselves and
other plants like widgeon grass to feed

50
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:59,470
fish and shrimp.
So Gill's would in fact change our lives.

51
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,230
Maybe one day with the
magic of bioengineering,

52
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,870
we'll be able to take that
deep breath deep underwater.
