1
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,270
What are the ingredients and
for an industrial revolution,

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,590
new energy sources at a dash of cutting
edge communications technology and top

3
00:00:15,111 --> 00:00:17,660
it all off with an emerging
mode of transportation.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,840
When our society goes through
an industrial revolution,

5
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,770
we spur economic growth and completely
changed the world we live in.

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,290
We've seen the effects of two already.

7
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,560
So how would things
change if we had a third?

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,750
This is what f and here's what would
happen if there was a third industrial

9
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:39,200
revolution.
According to economist Jeremy Rifkin,

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,650
we're already on the cusp of
a third industrial revolution,

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,220
a convergence of the internet,
renewable energy,

12
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,390
and automated transportation.
If we embrace this transformation,

13
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:55,570
it could decentralize nearly every
industry on earth giving more power to the

14
00:00:55,641 --> 00:01:00,110
people. How would this be an important
weapon against climate change?

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,140
How long can a civilization exist
surviving on a finite resource like fossil

16
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:10,620
fuels? Well, we might find
out sooner than we'd like.

17
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,150
According to Rifkin,

18
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,950
our current economic system and our
planet will eventually expire if we don't

19
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:21,480
move away from a carbon based
world. So how do we do that? Well,

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,010
it's already started and it was all
triggered by our embrace of the worldwide

21
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:28,410
web before the Internet.

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,220
The costs to spread your knowledge
and information was pretty expensive.

23
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,630
For example, let's say you wanted to
share your ideas through a newspaper.

24
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,410
Not only would you have to worry about
the initial cost of setting up shop,

25
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,790
but you'd also have to spend
money on every single copy
you made and distributed.

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,140
Nowadays after the initial
cost of accessing the internet,

27
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,220
you can produce unlimited copies of your
ideas and get them out to millions of

28
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:55,170
people without any further spending.

29
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:00,990
This phenomenon is known as zero marginal
cost and it could be the foundation of

30
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:04,410
the third industrial
revolution with the Internet.

31
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,790
Hundreds of millions of people are
producing and sharing music videos,

32
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,980
news blogs and ebooks essentially for
free bypassing the capitalist market

33
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,853
altogether.

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,660
We don't have to rely on a couple of
giant corporations to feed us all our

35
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:23,661
information and now that phenomenon is
expanding from the virtual world to the

36
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:27,120
physical world of goods and services.
For instance,

37
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,930
let's say you and a bunch of neighbors
want to start your own power grid based

38
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,970
on renewable energy.
Well,

39
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,410
with today's technology you can do that
and then you could even use that grid to

40
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:40,380
power driverless cars to run
a local ride share program.

41
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,180
You'd be creating a sustainable economic
system that would essentially cost you

42
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:46,710
nothing after the initial setup.

43
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,640
If Society embraces the
possibilities of using the internet,

44
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,970
renewable energy and automatic
transportation together,

45
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,400
it could restructure our economy.

46
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,120
Traditional corporations
would be disrupted and the
power would be returned to

47
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:02,260
the local communities,

48
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,790
will also be able to collect a lot more
information about the world around us,

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,030
allowing our economy to
operate at top efficiency.

50
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,180
As we continue to play sensors
on just about everything,

51
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,510
we'll be able to track things like
the flows of natural resources,

52
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,070
traffic and shipments.

53
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,680
All this available data will allow us
to increase productivity and decrease

54
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:26,590
waste and our ecological
footprints dramatically.

55
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,100
So maybe our future's
not so bleak after all,

56
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,420
or maybe all this global con activity.

57
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,170
We'll just open us up to a
whole new type of threat,

58
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,830
but that's a topic for another.
What if.
