1
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,820
What if instead of shining brightly
for another 5 billion years,

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,150
the only star in our solar system turned
into a dark and cold remnant of black

3
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:15,234
dwarf.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,990
How long would the earth last without
all the heat and light it gets from the

5
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:23,010
sun? And how would the sun
going dark change the universe.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,140
This is what if,

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,130
and here's what would happen if
our son turned into a black dwarf.

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,140
All stars have an expiration date.
They don't just fade to black.

9
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:38,730
Though stars like our sun don't have
enough mass to become a neutron star.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,380
They end up expanding to red giants and
then shedding their outer layers until

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,580
only their core remains.
That's when they become white dwarfs.

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,910
White dwarfs don't have fusion
reactions fueling them up.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,320
They gradually cooled down until
one day they become black dwarfs.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,630
The thing is there are no black
dwarfs anywhere in the universe.

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,730
Black dwarves just having formed.
Yet you see,

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,070
white dwarfs may not produce any energy,

17
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,110
but they still have enough of it left to
keep them shining faintly for hundreds

18
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:13,943
of billions of years.

19
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,270
Given that the universe is
only 13.8 billion years old.

20
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,950
Even the oldest white dwarfs are still
glowing at temperatures of a few thousand

21
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,590
degrees. Calvin, in the case of our sun,

22
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,270
it will take another quadrillion years
for it to cool down and become a black

23
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:35,250
dwarf that's 1 million million
million million years from now.

24
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,660
Give or take a few millions.
Think humans will be around for that long.

25
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,980
Well, let's switch it up. What
if the Sun burnt out tomorrow?

26
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,510
I hope you have a good supply of
batteries on hand because the entire solar

27
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:50,460
system would be thrown into darkness,

28
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,120
put on a few sweaters because it would
become much colder to planetary speaking.

29
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,750
We're pretty spoiled here on earth with
all the heat and light provided by the

30
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:05,280
sun. We're able to make a comfortable
home on a rock hurtling through space at

31
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:07,650
110,000 kilometers per hour.

32
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,040
It's easy to forget that we're
just another speck in the universe,

33
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,990
but if the sun stopped burning,

34
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,910
it would be immediately evident that
we're just floating in space after the

35
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:19,410
first week without the sun's heat.

36
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,570
The earth surface temperature would drop
to zero degrees Celsius. After a year,

37
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,690
it would go down even more dropping to
a freezing cold minus 100 that is if the

38
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:33,870
sun turned into a black dwarf instantly,
which is unlikely.

39
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,760
Even for our hypothetical scenario,

40
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,540
realistically to become a black dwarf,

41
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,740
the son would have to go through all
stages of the stellar lifecycle from the

42
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:44,640
main sequence stars.

43
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:49,641
It is now the sun would expand into a
red giant fade out to a white dwarf state

44
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,080
and only then cool down to become a
black dwarf at the red giant stage.

45
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,430
It would bake the earth,

46
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,400
most likely swallowing it completely
along with Venus and mercury.

47
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,900
At least we wouldn't have to worry about
freezing to death once the sun shrank

48
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:08,380
to a black dwarf.
What about the rest of the planets?

49
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,390
The ones lucky enough to have evaded the
burning flames of the red giant? Well,

50
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,780
they've keep orbiting that remnant of
the sun as if nothing had happened.

51
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,840
Even though the sun would
shrink to the size of the earth,

52
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,430
it's mass would stay the same.

53
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,410
Meaning that its gravitational pull would
remain unchanged in the grand scale of

54
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:29,560
the universe. The death of the son
wouldn't change anything either.

55
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,410
The Sun would be just
another star to go dark,

56
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,460
too small and insignificant to make
the universe even a tiny bit darker.

57
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,110
But what if all the stars
died at the same time? Well,

58
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,170
that's a story for another.
What if.
