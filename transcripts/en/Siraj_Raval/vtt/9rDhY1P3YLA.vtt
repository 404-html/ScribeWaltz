1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.340
Come from the data science stay for the meats.

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.070
Hello world it Saroj and data science is the hottest career to get into this

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.510
year.
Every industry is collecting customer data and using it to make smarter

4
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:15.240
decisions,
which leads to higher profits.

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.190
The demand to fill data science positions is through the roof globally and

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.600
forecast reveal that this demand will only increase in the coming years.

7
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.320
So to help you take part in this rapidly growing field,

8
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.480
I've created a three month curriculum to take you from absolute beginner to

9
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:35.760
proficient in the art of data science.

10
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.060
This open source curriculum consists of purely free resources that I've compiled

11
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:44.850
from across the web and has no prerequisites.

12
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.130
You don't even have to have coded before.

13
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.460
I've designed it for anyone who wants to improve their skills and find paid work

14
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.610
asap,
either through a full time position or contract work.

15
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.720
You'll be learning a host of tools like sequel,
python,
Hadoop,

16
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.700
and even data storytelling,

17
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.730
all of which make up the complete data science pipeline.

18
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.800
Data Science is the area of study involving extracting insights from data and a

19
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:14.070
data scientist sits at the intersection of math,

20
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.140
software engineering and data communication or the ability to communicate

21
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:20.580
insights from data.

22
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.500
There are a lot of related positions in the field ranging from machine learning

23
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:29.400
engineer to data analyst to business analytics specialist.

24
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.700
Usually a data scientist is expected to formulate the questions that will help a

25
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:39.801
business and then proceeds to solve them while a data analyst is given questions

26
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:44.610
by the business team and pursues a solution with that guidance.

27
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.230
On the other hand,
uh,

28
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:51.180
machine learning engineers goal is to build an optimized predictive models.

29
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.050
There's a lot of intersection between data science roles,

30
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.370
but the data scientist is usually the most senior role.
For example,

31
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.290
if we look at a data scientist job position hiring page at one of the big four

32
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:09.291
tech companies like Google or Facebook will see that they expect several years

33
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:12.540
of experience and a relevant undergraduate,

34
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.180
sometimes even graduate level degree.

35
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.030
That's because they can afford to do that.

36
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.800
Everyone wants to work there and they have more data than anyone else on the

37
00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:27.780
planet,
so they set the bar very high,
but don't get discouraged by that.

38
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.500
If you're applying as a first time data scientist,

39
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.330
it's best to avoid applying there and instead of applying to a lesser demanding

40
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:38.070
role like a data analyst,

41
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.080
data science jobs at smaller companies are much more forgiving and you can make

42
00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:48.081
up for both a lack of experience and any gaps in formal education by showcasing

43
00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:52.530
the depth of your skills.
If you start your career there,

44
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.520
you can work your way up to one of the bigger companies or of course start your

45
00:02:56.521 --> 00:03:01.180
own data science business.
I've divided curriculum up into three months.

46
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.850
The first month focuses on data analysis.

47
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.230
Month two is all about machine learning and the last month we'll have us learn

48
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:13.231
production grade tools like spark and Hadoop that data scientist use in the real

49
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:16.960
world.
Before I start describing the curriculum,

50
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.850
keep in mind that we are practicing accelerated learning.
Yes.

51
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.620
Each week of my curriculum consists of a full online course that's supposed to

52
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:27.730
take several weeks,

53
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.590
but we're concerned with efficiently downloading as much knowledge into our

54
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:34.570
brains as fast as possible.

55
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.160
To do this watch course videos at two x or three x speed using a browser

56
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:39.994
extension,

57
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.060
dedicate two or three hours every day to studying handwrite notes as you watch

58
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:48.820
for increased memory retention,
which has been proven and complete.

59
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:53.470
Just one of the projects of your choice from each course at the end of the week

60
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.380
to help synthesize the ideas you've learned.

61
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.630
Also while you're learning,

62
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.980
immerse yourself in the community by following this great list of data

63
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:06.130
scientists.
For the first week,
we'll want to learn python,

64
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.880
perhaps the most important tool in the data science pipeline.

65
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.470
It's a highly versatile programming language that's used across many different

66
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:19.471
industries at x has developed a great course made for absolute beginners to

67
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:23.080
learn python specifically for data science.

68
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.300
It takes us from Python language fundamentals up to creating plots using real

69
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:29.770
data.
Additionally,

70
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.460
I've developed a fun learn python for data science playlist,

71
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.170
so definitely check that out.
Once we have a basic grasp of python.

72
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.340
In the second week we'll want to take the statistics and probability course.

73
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.720
At Khan Academy.

74
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.670
It's actually really fun and Khan Academy's website has gotten better every
year.

75
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.540
The course has interactive content and they make it feel like you're playing a

76
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:54.970
game due to the mastery points system.

77
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.150
It covers topics like probability distributions,

78
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.870
random variables and hypothesis testing,
all of which are supreme,

79
00:05:02.871 --> 00:05:05.230
really useful in the data science pipeline.

80
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.340
After we have a bit more of a mathematical foundation,

81
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.520
we can start learning how to perform all sorts of exploratory data analysis

82
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:18.160
techniques,
some of which use probability and statistics.

83
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.450
This is the process of summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset.

84
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.190
Georgia tech released a course called introduction to computing for data

85
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:32.191
analysis that demonstrates how to preprocessed analyze and visualize a dataset.

86
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.240
The important thing about this course is that most of the focus is on data

87
00:05:37.241 --> 00:05:39.010
cleaning and in the real world,

88
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.180
data scientists will be quick to tell you that most of their time is spent

89
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:45.940
cleaning data.
Real world data is messy.

90
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:50.590
It's not like Kaggle where we get neatly packaged datasets.
It's unlabeled.

91
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.080
It's got missing values,
irrelevant features.

92
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.560
So learning how to carefully sculpt a Dataset so that it's ready for further

93
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:00.320
analysis is crucial.
Speaking of Kaggle,

94
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.350
the website has become a phenomenal resource for data science enthusiasts.

95
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.580
It's become not only a place for data scientists to compete for prize money,

96
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.650
by solving problems for companies,
but an incredible learning resource.
In fact,

97
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.800
Kaggle has a learn section that contains courses on a series of tools you'll

98
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:23.060
need to understand data science.

99
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.110
Each course is a series of well documented Kaggle kernels,

100
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.990
which are their version of Jupiter notebooks.

101
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.430
My only gripe is that there's no video content or assignments,

102
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.190
but an awesome resource.
Nonetheless,

103
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.400
definitely something to browse for week four,

104
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:44.990
spend the week solving a Kaggle competition that you personally find

105
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:48.320
interesting.
That's the best way to stay motivated.

106
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.180
Pick a completed competition and briefly view one of the colonels to get some

107
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:55.490
sense of what people have done before.

108
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.240
Then create your own repository and get to work.

109
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.540
Document the project very well on your get hub profile so that anyone who views

110
00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:08.180
it can run the code if they follow your instructions,

111
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.480
including any future employers.
Remember,

112
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.490
get hub is the new resume.

113
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.240
Now that we know how to clean a Dataset and explore,

114
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:19.610
it's different features and relationships,

115
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.090
we can start diving into the art of machine learning.

116
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.490
Machine learning models help us derive insights from data sets,
correlations,

117
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.940
classifications,
clustering.
There's a lot of possibilities.

118
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:37.450
There are several mathematical disciplines that make up ml and I've got a cheat

119
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:42.701
sheet for each of them that list the most relevant parts you'll need to know in

120
00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:43.610
the video description.

121
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.290
Columbia has an excellent course called machine learning for data science and

122
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:49.550
analytics on Ed ex.

123
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.770
It starts with concepts like search trees and linear programming applied to a

124
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.660
real world personal genomic Dataset to give us an algorithmic foundation.

125
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.900
Then it moves into popular machine learning techniques except for deep learning.

126
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:10.120
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning focus on just one type of model.

127
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.360
Neural networks,

128
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:16.190
the online deep learning books specifically parts one and two will get you up to

129
00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:20.540
speed on deep learning very fast.
Suspend Week seven reading that.

130
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.531
Additionally,

131
00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:25.610
I've got a deep learning playlists on youtube that's very extensive for week

132
00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:28.400
eight.
It's time for Kaggle project number two.

133
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.690
This time with a focus on different ways of using either machine learning or

134
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:34.790
deep learning to solve a problem.

135
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.770
Our last month we'll focus on learning how the modern data science pipeline

136
00:08:39.771 --> 00:08:43.400
works.
Data sets usually live in databases,

137
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.760
so learning how to work with databases is important.

138
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:52.090
You Udacity is intro to relational databases is a relatively short but detailed

139
00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:57.581
introduction to the basics of structured query language or SQL and database

140
00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:02.751
design as well as the Python Api for connecting python code to a database will

141
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:07.620
also fit in another short course into this week on the other type of database.

142
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.640
No sequel.

143
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.740
The intro to no sequel data solutions course by Microsoft on Fedex is perfect

144
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:17.850
for this.
It leads us through the three bs of no sequel variety,

145
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:19.230
volume and velocity.

146
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.580
By demonstrating popular examples like Mongo DB for we tend,

147
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:27.180
we'll move onto Hadoop and MapReduce.
As Google grew,

148
00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:32.160
it had to index more and more data over a billion pages of content and in order

149
00:09:32.161 --> 00:09:36.930
to cope they invented a new style of data processing known as MapReduce.

150
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.670
Hadoop was created to apply these concepts to an open source framework that

151
00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:42.840
anyone could use.

152
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:48.170
Data scientists use MapReduce to process data frequently and the intro to Hadoop

153
00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:52.800
and map by Cloudera course on your Udacity is the perfect way to get familiar

154
00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:53.790
with these concepts.

155
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.350
There's also another framework called spark that is newer than Hadoop and is

156
00:09:58.351 --> 00:10:02.100
getting a lot of attention because it's useful in different ways.

157
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.080
Think of it like an extension of Hadoop.

158
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:09.240
Stanford has a one day workshop on spark and we can use the associated slide

159
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:11.010
deck tutorial to learn more.

160
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.430
When you're working on a team as a data scientist,

161
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:19.050
often you're tasked with communicating your results to people in different

162
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:22.590
teams,
so important business decisions can be made.

163
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:27.860
Microsoft has a course on ed ex called analytics storytelling for impact.

164
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.350
That perfectly fits this use case.
And for the last week,

165
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:33.510
complete one more Kaggle project.

166
00:10:33.511 --> 00:10:38.310
So you have three great demos to show the world.
Once you finish this course,

167
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:41.940
you can start applying for jobs,
doing contract work,

168
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.260
start your own data science consulting group,
or just keep on learning.

169
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.650
Remember to believe in your ability to learn.

170
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.700
You can learn data science,
you will learn data science,

171
00:10:53.701 --> 00:10:58.110
and if you stick to it,
eventually you will master it.
Oh,

172
00:10:58.111 --> 00:11:00.450
and find a study buddy to keep you motivated.

173
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.860
I've created a data science in three months channel in our slack group to help

174
00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:07.410
you find one good luck wizard.
I'm rooting for you.

175
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.510
Please subscribe for more programming videos.

176
00:11:09.511 --> 00:11:12.990
And for now I've got to clean my data.
So thanks for watching.
