00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.380
How old were old Saroj.
Here let's talk about four ways to use smart contracts.

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.700
A smart contract is just a piece of code that is stored on a blockchain instead

3
00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:11.480
of a server.
That means no one can alter or deleted.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.070
Since blockchains aren't controlled by anyone,

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.600
it enabled people to do business with strangers without the need to trust.

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.590
A third part,
the first way to use it is to bring voting online,

7
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.730
but us government has never brought voting online because of the security risks

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.970
involved.
If they stored everyone's vote on a server,

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.190
that server could easily be hacked and votes alternative.

10
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.010
If only there was some kind of system that could securely and synonymously store

11
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:41.280
votes online.
Oh right.
The blockchain.
To do this,

12
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.080
an engineer could create a smart contract and push it to the blockchain smart

13
00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:46.781
contract with den.

14
00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:51.090
Yet unaddressed citizens could then just send a transaction to that address with

15
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:53.430
their encoded votes and social security number.

16
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.810
The contract would then verify it at the citizen had never voted before and then

17
00:00:57.811 --> 00:01:00.840
store it because this code runs from the blockchain.

18
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.280
A hacker would have to have more computational power and the 500 fastest

19
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:08.370
supercomputers on the planet combined to break the system.

20
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.150
Ain't nobody got that much computing power.
Once the government implements this,

21
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.130
voter turnout will skyrockets.

22
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.700
Boating would finally become just another app on our phone.

23
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.840
No having to wait in line at some paper ballot booth,
a 30 minute drive away.

24
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.060
Millennials would actually vote.

25
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.750
This would fundamentally improve the quality of the politicians we elect.

26
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.240
The second way is to increase spending transparency.

27
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.750
I think about all the cases of government corruption or evil corporate dealings,

28
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.560
all of them,
every single one has to do with money.
Stealing money,

29
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:39.450
spending money on personal interest,

30
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.940
giving and taking money from shady businesses.

31
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.280
The list goes on with smart contracts.

32
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.690
We as citizens of a nation or shareholders in a company can demand that all

33
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:53.550
spending happen on the blockchain and smart contracts can be instituted to route

34
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:56.040
money as we see fit.
So for example,

35
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.460
let's say a politician promises to increase spending on healthcare for their

36
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:00.294
states.

37
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.230
If there's a smart contract that will route money sent to it every time to 20

38
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:06.330
hospitals,
10 insurance companies.

39
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.280
The public can audit since all transactions are public on the blockchain ledger

40
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.490
and verify to be unaltered by cryptography.

41
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.510
That more companies and governments that institute this kind of transparency,

42
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.420
the more those who don't will be pressured to do so,

43
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.520
it will slowly become the norm.
The third way is to increase autonomy.

44
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.150
Has our species has progressed.
We've automated more and more.

45
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.330
We've offloaded more and more work to our machines.

46
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.820
This trend will continue as our machines get better.

47
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.140
Smart contracts bringing us one step closer to full artificial intelligence.

48
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.820
Take ride sharing.
For example,

49
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.770
Uber is a software APP run by humans sued Uber will implement self driving cars

50
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:47.910
so it won't need drivers.

51
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.840
But with smart contracts Uber could become even more autonomous.

52
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.330
Even more independence of humans.

53
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.500
A self driving car could live as an independent entity,
picking up passengers,

54
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.500
paying its own repairs,
filling its own gas,
parking itself,

55
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.140
coordinating with other Karl's.
If these tasks,

56
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:07.570
we're all smart contracts that the car communicated with,

57
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.370
it wouldn't need humans at all.

58
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.820
Instead of humans having to run the logistics and plumbing up Uber Network,

59
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.790
they can focus on more fun,
creative pursuits.

60
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.070
The fourth way is to create smart property.

61
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.120
Smart property is an object whose ownership is verified by the blockchain.

62
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.160
Traditionally,
we use humans to verify this,

63
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.770
like a stranger can't rent out your apartment on airbnb because airbnb has

64
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:32.560
verified that it's yours,
but with smart contracts,

65
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.350
you wouldn't even need airbnb to rent out your place.

66
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.250
You could create a digital token that would represent your apartment and then a

67
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:43.180
smart contract that said something like,
if you send money to this address,

68
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.200
transfer the ownership token to the sender for x amount of time,

69
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.990
and because there's no middleman to take a cut,

70
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.480
you get more money for renting out your place.

71
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.100
This can be applied to everything from patents,
to cars,
to fridges,

72
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.690
anything with Internet communication capability,
the Internet of things.

73
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.150
