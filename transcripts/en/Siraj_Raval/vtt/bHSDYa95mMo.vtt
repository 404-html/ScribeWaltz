00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.200
I'm not

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.730
<v 1>Stan.
It's been a ride.
Every model.</v>

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.070
I guess I had to go to that place.

4
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.610
Yeah.
You know some of you might still be in that place.

5
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.050
You fall trying to get out.
Yeah.
Just subscribe to me.

6
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.543
I'll get you there.

7
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.420
You can try and read these arrows off my compiler before I make them.

8
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.720
I don't live my coach,
so make sense that I break them.
My Algorithm,
it's dopey.

9
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.450
Take them when I code it,
I use pots on,
I don't give a damn if it breaks.

10
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.430
I'm doing this for you.
Let's hack it all.

11
00:00:37.431 --> 00:00:40.370
Chatty bots and games and machine nade music.

12
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.070
I keep it open towards kickup do through name is source to all those who look

13
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:47.060
down on me.
Just call me.
See Rich Ology our neural next,

14
00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:51.590
we'll see better than biology.
Self driving cars will drive dreams to reality.

15
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.570
Learning Syntax and formatting.

16
00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:57.200
Also properly until we get the BSO D on Old technology.

17
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.450
I'm learning from my data of and deltas and dated for pushing every limit.
Right,

18
00:01:01.451 --> 00:01:06.160
and Matt laughs.
Just kidding.
Matlab sucks.
Get adult kicked,
pull out,

19
00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:10.220
get push,
get,
commit until you to get from new to get legit.

20
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.380
Pretty model
from

21
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.840
two to four
years

22
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.340
data
view.
