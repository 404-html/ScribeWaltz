WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.140
Thanks for coming on the geology.
Um,
that's a good name.

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.530
I was a great name.
I appreciate it.
Uh,
yeah.
So like how,

3
00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:13.460
how's life,
how's everything going on lately?
Like that's pretty good.
Actually.

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.190
I'm living in San Francisco,
which is one of my favorite cities in the world.

5
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.440
A New York at the bay club second I think.

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.060
So they made me love my job,
love my apartment,

7
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.500
left my test.
Snake pet's name.

8
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.560
What is his name is Harris,
which is not very good name names.

9
00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:36.110
He doesn't actually hit that same,
he's like super chill.
He's super chill.

10
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.020
Is he a killer saying uh,
no,
he is presently,

11
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.810
do you have mice in department?
In the faith.
Okay.

12
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.540
What will tell you just start working at Vittoria ever treat recruiter family

13
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:53.250
online?
Almost two and a half years ago when I first started working there.
Um,

14
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.920
and I don't even think I realized at the time that it was a company.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.470
I had used their protocols and their African,
my application.
Yeah.

16
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.020
Especially in college to download stuff,
you know,
our college student.

17
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.640
And,
uh,

18
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.860
he reached out to me and said they were looking for a front end engineer on a

19
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:13.510
particular project and I just feel really excited.

20
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.600
I felt like there was that moment,

21
00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:17.820
something incredibly special about the folks at this time.

22
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:22.560
It's just like a bunch of Quirky nerds who just love technology and love what

23
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:25.430
they do and nobody's really trying to show off for,
you know,

24
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.600
be trendy or you know,

25
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.450
they're in it for the right reasons and I just felt really at home then.

26
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.940
That's awesome.
Yeah.
And it's cool that like,
you know,

27
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:36.600
through this period of like Joe Montana,
which is,
can be really hard.
You,

28
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.740
you found a great position in that you seem to love.
Yeah,
that's great.

29
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.740
I personally like I was looking for jobs and I got rejected by law.
I,

30
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.120
and it hurts a lot.
I mean,

31
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.610
do you have any kind of advice for people who are looking for tech jobs?

32
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:55.030
Like how to like,
you know,
deal with rejections and like,
you know,
like what,
what,

33
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.900
what,
what,
what did you do?
Oh,
well definitely crying in the shower.

34
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.730
Um,

35
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.830
yeah is definitely going to happen and it hurts and insights and there's really

36
00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:09.010
nothing you can do about it.

37
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:13.920
But you usually you'll find after like the initial period of being upset that

38
00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:18.150
like,
it's usually like a,
you know,
it's like kind of a blessing in disguise.

39
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:21.540
They usually realize that like that was not the right place to be working.

40
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:26.330
Like either,
you know,
it we might not have been the right fit or um,
you know,

41
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.630
also like if somebody doesn't want you working there,
like that's not really,

42
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.180
you know,
it's like you don't want to date someone who doesn't want to date here.

43
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.720
I think the key is just to keep powering through to the top,

44
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:41.320
let it get you down too much because eventually you find the right sentence for

45
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.480
sure.
I think that's a great analogy.

46
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.920
It's like your day to day life at work.
Cause it's like a,

47
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.680
it's an open source protocol but it's a company.
Yeah.
As his money.
Right?

48
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.580
We um,
and we have multiple products as well.
It's not just the,

49
00:02:56.581 --> 00:02:58.800
what we call a bit turned client.
Um,

50
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.570
so I work on the browser team and my friend had engineer,

51
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.790
although we're actually rebranding this spring,

52
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:11.530
it's surf that's going to be like super sexy.
Um,

53
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.800
but,
uh,
I referred him Tamir,
but I occasionally work in the back end.

54
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.670
Um,
it's basically a bit torrent,
but in the chromium browser,

55
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.840
so we've taken the chromium open source code and um,

56
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.630
we've been suited for some of our mentors and stuff in there.

57
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:33.631
And now you can fix the interim magnet lank and,

58
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.780
uh,
get a torrent right in your browser.
That's awesome.
Yeah,

59
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.490
there's a challenging,
where do you feel like it's something very true?
Um,

60
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.340
we'll book.
Yeah.
So,
which is part of why I left my job.
Um,
yeah,

61
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:48.100
some things are just super easy where it's,
you know,
uh,

62
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.100
doing some kind of a Ui work that's,
you know,

63
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.490
just very straight forward and simple.
Um,
and then sometimes like,

64
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:58.540
actually the thing I did today was going in and trying to change.

65
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.320
I'm trying to get our torrents today,
uh,

66
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.800
plane came to the chromium menu,
like the dropdown menu,

67
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.730
and you think that we'd be really straight forward except the chromium code is

68
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:10.780
not.
So you basically,

69
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:14.110
it's basically like a treasure hunt and you're trying to figure out that where

70
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.580
in the code you actually have to change some things.
So it's,

71
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.530
it's really challenging,

72
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:21.490
but it's also really fun and it's doable and it usually feels good when you

73
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.840
actually figure out how the pizza thing,
what,

74
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.360
what got you into programming in general?
Um,

75
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.390
so I moved to California and San Francisco in 2005 and I was actually,

76
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.440
um,
I was actually an astrophysics major and university,
so,

77
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.340
yeah.
So I'm,
so they didn't want to go into research or academia.

78
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:47.080
And so when I moved that to her that I was planning on going back to school for

79
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.340
mechanical engineering or something with a little bit more applied.
Um,

80
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.940
and while I was doing that,

81
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.570
I had a couple friends who are working on random projects that involve

82
00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:00.640
programming.
They want it to make some,

83
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.470
actually youtube cause like visualizations.
Um,
yeah.
And so,

84
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.890
uh,
I,
I said,
you know,
what the hell,

85
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.350
I'm going to learn how to program it and I'll see if I can help out.

86
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:15.610
And then I just sort of never looked back.
I've just been burger.
That's awesome.

87
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.880
And it's one of the,

88
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.780
I think one of the sad things about silicon valley because there's not enough

89
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.310
women in programs.
It's awesome that you are,
do you have any like,

90
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:28.870
advice that you would give to like girls who want to learn to code or they want

91
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:30.850
to get into the field?
Um,
yeah,
definitely.

92
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.440
I would definitely say that first you have to sort of find something that you

93
00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:39.180
want to build or make or just something that you're curious about.
Um,

94
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.430
doesn't have to be good.
It doesn't have to be,
you know,
useful.

95
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.940
It can even be something that someone did already that you'd want to learn
about.

96
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:48.720
So you just want to retell it underground or something.
Um,

97
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.470
it has to be something you're interested in,

98
00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:54.760
someone passionate about and then you just sort of have to go for it.
Um,

99
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.900
the other bit of advice would be to not let anyone tell you you can't do

100
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:04.370
something or let anyone put you down.
And if people do,

101
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.870
cause you will definitely encounter people,
uh,
who are really good,

102
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.350
secure themselves and want to put others down and we them feel stupid and make

103
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:13.830
them feel bad.
Um,

104
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.840
consider just find any way to not let that bother you because that's,

105
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.700
that's huge.
I went into an interview once,
I definitely won't say where.
Okay.

106
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.450
And you can tell the guy who came into the room,
uh,

107
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.060
didn't know a woman from my resume and he took one look at me and he could just

108
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:33.260
see the look on his face.

109
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:38.261
Like it was just immediately like it went from like friendly to kind of set it

110
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:43.040
in under a second.
Obviously I can't prove that it was because I'm a woman,

111
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:47.960
but definitely will be like,

112
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.960
I feel,
you know,
10 years from now

113
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.160
or,
um,
well hopefully,
uh,

114
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.140
hopefully there's a cute guy involved

115
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.050
and like the same as I'm doing something.
Um,

116
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.880
maybe a little more science or physics.
I don't know exactly what it would be,

117
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:16.520
but,
um,
I actually really miss science.

118
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.680
And so if I can figure out a way to combine the two

119
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.570
without necessarily needing a phd,
and this,
I think a lot of hands,

120
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.620
I wanted to get rid of the space sex,
there's some thinking.

121
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:30.190
I pretty much need a phd.
Um,

122
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.220
so we are trying to find something along those lines where I can still keep up

123
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:38.450
with those interests.
That's awesome.
Cool.
Well

124
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.750
thanks for answering all these questions.
Thanks for coming.
Thank you.
