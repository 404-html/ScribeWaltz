Hello world.

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.960
It's the Raj and the 100 days of ml code challenge is lighting up social media.

3
00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:07.884
Right now,

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.100
machine learning is the most transformative and important technology of our

5
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:14.130
time,

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.660
whether it's helping us discover new drugs for major diseases,

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.450
fighting fraud,
generating music.

8
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.870
The list of applications are truly endless and in order for us as a community to

9
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:32.370
be able to make valuable contributions to the world,

10
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.610
we need to master this technology.

11
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.090
100 days of ml code is our movement.

12
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.330
It's a pledge to dedicate one hour of your time every single day to studying for

13
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:50.670
coding machine learning for 100 days if you need a project idea.

14
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.700
There's a really cool challenge on driven data.org to use AI to help predict

15
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.880
local epidemics of dengue fever,

16
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.890
a disease that affects almost half a billion people every single year.

17
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.970
We can literally save hundreds of millions of lives.

18
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.210
The challenge ends at the end of this year and I know that together we can solve

19
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:16.770
it,
but don't feel restricted.

20
00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:19.740
There are many other projects out there.

21
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.450
Pick an industry that excites you.
Find a problem.
They have.

22
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.370
Locate irrelevant Dataset,

23
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.790
apply AI to that data set and create a solution.

24
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.120
I'll give a shout out to some of the wizards who successfully complete the

25
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:36.810
challenge details are in the Github.
Read me in the video description.

26
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.780
The more impact you make,
the better.
Good luck.
