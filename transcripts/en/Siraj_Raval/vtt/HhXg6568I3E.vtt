1
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.180
That's better.
Hello world.

2
00:00:07.181 --> 00:00:11.680
It's Saroj and I'd like to introduce you to a device called the link.

3
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.010
The link is a very small DNA based molecular computing device that we can place

4
00:00:17.051 --> 00:00:21.580
right behind our ear and increases our ability to learn,
create,

5
00:00:21.581 --> 00:00:25.990
discover,
and connect with other humans by several orders of magnitude.

6
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.830
I'll explain how it works at both the hardware and software level,

7
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.420
but the link is not yet available for consumers.
In fact,

8
00:00:34.421 --> 00:00:35.620
it's not even real yet.

9
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.900
It's just a very important thought experiment that every single one of us needs

10
00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:45.901
to go through because it's very likely that in 20 years it or something similar

11
00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:50.050
to it will be commercially available and it is in both academia,

12
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.710
government and industry are working on this.
As we speak,

13
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.700
we can think of the link as a brain computer interface,

14
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.380
a tool that we can use to interface with the Internet just like we currently do

15
00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:03.550
with our smartphones.

16
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.880
Our brain is the most complex system we know of and the NEOCORTEX.

17
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.630
The newest addition to our brain is considered to be the crowning achievement of

18
00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:14.560
human evolution.

19
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.030
Our neocortex is what differentiates us from every other species.

20
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.290
It has six layers of increasing abstraction and the highest levels of our

21
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:27.790
neocortex or what have allowed us to express love,
develop language,

22
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.950
technology,
art and science,

23
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.020
and the Internet acts like a digital version of our neo cortex giving us even

24
00:01:35.021 --> 00:01:38.650
more layers of abstraction which increased our capabilities.

25
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.410
Our smartphones let us access this.

26
00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:45.910
They've given us so much and they've improved our lives in so many ways,

27
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.760
but they've also caused us some problems.

28
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
From 2011 to 2016 teenagers started spending much more time on social media and

29
00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:57.700
much less time with their friends.
Face to face.

30
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.410
Decades of research shows that being with other people face to face is good for

31
00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:07.180
mental health.
On average,
we use our smartphone seven to eight hours a day.

32
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.650
We wait for replies to text messages and get anxious when they don't come.

33
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.220
This is so me.
Anxiety,
depressive symptoms,

34
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.330
clinical depression and suicide rates all sorted to go up around the time

35
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.010
smartphones were introduced.

36
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.020
They Nag us to recharge them and interrupt us when we're having a conversation

37
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.280
with another human,

38
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.490
but we decided to tolerate them because they let us communicate easily and give

39
00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:35.650
us unprecedented access to information.

40
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.160
Technology was supposed to make life more simple,

41
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.040
but instead it's made it more complex.

42
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.050
We need a solution that removes this barrier between us and other humans on

43
00:02:47.051 --> 00:02:49.270
entirely new user experience.

44
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.260
One that works invisibly alongside us and his biological,

45
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.620
not mechanical in nature.
Enter the link.

46
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.020
The link is a very small device.

47
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.680
We can stick snugly on top of the skin right behind our ear.

48
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.560
It's noninvasive and made up of silicone rubber,

49
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.090
the same material on an apple watch band.
It's waterproof,
lightweight,

50
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.980
nontoxic,
and gluten free.

51
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.450
The link uses DNA as its medium for both computing and storage.

52
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.310
It can read brain states using infrared spectroscopy and it can modify brain

53
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:24.490
states using a technique called temporal interference.

54
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.560
Two way communication is achieved between the Internet via an onboard Wifi

55
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.470
module.
I'll explain each of these terms,

56
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:36.160
but first let's talk about how it uses DNA to store data.

57
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.490
DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid and it represents the genetic blueprint of

58
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:43.240
all living creatures.

59
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.010
It's also a unique computational element because it has extremely dense

60
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:49.210
information storage,

61
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.230
enormous parallelism and extraordinary energy efficiency.

62
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.480
Just a single gram of DNA is capable of storing 215 petabytes of data.

63
00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.560
For comparison,

64
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:04.330
just one petabyte is equal to 13 years of high definition video content.

65
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.010
The way DNA storage works is that first we take some digital data that we'd

66
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:13.510
normally store in binary code of ones and Zeros and translate it into the

67
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:15.970
genetic code of A's,
C's,
g's,

68
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:19.720
and t's that represent the chemical building blocks of DNA.

69
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.780
Then we use that DNA code to synthetically generate strings of DNA to our

70
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:29.290
specifications using the onboard bite to DNA converter.

71
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.790
It stays in many cold storage and when we want to retrieve the information,

72
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.260
we use a DNA sequencing machine to decode the material inside.

73
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.790
That gives us,
once again,

74
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:44.791
the DNA sequence which we can either translate back into binary or use as direct

75
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.170
input to the DNA processor.

76
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.530
The DNA processor is a surface of Origami.

77
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.490
By that I mean that it is essentially a bunch of DNA strands that have been

78
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:58.660
folded in ways similar to the techniques of Japanese paper folding.

79
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.400
This lets us create DNA logic gates and the interconnects that link them.

80
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.760
We can call these nanoscale computational circuits made from synthetic DNA DNA

81
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.320
Domino's circuits.
For example,

82
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.350
a transmission line consists of hairpin loops of DNA strands with one end fixed

83
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.970
to the origami surface.
When both input and fuel DNA strands are poured on,

84
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.170
they break the loops in the transmission lines strands and forced them to bend

85
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:30.040
over and link up with their neighbors strands one after the other,

86
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:34.960
like dominoes falling until they form a line of DNA on the substrate.

87
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.000
These transmission lines and other structures make elementary logic gates like

88
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.030
Andy and or with two inputs and we're able to make even more complex circuits by

89
00:05:45.491 --> 00:05:50.491
linking these elementary gates together so we can think of the DNA origami

90
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:52.690
wafer,
like a molecular breadboard.

91
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.320
All of this is powered by your body heat using an onboard thermo electric

92
00:05:57.321 --> 00:05:57.950
generator.

93
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.950
The link is able to read the brain using functional near infrared spectroscopy.

94
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.460
This is a portable,

95
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.490
noninvasive brain imaging technology that uses low levels of light to record

96
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:14.300
changes in cerebral blood flow in the brain through an optical sensor.

97
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.710
These signals are recorded be a flexible fiber optic cables which allow

98
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:22.880
neuroimaging tasks to be conducted no matter what you are doing,

99
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.190
whether it's walking,
standing,
or running.

100
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.460
This 32 channelF nirs system is able to record brain activity in the frontal

101
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.580
motor sensor and temporal cortices with ease.

102
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.510
So when brain activity is recorded by theF and IRS module,

103
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.510
it's processed and stored by the DNA computer.

104
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.690
Then it's encrypted using the aes two 56 encryption algorithm and waits to be

105
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:51.260
sent to whatever third party service we'd like over Wifi with just a thought.

106
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:54.860
We can book a car or a flight,
send a message,
make a payment,

107
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.740
subscribe to t series,
all of it instantly,

108
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.650
and we can finally visualize our neural activity.

109
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.540
That means we can record our dreams at night and play them back to ourselves in

110
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:06.740
full HD video.

111
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.210
We can also visualize our mood and notice how it changes over time,

112
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.760
how angry we are,
how happy we are,

113
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.620
whatever combination of emotions we're feeling in precise detail and it doesn't

114
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:19.454
end there.

115
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.780
The ability to visualize our neural activity means we can visualize our belief

116
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:24.500
systems,

117
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.000
value systems and our own capabilities across a wide range of tasks.

118
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.920
This leads to enormous potential for optimizing life.
Using our neural patterns.

119
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.850
Algorithms can match us with our ideal dating partner Diet,

120
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.950
fitness plan and lifestyle plan.

121
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.780
The link helps us with the enormous complexity of decision making in our modern

122
00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:48.920
world and let's not forget the potential for creative expression,

123
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.110
that song or art piece in your head.

124
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.730
You can visualize it immediately and this ideation feedback loop applies to

125
00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:57.710
scientific discovery as well.

126
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:03.070
The ability to visualize a hypothesis in any field has never been easier,

127
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.820
but in order for us to be able to visualize all of this and access internet

128
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:09.920
services without needing a screen,

129
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:15.050
the link is also able to modify the brand using what's called Tim interference

130
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:20.270
to high frequency electrical currents are generated using very small electrodes.

131
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.570
While these fields are too fast to drive neurons,

132
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:28.310
the current interfere with one another in such a way that when they intersect

133
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:29.390
deep in the brain,

134
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.430
a small region of low frequency current is generated inside neurons.

135
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:39.670
This low frequency current can be used to drive neurons electrical activity

136
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:44.180
while the high frequency current passes through surrounding tissue with no

137
00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:48.080
effect.
So if we think visualize my dream from last night,

138
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.580
the link will automatically find the appropriate app from the links APP store

139
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.590
dream Biz in this case,
then read dream,

140
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.670
convert that dream data into a neural pattern that would allow us to see that

141
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:04.380
dream in front of us clear as day,
just like we would on a normal TV screen.

142
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.920
By stimulating our brain to be able to visualize it,

143
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:13.070
triggering the exact combination of colors and textures in the visual Cortex to

144
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:16.950
show us something in real life that exists only in the brain.

145
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.750
This ability to write to the brain gives us extraordinary capabilities with the

146
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:26.751
link we can experience any drug be at DMT or LSD without experiencing side

147
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:27.750
effects.

148
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.190
It's simply a matter of changing our neuro states by downloading the digital

149
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:33.840
version of these drugs.

150
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:39.140
We can also download any skill instantly a phd in physics on entire textbook or

151
00:09:39.991 --> 00:09:42.930
even an entire language and for the gamers.

152
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.940
The link lets us experience entirely new worlds in full 5 cents emergent.

153
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.610
We can experience the Lord of the Rings trilogy as the main character or wall

154
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.690
hack on counterstrike for ourselves,

155
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.620
sharing and communication has improved as well.

156
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.630
We can share memories in full detail with others who use the link directly.

157
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.850
It allows us to experience love,

158
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.330
intimacy and connection like never before with a partner.

159
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:14.630
Imagine a cosmic love that human words couldn't describe enhancing every aspect

160
00:10:14.911 --> 00:10:15.780
of a relationship.

161
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:20.910
Being able to feel what they feel to be closer to them than ever before and that

162
00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:25.890
feeling of union and connection could be shared not just with one partner but

163
00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:27.690
with groups of people as well.

164
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.680
Instant thought to thought communication across the globe.

165
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.780
There are also concepts that exist that we are currently not capable of

166
00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:41.781
understanding or experiencing because we are limited by our biology concepts as

167
00:10:42.211 --> 00:10:44.760
fundamental as music or the color red.

168
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.410
Higher states of consciousness exists in the universe that if we only knew

169
00:10:49.411 --> 00:10:52.290
existed,
we do anything we could to reach there.

170
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.930
The link lets us experience them all.

171
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.590
There will of course be concerns about this device.

172
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.630
A major one is manipulation.

173
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.520
What if the software you use contains malware or a virus of some kind that could

174
00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:07.740
completely wreck havoc on your brain?

175
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:12.840
It's important to note that this technology necessitates a new breed of

176
00:11:12.841 --> 00:11:17.460
decentralized peer to peer applications that are only transparent

177
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.590
cryptographically secure open source and verified using several third parties

178
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.830
will have to completely trust any service we let anywhere near our heads and

179
00:11:27.961 --> 00:11:30.420
Facebook is definitely not one of them.

180
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.050
Another issue is a potential intelligence disparity.

181
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.700
What happens to those people who don't want to use the link or can't afford it?

182
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.230
The more demand there is,

183
00:11:40.231 --> 00:11:44.670
the more the link will be manufactured and thus the less expensive it gets.

184
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:45.970
Just like smartphones,

185
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:50.730
which are rapidly being deployed to millions of people in developing countries.

186
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.940
There's one last point I'd like mention and that's the role of AI technology in

187
00:11:56.471 --> 00:12:01.060
all of this.
Ai Is complimentary.
It's better than us at some tasks.

188
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.740
While we're better at others.
For example,
when we want to search a question,

189
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.880
we create that question in our head using our biological intelligence.

190
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.410
Then that question is sent to a search engine service that uses AI to parse

191
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:18.310
through billions of web pages to find the most relevant one.

192
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:23.410
Would we even need an artificial general intelligence if we all have this

193
00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:28.000
superhuman capability?
In fact,
is it even possible to build one?
Well,

194
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:31.510
we currently have no idea how consciousness works.

195
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.870
If consciousness is purely created from our brains,

196
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.850
then perhaps we can replicate that consciousness in a machine and create digital

197
00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:42.550
beings as counterparts to ourselves.

198
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:47.850
But there's also a chance that there is a universal consciousness that all

199
00:12:48.161 --> 00:12:52.690
living things are connected to,
that our brain,
in fact acts as a receiver of it,

200
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.200
not the source.
And if that's the case,
the link,

201
00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:00.010
a tool of our own creation extends the capabilities of this.

202
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.880
You're replaceable phenomenon and moves us closer to this universal

203
00:13:03.881 --> 00:13:06.010
consciousness.
Regardless,

204
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.030
a world of advanced super intelligent beings that create,

205
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:15.040
discover and love each other is an exhilarating thought to imagine by studying

206
00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:19.390
different modes of computing biotechnology,
the role of consciousness,

207
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.020
the capabilities of AI,
and of course,
neuroscience.

208
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.170
We definitely have a shot at getting there in our lifetime.

209
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.090
What do you think of the link?

210
00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:31.360

I've got to stare at a screen,
so thanks for watching.
