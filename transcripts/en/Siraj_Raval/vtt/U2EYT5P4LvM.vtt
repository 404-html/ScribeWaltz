1
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.340
All right.
This has gone too far.
Let's take a step back.
Hello world,

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.320
it's Saroj and the blockchain space has been plagued with scams,

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.910
apps with bad user experiences and some major technical issues.

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.530
I'm going to talk about what's gone wrong in the space,
what's gone right.

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.680
Then give some insight into how this technology will evolve in 2019 using

6
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:27.180
programmatic examples for context.

7
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:31.830
Two years ago I wrote a book called decentralized applications harnessing

8
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.780
Bitcoin's blockchain technology.

9
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.020
I also this year taught a 10 week course titled decentralized applications at

10
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:40.224
School of Ai.

11
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.160
Clearly I've been very excited about the potential for this technology,

12
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.070
but if we bring up Google and type in Bitcoin,

13
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.410
the first ever cryptocurrency created,

14
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.650
all of the results are about it's price.

15
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.680
They are debating whether or not it's a good investment opportunity and all of

16
00:00:57.751 --> 00:01:02.370
this is coming from mainstream organizations that have big distribution

17
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:06.090
channels,
so they're framing how the public thinks about bitcoin.

18
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.080
Symbio it's are an endangered species invest in venom coin

19
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.110
and it of course can be,
but that's not the real value of this technology.

20
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.100
Let me explain.

21
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.480
The bitcoin network stores all of its transactions in a database.

22
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.640
This database is distributed.
Each node in the network stores a copy of it,

23
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.090
and this database is arranged in sequential block objects that each store

24
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.530
transaction signatures linked together via pointers to form a chain,

25
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.820
Aka a block chain.

26
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.890
Certain nodes called miners use their computers to convert kinetic energy in the

27
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:47.100
form of electricity into a ledger block.

28
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.310
And this distributed mining machine repeatedly performs operations until it

29
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:56.820
solves a really simple math puzzle.
The result,
a single hash,

30
00:01:56.821 --> 00:01:59.520
which itself takes very little energy to compute,

31
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.710
is a direct representation of the huge ball of energy that was required to

32
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:09.360
produce it.
It's a mathematical proof that the block was minted.
Therefore,

33
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:14.361
an attacker wanting to modify any of this transaction data maliciously would

34
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.750
need to have more computing power than half the network to do so.

35
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.960
And even if this attacker used all of the super computers in the world combined,

36
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.190
it still wouldn't be enough.

37
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.370
Since bitcoin is such a massive network,

38
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.640
that's why it's still intact.
A decade later.

39
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.350
The bitcoin network enabled trust and cooperation between humans at a scale

40
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.240
never seen before,
specifically around securing and maintaining its ledger.

41
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.780
And this model of trust is built on math and physics,

42
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.760
mainly the proof of work algorithm.

43
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.230
Institutional Trust has been the predominant model of trust today,

44
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.490
but it's not perfect.
The Equifax hack,
the wells Fargo scandal,

45
00:02:56.491 --> 00:03:00.250
the drama over user data at Facebook,
Dunkin donuts in India.

46
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.550
These are just a few examples of how institutional trust has bailed us trust

47
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:11.401
based on math and physics helped ensure that astronauts could land on the moon

48
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.330
safely and we can also use it to guarantee that no one can modify bitcoins

49
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.650
bookkeeping record.
This is an incredibly powerful idea.

50
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:24.520
If this trust is based on math and physics,
it's programmable.

51
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.570
We can engineer entirely new incentive structures.

52
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.530
Maybe we can incentivize people not to merely mind blocks,

53
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:34.660
but to do social good for the world,

54
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:39.490
to volunteer to help make the lives of other humans better in ways that were

55
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:41.500
previously not profitable.

56
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.900
We could also incentivize them to store files,
share computing power,

57
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.020
collaborate in all sorts of novel ways.

58
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.400
It coin was the first decentralized application or dap.

59
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.481
In my book,

60
00:03:55.481 --> 00:04:00.481
I talked about a new business model where users could get paid by apps specific

61
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:05.680
tokens for their contributions and they could use these app tokens to access

62
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.650
certain features.
If the APP was successful,

63
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.500
these tokens would accrue in value over time.

64
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.270
This idea was later dubbed initial coin offerings or ics and it became the

65
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:21.271
defacto way that any decentralized startup raise money and just a few lines of

66
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:25.390
code most often done on a blockchain network called etherium.

67
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.720
Anyone could create a new market issuing a set of tokens to people globally.

68
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.010
They could raise money not from venture capitalists but from the crowd.

69
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.370
The problem with the ICO model is that we've seen so many low quality proof of

70
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:44.470
concepts,
meaning during the public sale,

71
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.480
lots of these startups only have a white paper and a website,
no code.

72
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.040
It was perverted from an innovative way to raise startup capital without selling

73
00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:59.041
your soul to venture capitalists to how fast can we scam a whole generation of

74
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:03.700
crypto suckers out of their money before regulators catch us every time some

75
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:07.420
scammer gets caught.
I imagined the yacht seen from wolf of Wall Street.

76
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:09.880
I've watched it like 500 times.
I was,

77
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:14.710
however glad to see a surge in new dapps being created at least a thousand of

78
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:19.120
them in the past few years,
but on almost every dimension,

79
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.030
they are worse than their centralized counterparts.

80
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.160
Decentralized apps are slower,
there are more expensive,
less capable,

81
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.200
have worse user experiences.
They have volatile and uncertain governance.

82
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.330
They are not a pleasure to use as much as I'd like them to be except for Crypto

83
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:42.250
kitties and that's because there are certain structural tradeoffs that results

84
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.170
directly from the primary design goal of these services that's prioritized above

85
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.510
all others.
Decentralization,

86
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.350
we need only look back at the history of the Internet to see the parallels

87
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:57.380
between the rise of the early web and this new decentralized web.

88
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.580
The dotcom bubble was caused by crazy high valuations,

89
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.930
ill informed speculation and Utopian promises of a better future.

90
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.410
If there's one takeaway we should have from that era,

91
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.510
it's that digital networks and code aren't a solution to human brokenness.

92
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.430
Instead of leading us to truth,

93
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.930
the Internet gave us all an opportunity to build our own personal knowledge

94
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:21.764
universe,

95
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.770
which catalyze a detachment in society from actual fact that has led to the rise

96
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:30.320
of propaganda fed authoritarianism globally.

97
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.100
Instead of freeing ourselves from the manipulation of corporations and

98
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:38.300
governments,
the Internet became the most powerful tool of surveillance,

99
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.800
behavioral manipulation and control ever created in human history.

100
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.710
We should hold onto our idealism.
As developers,

101
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:48.590
we're building this new world and the code we write,

102
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.390
the applications we build will deeply affect the future of humanity,

103
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.190
but we need to be careful to not fall victim to the same exact fallacies that

104
00:06:58.191 --> 00:07:03.191
are hacker forebearers embraced in the 90s we've learned a lot in this past

105
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.570
decade about what doesn't work so far.
It's not decentralization,

106
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.310
but convenience.
That's been the commodity our generation values the most.

107
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.533
In fact,

108
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.540
we value convenience so much that we choose to use services like Amazon despite

109
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.950
how it treats its workers and despite how it's becoming increasingly pervasive

110
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.200
in every aspect of our lives.

111
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.030
But it turns out that there is a growing trend of distrust towards centralized

112
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.040
everything over the past few years,

113
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.850
and that is now starting to include the biggest tech companies.

114
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Data regulation laws are being enacted across the world and people are waking up

115
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.550
too many problems with centralized services.

116
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:51.260
We shouldn't be building more trust,
less systems.
Instead,

117
00:07:51.261 --> 00:07:52.970
we should be building more trust,

118
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:58.120
full systems systems that allow us to more easily trust other humans.

119
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.520
Trust isn't something that we need to remove the need for.

120
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.220
It's something to strengthen with technology.

121
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:09.580
It's going to take a societal shift in consciousness towards valuing things like

122
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.300
privacy,
data ownership,
and algorithmic transparency.

123
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.750
But that's not hard to imagine.
Until recently,

124
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.980
encrypted messaging was only used by hackers,
spies and this guy,

125
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.260
but in the post Snowden era,

126
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.410
everyone seems to be using signal or telegram.

127
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.020
WHATSAPP is end to end encrypted.

128
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.870
The press solicit tips through secure drop,

129
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.270
and of course the technology improved,

130
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.290
but it's mainly changes in society that drove that adoption.

131
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:44.650
Humans will deploy any technology for both good and evil for the realization of

132
00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:47.810
freedom and tyranny for charity and for greed.

133
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.400
So let's move fast and iterate on what we've learned.
To begin,

134
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:57.430
let's all start using the term distributed ledger technology or DLT instead of

135
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:01.740
blockchain.
The Enterprise has already started to adopt that term.

136
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:05.070
It's less triggering and more generalized a term.

137
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:10.130
It pushes away from blockchains association with the wild west of crypto in ics.

138
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.130
Next,

139
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:15.780
I want to demonstrate for real world uses of this technology that profitable

140
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:19.770
businesses have already been built on in finance,
medicine,

141
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.070
manufacturing,
and government.
Let's start with finance.

142
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.090
Over 2 billion people in the developing world remain unbanked.

143
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.550
That's one in every five adults,

144
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.840
financial inclusion is considered a key factor in poverty reduction.

145
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.550
The unbanked population of global utilities customers has gone largely

146
00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:39.480
unrecognized.

147
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.950
They've been left to wait in line at local utility offices to make payments in

148
00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:48.180
hard currency,
often in uncomfortable and unsafe areas.

149
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.030
This all feeds into a cycle of poverty,

150
00:09:51.031 --> 00:09:55.410
disabling them from financial stability and thus stoking the fires of political

151
00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:56.190
instability.

152
00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:01.020
But humanic is a startup using DLT to create an identifiable bank account for

153
00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:02.610
any human in the cloud.

154
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.120
That's one piece of the financial inclusivity puzzle.

155
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:11.190
Next comes credit services like bloom are being used as a basis for risk

156
00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:12.810
assessment and credit scoring.

157
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.890
This allows people to gain access to their credit worthiness and lets them use

158
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:17.724
credit cards.

159
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:22.790
It tracks a user's credit score over time to verify who is safe debt or could be

160
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.100
by using DLT.
Biblio graph allows people to save,

161
00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:30.000
transfer and invest their wealth.
Creating a cycle of wealth generation.

162
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:35.220
There are so many processes and services that our bank provides and we can

163
00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:39.690
decouple each of those and turn each of them into standalone businesses that can

164
00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:42.750
provide financial inclusion for people in the developing world.

165
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.840
Next is medicine ever wonder why you have to fill out a new form every time you

166
00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:49.530
see a new doctor.

167
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.800
Most healthcare is provided by separate independent practices without efficient

168
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:57.990
methods of communicating with each other.

169
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:03.290
We could store that data on a server but controlled by who medical data is

170
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:04.194
sensitive.

171
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:09.230
Encrypting it and storing it on a DLT empowers patients with a self sovereign

172
00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:10.200
health identity,

173
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:15.300
a global holistic record of encrypted medical data that can be shared between

174
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.370
any health provider you choose.

175
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:21.870
That's what meant health is working on it's tamper proof since the lts are

176
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:26.400
immutable technology so the patient doesn't have to worry and this idea of

177
00:11:26.401 --> 00:11:31.050
sharing data between multiple parties that don't know each other can be applied

178
00:11:31.051 --> 00:11:34.620
to any kind of supply chain.
In a typical supply chain scenario,

179
00:11:34.621 --> 00:11:38.790
there are multiple independent parties that take some payload from point a to

180
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:41.880
point B and there has to be a way to keep track of it all.

181
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:46.710
An Independent tamperproof ledger that records where and when some product has

182
00:11:46.711 --> 00:11:49.800
been delivered is what a DLT can uniquely provide.

183
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.620
Suku is doing just that and efficient,

184
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:57.280
transparent and collaborative bash board that let's each party see where the

185
00:11:57.281 --> 00:12:00.820
product is in whichever industry.
And just last month,

186
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:05.850
West Virginia became the first state in the u s to allow people to vote online

187
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.890
using a DLT in a federal election,

188
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.960
piloting the program for military and other voters living overseas by partnering

189
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:16.390
with the Boston based Startup called votes.

190
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.420
The APP works by recording boats on the ledger.

191
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:24.430
Then facial recognition tech verifies the voters identity by comparing it to a

192
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:26.530
driver's license or other photo id.

193
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:30.790
And their vote is recorded on the ledger where each is mathematically proven.

194
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.770
Anyone can vote from anywhere in the world with no potential for human error.

195
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.270
Since it's tamper proof,

196
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:42.450
144 West Virginia voters stationed in 30 countries cast their ballots with boats

197
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.130
for the 2018 midterm election.

198
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:50.340
The ICO model is already evolving into Iti or equity token offerings and an Eto

199
00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:56.380
investors are issued actual equity tokens which give them an unparalleled level

200
00:12:56.381 --> 00:13:00.190
of legal protection by providing them rights.
Similar to equities.

201
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.810
This means far less scamming.
Scalability is definitely an issue,

202
00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:09.100
but vitalic Scott,
some really cool ideas involving quadratic sharding.

203
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.900
He wants it theory.
I'm to be operating at visa levels and three years.
Using it.

204
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:19.180
Sharding means splitting the entire states of the network into a bunch of

205
00:13:19.181 --> 00:13:23.980
partitions called shards that contain their own independent piece of states and

206
00:13:23.981 --> 00:13:25.240
transaction history.

207
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.170
Certain nodes would process transactions only for certain shards,

208
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:34.000
allowing the throughputs of transactions processed in total across all shards to

209
00:13:34.001 --> 00:13:39.001
be much higher than the current standard and wild bitcoin is definitely slow.

210
00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:44.071
It's still an immutable ledger side chains that use faster consensus mechanisms

211
00:13:44.111 --> 00:13:49.111
like proof of stake can be pegged to bitcoin allowing for a second layer of

212
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.143
operability.

213
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.830
This is something that developers in this space are excited to have fully

214
00:13:53.831 --> 00:13:57.150
developed in 2019 using side chains,

215
00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:01.630
we can take advantage of bitcoins,
immutability and decentralization,

216
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.700
avoid its volatility,

217
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:08.790
and also leverage the speed of a much faster consensus mechanism on a different,

218
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.450
the Lt.
Overall.
Three things to remember from this video.

219
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.740
The distributed ledger technology space is still evolving.

220
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.360
We've learned a lot from ICO scams and subpar decentralized apps.

221
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:27.010
There are profitable businesses using DLT out there right now providing

222
00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:31.150
financial services to the developing world and in a few other fields.

223
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.360
And moving forward we can focus on scaling solutions like quadratic sharding and

224
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:41.380
proof of stake side chain to Bitcoin to create the depths of the future.

225
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.120
Where do you think blockchain is going?

226
00:14:43.121 --> 00:14:46.150
Let me know in the comment section and please subscribe for more programming

227

For now,
I've got to use my bank,
so thanks for watching.
