00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.660
We have developed speed,

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.080
but we have shut ourselves machinery that gives abundance,

3
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.920
has left us in one of our knowledge,
has made us cynical,
our cleverness,

4
00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:10.060
hard and unkind.

5
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.140
We think too much and few to little more than machinery.

6
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.000
We need humanity more than cleverness.
We need kindness and gentleness.

7
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.230
Without these qualities,
life will be violent and all will be lost.
How was never?

8
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.620
My parents got so mad.
It said study for school.
I don't give a fuck about.

9
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.490
Don't try to grade me.
Don't tell me that.
Go Study Shit.
I have my own dreams.

10
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:39.030
Oh my own mind.
Online bitch tried to take me off line.

11
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:43.540
I got Sam trying to make my own way in this world,
trying to make it,

12
00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:45.970
give liberation a world so lonely.

13
00:00:45.971 --> 00:00:50.800
This just me wanting only real friends is hard.
So many phones,

14
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.880
it's all good.
I'm moving a panel with sub life is a marathon.

15
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.880
I've run til I throw up raised in Houston but moved up to Nyc to join that ivy

16
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.380
universities.
Damn right.
I would dazed and confused.
I refuse to lose.

17
00:01:05.381 --> 00:01:06.610
I had nothing to choose,

18
00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:11.611
but then down to lab for robots and that Shit had my name on do not despair and

19
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:14.480
misery that is now upon us is,
but the passing of greed,

20
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.110
the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress,

21
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.970
the heat of the men will pass and dictators day and the power they took from the

22
00:01:22.971 --> 00:01:26.690
people were returned to the people.
And so long as men die,

23
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.430
liberty will never perish.

24
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.440
It was help till the crack of dawn trying to find all the buckets in my mind,

25
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.550
trying to reach it online.
Then I'll walk straight up to professor.
Hey y'all,

26
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.880
can I work in your lab?
Sure.
And we hope you stay with words were sweet to mine.

27
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.240
Your assigned job,
starting playing with motors and gears.
No fear.

28
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.890
How would lead engineer revolution was here?
So visionary,

29
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.370
I made a robot start up trying to make a robot.
So hot toast,

30
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.990
then a coal,
clean your dish a whole lot but didn't work.
We felt a whole lot.
Ah,

31
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.650
no money,
no sales.
I lost.
The Passion was lost,

32
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.750
taken by Jack Frost.
No longer the boss.
Robotics was lost.

33
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.460
I've packed my bags.
I left for the West.

34
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.000
Maybe I could find purpose again.
I didn't fucking know

35
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.980
<v 1>you.
The people have the power,
the power to create machines,</v>

36
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.480
the power to create happiness.

37
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.560
You the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful to make this

38
00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:30.670
life a wonderful adventure.
Then in the name of democracy,
there's a shoes.

39
00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:31.504
That car

40
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.420
<v 0>shout out to SF.
My new home city.
Fucking love this place,
man.</v>

41
00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:41.620
It's so very pretty.
Ahmed's dichotomy.
Surat geology.

42
00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:46.170
I guess I learned robots with sale.
Hotson me,
I'd be machine learned in neuro.

43
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.560
Ooh,
go.
No alphabet.
All that shit rolled is in flames.

44
00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:54.730
We got to make shit better.
It makes them robots do some real shit that matters.

45
00:02:54.731 --> 00:02:59.110
I'm tired of all the pain
all day.
All the lies,

46
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.640
all the wars,
all his by trying to make shit blow up for miles.

47
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.560
Kind of make us wild.
Back to the Ribbon Nile.

48
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.440
We got to put brains in the robots.
Make them so smart.
So Hi Vic.
Shit.

49
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:15.920
A whole lot.
Then we've free to do a whole lot.
Yeah.

50
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.010
<v 2>Hey,
I think we can do it.
Don't you?</v>
