00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.490
Ai Is my Citi.
Hello world.

2
00:00:02.491 --> 00:00:06.420
It's the Raj and what is the best laptop for machine learning?

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.280
It's a popular question I get asked and in this video I'm going to talk about

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.430
the best laptop desktop and DIY system for machine learning as well as the best

5
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:22.530
cloud options when it comes to choosing the right machine for machine learning,

6
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.560
you are usually choosing between the two factors,

7
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.180
portability and processing power.
The higher the processing power,

8
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.070
the heavier the laptop is,
thus the less portability it has and vice versa.

9
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.990
Also,
the higher the power,
the lower the battery life and portability again,

10
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:40.824
takes a hit.

11
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.420
There are a few important components that you should think about when buying a

12
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:50.280
laptop for ml,
specifically ram,
GPU processing,

13
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.360
storage,
and the operating system.
When it comes to Ram,

14
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.570
the minimum amount you need is eight gigabytes.

15
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.600
Although 16 gigs is what I recommend for faster processing for heavy ml

16
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.570
algorithms like neural nets or random forests.

17
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.990
Rams important since it significantly speeds up computation time for training AI

18
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.620
algorithms,

19
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.910
but no feature is more important than what GPU you're using.

20
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.990
Deep learning.

21
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.580
The most popular subfield of machine learning involves in neural networks.

22
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.580
It's also the most computationally expensive.

23
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.970
It requires calculating massive amounts of matrix operations to train and GPU is

24
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.630
enable highly parallelized matrix operations,

25
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.290
which speed up the process.
With no GPU training,

26
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:45.090
a model could take months,
whereas with the right one it could take an hour.

27
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.390
It allows you to quickly iterate over different versions of your neural network

28
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.440
and speeds up the entire research and development pipeline by orders of

29
00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:56.274
magnitude.

30
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.580
Making the right choice here is critical and video brought desktop class

31
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:05.550
graphics to laptops with the g force 10 series.

32
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.560
Picking from one of these that are in your price range are the best gps to get

33
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.670
for a laptop.

34
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.010
Most deep learning libraries like tensorflow and Pi Torch use the Kuda

35
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.873
processor,

36
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.680
which compiles only on Nvidia cards and looks like you missed the boat buddy.

37
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.130
If you want to use a machine powered by an AMD or Intel HD Gpu,

38
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.420
you should be prepared to write some low level code in open cl.
For a processor.

39
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.720
The minimum requirement would be an intel I five.

40
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.460
Also the [inaudible] seventh generation would be ideal for storage.

41
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.210
You should have one terabyte minimum of hard disk space.

42
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.420
Since data sets seem to be getting bigger day by day,

43
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.870
if you're choosing to go for a machine with an SSD,

44
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:56.871
make sure it has two 56 gigs of SSD storage available else you might have to

45
00:02:57.181 --> 00:03:01.360
purchase an external hard drive.
Lastly,
for an operating system,

46
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:03.310
you'll want to go with Linux,

47
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:08.311
although both Mac and windows can run Linux as either a virtual machine or on

48
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:12.370
startup using software like bootcamp or parallels.

49
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.870
So when it comes to the best laptop to get at the highest end,

50
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.550
a startup called lambda labs wins here with their or book laptop.

51
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.880
They're using an Nvidia GTX 10 70 GPU and Intel I seven processor there.

52
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.300
Max version looks truly remarkable and they've also taken the time to pre

53
00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:38.301
install a bunch of popular machine learning libraries like tensorflow and Pi

54
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.010
Torch that includes all the relevant to Kuda libraries and video GPU drivers as

55
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.800
well as developer tools like them,
emacs and t mucks.

56
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.490
It's made for deep learning and ready to go out of the box,

57
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:53.470
but they are pretty pricey though.

58
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:58.420
So for a middle range budget to Nvidia has aligned of gaming laptops called the

59
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:03.400
g force GTX 10 series line powered by their pascal architecture.

60
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.600
The 10 series dropped the distinction between desktop and mobile cards,

61
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:12.400
so you won't be giving up as much peak performance as in the past by getting a

62
00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:13.234
laptop.

63
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.540
Msi is the best of the bunch packing in some serious computing power into a

64
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:23.020
relatively lightweight laptop and you can buy it from a bunch of online

65
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:27.190
retailers including Amazon,
although they're marketing them for gaming,

66
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.030
they are very well suited for any kind of machine learning.

67
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.090
If you don't have the budget for one of these,

68
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.360
I'd recommend just getting the cheapest laptop you can code on and connect to

69
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:42.160
the Internet with like a Chromebook,

70
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.720
you can then use all the money you saved for thousands of hours of compute time

71
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:51.721
on one of the many AI cloud computing platforms that have GPU like AWS,

72
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.820
Microsoft Azure,
or Google cloud.

73
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.990
A zero generally has the lowest on demand pricing.
Well,

74
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:02.080
AWS runs in the middle of the pack.
Yes.

75
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:04.270
I just endorsed a Microsoft product.

76
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:08.080
Where is your God now in terms of the easiest service to use?

77
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.700
I'd say Floyd hub wins.

78
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.650
It's a layer on top of AWS and the learning curve isn't steep at all.

79
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.710
You can train models really intuitively.
Also,

80
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:21.880
the reason I use a Mac book pro is because I love the form factor.

81
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.380
Final cut pro is my safe place and I use a separate desktop machine for any

82
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:31.381
training tasks I have and if you want to connect an existing GPU externally to

83
00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:36.280
your Mac book,
you can do that thanks to Nvidia's Pascal drivers for Mac.

84
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.640
Just connect your GPU to an external enclosure like a kitty oh node then

85
00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:44.950
connected to the Mac book via a thunderbolt three cable.

86
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.800
Then you'll need to run a little script to get it set up,

87
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:51.070
which I'll link to in the video description,
but right.

88
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.190
Speaking of desktops,
if you opt for one,

89
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.560
the price ceiling is much higher.

90
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.070
These can get pretty expensive at the high end.
I found that again,

91
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.640
lambda labs make some really incredible machines.

92
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.940
These are built specifically to train deep learning models in 2018 it's made for

93
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:12.740
some serious researchers and teams of them.

94
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.200
The Quad model is the best of the best.

95
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:17.750
It allows multiple engineers to work together.

96
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.490
The basic model starts with for Nvidia,

97
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.680
10 80 ti IGP use with an Intel I seven processor.

98
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.930
The con is that it's 8,800 bucks,
which is like 10 years worth of soylent.
Now,

99
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:34.340
a more affordable way to buy a deep learning desktop is to build it yourself.

100
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.550
This can actually be a very fun project.
In fact,

101
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.580
you can make a really great one with just $1,700 I wouldn't recommend getting a

102
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.770
Gpu from any company other than Nvidia.

103
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.640
They make the best in the world and Kuda is a valuable tool.

104
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.750
The GTX 10 80 ti,
I and Titan next are similar,

105
00:06:53.751 --> 00:06:57.260
although the GTX 10 80 TEI is less expensive,

106
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:02.350
so that one makes the most sense for a CPU and Intel high five works great.

107
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.990
It's cheap,
but good enough not to slow things down.

108
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.080
We also don't want to forget about the PCI.

109
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.260
Elaine's supported by the CPU and motherboard.

110
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:14.390
As Andre carpathy has pointed out,

111
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.780
each GPU should have 16 lanes so it eats data as fast as possible.

112
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.810
That means for two cards we need 32 PCI lanes.

113
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.190
32 gigs of Ram should do.
You can get to 16 gig sticks.

114
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.400
Jeremy Howard has suggested getting a fast SSD disk to keep the ols on and the

115
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:38.180
current data on and then a slow spinning hard drive for the huge datasets like

116
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:40.190
image net.
For a motherboard,

117
00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:45.191
we'll need one that's capable of supporting two GTX 10 80 tis and asis has a

118
00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:49.730
great one called Tuf z to 70 for a power supply.

119
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:54.731
The EVG a seven 50 GQ has an unbolted to give the GPU and CPU lots of power and

120
00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:57.650
when it comes to a case,

121
00:07:57.651 --> 00:08:02.090
a thermal lake end 23 will do just fine LEDs optional.

122
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.420
Putting it all together is a separate tutorial,

123
00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:10.280
but all in all it should come out to just under $1,700 I've got links to

124
00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:12.890
everything I've talked about in the video description.

125
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.710
If you're going to do a lot of deep learning,

126
00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:20.570
it's generally cheaper to just buy your own hardware and train on that.

127
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.420
Three things to remember from this video.

128
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.720
The best laptop to get for machine learning in order of budget is either the

129
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:30.320
lambda labs tensor book,

130
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.570
the Nvidia Gtx 10 series or a Chromebook with cloud computing credits.

131
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.860
The best desktop to get for machine learning is in order a budget,

132
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:45.020
the lender labs,
quad computer or a DIY $1,700 machine,

133
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.610
and for cloud options,

134
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.240
a zero offers the cheapest on demand instances,

135
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.780
and the easiest service to use for beginners is Floyd hub.

136
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.130
Essentially a wrapper around AWS.
You made it to the end.
Hit subscribe,

137
00:08:58.131 --> 00:09:01.400
and I'll be your GPU for Valentine's Day.
For now,

138
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.430
I'm going to run the school of Ai,
so thanks for watching.
