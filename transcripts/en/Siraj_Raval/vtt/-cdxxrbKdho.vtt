1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.860
Tonight we code in Python.
Hello world.

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.690
It's a Raj and what is the best programming language to learn for machine

3
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:10.524
learning?

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.590
There are a lot of options out there and it can be kind of confusing to pick

5
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:16.524
one.

6
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.530
While it seems beneficial to learn multiple languages since they all have their

7
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:23.460
unique features,

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.640
it's important to avoid overwhelming yourself by picking just one to start.

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.640
Machine learning has been around for decades now and more and more companies are

10
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:40.971
adopting machine learning techniques to improve their products and services

11
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.023
every day.

12
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.510
Some unsuccessfully like apple and with this rise in popularity,

13
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.970
almost every programming language is adding their support for machine learning

14
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.390
algorithms,
but one in particular stands above the rest.

15
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.660
Back in 91 when Guido van Rossum open sourced his side project language,

16
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:04.050
he called Python,

17
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.210
he likely didn't think that it would be the worlds fastest growing programming

18
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:11.580
language two decades later.

19
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.970
If we look at stack overflow traffic in terms of the questions that are asked

20
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:18.780
for specific languages,

21
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.050
it's clear python now has the lead and if we project into the future,

22
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.030
that lead increases by a bigger margin.

23
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.250
The reason for this is that python was built for readability and ease of use.

24
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.390
It's based on the concept of object oriented programming,

25
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.910
but can be used for simple scripting.

26
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.110
It's a great language for a beginner to get started with.

27
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.410
Keywords aren't filled with jargon and often use plain English to describe

28
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:49.590
concepts.

29
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.890
Most machines come pre installed with it and we can even run python code

30
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.680
directly from the command line or terminal using the built in compiler.

31
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.990
Think about all the incredibly rich fascinating concepts that machine learning

32
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:11.001
literature is full of like attention mechanisms or multiagent cooperative

33
00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:14.790
systems or Drake a dancing AI.

34
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.060
These are nontrivial concepts that require a grasp of linear Algebra,

35
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.571
calculus,

36
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:26.571
and probability theory to understand fully and because these concepts require

37
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.520
some time to learn,

38
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.870
it's best if the language involved is relatively simple to learn.

39
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.850
Python,
let's data scientists focus on the complexity that matters.

40
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.280
The Algorithm,
not the syntax,

41
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.350
and python at this point has a package to deal with pretty much any machine

42
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:50.940
learning task you can think of wanting to do computer vision.
There's open CV.

43
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.440
How about text and Ltk data?
Preprocessing pandas,

44
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.480
general purpose machine learning,

45
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.570
so I get learn tensorflow and the newly christened Pi Torch of course Web Apps,

46
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.390
Djengo data visualization map,
plot line and these are just a few.

47
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.660
These packages offer a very small learning curve in a Jupiter notebook made

48
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:14.860
originally for python.

49
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.070
You can see the results for each line of code in real time and if you don't want

50
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:24.160
to use these libraries you can use the matrix math library,

51
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.280
num Pi to build any machine learning algorithm you'd like from scratch with just

52
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:31.690
some minor changes to the source code.

53
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.840
Python can run on lots of different types of operating systems and environments.

54
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.690
It's got an amazing developer community as well,

55
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:43.660
whether it's on stack overflow or get hub,

56
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.290
there is free support available for those who ask.

57
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.530
Best of all it's production ready.
Facebook,

58
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.590
the world's largest social network uses python for 21% of its code base and

59
00:03:57.041 --> 00:04:02.041
while it might be a slight pain to upgrade code from python two to python three

60
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.210
it's totally worth it for the other benefits the language provides.
Now,

61
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.230
like I said,

62
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:12.340
there are a lot of programming languages for machine learning out there,

63
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:15.940
but if I were to pick a second choice after python,

64
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.890
and this might be controversial to some for me to say,
I'd say it's Javascript,

65
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.180
love it or hate it.

66
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:27.181
Javascript is the language of the web and it has one of the widest install bases

67
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.620
of any language or framework.

68
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.950
Pretty much any modern personal computing device has a web browser installed,

69
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.010
be that an older smartphone or a super computer.

70
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.310
That fact alone means that machine learning in the browser can serve all of

71
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:45.520
those devices.

72
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.790
JS is evolving at a rapid speed often in domains nobody would have thought a

73
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.320
couple of years ago from embedded systems to of course machine learning and it's

74
00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:59.290
not all about web development to anymore.

75
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.110
Recently Google released tensorflow dot.

76
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:07.111
JS which is just one of several examples of a machine learning framework in Java

77
00:05:08.131 --> 00:05:11.890
script that utilizes client side machine learning.

78
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.310
That means that the algorithm can be run directly on the user's device without

79
00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:19.420
needing to talk to a server.

80
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.490
So applications like recommender systems can serve you options,

81
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:29.491
whether you are at home on the go or completely disconnected from the Internet.

82
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.340
It uses the web GL library to help train models in the browser which uses the

83
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:40.861
CPU or Gpu of the client device to accelerate matrix math executions.

84
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.670
The number of javascript libraries for machine learning is increasing and a look

85
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:50.860
at get hub activity helps us confirm that.

86
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.840
Of course javascript has its own equivalents to all the python machine learning

87
00:05:55.841 --> 00:06:00.680
libraries I've mentioned as well as its own popular web development libraries

88
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:05.681
like you react and angular development is moving fast for all of these.

89
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.801
Okay.

90
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:11.801
I do have to do a special shout out to both c plus plus and Kuda tensorflow.

91
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.260
The most popular machine learning library currently has a great python

92
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:17.840
framework,

93
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.840
but for the most part the core isn't actually written in python.

94
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.590
It's a combination of super optimized c plus plus and Kuda,

95
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.600
which is Nvidia's language for programming Gpu.
They used the Eigen,

96
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:37.601
high performance c plus plus and Kuda numerical library and and videos see you

97
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:43.601
Dnn library which offers GPU optimized functions like convolutions to help build

98
00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:45.470
the framework.

99
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.390
When we write out a model in tensorflow using python and hit run,

100
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.630
what's actually created is a data flow graph that says to take particular

101
00:06:55.851 --> 00:06:56.684
inputs,

102
00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.690
apply particular operations to them and supply the results as input to other

103
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:06.620
operations all executed by fast c plus plus code.

104
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.980
Both languages aren't nontrivial to learn but have a lot of low level libraries

105
00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:14.570
that help optimize speed immensely.

106
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.020
If you'd like to work on the infrastructure side of things,

107
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.830
c plus plus and Kuta would be great languages to learn.

108
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.000
So those are the most important languages in machine learning currently.

109
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:31.001
But I also want to say that Matlab is closed source plus expensive and our is

110
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:33.560
slower than python.

111
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:38.710
Neither is a good choice at all in terms of learning resources for python.

112
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:44.000
I've got a great playlist right here on Youtube called learn python for data

113
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:47.810
science and the book learn python the hard way.

114
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.850
Has a bunch of great examples to help you get started for Javascript,

115
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.200
the tensorflow.
Dot.

116
00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:59.201
Js Docs both on their website and on good hub offer some amazing examples to get

117
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:01.340
started.

118
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.340
Learning how javascript can be used to train and test ml models linked to

119
00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:11.390
everything will be in the video description.
