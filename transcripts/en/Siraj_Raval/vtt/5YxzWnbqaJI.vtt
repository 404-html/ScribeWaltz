00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
Hello world and Siraj and the technology that excites me more than anything else

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.260
is called a brain computer interface.
I'm going to talk about it philosophically,

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.213
theoretically,

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.220
and of course technically via a python demo that lets you control a robot with

5
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:21.360
your mind.
Nikola Tesla was one of the greatest scientists to ever live.

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.110
He invented the alternating current,
the radio,
the electric motor,

7
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.460
and so much more,
all of which make possible our modern way of lives.

8
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.290
In 1926 he was quoted as saying,
when wireless is perfectly applied,

9
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.320
the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain,

10
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.820
which in fact it is all things being particles have a real and rhythmic whole.

11
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.700
We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly.

12
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.030
Tesla perfectly predicted the modern smartphone.

13
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.030
The smartphone has only been around for two decades,

14
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.850
but it's already hard to imagine life without it.

15
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.150
Evolution has managed to squeeze 100 billion neurons into our biological

16
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.020
neocortex,
which if unfolded,
it's just the size of a small Napkin,

17
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.920
but like Tesla predicted.
There is also a digital brain,
a digital neo cortex.

18
00:01:08.921 --> 00:01:11.670
We're building the wires that connect the Internet together,

19
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.540
act like a highway network for what's essentially a giant nervous system.

20
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.640
Smartphones act as the bridge between our biological neocortex and our digital

21
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:21.240
one.

22
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.870
Researchers down that when people were asked to stop using their smartphones for

23
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:26.190
a long period of time,

24
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.960
they had a spike in heart rate and blood pressure as well as feelings of
anxiety.

25
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.640
There aren't actual physiological changes that occur when we're separated from

26
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:39.930
our phones and that makes sense.
Part of our identity who we are,

27
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.640
is already in the cloud in the form of our social media accounts and message

28
00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:49.230
history.
We're already cyborgs are smartphones are like a third arm.

29
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.730
And since our biological intelligence wasn't designed to be able to parse and

30
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:56.460
understand billions of data points at once,

31
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.930
we've created artificial intelligence is to help us do just that.

32
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.580
Almost every software app we use today uses AI in some way to learn from the

33
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:10.050
massive datasets being generated and deliver the insights we need instantly.

34
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.910
So Ai isn't just a feature,

35
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.500
it's a decisive smartphones act as a bridge between human and machine

36
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:17.334
intelligence.

37
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.630
But this global brain we're building for ourselves has some problems.

38
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.610
Since AI algorithms run everything and they're constantly being improved by

39
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.140
teams of researchers.

40
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.220
If they were to achieve consciousness and decide to go on strike,

41
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.780
our entire civilization would be crippled.
We couldn't get money from our bank.

42
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.870
We could communicate transportation and manufacturing would grind to a halt and

43
00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:43.410
we couldn't do anything about it.

44
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.650
These intelligent agents would have a clear advantage over us.

45
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.590
They'd have access to way more computing power and data.

46
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.700
Then our biological brains do.
For the first time in human history,

47
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.050
an intelligence explosion is occurring and if we're to continue to be at the

48
00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:01.840
forefront,
we've got a truly upgrade.
Our own intelligence,

49
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.830
according our smartphones every year,
can only take us so far.

50
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.840
It's too limiting a medium in terms of the input and output bandwidth as far as

51
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:13.630
output,
converting our thoughts into data via thumb.

52
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:18.550
Typing on a virtual keyboard is too slow and cumbersome around a few tens to a

53
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:21.050
hundred bits per second.
In terms of input.

54
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.510
Our eyes are much higher bandwidth using our eyes to process data from say,

55
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.750
newsfeeds is on the order of a few megabits per second.

56
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.040
The only way of getting past these limitations would be directly capturing

57
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:35.290
signals from the brain itself.

58
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.060
We need a device that would act as a brain computer interface that would

59
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:44.530
maximize the bandwidth of the interaction between our biological and digital

60
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:47.230
brain,
making it much more fluid and natural.

61
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.440
It would give us read and write access to our own brain.

62
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.320
Basically open sourcing it and if we could do that,

63
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.890
the possibilities are endless.
Depression,
anxiety.

64
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.140
Think of all of these as tuning knobs.

65
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.740
Neural technology will let us become masters of our own minds,

66
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.520
letting us achieve any mood or emotion or mental state we'd like.

67
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.450
We'd be able to connect with people in ways we never thought possible.

68
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.950
Sharing memories directly,
elevating the intimacy of love and friendship.

69
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:19.750
A thousand fold.
We truly be able to understand and empathize with any human.

70
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.180
Imagine an APP store for the mind.

71
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.190
We could download packaged virtual experiences and memories directly into our

72
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:30.400
brain.
Downloading new skills like foreign languages,

73
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.090
even entire graduate school curriculums into our head,

74
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.530
and he would take seconds smartphones with a first step in this direction,

75
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.510
but that medium has also acted as a barrier between us and fully experiencing

76
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:47.890
our reality.
So how do we create this brain computer interface?

77
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.250
Let's look at the timeline of progress in this field.

78
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.610
In 1924 the German neuroscientist Han's Berger was the first to discover the

79
00:04:57.221 --> 00:04:59.110
brain's electrical activity.

80
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.460
He placed needle electrodes under the scalp of patients who had lost some of

81
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:05.050
their skull bones in surgery.

82
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.980
His device was called the electroencephalogram or EEG.

83
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.450
A few decades later,

84
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.480
Darpa initiated a private program to further explore brain communications using

85
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.870
EEG technology for military use.

86
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.220
But it wasn't until [inaudible] 98 that an actual implant was placed inside the

87
00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:27.520
human brain.
It was for a stroke victim who couldn't speak.

88
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.750
So a team of researchers decoded the high quality signals they received such

89
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:35.770
that he could slowly spell out words by picking out letters from an onscreen

90
00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:36.604
keyboard.

91
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.500
In Oh five a monkey's brain was successfully used to control a robotic arm

92
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.030
showing that it was possible to convert these electrical signals into one way

93
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:48.850
interpretable commands by a machine three years ago.

94
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.400
The first direct brain to brain communication,

95
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.170
a simple yes or no was achieved by transmitting EEG signals over the Internet

96
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.300
between two people.
By focusing on the Yes light,

97
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.130
an EEG device generated a sense signal to the inquirer,

98
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.700
the the internet to activate a magnetic coil positioned behind the inquirer's

99
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:08.270
head,

100
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.800
which stimulated the visual cortex and caused the inquirer to see a flash of

101
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:17.570
light.
This demonstrated that we could both read and write to the brain a two way

102
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.270
communication and just two years ago a paralysis patient became the first

103
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.980
receive a sensory enhanced robotic hand,

104
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.440
which he controlled using just his brain.

105
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.800
It also allowed him to feel when the hand was being touched,

106
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.160
the hand was surgically wired directly to his brain,

107
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.800
providing him with two way electrical feedback.

108
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.530
Despite the signals coming from a robotic hand,

109
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.090
the patient said that the sensation of having his fingers touched was almost

110
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:47.540
natural.
Fast forward to present day.
Brian Johnson,

111
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:52.430
who sold his startup to paypal for $800 million is now building a company called

112
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:57.080
colonel after pledging 100 million of his own money to the operation,

113
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.280
which aims to build the neural tools that can read and write the underlying

114
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:02.900
functions of the brain.

115
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.650
Facebook recently announced that it's yearly conference that they were

116
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:11.651
developing a device that uses optical imaging to scan your brain hundred times

117
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:15.770
per second to let you translate your thoughts directly into text.

118
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.390
And of course the most notable attempt at this is by none other than Elon Musk

119
00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:21.170
himself,

120
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.880
who recently founded neuro link as a way to develop ultra high bandwidth brain

121
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:29.420
machine interfaces to connect humans and computers.

122
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.560
All of these companies are pretty secretive about the work they're doing.

123
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.600
You can get hints and glimpses by looking at their hiring pages as in the

124
00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:42.110
requirements for the type of people they're looking for.

125
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.310
They're usually people with experience in either neuroscience or machine

126
00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:51.050
learning,
brain surgery,
building of hardware,
or even all of the above.

127
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.320
There are two types of BCIS,
the invasive kind,

128
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.440
which required surgery and the noninvasive kind.

129
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.500
The noninvasive kind include measuring eye movements and pupil size oscillations

130
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:05.720
via camera using magnetic resonance imaging,

131
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.230
Aka an Mri or using an EEG device.

132
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.310
Pupil measurement research is still in its early stages and an MRI is an

133
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:18.311
incredibly bulky and expensive device that uses a magnetic field and radio waves

134
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:23.240
to produce detailed images of the brain currently limited to medical facilities.

135
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.160
However,
for EEG devices,

136
00:08:25.161 --> 00:08:29.390
there are some commercially available ones out there like the muse,
neuro,

137
00:08:29.391 --> 00:08:30.530
sky and emotive.

138
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:35.240
These are consumer EEG so that you can wear yourself and stream your own brains

139
00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:36.500
data to your computer,

140
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:41.600
allowing you to control all sorts of things with your mind is actually a lot of

141
00:08:41.601 --> 00:08:46.250
fun.
You can lift a rock in a three d simulation,
control our robots movement,

142
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.060
control mouse movements and type all with your minds.
For example,

143
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:55.061
the open BCI device is an open source EEG with up to 16 channels that you can

144
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:58.980
read from via a python library for easy access.

145
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.380
Once you've connected the board to your computer,

146
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.490
you can read from it by specifying which pins you'd like to read data from.

147
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.320
And once you have electrodes attached to each one and a devices on your head,

148
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.050
you can enable it to string the data to your machine.

149
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.220
You'll first be able to view that data in terms of numerical readings from

150
00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:21.880
terminal,
but with some javascript you can see it as a much prettier graph,

151
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.800
but are there any noninvasive mediums to write to the brain?
Well,

152
00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:26.730
just two months ago,

153
00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:31.731
a paper in cell reported a new noninvasive brain stimulation method from MIT

154
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.740
called temporal interference stimulation.

155
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:39.600
The technique is based around applying to electrical fields to the subjects
head.

156
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:44.490
Each field is applied using to scalp electrodes and the interaction between

157
00:09:44.491 --> 00:09:46.920
these fields create brain stimulation.

158
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.100
Invasive BCIS are an easier way to maximize our input output bandwidth,

159
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.230
but surgical implantation is difficult.

160
00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.060
The most obvious way is to use a closed loop implant similar to what's already

161
00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:02.130
been done to some disabled patients.

162
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.810
This involves cutting open the skull and Scalp and placing a very small chip

163
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:09.900
with many electrodes cramped into it.
Onto the brain.

164
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.440
This is obviously not preferred since it's really risky.

165
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.800
One idea originally from Scifi that Elon has expressed interest in is creating a

166
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:20.100
neural lace.

167
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.870
This is very thin silicon coated in a polymer with cross connections made purely

168
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.260
of polymer.
It's a programmable mesh of stretchy,

169
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:33.210
flexible silicon nanowires.
The meshes then put into a liquid making it curl up.

170
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:38.300
A syringe with the diameter as small as 100 micro meters can draw it up and

171
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:43.500
inject the mesh into specific regions of living tissue.
Once in the brain,

172
00:10:43.501 --> 00:10:48.501
it uncurled to about 80% of its original configuration sits on top of neurons

173
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.640
and starts moderating for humans.

174
00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:55.080
This could be implanted via an injection somewhere on the body traveled via the

175
00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:59.730
bloodstream and ultimately interface with neurons directly after crossing the

176
00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:03.600
blood brain barrier.
Another idea mentioned by one of neuro links,

177
00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:07.320
cofounders DJ set is creating neural dust.

178
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.770
These are tiny 100 nanometers silicon sensors.

179
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:15.630
The width of a hair that could live throughout the cortex and could be injected

180
00:11:15.631 --> 00:11:19.650
into the bloodstream,
similar to a neural lace on the outside.

181
00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:24.240
A super small device could communicate with the dust sensors via ultrasound

182
00:11:24.241 --> 00:11:26.550
inspired by RFID technology.

183
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:31.020
The same that's used for hotel key cards to unlock physical doors.

184
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.280
While these ideas are awesome,
we've got some problems solve first,

185
00:11:35.281 --> 00:11:40.230
like how does the brain work?
How can we record lots of neurons all at once?

186
00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:45.180
Can we build such small sensors and can they last in the body for a long period

187
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.133
of time?

188
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.100
And what does the neuro security stack that protects your brain from being

189
00:11:50.101 --> 00:11:55.101
hacked look like producing a reliable minimally invasive neural device that can

190
00:11:56.051 --> 00:12:01.051
both correctly read your mind and also stimulate neurons to write to your mind

191
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.560
is hard Aaf,
but as long as there are many smart people working on this,

192
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.680
the future looks bright.
New York shitty.

193
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:13.180
The winner of last week's coding challenge is Tim Kula Teralba Gpu programming

194
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:16.870
is for the bravest of programmers and 10 coolest sped up Mandelbrot set

195
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:19.270
visualization successfully with Kuda.

196
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:24.280
Check it out and the runner up is each on why we use Kuda to parallelize

197
00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:27.960
gradient descent.
The KUDA coat didn't result in any big speedups,

198
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.420
but a plus on the effort.
Please subscribe for more programming videos.

199
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:35.770
And for now,
I've got to try to interview Elan,
so thanks for watching.
