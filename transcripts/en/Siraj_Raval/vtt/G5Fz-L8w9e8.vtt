00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.720
Hello world.
Welcome this around geology.

2
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.600
I met the base impact hackathon in San Francisco.

3
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.453
<v 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.590
<v 0>There's a lot of great sponsors and partners that made this entire event</v>

5
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:15.100
possible.
Thank you.
Sponsor

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.460
crazy.
That guy.
I Dunno.
So what were you saying though?
Or are you saying though?

7
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.190
Well maybe you find that you maybe find new particle into data being read in

8
00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:30.620
really cool in a certain data and certain data or if you could,

9
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:35.621
if you could prove supersymmetry or not look disprove supersymmetry that's what

10
00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:37.890
people are looking for.
Maybe you'll find new physics.

11
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:41.510
So it would be reading for new physics would be awesome.
You should go for it.

12
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.880
Yeah,
you are.
You cause you,
you studied that stuff,
right?
What,

13
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.280
what kind of physics do you do?
I do theoretical,
solid state physics,

14
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:51.470
specifically quantum computing.
Okay.

15
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.090
Could you introduce yourself just in general?
In general.
All right.

16
00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:57.690
My name is [inaudible].
Uh,

17
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.310
I'm a physicist with a background in economics and from Germany currently

18
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:04.280
working at UC Berkeley.
And uh,

19
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.020
today we've got to do some data magic.
Oh yeah.
And uh,

20
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.120
what,
what got you interested in machine learning?

21
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.050
I think machines are gonna take over the future and want to be part of it.

22
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.650
Awesome.
And Are you excited for this hackathon?
How are you feeling?

23
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.830
I feel kind of tired to be very honest,

24
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.640
but I'm very happy because we found a really cool rule and their love drawing on

25
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.490
whiteboards.
One interesting fact and then why you're here today.
Sure.

26
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:31.230
When did you see back in June?

27
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:35.940
I'm biking from Vancouver to Allana and uh,
why am here today?

28
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:40.180
Uh,
I think that is impact's mission is pretty,
uh,

29
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.060
just exciting.
Um,

30
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.060
especially in silicon valley where I think like a lot of people are solving.

31
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.700
I'm kind of like not as as fundamentally important problems Matt.

32
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.910
Um,
for me I've always been interested in the data science for social good space.

33
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:58.050
I used to work in data science in the healthcare space.
For me,

34
00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.730
an interesting fact,
I'm half Filipino.
Okay.

35
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.820
I want to work on this because,
uh,

36
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.680
I feel like when we are technology workers,

37
00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:12.350
we've put a lot of energy behind making technology,

38
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.250
but I'm a little concerned that policy might not catch up.

39
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.090
So I really want to put a lot of energy behind that as well.

40
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.660
I feel this is very solution oriented.
Like this is like the output is very late.

41
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.340
You can grasp it.
It's like this is what we have,
this what we can do,

42
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.190
this is what you should do.
It kind of is like,
so from them,

43
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.160
from a data science perspective,
what,
what are we trying to do?
Like what,
okay,

44
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:45.140
so we have all this,
how do we figure out,
uh,
what you suggest to people?

45
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.450
Is it just based on what other people have chosen or,
um,

46
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.310
so that's one way to do recommender system,
right?

47
00:02:52.311 --> 00:02:53.210
Well that depends on what kind of,

48
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.940
Oh yeah,
we got the good stuff.

49
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.970
We got the good stuff.
Tobias,
are you excited to eat?

50
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.810
Are you excited to buy us such excited?
Wow.
Yeah,

51
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.370
maybe you're just
popular.

52
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.400
I feel like it shows your industry growth.
Average wage.

53
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.540
These are like recommended jobs and yeah,

54
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.560
you can search and it's just going to slice the data in the query and it goes on

55
00:03:34.011 --> 00:03:36.290
similar jobs.
You don't think me a monster page.

56
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.430
Hi Guys.
It's midnight.
It's time for me to leave the hackathon.
Check it out.

57
00:03:47.431 --> 00:03:48.330
A lot of people here,

58
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.740
you guys are just woke up.
Uh,
it's 90 of the next day.

59
00:03:58.741 --> 00:04:02.370
I'm heading back and judging ceremonies happening.
Let's go see what happens.

60
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.230
Very similar.
Okay,

61
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.220
great.
It's all good.
It's been a long,

62
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.170
how are you feeling?
Faith

63
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.130
is not working.
Pre Demo balloons.
We don't chat internally.

64
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.870
We have the wheel of death

65
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.820
complaints.
Referee,
the referee,
uh,
has,
uh,

66
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.960
sexy tech intentionally a novelists fraud or a malicious behavior that's

67
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.560
targeting certain groups.
