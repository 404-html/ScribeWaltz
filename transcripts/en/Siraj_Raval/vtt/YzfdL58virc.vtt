00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.710
Why'd the chicken cross the Mobius Strip to get to the same PSI?
Hello world.

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.950
It's Saroj and if you're interested in AI,

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.600
you're going to need to brush up on your math skills.
In this video,

4
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:17.601
I'll describe my strategy to learn mathematics as fast as possible.

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.260
Math is a specific powerful vocabulary for ideas.

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.120
Imagine a cook that only knows the descriptive words,
Yummy and Yucky.

7
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.370
If he makes a bad meal,
he has no way to describe it.
Is it too sour,

8
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.120
too dense,
too spicy?
That last one's impossible,

9
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:40.560
but all of these critiques are hazy variations of Yucky.

10
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.420
His vocabulary shapes what he's capable of thinking of.

11
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.140
In the same way math vocabulary shapes,

12
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:53.550
concepts and ideas that we're capable of thinking of.

13
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.700
It uses the rules embedded in our universe to create models and relationships

14
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.150
and the process of learning what these rules are has been iteratively refined

15
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.060
over millennium.
Take counting for example.

16
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.370
First there was the you narrowed system,

17
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:15.990
which was like drawing lines in the sand.
Then came Roman numerals,

18
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:18.810
which had shortcuts for large numbers,

19
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.950
then decimals and binary.
Then scientific notation.

20
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.900
And you can bet that in the future we'll have an even better system for counting

21
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.020
or take the word quantity.
For example,

22
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.490
we understand this concept.
It's considered common sense,

23
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.790
but this understanding includes concepts refined over millennia like base 10

24
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:46.560
notation,
zero decimals and negatives.

25
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.180
Now imagine improving your vocabulary for structure,
shape,

26
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.680
change and tense.
That's what Algebra,
geometry,

27
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.550
calculus,

28
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.550
and statistics come in all math concepts build on other math concepts.

29
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.250
Multiplication and division used to alluded geniuses millennia ago and now they

30
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:13.131
are homework for primary school kids as newer concepts require them as

31
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:16.020
prerequisites.
If you're like me,

32
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.050
you were likely taught Nath in a very boring way involving blind.

33
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.880
That memorization and speed testing,

34
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.730
it did improve my ability to fall asleep.
Fast.

35
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:31.731
Aaf though actually memorizing math facts is just a small part of mathematics

36
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.310
and being fast.
That math doesn't necessarily mean you're good at math.

37
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.820
There's this widespread myth that some people are math people and some people

38
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.533
aren't.

39
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.630
There's so much fear and boredom involved in introductory math curriculums with

40
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:56.610
very little real world application,
and if you don't believe you're good at math,

41
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.740
it will definitely affect your performance.

42
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.040
Neuroscience research shows that there is a strong connection between the

43
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.860
attitude that students hold about their own learning ability and their academic

44
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.024
performance.

45
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.240
So the first step before starting to learn any math subject is to believe that

46
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:23.380
you can work it.
Your brain is adaptable,
Aaf,

47
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.440
it can learn anything if you have the right motivation.

48
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.190
Don't worry if you don't get a concept right away.

49
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.290
Research shows that when you make a mistake in math,
your brain grows.

50
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.560
It's that period when our brains struggled to understand a concept that real

51
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.920
learning occurs.
You got to work it out like a muscle,

52
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:49.810
like any athlete would to complete a task,
no pain,
no gain,

53
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.050
right?
When it comes to picking a math topic,

54
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.240
pick the subjects that interest you.

55
00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.570
Don't waste your time learning subjects you don't care about like c sharp

56
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:02.140
development just cuts.

57
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.130
If you're like me and are interested in AI,

58
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.950
linear Algebra or the ability theory,

59
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.010
calculus and statistics are crucial concepts to understand the field,

60
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.680
each with a depth of knowledge to learn.

61
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.070
There are a wealth of great learning resources available to you to learn about

62
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.350
any of these textbooks.
However,

63
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.380
rarely focused on developing real understanding.

64
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.330
They're mostly about solving problems with a plug and chug formula.

65
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.400
For example,
the Pie taggery in Theorem isn't just about triangles,

66
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.850
it's about the relationship between similar shapes.

67
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.120
The distance between any set of numbers and more math is not a spectator sport.

68
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.890
While memorizing concepts is useful,
in order to actually learn,

69
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.630
you need to be solving problems and you should be solving problems that you

70
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.720
actually enjoy solving for it to be fun,

71
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.180
right for the memorization part,

72
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.270
just use a cheat sheet for any subject you want to learn about as a helpful

73
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:12.310
guide as you solve problems.

74
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.580
I've linked to several in the video description in terms of gamifying problem

75
00:05:17.771 --> 00:05:19.410
solving.
Brilliant.
Dot.

76
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.420
Borg has done a great job of making engaging content to learn about different

77
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:27.790
math subjects with a big variety of styles.

78
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.700
I highly recommend checking that website out.

79
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.800
You can also find a video games that help you learn about a math subject very

80
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.030
into,
for example,

81
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:42.031
lets you learn in calculus by using it to solve puzzles while playing a young

82
00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:46.180
woman who tries to save the planet from imminent destruction.

83
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.460
Wild true learn is a game that lets you play the life of a machine learning

84
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.460
developer using visual programming to make a living.

85
00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.090
Use the internet to find ways of learning whatever subject you are interested

86
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:06.170
in.
That's the best way to motivate yourself to actually learn it.

87
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.790
Make your own curriculum,

88
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:11.540
no need to follow existing courses if you don't want to,

89
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.820
you can use them for inspiration,

90
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:18.821
but develop a learning path that works for you on your time that fits your

91
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.830
goals.
Whatever subject you're learning,

92
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.820
make sure to take notes when you're taking notes.

93
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.880
Think of it as a teaching guide for someone who knows nothing about the subject.

94
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.350
The practice of explaining is the best way to learn any concept.

95
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.680
A great methodology to follow for creating explanations for a concept is called

96
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.560
adept or analogy diagram.
Example,

97
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.840
plain English and technical definition.

98
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.350
This is how you can teach yourself a difficult concept or explain one to others.

99
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.380
The first part,
analogy asks the question,

100
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.560
what else is this concept of like most new concepts are variations of what we

101
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:04.040
already know.

102
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:09.050
We've encountered millions of objects and experiences as we've aged.

103
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.160
Surely one of them is vaguely similar to this new topic.

104
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.520
Then make a diagram which engages the other half of your brain dedicated to

105
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:23.930
vision processing.
If we can create a diagram of imaginary numbers,

106
00:07:23.931 --> 00:07:27.650
we can see that it lets us rotate around the number line,

107
00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:29.510
not just move side to side.

108
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.900
Then give an example like what happens after four turns on these axes.

109
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.030
Describe it in plain English.

110
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:42.980
Once you have an example and the last way,
use a technical description.

111
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:48.230
This final step converts our personal understanding into formal notation.

112
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.530
It's like sharing a song you made.
You can home it,

113
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.860
but other people need sheet music of it to play it.

114
00:07:55.010 --> 00:08:00.010
Let's use this method in the context of studying the popular machine learning

115
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:01.490
course by professor.

116
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.600
Hang on Coursera who also liked a tweet that mentioned me.

117
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:09.500
I see you ang,
I see you.
Love you.
When studying.

118
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.500
If we see an idea that makes sense,

119
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.480
we can write it down in language that we ourselves would understand.

120
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:18.770
If it doesn't,

121
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.800
we can still write it down and then use the adept method to decompose it.

122
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:29.260
We can write down one sentence explanations for ourselves of any core concept

123
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:35.350
that makes sense to us and then later use these concepts as our own personal

124
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.330
cheat sheet to understand later material.

125
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.750
The course is chalk full of formulas that most people have never encountered

126
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.420
under advanced optimization.
For example,

127
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:52.310
if we're unclear why the negative sign is used in the formula,

128
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.160
we can make a note of that.
Then focus on concepts.

129
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:59.130
We already understand that like derivation.

130
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:04.580
It turns out that in derivation the natural log is expected to be negative and

131
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:09.891
sometimes the terminology can get confusing like using the word cost instead of

132
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.490
error.
If we take the time to write out explanations for each term,

133
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:16.020
we don't understand.

134
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.940
We can see that cost captures things outside the model like complexity,

135
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:24.120
which error alone doesn't encapsulate.

136
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.660
It's important to continuously try and create brief,

137
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.320
easily understandable explanations for everything we learn.

138
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.660
We could try and summarize the course by saying machine learning is all about

139
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:39.570
creating models with linear Algebra.

140
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:44.160
Then improving them with calculus.
Embrace your confusion.

141
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.050
It's okay to forget things.

142
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.060
Your notes are meant for you to record what you don't understand,

143
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.800
what you do understand in the process of how you come to understand.

144
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:56.670
Eventually,

145
00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:02.420
eventually you can make technical content for the public based off of your

146
00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:03.360
notes,

147
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.220
and that'll improve your understanding even more by making your vocabulary more

148
00:10:08.221 --> 00:10:11.760
broadly accessible.
Math is awesome,

149
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.780
and so it's hard work.
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

150
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.350
Let your curiosity guide your learning,
have goals,

151
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:24.300
and don't be afraid to be confused.
It's all apart of the learning process,

152
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.450
wanting to become a math genius.
If the subscribe button,

153
00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:31.470
and I will show you the way for now,
I've got to solve p equals NP,

154
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.030
so thanks for watching.
