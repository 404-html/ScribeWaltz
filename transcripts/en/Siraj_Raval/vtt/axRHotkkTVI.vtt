1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.140
Hey Dandelion,
how's it going?
Hey,
I'm doing pretty well and yourself pretty good.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.950
Do you mind if I asked you 67 questions?
Go for it.
So rush.
Cool.

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.390
How'd you get into work today?

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.380
Woke up,
spent a,

5
00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:19.590
I spent about a half an hour sort of enjoying company with the people I live

6
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:20.424
with and then drove

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.750
favorite part of the tensorflow staff?

8
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.990
Well I would have to say tensor boards since that's the case that I work on.

9
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.120
Favorite thing about working at Google?

10
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.540
There are a lot of different things I like about working at Google.

11
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.080
I think the thing that's most important to me is that I feel that Google as an

12
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:41.820
organization really cares about the impact it has on the world.

13
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.170
And so I've been in a lot of meetings where we've kind of been able to think

14
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.450
about how to deploy some technology that could help people.

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.290
And the conversation is always first like how can we do something that's useful?

16
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.190
And then the question of how will we make money is like,
ah,
you know,

17
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.750
let's do something important first.
And we can always figure that out later.

18
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.780
How would you describe your experience at Palentier?
Uh,

19
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.160
I would say I learned a lot and grew a lot as a developer.

20
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.910
If you could spend an evening,
Rick,
one famous person,
who would it be?

21
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.300
If I could spend an evening,
uh,
maybe Barack Obama.

22
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.980
You play any sports?
No.
Do you miss being a student?

23
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.170
I miss having such an abundance of people like living close by to me who I knew

24
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:29.400
in good socially interact with.

25
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.640
But on the whole I really like being employed as a software engineer.

26
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.990
What's your favorite fan?

27
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.560
It's really difficult to choose a single favorite band.
Uh,

28
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:45.380
I would say my favorite music is like very danceable fusion tunes.
Uh,

29
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.790
and as I sort of like organized by genre rather than brand.

30
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.060
Is there a programming language you really don't like it?
You know,

31
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.270
I've never been too fond of Java.

32
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.250
It seems like it really has a lot of boiler plate.
Uh,
and I often,

33
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.760
I often have a love hate relationship with Java script and that I wish it had

34
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:05.540
like static typing and a couple others.
Nice.

35
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.280
Maybe more consistent semantics programming,

36
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:10.660
language of choice for machine learning.
Uh,

37
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.640
it would have to be python since that's the Lingua Franca of machine learning.

38
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.360
And of course the tensorflow frontend is written in python.
Favorite professor.

39
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.240
I had a professor named Larry Mckenna niece at u Chicago and he was the head of

40
00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:25.230
the writing department.

41
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.620
And my conversations with him really shaped the way that I think.

42
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.120
How are you liking the Bayer?
I love living in the bay.
It's beautiful.

43
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:37.340
It has a lot of like fun,
weird people.
It's got a lot of great dancing.

44
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.850
It's got a lot of great piking.
Why do you choose to work on a,
on a,

45
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.710
I think that it's going to be really,

46
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.300
it has the potential to really impact a lot of people and it offers the

47
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:53.301
opportunity to like help create societies in which people are freer in which

48
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:56.520
there's more abundance.
And I'd like to be a part of that.

49
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.710
What's the most beautiful thing in the room?

50
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.220
It's difficult to choose single most beautiful things,
but as a pattern,

51
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.120
I refined it really fascinating how the world seems to self organize and to

52
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.670
these complex ecosystems and fractals and so forth.

53
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.360
So maybe the tendency of the world towards emerging self organization is the

54
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:25.090
thing I find most beautiful.
Last thing you made with your hands.

55
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.000
I have this floating light bulb,
sort of a piece of art.
Uh,
it has a,

56
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:40.360
an electromagnet and the base that suspends a light bulb above it.

57
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.930
And my friend Chaz and I took it apart and sort of redid the design.

58
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.730
So we switched it from having a really like polished modern look into a sort of

59
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:52.120
a grungy industrial wood.
And that was a fun project.

60
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.270
Robin,
do you miss your hometown town?
I prefer the bay area.

61
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.870
What website do you waste time on Facebook.

62
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.520
You get an all expenses paid trip to one city where you go,

63
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.300
uh,
probably is tenable.
But if I could time travel,

64
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:15.910
I would want to go back to Rome.
At the peak of Roman Empire,

65
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.410
would you visit Mars?

66
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.730
It depends on the terms and conditions and transit time.

67
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:23.410
And who else is there and what's going on.

68
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.660
What is one thing you can't live without

69
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.500
connection to other humans?

70
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.360
What was it like presenting at the tensorflow Dev Summit?
Uh,
it was pretty fun.

71
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.340
I really liked the content and I was really happy to get to share knowledge

72
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:43.510
about 10 board with the central floor community.
What text editor do you use?

73
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.650
I've been switching between sublime text and Adam.
Uh,

74
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.180
I was kind of excited about the fact that Adam is open source by find sublime

75
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.360
has better performance.

76
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.820
So I kind of haven't quite stabilized on one or the other.

77
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.570
What open source library you really like tensorflow?

78
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.820
What's one of your favorite movies?

79
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.720
I really like V for vendetta.
I really like the network.

80
00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:11.160
I really like Kenneth Brown,
his rendition of Hamlet.
Uh,

81
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.100
I saw Vicky,
Cristina Barcelona recently.
I thought it was great.

82
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.860
What inspired you to focus on deep learning?
Specific,
the whims of fate.

83
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.750
What was the first program you ever made in eighth grade?

84
00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:27.790
I made a little program for calculating time numbers.

85
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.920
What is one book you really like?

86
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.150
Well,
there's so many books.
Uh,

87
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.820
if I have to choose one,

88
00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:42.040
then it's like a really like I want to choose something quite good.

89
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.360
I really liked,

90
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.450
there's a book called Poor Charlie's Almanack and it's written by Charlie

91
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.540
Munger,
who's Warren Buffet's investment partner and it's sort of a collection of

92
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:56.380
aphorisms describing how he approaches living life.
Uh,

93
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.510
and I found that that to be really interesting.
Oh,
and I love Godel Escher Bach,

94
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.500
one of my favorite,
one of my favorite books that I've only read half of it.

95
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.690
And if I were to say books that I've only read the introduction,

96
00:06:06.691 --> 00:06:09.090
I would say Bertrand Russell's a history of western philosophy.

97
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.000
What's the bravest thing you've ever done?

98
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.540
I don't know.
If you were a Greek God,
who would it be?
Athena,

99
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.630
what is one piece of advice you'd give yourself 10 years ago?
Oh wait,

100
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.600
maybe I would choose like mercury or Hermes,

101
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.690
a one piece of advice that I would give myself 10 years ago.

102
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:39.050
Focus less on the intellect and you remember that not all truth is arrived at

103
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:43.640
spruce thinking.
What is a topic in machine learning you'd like to explore more?

104
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.310
I think there's a huge potential for using machine learning,
for creating tools,

105
00:06:48.311 --> 00:06:51.680
for augmenting human creativity.
So for example,

106
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:54.960
I'd like to get to a point where you can like doodle a cartoon,

107
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.320
storyboard it and then have machine learning,

108
00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:02.321
transform it into a finished cartoon with like voice acting and animation and

109
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.480
consistent design.

110
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.920
And I think that's a point where we might reach in the next uh,
two years.

111
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.400
Do you think will solve intelligence in your lifetime?
I have no idea.

112
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.300
If you were in the world,
what is one log you do that

113
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:22.210
I think if I ran the world I would try to your up better systems of government,

114
00:07:22.861 --> 00:07:27.330
like maybe having better voting systems so that we don't get the situation where

115
00:07:27.331 --> 00:07:28.860
people are all voting for the candidate.

116
00:07:28.861 --> 00:07:32.370
They at least dislike because I think that that candidate has like the best shot

117
00:07:32.371 --> 00:07:33.204
of winning the election.

118
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.310
Who is one person you looked up to when you were in college?
Warren Buffet.

119
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.950
What were you like as a kid in grade school?

120
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.680
I liked to read books and I would kind of hang out by myself and also play video

121
00:07:47.131 --> 00:07:49.980
games.
What's something that excites you about the future?

122
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:58.220
I'm excited by the idea that we can learn to have a society that's kind of more

123
00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:03.600
nurturing to people and focus less on competition and winning and more on like,

124
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.570
like expressing oneself and supporting and connecting with other humans.

125
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.160
If you were to start from scratch today,

126
00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:11.790
what is one resource you would use to learn machine mark?

127
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.700
I really like Chris Olah is a blog which is see yola dot get hub.io and uh,

128
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.640
that would be,
that would be a starting point for me.

129
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.880
What is one major unsolved research problem you'd love to tackle?

130
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.530
There's a lot of different things here,
like transfer learning,

131
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.410
unsupervised learning.
Uh,
I'm not sure.
I'm not really a researcher.

132
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:47.170
Probably learning too develop a model architectures or learning to come up with

133
00:08:47.611 --> 00:08:50.910
the right machine learning model.
What's more interesting?

134
00:08:50.911 --> 00:08:55.110
Generative models or discriminative models?
Generative.
If you can be a superhero,

135
00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:00.060
would it be
maybe iron man?
Although I would,
I think that the best,

136
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:02.040
the superhero with the best power is as document hadn't.

137
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.590
What's your spirit animal?
A alliance favorite computer scientist.

138
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.260
Jeff Dean.
If you had a time machine,
when would you visit?

139
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.500
So it depends if I'm visiting to check it out or visiting to say if I were

140
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:22.140
visiting to check it out like Rome at the height of empire,

141
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.580
assuming that I were fluent in Latin,
uh,
visiting.
Just stay.

142
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:30.990
I think maybe like living in a hunter gatherer society can be quite nice.

143
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:35.580
You actually use Google plus?
No.
Android or iPhone.

144
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.450
I have an iPhone.
What would surprise people about life at Google?

145
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:50.940
I was really surprised by this scope and raw power of Google infrastructure.

146
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.160
Uh,
I know it was pleasantly,
so I was,

147
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.790
