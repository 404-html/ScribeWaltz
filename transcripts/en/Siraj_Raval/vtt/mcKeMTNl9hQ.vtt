1
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.230
Hey Sebastian,
how's it going?
Hey,
yes.
Good.
Can I ask you 67 questions?
Sure.

2
00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:09.550
Or whatever.
Okay.
What's the culture like at you?
Udacity in one word.

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.780
A fearlessness will online learning,
replaced physical learning,

4
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.150
augment it and make it more accessible.

5
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.250
What's something you miss about where you grew up?
Um,

6
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.420
I would love to have grown up in silicon valley,
but people are just crazy.

7
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.330
What time do you wake up?
I wake up to be at eight o'clock.

8
00:00:25.331 --> 00:00:26.260
I'll bring my son to school.

9
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.820
What website you absolutely love to spend time on New York Times.
To be honest.

10
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.620
Favorite machine learning paper of 2016 we have one coming out in nature in

11
00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:38.080
about two weeks and I can't spill the beans,
but as machine learning,

12
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.560
if you could meet one person,
who would it be?
Um,
I love to,
uh,

13
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.060
meet avalanche terrain,
but he's dead.
Unfortunately.
They have a car.

14
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.230
A Tesla used to be a full time professor at Stanford.

15
00:00:50.231 --> 00:00:52.360
What was something surprising about that experience?

16
00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:54.850
That I wasn't kicked out because everybody else was smarter than me.

17
00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.010
Very nervous thing you've ever done.
Um,
I,
uh,
snowboarding down a cliff.

18
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.610
What is one thing that scares you?
A actually nothing.
Maybe.
Honestly,
I,

19
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.670
I live to be scared and love surprises.
Hey,
brain instrument,

20
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.600
uh,
as a child as follows,
the saxophone of many years.

21
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.940
<v 1>Sorry.
Sorry.</v>

22
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.110
<v 0>I hope you feel better.
Yeah.
It stuck to my mind.
Felt what's more interesting?</v>

23
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.550
Physics or neuroscience.

24
00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:26.460
Neuroscience at this point because physics hasn't changed in a long time.

25
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.820
Best present you've ever received?
Um,
a hug is always the best.

26
00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:34.320
The hug from a family off of my son I love is more than anything else.

27
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.510
What is something you do to chill?
I run,
I bike and I ski.

28
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.850
Anything fast motion.
Honestly,
a flat planes too.

29
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.630
What is something surprising about you?
Um,
I recently had an MRI of my brain.

30
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.650
They found this gap up here around here,
but 2.3 centimeters wide.

31
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.130
I think that it's been normally fears located because I don't have fear.

32
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.960
Do you prefer cats or dogs?
Dogs.

33
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.600
How did you come up with the idea for Google x?
Um,

34
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.250
Vivanta to do innovative stuff.
They wanted to do crazy moonshots.
Uh,

35
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.560
so Larry sloganized set together and ask,

36
00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:11.250
what's the best way to do this favor Google x project?
And there's no favorite,

37
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:12.900
but the one I'm best known for is the self driving car.

38
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.740
What project are you currently working on?
Uh,
my God,

39
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:20.790
you'd acidy making education globally accessible and democratize it and double

40
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:24.660
the world's GDP through education.
If you could repeat one experience again,

41
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.010
what would it be?
A boy being a set of captain was very humbling,
to be honest,

42
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:32.520
and as many good moments and many bad moments.
So I'd love to do it again.

43
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.090
Why you think deep learning has gotten so popular recently?
It is amazing.

44
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:39.110
I think we've reached the critical scale of data.
Like if you look at,
uh,
uh,

45
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.090
red brain,
you can't teach her event super interesting tricks,

46
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:45.660
but if you make the larger the human brain,
you can do it.
So I think in computer,

47
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:47.190
we know reached the size of a human brain.

48
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.060
What is your favorite operating system?
Linux,
of course,

49
00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:53.910
I spend way too much time hacking Linux kernels in my life.

50
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.930
What's your favorite movie matrix?

51
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.390
What is your favorite operating system?
Uh,
it is Linux.
Um,

52
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.970
but I ask a question or even before,
do you collect changed?
Yes.

53
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.980
Do you play any sports?
Uh,
I run,
I ski,
I bike and do anything.

54
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:14.290
It's fast.
Most adventurous thing you've ever done.

55
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.360
A I f I snowboarded and actually broke my back.
We're stumbling over a cliff.

56
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:21.700
So then a crazy ski drums before when I was young.

57
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.570
What's one source you use to stay up to date in ml?
Um,

58
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.410
I love browsing the web.
I love talking to people.
I go to conferences,

59
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.250
a lot of stuff in the new city space,
programming,

60
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:37.690
language of choice for machine learning.
Um,
for me it's either python or Matlab.

61
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.320
Matlab,
because I love fast prototyping and I love the nonpayment and python.

62
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.080
But um,
when I go to production code,

63
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:48.580
I got a c plus plus favorite professor myself.
Not Hard.
Just as what a joke.

64
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.120
My mentor Tom Mitchell and Carnegie Mellon who was a founder of the machine

65
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:55.660
learning department is just amazing.
W why do you think programming is fine?

66
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.170
It's amazing.
I love it.
I do it for recreational purposes.

67
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:02.410
I just program a pseudocode problem solver just because I was jet lagged.

68
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.610
It's fun because it's a great mental exercise.
Favorite comfort food.

69
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.470
Oh my God.
I actually make my own food.
I have a little food invention to make.

70
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:14.020
Great.
The 19 and a half minutes and I love fish.

71
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.610
Name one person you really admire.
Um,
I would say number one would be Larry Page,

72
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.840
the CEO of alphabet.
And I learned so much from him.
What was your first program?

73
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.000
Uh,
I had a pocket calculator called Texas instrument 57.
You should Google it.

74
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.320
It looks like 1980 [inaudible] and it had 50 programming of steps in.

75
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.210
I spend endless time building video games on a pocket calculator.
What texture,

76
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.540
what techs had or do you use a,
usually EMS.
What?

77
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:43.150
Open source library do you really like?
Um,
boy,

78
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.130
I do a lot of work on Linux of course,
and I love working on,

79
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.290
uh,
Caitlin and the libraries.
Best advice you've ever received.
Boy,

80
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.030
not to take myself too seriously.
Life is suppose to be fun.

81
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.290
Do you spend more time on the internet or real life?
A real life.

82
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.220
And even when the Internet,

83
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:06.280
for me it's real life because I interact with people and we have people.

84
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.410
Do you have any pets?
Uh,
only fleas.
Just kidding.
No,
not that I know of.

85
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.130
What's something you've learned in the past month?
Um,

86
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.340
I learned something amazing about crowd sourcing our students.

87
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:21.940
They produce software for the self driving car as so amazingly strong.

88
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.390
I think we should do much more crowd sourcing facility development.

89
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.080
Do you like spicy food?
I do.
If you ran the world,

90
00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:31.660
what is one lie you would enact immediately?
Um,

91
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.350
I would force every kid in their states to spend one year abroad to understand

92
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:36.550
that there's more than just America.

93
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.390
Is the singularity near van in the middle of it at this very moment.

94
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.620
Who is one person you looked up to when you were in college?
Again,
my,
uh,

95
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.580
my thesis advisor,
Tom Mitchell,
whom I met when I was in college.

96
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.760
It was just me like a god to me and he helped me understand the importance of

97
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.090
not just doing good research but doing impactful research.

98
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.800
What deep learning library do you use the most?

99
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.860
I think tens of sorts the best right now,
but it's a fast moving field.

100
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.750
If you were to start from scratch today,

101
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.480
what is a learning resource you would use to learn machine learning?

102
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.850
Definitely you'd ask no question.
I think honestly it's not perfect,

103
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:13.700
but have you done me?
I hope I've done really good job making it accessible.

104
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.220
We have a new foundation on a degree on deep learning,

105
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:20.270
which is very easy to understand.
What is one goal you have in the next 10 years?

106
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.660
Boy,
I have so many of those.
I love learning new things,

107
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:25.310
so I get bored when I'm good at something.

108
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.720
So right now I'm learning how to do instrument piloting of planes,

109
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.100
but also like to understand better how to make it as study a really,

110
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.130
really amazing company.
Favorite subject in school when you were growing up?
Math,

111
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.770
if you could be a superhero,
who would it be?
Boy,
I feel sorry.

112
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.900
I feel like Spiderman on the depressed days

113
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.680
and displayed to me.
Batman.
What's your spirit animal?

114
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.510
My spirit animal.
Your spirit animal.
Um Oh my God.
Pokemon.

115
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.430
What do you predict comes next after the deep learning hype?
I think machine,

116
00:06:58.431 --> 00:06:59.840
and we would say,
as we've talked for quite a while,

117
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:03.230
and this is going to be as big of evolution as the agricultural revolution is

118
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:06.620
going to come in many shapes.
But,
um,
if I were to add one new thing,

119
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.620
I think we're going to bid machines.

120
00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:11.780
They can browse all the dictionary and the ward or the books in the world and

121
00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:15.400
learn from it.
And combined image based learning and,
and,

122
00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:19.490
and database learning with book learning,
coffee or tea or coffee,

123
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.470
summer or winter.
Uh,
both Google home or Amazon.
Alexa,

124
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.960
definitely Amazon Alexa because it has a name and it's,
you can,
it can,

125
00:07:27.961 --> 00:07:31.400
I can call it my name chrome or safari chrome.

126
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.350
WWDC or Google io deaf and the legal Glioma,
Forensic Bula.
Amazing.

127
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.430
Awesome.
All right,
Sebastian,
thanks so much for answering those questions.
