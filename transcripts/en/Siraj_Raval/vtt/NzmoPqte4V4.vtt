00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.180
Hello world,
it's Saroj and who's ready to watch me build an AI startup.

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.310
In this video I'm going to show you how to build an AI startup from start to

3
00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:11.060
finish.

4
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.870
What I mean is we're going to build a simple prototype and I have it right here

5
00:00:14.871 --> 00:00:18.470
for you.
It's called Smart Med scan.
Let me show you a quick demo.

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.470
It's running locally on my machine as you see behind me,

7
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.370
I've called it smart med scan.
Clearly I need to design it a little better,

8
00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:27.080
but uh,
it's a prototype.

9
00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:30.740
And what I'm going to show you is how this works first and then the entire

10
00:00:30.741 --> 00:00:35.510
pipeline of how we would ideate,
how we would design a business plan,

11
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.340
how we would get our first clients,
and then how we would grow our startup.
Okay.

12
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:40.941
Over time.

13
00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:45.410
So it hopefully this whole video shows gives you an overview of how I would do

14
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:48.770
this.
I'm going to show you,
give you all of my secrets of how I would do this.

15
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.110
I'm going to be totally transparent and open with you.
All right?

16
00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:53.000
So check this out.

17
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:57.320
So the first step for user is to sign up for Smart Med scan.
And who is this for?

18
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.530
This is a tool for doctors to be able to classify images or medical images.

19
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.570
So you know,
x ray scans for their lungs.

20
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.590
Doctors have all sorts of images that they spend many years learning how to

21
00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:12.590
classify with their brain.
But um,
there's a,

22
00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:14.730
there's a shortage of doctors out there.
Um,

23
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.870
it's expensive and a lot of times there's a lot of miss misdiagnoses out there,

24
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:20.600
right?
So,

25
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.470
which is bad for patients in terms of their health and it's bad for doctors in

26
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:26.930
terms of liabilities.
So we want to avoid that.

27
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:31.160
And the way to do that is to use these deep learning and machine learning

28
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:36.050
technologies to do that for us and to help doctors to make their jobs easier.

29
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.740
It's make patients lives better.
Okay.
So my email,
let's see,

30
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:43.410
I've got all my basic details here.
Password,
um,

31
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.330
another password and I'll submit.
Okay.
So now that I've signed in,

32
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.810
I'm going to pay with card.
Okay.
So I'm a doctor,
I have an image.
I want it,

33
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.630
I want to classify it.
So I'm gonna pay with my card.
I'm gonna say,

34
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:57.770
you know this my email,
here's my test card number,
or whatever it is,
it's fake.

35
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.530
And then here's my CVC CVC.

36
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.290
I'm going to pay 10 bucks for a single classification.

37
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.260
I'll go ahead and pay the charge goes through.

38
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

39
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.770
<v 0>And it says,
great job.
Thanks for paying 10 bucks.
Go ahead and upload your file.</v>

40
00:02:12.771 --> 00:02:16.520
This now shows up and I'm going to say,
uh,

41
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.280
<v 1>yeah.</v>

42
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.840
<v 0>Let's see.
I'll say this one.
Here's my medical image.</v>

43
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.070
Submit it.

44
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.280
It's running inference right now in the cloud or on my machine is running in

45
00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:33.660
France.
This is machine learning happening right now.
It's classifying it.

46
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.650
<v 1>Okay?</v>

47
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.440
<v 0>Okay,
so now I've uploaded it.
It's classified it,</v>

48
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:40.650
and we can see the classification results right underneath,
right here.

49
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.430
It is very likely that this is an example of pneumonia.

50
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.100
This is something that people go to school for years to do,

51
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:50.640
and we just figured out how to automate that,
which is amazing.

52
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:53.490
It's going to help doctors and help patients.
It's going to make life better.

53
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.150
And so here's an example,
right?
And I have different options,
different pricings,

54
00:02:57.151 --> 00:03:01.750
a thousand USD,
you know,
even more for enterprise hospitals,
bigger,

55
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.840
bigger medical institution so you can see how this could work.

56
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.060
So I'm going to show you how I did this,
how I built this,

57
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.420
and how I would plan to grow this.
Okay?

58
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.890
So it's a 10 step process.
I'm going to list some of my problems.

59
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.740
I'm going to pick one that I feel most passionate about.

60
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.470
I'm going to do some market research for competing products.

61
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.550
I'm going to buy a domain,
create a landing page,
get some customers,
uh,

62
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:28.210
create a business plan,
designed the actual pipeline for the real APP.

63
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:31.630
When I build it,
build the APP and then deploy it.

64
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.090
And you'll see all of those steps.
All right?
So,

65
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.440
so the first step is going to be too fine.
A problem that I actually care about.

66
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.790
And uh,

67
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.870
what we can do is we can frame it like this or there are problems that you care

68
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:47.080
about,
their passions you have and their strengths that you have,
right?

69
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:49.540
So one example would be me,
right?

70
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:53.620
So my passion would be to educate people.
It's also,

71
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:57.280
it happens to be my strength and there happens to be a problem where not enough

72
00:03:57.281 --> 00:03:59.650
people understand how this AI technology works.

73
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.130
So the star then would be to educate people about Ai.
So that is,

74
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.360
that would be my real life startup,
which it is.
And I do make money from that.

75
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:09.610
So this is a startup.
It's,
it's more,
it's,
it's,

76
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.610
it's grown past startup stage at this point.
It's like mid size.
Anyway,
so,

77
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.510
so that's a very kind of basic way to think about,
you know,

78
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:19.300
write down what your strengths are,
write down what your passions are,

79
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.250
write down what the problems you care about are,

80
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:23.650
and then look for the intersection of those three.
And in fact,

81
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:27.340
the Japanese have codified this more than a hundred years ago with the concept

82
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:31.230
of Icky guy.
It literally means a reason for being.
And this,

83
00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:34.450
this chart here shows you what all of that entails,
what you love,

84
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:37.750
what you're good at,
what you can be paid for,
and what the world needs.

85
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:41.440
And that the intersection of all of those four things is your eeky guy.

86
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.850
And you want to find that,
right?
So one way to do that is to write down what I,

87
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.300
what I said,
but also look at the industries that are available,
right?

88
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:53.440
So artificial intelligence is going to transform every industry,
right?

89
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:57.190
It's not just hype,
it's reality.
And this is going to continue to happen.

90
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.220
Ai Is a new electricity as Professor Ang says.

91
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.820
And so what you can do is you can look at these industries and you can pick and

92
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:07.660
choose one that you would one.
So for me,
I'm going to pick and choose three.

93
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.520
My three passions are healthcare,
education,
and scientific research.

94
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.770
So a good thought exercise would be to say,
you know,
hey,
this problem sucks.

95
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.290
How many people have had had this problem?

96
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.790
How many other ways are there to solve it?
What,

97
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.670
what would it cost to offer a solution?

98
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.820
And how does the cost compared to the pain of the problem?
And so for me,

99
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:31.990
I'm going to pick one problem in particular of my three passions.
Healthcare,

100
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.970
right?
And so it's going to be in healthcare.

101
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.380
And specifically I know that image classification technology is really good then

102
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.600
and so then it happens.

103
00:05:39.601 --> 00:05:42.790
So what happens is we have to pick one of those subfields of healthcare.

104
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.490
I'm going to say radiology specifically for lungs.

105
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.530
That's going to be the one that I'm,

106
00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:51.440
I'm most passionate about because in this example I have somebody who I know who

107
00:05:51.441 --> 00:05:55.780
has been affected by it.
And here's a story,
right?
So,
so that's,

108
00:05:55.781 --> 00:05:58.040
that's how to think about it.
But if you cannot think of a problem,

109
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.100
no matter what you're doing,
do this,

110
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.410
just leave wherever you are for a month.

111
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.650
It just go to a totally different culture and you've got to increase your

112
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:11.150
training data,
right?
So find,
find new training data,
find new cultures,
new values,

113
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:14.510
new languages,
new people,
new perspectives.
And I promise you,

114
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:17.810
you will find a problem that you are passionate about.

115
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.490
You will find your [inaudible] guy.

116
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.640
You need to get out of your bubble and go forth into strange territory that

117
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:27.740
scares you,
right?
I lived in Amsterdam for a year.

118
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:31.700
I've lived all over the world at this point,
Tokyo,
Singapore,
everywhere.
So,

119
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.780
and it definitely helps you find that passion.
So definitely do that.
Okay,

120
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.180
that's step one.
We did that.

121
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.580
Now I have the problem healthcare for doctors and we're going to automate

122
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.410
healthcare via a classifier.

123
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.010
Now the next step is to do some market research.

124
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:48.470
What are the competing products here?
By the way,

125
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.150
AI can do literally so much.
This is just a subset of what AI can do.

126
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:56.810
It can do anything with natural language processing.
It could generate text,

127
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.480
it could classify texts,
it could summarize text.
Uh,

128
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.620
you can use computer vision to see things in classify things.

129
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.620
You can generate new types of images for fashion lines and you can retrieve

130
00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:11.150
information in a very intelligent way.
You know,

131
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:12.650
there's so much information out there.

132
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.640
How do you compress it and how do you present to a customer or user the most

133
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:19.250
useful information that is,
uh,
an AI problem?

134
00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:21.710
How do you filter what they want and what they don't want?

135
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.130
How do you predict the future in finance,
in asset prediction,

136
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.200
in portfolio optimization?

137
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.350
How do you make the best decisions when you have a giant company at giant

138
00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:34.970
organization that's decision analytics,
how you improve the supply chain process.

139
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.110
How do you classify these plants that need to be classified?
If you're,

140
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.560
if you're a farmer and you're trying to get rid of weeds and increase your

141
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:47.300
supplies,
do you see what I'm saying?
Ai applies to literally every industry,

142
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.530
the basic human senses of vision,
of speech,
of,

143
00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:55.490
of recognizing texts and understanding language,
machine translation.

144
00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:00.470
All of this can be automated and we can create services to do this for us.

145
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:05.240
So then we can focus on creative pursuits were more meaningful lives,

146
00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:07.880
et cetera.
That's a little metta.
You see what I'm saying?

147
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:13.310
So if we look at the uh,
field of,
of Ai in healthcare,

148
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.090
we know that this is something we can do,
right?
Input,
output,
simple input,
output,

149
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.410
pattern recognition,
right?
We have the input,
it's going to be a medical image.

150
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.890
We have our classifier that we're going to build and it's going to output what

151
00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:28.580
the disease is.
Very simple.
Pattern recognition,
supervised learning,

152
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.000
find a labeled dataset.
Easy stuff.
We can do that.
Now,

153
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.860
if we look at the competitor landscape for this,
and I found this image,
you know,

154
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.230
out there there's general imaging and these people try to do everything that,

155
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:43.160
you know,
they're classifying breast cancer,
they're classifying,
you know,
um,

156
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.450
all sorts of the whole body.
Then there's like specific niches here.

157
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:52.370
So we're going to pick this niche,
which is a lung imaging,
right?

158
00:08:52.371 --> 00:08:56.220
So if we look at this,
these lung imaging startups,
I go to Mbo,

159
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.910
I'll check it out.
What does it look like?
Okay.

160
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.840
They have this trial situation.
Do they have a freemium model?
No.

161
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.560
They look kind of a pulmonary AI.
Okay.

162
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.910
So they're doing that fully automated.
I don't know.

163
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:15.210
I think it can be done better that there's sites kind of,
you know,

164
00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:18.540
old school and you could just make it hipper and look,

165
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:21.060
there's so many different,
uh,

166
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.570
medical facilities out there and they're probably the only targeting the US or

167
00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:28.140
the UK or the EU.
We've got the world to upgrade,
right?

168
00:09:28.141 --> 00:09:30.930
So we can target those markets that they're not going to target.

169
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:33.900
We're going to target the entire world will figure out the regulations when we

170
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:36.810
get there.
That's the startup mentality.
That's how Uber did it.

171
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.980
That's how we're going to do it.

172
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.040
And the lung imaging landscape looks pretty disruptable.

173
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:44.100
It's not specialized enough.
They're trying to do everything we're going to,

174
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:48.360
we're going to do is we're going to laser focus on one type of medical image and

175
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:51.120
that that are,
those are the lungs,
right?
Lung images.

176
00:09:51.121 --> 00:09:53.970
We're going to focus on those.
We're going to do that really,
really well.

177
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.300
We're going to do that better than anybody else because we have the data and the

178
00:09:57.301 --> 00:09:59.490
technology to do that freely available.

179
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.820
And when we do that and we build a customer base,

180
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.600
then we're going to grow and then we're going to start applying it to all sorts

181
00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:09.420
of medical images.
And that's,
that's how that looks.
All right,

182
00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:12.510
so we have done our market research and assume that I looked through all of

183
00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:16.230
these are right.
So this third step is to buy a domain and you know,

184
00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:18.960
go to go daddy,
whatever you want.
I'm not endorsing Godaddy,

185
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:23.010
just like pick a domain by it and that's it.
Right?

186
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.210
So when we go to go daddy,

187
00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:28.650
we can type in smart med scan and see if there's exist.

188
00:10:28.651 --> 00:10:32.430
Any other great,
it's available.
Smart Med scan is available.
Good.

189
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:34.350
We'll go ahead and buy it.
I'm not going to do that right now.

190
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.040
So we assumed we bought it.
Now the next step is create a landing page.

191
00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:40.950
And to do that we need a logo,
right?
We need a logo.

192
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.530
Now I use this AI tool to generate a logo for me.
It's pretty amazing.

193
00:10:46.531 --> 00:10:48.270
It's called brandmark.
Okay.

194
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:51.880
And when it does is it uses AI to create a logo for you?
It generates it.
It's a,

195
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.750
it's a generative network that they're using in the back background here.

196
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.340
So I'll say it's called Smart Med scan.

197
00:10:56.341 --> 00:10:59.900
We bought the go daddy domain or whatever domain you buy from and it's going to

198
00:10:59.901 --> 00:11:04.350
be related to hospitals and they're using NLP here to relate images via some

199
00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:07.920
semantic similarity index here,
hospital deep learning.

200
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.220
These are my keywords and it's going to then deep learning AI.

201
00:11:11.221 --> 00:11:13.620
So you already knew Ai.
And I'll say,

202
00:11:13.621 --> 00:11:17.610
here's the color scheme that we want and it's going to generate a logo for us.

203
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.780
We don't have to do that ourselves.

204
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:22.770
And we're going to use this logo and this color scheme to create a landing page,

205
00:11:22.771 --> 00:11:27.510
right?
So check out all these beautiful logo,
smart,
smart med scan right here,

206
00:11:27.511 --> 00:11:31.740
smart med scans.
So we would just pick one and we would say,
okay,
so here it is.

207
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.850
Smart Med scan,
deep learning for hospitals.
Look,
it's got the guy with the shirt,

208
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.800
man,
I love this,
I love this site.
Um,
look,
it's got the guy looking at it as well.

209
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.510
Let's not get too,
let's not get too enamored by this right now anyway.

210
00:11:43.511 --> 00:11:45.210
It's amazing.
It's so pay them,

211
00:11:45.211 --> 00:11:47.820
definitely pay them and stuff like I did guys like,

212
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:51.930
but also like if you don't have money you can just kind of like screenshot it as

213
00:11:51.931 --> 00:11:56.770
well.
You know,
they,
they must've known that's possible.
So whatever,
you know,

214
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.110
if you support them,
pay them.
But like if you're going to do that,

215
00:11:59.111 --> 00:12:02.440
just do that as well.
Whatever it takes,
you know?
So anyway,

216
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:07.420
so that's to create a logo and now we're going to create a landing page.

217
00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:07.631
Okay?

218
00:12:07.631 --> 00:12:12.631
So the whole idea of a landing page is that we want to know if we're going to

219
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:15.580
actually have customers before we build this thing.

220
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:19.060
We don't want to waste our time.
I did that before with the robotic startup.

221
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.980
I don't want it.
We don't want to waste our time again.

222
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:24.580
So what we're gonna do is we're going to create a landing page that demos this

223
00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:27.190
idea with the logo,
and it's going to have an email.

224
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.820
It's kind of a single field to enter your email if you want to learn more.

225
00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:34.570
And what we're going to do is we're going to have a one liner describe what the

226
00:12:34.571 --> 00:12:37.930
product is.
We're going to put the price,
and then we're going to say,
here it is.

227
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.370
If you're interested,
sign up.

228
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.610
And what we're gonna do is we're gonna find a bunch of medical facilities near

229
00:12:42.611 --> 00:12:45.130
us.
We're going to ping them and say,
Hey,
are you interested in,

230
00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:48.160
hopefully we get some people to sign up.
And if we do,

231
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.170
that is called market validation.

232
00:12:50.171 --> 00:12:53.650
That's how we know that people actually want our product.

233
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.300
And the easiest way to do this is to use MailChimp,

234
00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.300
which is a tool that I generally use.

235
00:12:58.301 --> 00:13:01.900
And so we can say mail chimp landing page.

236
00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.100
And what mail chip allows you to do is this,

237
00:13:04.101 --> 00:13:06.040
it's got this free landing page builder.

238
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:11.080
You can try it out and I'll say it's called test,
select the list,

239
00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:15.250
whatever,
you know,
whatever.
And we'll begin that.

240
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:22.120
And Alex,
I'll pick one of these.
Let's just pick this one,

241
00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.100
right?
So see here it is email address.
When they sign up,

242
00:13:27.101 --> 00:13:29.830
it goes into your MailChimp account and that's how you collect emails.

243
00:13:29.831 --> 00:13:33.130
And so we can,
you know,
change all of this to like med scan,
whatever,
you know,

244
00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:35.190
we can change the tax,
you know,

245
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.650
add all this stuff and we'll just that this is easy stuff,
but you got the point.

246
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.630
And once we have it,
we'll do save and close,
save and close.

247
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.930
And then we'll say,
um,

248
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:52.180
add a URL and it's going to generate a URL for us.
Save.

249
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:53.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

250
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.850
<v 0>And then we'll say add page title,
unentitled whatever,</v>

251
00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.073
publish.

252
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:00.560
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

253
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.810
<v 0>And now here's our landing page right here.</v>

254
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:03.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

255
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.060
<v 0>Right?
So here's our landing page.
Obviously we need to change it,</v>

256
00:14:06.061 --> 00:14:06.781
but you get the point,

257
00:14:06.781 --> 00:14:11.040
you can quickly make a landing page and then we'll link our go daddy domain to

258
00:14:11.041 --> 00:14:14.610
this,
right?
So on the backend we just changed the name servers,
uh,
to,

259
00:14:14.611 --> 00:14:18.300
to this one or you know,
or you saw that option that it had to use your own,

260
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.460
which you could do.
But anyway,
that's the point.
And so then what we would do is,

261
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.410
right,
so we create our Lenny,
we create our,
our landing page.

262
00:14:25.411 --> 00:14:27.840
And now step five is to share that landing page.

263
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.710
So let's share that landing page so we can,
you know,
Sharon,
our social networks,

264
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:36.420
you know,
on Facebook,
whatever it is,
like,
hey,
sign up for this.
Hey,

265
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:41.250
sign up.
You know,
make it a better pitch.
But like,
Hey,
I,
you know,

266
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:46.230
if you're interested,
I have a startup for doctors.

267
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.970
Sign up here,
sign up here,
coming soon,
right?
Whatever it is,
and then,
you know,

268
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:50.813
add the link.

269
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.710
And then the other thing we can do is we can go to maps and then we can say

270
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:59.510
inside of Google maps,
what are the places that are near me?

271
00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:02.670
And we can search and then we can find what those places are and we'll just see.

272
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.210
We'll email them or know,
call them wherever.

273
00:15:05.211 --> 00:15:10.100
We'll send them this link with a nice pitch,
right?
So that's the fifth step.

274
00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:14.030
And once we have a list,
the next step for us is to create a business plan.

275
00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:14.870
Now there are,

276
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:18.800
so there's so much advice that exists out there on how to create a business
plan,

277
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.680
write a one page summary,
define your target market.

278
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:26.330
And the reason we want to do this is just to kind of pan out what the idea would

279
00:15:26.331 --> 00:15:30.770
look like in our heads for ourselves.
It's for ourselves more than anyone else.

280
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:35.960
So my idea is to get,
you know,
25 signups for the landing page,
create the APP,

281
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.600
and then give those signups the APP,

282
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.980
convert some of those signups to actual paid clients.
Collect some feedback,

283
00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:45.890
like did these doctors like it?
What didn't they like about it?
You know,

284
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:48.320
they're like,
oh,
fix this,
add this,
I'll do that.

285
00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:50.600
I'll improve the APP with the data,
data driven.

286
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:52.820
Then I'll collect a hundred more paid clients,

287
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:57.050
which I arbitrarily picked as a number.
I'll repeat steps four through six,
right?

288
00:15:57.051 --> 00:16:01.070
Collecting feedback and growing the APP until I can't do it anymore myself and I

289
00:16:01.071 --> 00:16:04.520
have to hire people,
then I'll make two of the most unnecessary hires,

290
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.450
a full stack engineer who can do both Mlai web and mobile,

291
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:13.451
eventually development and a salesman to go out or woman to find people and to

292
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:18.590
get them to,
you know,
sign up for our service.
And then eventually,
um,
I might,

293
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:23.330
I may or may not raise the first round and um,
then higher,
larger team,

294
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.490
the step 12 and 13 are just a joke.

295
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.060
And then the exit strategy will be to be bought out by one of these big tech

296
00:16:29.061 --> 00:16:31.400
companies or buy them out.
We'll see.
You know,

297
00:16:31.401 --> 00:16:35.900
it depends on how ambitious we want to be and this is called the lean startup

298
00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:39.020
mentality.
I would highly recommend checking out this book.
Uh,

299
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:43.370
it's a great book by Eric Reese and it,
it talks about how to do this basically,

300
00:16:43.371 --> 00:16:46.760
you know,
Tldr of the entire book is don't just try to raise money,

301
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:51.380
just build as much as you can without making,
you know,

302
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.780
while being frugal,
while being frugal.
And,

303
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:58.100
and that is how you build a real business.
Okay.
So now on to step seven,

304
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.950
step seven is going to be to design a pipeline.

305
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:05.150
So what we know we need is first of all,
we need there to be a database of users.

306
00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:09.860
So authentication,
functionality,
right?
That's very basic.
Just sign up,
log in,

307
00:17:09.861 --> 00:17:10.310
right?

308
00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:14.240
That we know we need that and we also need a database to store those users.

309
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:19.010
So we're going to use sequel.
Sql is the goto default database that,

310
00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.460
you know,
we use these days and obviously there are others,
but for,
uh,
you know,

311
00:17:22.461 --> 00:17:26.600
we're trying to build a prototype as fast as possible.
Rapid experimentation.

312
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.920
It's one of our values at school of AI just rapidly experiment until we get to

313
00:17:30.921 --> 00:17:35.390
whatever solution we need.
Try fail,
try,
fail,
try fail.
So,
um,

314
00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.040
right.
So we want to use a SQL database for our user authentication,

315
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:44.330
for our database to store those users and then we can need a way for them to be

316
00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:46.670
able to pay us and the way to pay people,

317
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.640
and I'm biased because I use it myself and I have used it is stripe.

318
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:55.470
I love stripe.
I love you guys.
I love the design of everything and um,

319
00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:00.480
stripe rules.
So Stripe is the way to collect payments,
right?
So,

320
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.400
so once a user signs up,
they'll need to be able to pay,

321
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.280
we'll need to be able to collect their card information easily stored in a

322
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:11.790
secured way.
And then once they do that,

323
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.210
we want to allow them to upload their images.
So flask,

324
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.860
we'll natively allow us to do that.

325
00:18:16.861 --> 00:18:21.180
Speaking of Flask Flask is a web development framework for python.

326
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.240
And the reason that I chose flasks cause because I'm most familiar with it,

327
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.150
however,
Django works just as well,
pyramid air pair.

328
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.530
And there are a million other ones,

329
00:18:28.531 --> 00:18:31.160
but flasks seems to have a lot of good documentation,

330
00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:35.580
a lot of good repositories on Github,
which makes me more inclined to use it.

331
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.090
And lastly,
once they've uploaded their file,
they've logged in,

332
00:18:39.091 --> 00:18:43.830
they paid what is the last thing we want them to do?
We want them to,
uh,

333
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.180
you to perform inference using our AI model,
which will then classify,

334
00:18:48.181 --> 00:18:53.010
which will diagnose,
uh,
the medical image.
And we use carrots for that.

335
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.750
Okay,
so let's see.

336
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.800
The naive way to do this would be to just build it from scratch,

337
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.870
but we are not naive are we?
We recognize how beautiful get hub is.

338
00:19:03.871 --> 00:19:08.100
Now I'm going to take a second here to educate you on how powerful to get hubs

339
00:19:08.101 --> 00:19:11.700
search is,
right?
So we have to be really good with search and get hub,

340
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:16.550
the repository for code on the Internet.
We know we want,
uh,

341
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:18.810
we know we want a flask APP,
so we know that.

342
00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:23.610
We also know that we want it to have payments and probably stripe integrated.

343
00:19:23.611 --> 00:19:26.160
So let's just search flask stripe on all of get hub.

344
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.670
And we've got some great
look at this.

345
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.800
We've got some great repositories that already exist.

346
00:19:34.801 --> 00:19:37.560
And guess what these people did.
They integrated payments,

347
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.440
user authentication and a database for us.

348
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.890
This is kind of boiler plate has nothing to do with Ai.
It's just a web app.

349
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.780
And this,
they did it for us.
So what we can do is we can build off of their APP.

350
00:19:48.781 --> 00:19:49.830
And so you know,

351
00:19:49.831 --> 00:19:53.370
I tried several of these and one that I've found worked pretty well was called

352
00:19:53.371 --> 00:19:54.540
Flask Sas,

353
00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:59.270
which a this guy bill tier and what we can build off of his work.

354
00:19:59.271 --> 00:20:03.330
So we're going to go ahead and clone,
download this straight from get hub.

355
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:07.650
Okay.
And uh,
we'll get into that in a second.
Okay.
So,

356
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.830
and then we want to add upload functionality,
right?
Who,
who does,

357
00:20:10.831 --> 00:20:13.860
who has upload functionality,
Flask Image uploader.
Oh,

358
00:20:13.861 --> 00:20:18.861
he's got a running demo right there and he's got the code right here.

359
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.890
Uh,
that's simple.
See We,
you have to be able to use get hub for the,

360
00:20:22.891 --> 00:20:25.110
for what it is.
It is an incredibly,

361
00:20:25.111 --> 00:20:30.111
an incredibly useful tool to allow you to rapidly prototype by putting together

362
00:20:30.181 --> 00:20:34.200
components that already exist to create something entirely new.

363
00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:37.260
That's the whole point,
right?
So really you gotta be,

364
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.370
you gotta be very smart about using good hub in looking at those keywords and

365
00:20:41.371 --> 00:20:43.980
searching it because it is the Google for code,
right?

366
00:20:43.981 --> 00:20:48.060
So it's like whatever you want,
you know,
medical flask,
medical pro,

367
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.360
I don't know if somebody is going to show up,

368
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:53.200
probably a flask python web app running on Apache.

369
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.220
How much could we learn from that?
Right.
There's so much.

370
00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.910
It's so rich with ideas,
right?
So definitely look at,

371
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.300
look into search and get hub and learning how to,
you know,

372
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.780
have a laser focus on what is useful out of get hub.
Okay.

373
00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.390
And so the idea is like,
okay,
so once they've authenticated,

374
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.010
we got their payment functionality.

375
00:21:12.011 --> 00:21:16.570
What we can do is we can build off of this flask Sass App and that upload

376
00:21:16.571 --> 00:21:19.480
functionality,
add our carrots,
you know,
snippet of code.

377
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.210
And then have a call back where if upload,
you know,

378
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.090
if the user has signed in and they've already paid,

379
00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:29.800
then run in France if and only if then run in France and then display the result

380
00:21:29.801 --> 00:21:31.480
as html.
You see what I'm saying?

381
00:21:31.481 --> 00:21:34.540
So that's the pipeline that we want for the prototype.

382
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.120
Now we're going to perform transfer learning.

383
00:21:37.121 --> 00:21:42.121
So the whole idea behind transfer learning is to not have us have to waste a lot

384
00:21:43.271 --> 00:21:48.130
of our time training our model on,
uh,
an extremely large dataset.

385
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.670
It's not going to,
it's also not going to require a lot of computational power.

386
00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:52.800
So the,

387
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.010
the way to do that as the first decide what technique we're going to use for

388
00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.630
medical imaging classification.
And we know that convolutional networks,

389
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.150
a type of ml model tend to do really well.

390
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:05.860
Now I'm not gonna explain how they work.

391
00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:09.310
I have a great video on that called convolutional neural network.

392
00:22:09.311 --> 00:22:11.590
Just search youtube Suraj it'd be the first link.

393
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.240
Watch that come back if you don't know how they work to this video.
Pause,

394
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:20.800
open new tab,
watch come back,
right?
So dependencies,
life full of dependencies.

395
00:22:20.801 --> 00:22:24.580
Back to this convolutional networks,
they do really well at image classification,

396
00:22:24.581 --> 00:22:29.050
hot dog,
not hot dog cancer,
not cancer,
right?
Diabetes,
not diabetes.

397
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:33.160
And so it's a very simple process.
We train the model with labeled data,

398
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:37.810
then we applied to unlabeled data and it will make a prediction.
That's it,
right?

399
00:22:37.811 --> 00:22:40.270
So now we're going to write our web app web APP,

400
00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:43.510
and then we're going to deploy step nine,
right?
Our web APP and then deploy.

401
00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.250
So before we do that,
check this out.

402
00:22:45.251 --> 00:22:49.120
So what I did was I took some time to write out this transfer learning code.

403
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:51.400
And what this code does is

404
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:57.670
it will use care Ross,
the deep learning library to build off an existing model.

405
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.820
So let me go back for a second and show you something that I forgot to show you.

406
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.880
And so there exists a lot of different types of pretrained classification models

407
00:23:05.981 --> 00:23:08.650
that Google and other institutions have built.

408
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:12.310
And what we can do is we can leverage those pretrained models.

409
00:23:12.311 --> 00:23:15.550
And I'm doing this because it represents all the layers of what it's learned

410
00:23:15.551 --> 00:23:19.360
before,
right?
So inception for example,
it's like 50 layers of everything.

411
00:23:19.361 --> 00:23:22.090
It's learned from dogs to planes to everything.

412
00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:25.000
And what we do is we cut off the final layer.
By cutoff,

413
00:23:25.001 --> 00:23:28.710
I mean we were moved that final matrix,
um,
that the,

414
00:23:28.711 --> 00:23:31.420
the final set of matrices that store all of its learnings,

415
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.450
we remove it and then we take the rest of this,

416
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.030
we take the head off the Hydra and then we,

417
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:41.050
we retrain this existing model on our medical imaging Dataset.

418
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:46.080
And the reason we do that rather than do it from scratch is it improves accuracy

419
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:51.700
if we leverage all the general features that it's learned from things as random

420
00:23:51.711 --> 00:23:54.890
as umbrellas and trains and cars,

421
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.910
all of that will improve the accuracy of our specific niche,
which,

422
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:03.290
which is surprisingly,
it does,
which is medical imaging.

423
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.600
And so that's the idea behind transfer learning.

424
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:10.370
Train a model on a giant Dataset and then we'll just exist as a component,

425
00:24:10.371 --> 00:24:14.720
as a building block to further AI models that we build that are more
specialized.

426
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.440
The technical term it our downstream tasks.

427
00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:19.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

428
00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:21.340
<v 0>So we're going to pick one of these models and we're going to do it.</v>

429
00:24:21.341 --> 00:24:26.230
And so what I did was I built the code to,
to to show you what this looks like.

430
00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:30.550
Well,
first import our dependencies,
right?
This is running tensorflow and care os,

431
00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:34.360
and then this is the line that's very important.
Image net.
Here's the weight.

432
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:38.680
It's going to load an existing convolutional network that was trained by Google

433
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.690
in a single line of code,
okay?

434
00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.170
And then we'll add some more layers to improve accuracy,

435
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.330
<v 1>okay?</v>

436
00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.960
<v 0>Then what we do is we say,
okay,
here's our model.</v>

437
00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.260
Here are the inputs,
here are the predictions.

438
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:54.840
Now here's the line where I'm talking about the cutting off part,
right?

439
00:24:54.841 --> 00:24:58.560
So if it's lower than 20 layers,
it's not trainable.

440
00:24:58.561 --> 00:25:00.660
If it's greater than 20 layers,
it's trainable.

441
00:25:00.661 --> 00:25:03.390
So we're only making the last parts retrainable.

442
00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:06.450
Then what we do is we import our data from Kaggle,
right?

443
00:25:06.451 --> 00:25:10.020
So I have many videos on how this works.
Search,
Kaggle,

444
00:25:10.021 --> 00:25:13.440
Suraj and so we'll,
we'll authenticate with Kaggle.

445
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:17.740
We'll pull that data set from Kaggle
and took,

446
00:25:17.741 --> 00:25:20.100
let me show you what this looks like.
Our dataset,

447
00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:24.840
here's our data set of Kaggle images,
5,863 images,
you know,

448
00:25:24.841 --> 00:25:27.900
pneumonia,
viral pneumonia,
all of those diseases.

449
00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.260
We can pull it directly from Kaggle.
Okay,
so that's our dataset.
It's got those.

450
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:35.910
These are the three labels.
And then the images are the other column.
It's right.

451
00:25:35.911 --> 00:25:39.660
So it's a labeled dataset and we can pull this directly from Kaggle.

452
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:46.010
And then once we've downloaded it into our colab research environment,

453
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:51.020
we can take that data,
we can say,
here's the data,
train it on that data,

454
00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:55.100
compile it,
it's going to train.
And then we download the weights.
And to do that,

455
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:58.850
what we do is we put it in our Google drive and then we download it to our local

456
00:25:58.851 --> 00:26:01.280
machine and then we apply and then we point to it,

457
00:26:01.281 --> 00:26:05.420
the dot h five file are all of the learnings that it's learned on the web.

458
00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.840
It will then connect to that and I'll show you how to do that locally.

459
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.740
So that's transfer learning.
Now we're on to step nine.
We're,
we're almost done.

460
00:26:12.741 --> 00:26:15.070
We've got to write our web APP,
so let's write our web apps.

461
00:26:15.071 --> 00:26:18.620
Starting with that boiler plate that we just downloaded right here.

462
00:26:18.621 --> 00:26:21.170
It's called flask SAS master.
Okay,

463
00:26:21.171 --> 00:26:25.190
so it's called flask SAS master one.
Dot.
Sip.

464
00:26:25.191 --> 00:26:29.480
So I'm going to copy that.
I'm going to go here.
I'm going to,
then,

465
00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:36.570
let's see.
Let's make this bigger.
Let's do this.
I love terminal.
Here we go.
CD,

466
00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:41.490
intuit,
boom,
we're there.
Okay,
sublime.
Open it up.
Here's our file.

467
00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.490
Now,
where were we?

468
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.910
What was the name of that file?
It's called flasks.
Sas.

469
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:55.000
And what are the instructions to run it?
Set up,
make,

470
00:26:55.001 --> 00:26:57.990
install and make dev great.
We can do that.

471
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.690
Okay,
great.
That worked.
Create the database.

472
00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:17.570
Python three
great.

473
00:27:17.571 --> 00:27:21.470
Sql database has been created and now we run the application.

474
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:32.150
That's right.
Python three.

475
00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:38.383
Here we go.

476
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:46.550
Hey Ay ay.
Okay,
so we just built it.

477
00:27:46.551 --> 00:27:50.750
There it is.
It's there.
We did it.
Good job.
High Five.
Okay,

478
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:55.220
so it's a,
it's a,
it's bare bones.
It's got nothing,
but it's got a Nav bar.

479
00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.100
It's got sign up functionality there and now we can just modify it.

480
00:27:58.101 --> 00:28:02.300
Look how easy that was,
right?
So I'm going to sign up and say whatever,
whatever,

481
00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.040
whatever,

482
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:08.840
and then whatever@whatever.com and then whatever,
whatever.
Okay,

483
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.170
great.
Check your email to confirm.
Great.
So it's got that.
It's right.

484
00:28:12.171 --> 00:28:15.410
So we did that.
Now we've,
we've immediately,
we have our authentication,

485
00:28:15.411 --> 00:28:16.610
our database running.

486
00:28:16.611 --> 00:28:20.920
This would have taken us forever and we have done it so fast.
Awesome.
So let's,

487
00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:23.390
let's keep going here.
Let's look at what this app has in your,
how,

488
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:26.000
how has this APP structured.
We need to understand it.

489
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:30.490
So let's look at in the con config file.
So in the config file,
um,

490
00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:35.850
this person added the credentials for the database to sequel lite database.
Um,

491
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.330
they've got the mail server or great stuff like that.

492
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:43.130
What we want to do is we want to add an upload folder,
right?
So these are these,

493
00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.580
these are global keywords.

494
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:48.050
So one thing we want to do is we want to add an upload folder that's going to

495
00:28:48.051 --> 00:28:51.080
store whatever images that doctors or whoever uploads in,

496
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.300
since it's on my local machine to start,

497
00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.000
I'm just going to name it whatever my local

498
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.640
directory is called.

499
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:05.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

500
00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:09.050
<v 0>That's it.
That's my upload folder.
And that's all right.
So anyway,</v>

501
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.140
let's see what else I've got here.
And so let's look in the index file.

502
00:29:12.141 --> 00:29:16.400
The index file.
Okay,
so if we go to index,

503
00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:21.410
here's the index,
right?
That that home page,
if the current users authenticated,

504
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.530
then show hi username.
Okay,
makes sense.

505
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:28.340
And it says it's extending from layout dot.
Html.
Okay,
so what's in layout?

506
00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:33.080
That's where the good stuff is.
Okay,
then now we've got some style sheets.

507
00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:36.890
Now we got to brush up on our a html and javascript.

508
00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:38.140
<v 1>Okay?</v>

509
00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:38.351
<v 0>Okay.</v>

510
00:29:38.351 --> 00:29:43.351
So what we can do is we can add our logo here,

511
00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:48.370
right?
So remember that brand Mark Logo,
assume that you screenshotted it,

512
00:29:48.371 --> 00:29:53.050
then you uploaded it to injure,
right?
Then what you can do is you can say,

513
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:56.680
let me add that right.

514
00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:02.530
Let's say here
and then let's see what it looks like.

515
00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:08.140
Boom,
there's our logo,
there's our low go.

516
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.290
And so what we can do now is we can change the rest of the,
um,

517
00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:17.370
we can change the rest of the attributes and CSS to make it look more like what

518
00:30:17.981 --> 00:30:19.120
we would want it to look like.

519
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:26.700
So we'll say for this entire container,
we want the background.

520
00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.340
Uh,
it's,
we're going to say it's going to be a

521
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.460
<v 1>okay</v>

522
00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.010
<v 0>background color,</v>

523
00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.470
just like that.

524
00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:47.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

525
00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:52.210
<v 0>Which is the color that brand mark gave us.
And then we go back here.</v>

526
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.440
The whole thing is that color,
the whole thing became that color.
Good.

527
00:30:56.441 --> 00:30:59.620
It's beautiful.
Now we got a center it,
I mean,
you know what it is.

528
00:30:59.621 --> 00:31:01.180
We've got a center of this thing now.

529
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:05.320
Center Center.

530
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:12.220
<v 1>Center
closing.</v>

531
00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:17.570
Good.
Good,
good,
good,
good,
good,
good,
good,
good,
good,
good.

532
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.480
<v 0>All right,
so we did that.
Now what are we going to do?</v>

533
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:22.430
So now we want to add our pricing.

534
00:31:22.431 --> 00:31:26.090
So what we can do is we can go to stripe and first you got to create an account

535
00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:30.470
at stripe,
right?
So I have an account and once we're in our stripe account,

536
00:31:30.471 --> 00:31:34.280
we can go to the developers tab,
we can find our API keys.

537
00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.480
And so we have to Api keys.
We have a publishable and a secret key always.

538
00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:40.700
I'm going to change this by the time the video is there.
So it's all good.

539
00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:44.810
So Stripe has several very easy code snippets that we can just paste in that

540
00:31:44.811 --> 00:31:49.160
will immediately take someone's car details and then allow us to authenticate

541
00:31:49.161 --> 00:31:51.070
their,
their details,
make a charge,

542
00:31:51.071 --> 00:31:52.670
and it's going to show up in our stripe balance.

543
00:31:52.671 --> 00:31:55.310
So we don't have to worry about that.
Obviously they take a cut,

544
00:31:55.311 --> 00:31:58.640
that's their business model,
but it's uh,
it's,
it's,
it's working well.

545
00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:04.570
So what we can do is we can place that here.

546
00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:06.050
Let me see if that,

547
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:07.280
<v 1>yeah.</v>

548
00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:11.820
<v 0>Worked.
Let's see what happened.
All right,</v>

549
00:32:11.821 --> 00:32:14.850
so here's an example.
So what I did was it created an html table.

550
00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:16.320
And in that I embedded,

551
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:21.330
let's look back at the code I embedded just these three little stripe scripts,

552
00:32:21.331 --> 00:32:25.020
scripts I just copied and pasted from the stripe documents,
which basically says,

553
00:32:25.021 --> 00:32:25.950
here's your data key.

554
00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:29.490
Choose an amount you want them to pay and then just paste this in and they're

555
00:32:29.491 --> 00:32:30.690
going to take care of it using this.

556
00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:34.550
See how it's pulling from their javascript file to allow for this.
So just this,

557
00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.950
these three pay with card buttons.
And so that's it.

558
00:32:37.951 --> 00:32:40.880
So we didn't have to code any of that.
We'll just type in an email,
you know,

559
00:32:40.881 --> 00:32:43.360
you can use a test card,
it doesn't,
you know,

560
00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:48.380
work and CV and then you can click pay and then that's going to make a charge

561
00:32:48.381 --> 00:32:52.220
for you.
So that's our payment functionality integrated into our APP now.

562
00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:58.280
Okay.
So we have our payment functionality and now what we want to add are,

563
00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.430
um,
what's next?
So we have our payment functionality.

564
00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:06.350
We want to add the upload functionality,
right?
So,
uh,
we'll do this with html.

565
00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:11.610
There we go.
Does he upload code?
Great.

566
00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:12.800
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

567
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.760
<v 0>thank you.
Html.
And we'll place it here.</v>

568
00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:27.500
If the user is authenticated only then,
then we'll let them upload,

569
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:31.340
right?
So there's that,
right?
So now for the last bit,

570
00:33:31.341 --> 00:33:34.310
we want to make sure that we are able to inference,
right?

571
00:33:34.311 --> 00:33:36.470
So that's the whole point.
Once they've uploaded something,

572
00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.840
we want them to be able to inference with that code.

573
00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:44.300
And so the way we can do that is we're going to go into the routing file and so

574
00:33:44.301 --> 00:33:48.260
okay,
so we're going to add a new route.
It's going to be called APP dot route.

575
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:53.270
Once somebody has uploaded
an image,

576
00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:57.890
the uh,
you know,
it could be either get or post is going to be post.

577
00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.900
These are our different curl commands to talk a little bit of a crud,

578
00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.310
create,
read,
update,

579
00:34:04.311 --> 00:34:09.140
delete to go back to like old school web development.

580
00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:12.860
Now we'll upload a file,
right?
So once a user is uploaded a file,

581
00:34:12.861 --> 00:34:14.390
we want to do something with that file.

582
00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.240
And so we're going to import care os for this.

583
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.430
So we have to import care os and then we're going to say,

584
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.910
well if it's going to be a request,
if the request method is post,

585
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:34.710
<v 1>get that file
and</v>

586
00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:40.430
<v 0>get that model.
The resonant model,
the weights are there,</v>

587
00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:46.250
the weights are from image net,
which already exists.
This is pre pre training

588
00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:52.430
or the are actually are retrained model,
which are,

589
00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:53.390
which is a,

590
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:54.950
<v 1>okay,</v>

591
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:56.330
<v 0>oh wait,
stop at age five,</v>

592
00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:01.310
the weight side h five file that we've pretrained and then we're gonna say,
okay.

593
00:35:01.311 --> 00:35:06.311
So our image is going to be image dot load image and it's going to come directly

594
00:35:07.941 --> 00:35:08.774
from

595
00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:12.893
<v 1>okay</v>

596
00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.870
<v 0>the file</v>

597
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:20.230
and that's our image.

598
00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:25.210
Now we're going to use our model to make a prediction model dot predict with the

599
00:35:25.211 --> 00:35:27.820
image.
And we will

600
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.420
<v 1>return</v>

601
00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:39.960
<v 0>you uploaded html page and we're going to return the predictions that it's made.</v>

602
00:35:39.961 --> 00:35:43.020
And then the,
uh,
on the uploaded an html page,

603
00:35:43.021 --> 00:35:46.950
we'll take that data and we'll format it.
So it's in a pretty,
uh,

604
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:51.960
format for the doctors to be able to see predictions to coated.
Great.

605
00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.450
Awesome.
So there we go.

606
00:35:55.451 --> 00:35:59.890
So we have our inference code and then it's going to render it for the client.

607
00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:03.360
Then what we can do is we can say,
let's pay by card,
you know,
so for the,

608
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:08.080
through the basic plan,
we're just going to say that it requires only,

609
00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:11.410
you know,
10 bucks for a single image.

610
00:36:11.411 --> 00:36:14.800
Now they can move on to higher plans,
but that's the basic plan.

611
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:16.540
And then once they paid,

612
00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:21.690
then they'll choose a file and the file is going to be his file of a medical

613
00:36:22.931 --> 00:36:25.690
image will help load it.

614
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:28.870
It's running in France like we coded out and then

615
00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:35.380
once it's done it will display the result beautifully for us.

616
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:41.103
<v 1>Boom,</v>

617
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:45.330
<v 0>98% pneumonia.
Okay,
so once we've done that,</v>

618
00:36:45.331 --> 00:36:48.870
we can move on to the next step and the next step is going to be to deploy it.

619
00:36:48.871 --> 00:36:52.680
And the way we do that,
like the way I would do this is to just go to Heroku.

620
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.280
And so here's like a bunch of deployments that I added,
but it's really simple.

621
00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.210
We just say,
okay,
in the director who say Heroku,
which is a keyword command,

622
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:04.560
say Heroku.
And so which is the one we want right here.

623
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:08.370
So right here we say Heroku create,
we'll create a remote Heroku,

624
00:37:08.371 --> 00:37:12.810
create a remote branch.
Great.
We're in,
we created,
it's called stormy ridge.

625
00:37:12.811 --> 00:37:17.310
Here's the link.
And now we say get in it,
get ad dot.

626
00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:21.810
Get status.
That's everything.
Get commit.
M let me make this bigger.

627
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:27.550
You'd commit m yo get push Heroku,

628
00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:35.000
push Heroku master.
All right,
so that's it for her Roku deployment.

629
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.550
And obviously now it's a,
it's an actual link.
We can link that to our domain.

630
00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:41.610
We could switch it up with our landing page and there's a lot more we can do,

631
00:37:41.611 --> 00:37:44.610
right?
So that was his 10th step.
Now in the future,
well can we do,

632
00:37:44.611 --> 00:37:48.810
while we can obviously add a mobile app so doctors can classify with their,
uh,

633
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:50.970
mobile devices with their,
with their cameras,

634
00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.850
and we can have it happen on the device with like low,

635
00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.800
low power inferencing techniques,

636
00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.690
core ml for ios and android has its whole whole suite as a whole suite dedicated

637
00:38:00.691 --> 00:38:03.900
to this.
And then we can also make a better model,
right?

638
00:38:03.901 --> 00:38:07.950
So one thing we can do is we can add batch inference so they can upload many,

639
00:38:07.951 --> 00:38:11.580
many images all at once,
not just one.
Uh,
we can design it better.

640
00:38:11.581 --> 00:38:13.620
Obviously the design could have been much better.

641
00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:16.680
And also we can create a continuous serving pipeline.

642
00:38:16.681 --> 00:38:20.160
And the best tool I've seen to do this is tensorflow serving.

643
00:38:20.161 --> 00:38:24.690
I mean this is really,
really powerful stuff.
The whole idea behind serving,

644
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.940
which is the tensorflow library,

645
00:38:26.941 --> 00:38:31.941
is that it builds this continuous pipeline of models that are training on new

646
00:38:32.191 --> 00:38:33.600
data retraining.

647
00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:38.400
And it's got this a version system where older models will be deprecated and

648
00:38:38.401 --> 00:38:40.270
newer models will come in in real time.

649
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:44.200
So it's this continuous training pipeline where it's improving over time.

650
00:38:44.201 --> 00:38:48.100
It's learning from its users,
data from your users data.
And this is very,

651
00:38:48.101 --> 00:38:50.500
very powerful.
And it's,
it's,
it's what we want to do.

652
00:38:50.501 --> 00:38:53.830
We want to make our system better with every image that it sees.

653
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:57.640
We want it to continuously improve and we want it to be robust and to always say

654
00:38:57.641 --> 00:38:58.150
online.

655
00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:03.150
So obviously I did not cover every single thing we needed to build an AI

656
00:39:03.521 --> 00:39:07.850
startup,
but hopefully I gave you some education,
some inspiration.
Um,

657
00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:12.960
and to just an example to show you that this is indeed possible and it is

658
00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:16.180
something that you can do no matter who you are,
where you are,

659
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:17.860
this is something that you can do.
All right,

660
00:39:17.861 --> 00:39:20.860
so and you'll find the code for this in the video description.
