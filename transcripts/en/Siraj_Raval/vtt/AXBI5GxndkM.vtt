1
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.270
Hey brian,
how's it going?
Oh,
hey.
How are you doing?
Suraj pretty good.

2
00:00:08.271 --> 00:00:11.870
Do you mind if I asked you 67 questions?
Sure.
Her.
All right,
let's do this.

3
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.260
So what's life like it in video?
Well,

4
00:00:15.261 --> 00:00:17.180
I think in video is a speed of light company,

5
00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:21.710
so we're always trying to figure out what the boundaries are and push as close

6
00:00:21.711 --> 00:00:22.550
as we can to them.

7
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.600
What's the application of deep learning you're currently the most excited about?

8
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.320
I'm most excited about graphics for deep learning.
Uh,

9
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.070
obviously Nvidia cares a lot about graphics and cares a lot about AI and there's

10
00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:37.600
some opportunities to really change the way we create and render graphics with

11
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.180
deep learning.
You got your phd from Berkeley.
Do you need,

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.150
you need a PAC for deep learning?
No,
you don't.

13
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.290
Some of my favorite researchers don't have PhDs solely fine.

14
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.240
Favorite part of the software stack?
Um,
hi,

15
00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:55.640
love compilers.
Compilers are pretty awesome.

16
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.220
You spent two years in Russia and learned Russian.
I did.
Right.

17
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.070
Tell me a phrase in Russian Yamahas new bill.
You're both just show up.

18
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:06.920
We'd Emojis Dushay Mia who?
Goslin Yusuf Sam

19
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.850
describes Kuda in one sentence.

20
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.880
Cuda is Cindy parallel programming done right?

21
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.890
What's one thing you wish people knew more about?
Kuda um,

22
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.730
I wish that people knew that with Folta our newest gps,

23
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.780
it's a lot more like parallel programming on a CPU and all the threads can work

24
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:31.450
independently spread.
What do you do to relax?
Uh,
I went to bake.

25
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.040
What comes after gps in terms of AI processing hardware.

26
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.440
GPS are the best processors for AI.

27
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.190
If you could spend an evening with one famous person,
who would it be?

28
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.920
I have to go with President Obama.

29
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.960
You invented a language called copperhead.
Was that as difficult as it sounds?

30
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.960
It was a lot of work.
Um,
it's,
it's interesting.

31
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:56.840
A lot of the ideas behind comprehend are now pretty common.

32
00:01:56.841 --> 00:02:01.460
And frameworks like torch blue on last thing you made with your hands,

33
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.530
a loaf of raisin bran.
Conrad,
what's the next problem you want to solve?

34
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.670
A,
I'm really focused on reinventing graphics.
They die.

35
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.820
What advice would you give yourself 10 years ago?
I would say more deep learning.

36
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.500
What website do you waste time?
Uh,

37
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.140
I love the beyond three d forums and youtube.

38
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.020
Last person you emailed my boss,
Jonah all.

39
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:32.420
Then you get an all expenses paid trip to one city.
Where do you go?

40
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.160
I like to go back to,

41
00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:37.490
you can see it in book in the middle of the URL region and Russia.

42
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.030
Would you visit Mars?
Of course.
Who would,

43
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.650
what is one thing you can't live without?
My computer.

44
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.430

48
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.840
What is something you do to come up with project ideas?

49
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.960
Do a lot of brainstorming in Google docs and no idea is too stupid to put down.

50
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.130
You worked for Baidu for two years.
How was that experience?
If I do is great.
Uh,

51
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.210
it was very fast paced and lots of wonderful technology is being created there.

52
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.770
Uh,
so I had a wonderful experience there.

53
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.300
I did kind of run into the limits of what I could do since I was remote working

54
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:37.150
in America.
And so I'm glad to be working back at Nvidia.

55
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.330
Will China dominate AI in the next decade?

56
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.870
I think they've got a lot of people working really hard and they're doing

57
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:47.110
amazing things.
What was the first program you ever made?

58
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.740
First Program I ever made was on our old Timex Sinclair 1000 and I was making

59
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.330
little plots
what the music genre you're currently into.
A,

60
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:02.920
I'm super obsessed with modern choral music.

Um,

65
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.560
right now I guess I'd have to say language modeling.
Super interesting.

66
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.330
What is a misconception people have about technology in general that is built

67
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.850
out of breakthroughs one after another?
Actually,

68
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:37.790
a lot of technology comes step by step.
Name,

69

I'm most excited about unsupervised learning.

75
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.180
What are the people that you've met at technology conferences like,
oh,

76
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.710
they're normal people may be a little bit more focused.
Uh,

77
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.800
generally fun to have technical conversations with.

78
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.370
Describe an ideal culture in one word.
Self-Aware.

79

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:29.980
be honest with yourself.

81
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.830
You think you need a phd to do deep learning?
No,
I don't.

82
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.350
Well,
the singularity happened.
I don't think it will.

83
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:43.090
Not In the way that we're worried about.

84

What is one of the most surprising things you've ever learned from your studies

86
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.010
in deep learning
that deep learning models can actually,

87
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.790
it's very surprising and people take it for granted,
but like why?

88
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:06.050
Why should that be true?
What is the meaning of life 42?

89
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.440
What was the last thing that frustrated you?

Where would you like to see yourself in the next five years?

96
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.120
I'd really like to see some of the interventions from our lab making a

97
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:42.800
difference to in video.
Do you think molecular computing will become a reality?

98
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.640
Yes.
And I think we're on the way there already.
If you ran the world,

99
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.960
what is one log you to net?
Um,

100
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.890

<v 2>okay.</v>

106
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.040
<v 1>I don't know.
It's too hard a question.</v>

107
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.230
What were you like as a kid in grade school?

108
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.900
I was pretty ambitious and pretty extroverted.

109
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.100
I really liked to go up to people and tell them why I was really,
really smart.

110
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.480
I was kind of annoying.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.890
If you were to start from scratch today,

115
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:53.060
what is one learning resource you would use to learn deep learning fast.ai?

116
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.860
Awesome.
Well,
thank you so much for taking the time to answer those questions,

Great.
That's fine.
All right.
Have a good one.
All right.
