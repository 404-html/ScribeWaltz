1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.540
Brace herself.
You're about to feel the learn so hard.
Hello world.

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.570
It's a Raj and the question I get asked the most by far is how do I get started

3
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:10.800
with machine learning?

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.960
I've created a three month guide to help you go from absolute beginner to

5
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:18.540
proficient in the art of machine learning,

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.150
and I'll describe it in this video.

7
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.390
It's for those who can only dedicate part time to learning since you either pay

8
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.320
have a job or B have to go to school,
but you're,
if you're able to go full time,

9
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.420
you could complete this in half the time.

10
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.900
This is something that I create for myself if I were to start learning AI today,

11
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.060
but I'm open sourcing it for you to help you out.

12
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.730
Let's start by looking at the hiring page for deep mind,

13
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.140
arguably the world's leading institution when it comes to publishing state of

14
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:53.940
the art Ai Algorithms.
If we look under the research engineer position,

15
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.860
we'll see a description for what it takes to be a part of the team responsible

16
00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:02.870
for Alphago,
the deep Q network and wave net,

17
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.760
each of which revolutionized the field of AI.

18
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.230
The minimum qualifications or having a bachelor's in computer science or a

19
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:13.500
related field,
strong knowledge of python,

20
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.140
machine learning and algorithmic design.

21
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.010
No need to have a phd or have published a ton of papers.

22
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.620
Even under the preferred qualifications.

23
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.570
If we were to create a pie chart to try and understand the necessary topics for

24
00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:30.600
machine learning,
it would look something like this.

25
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.080
35% of it would consist of linear Algebra.

26
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.580
25% would include probability,
theory and statistics.

27
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.770
15% would be calculus,

28
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.340
another 15% would be algorithms and complexity,

29
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.500
and the last 10% would be dedicated to data preprocessing knowledge.

30
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.070
We can build our own curriculum around this chart,

31
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.200
but wait where to begin?

32
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.890
I've divided this curriculum up into three months.

33
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.120
The first month consists of math and algorithmic complexity.

34
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.040
The second month consists of machine learning and the third month consists of

35
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:11.820
the most popular subset of machine learning,
deep learning.

36
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.530
But before we begin,

37
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.730
I want to first say that one of your daily tasks should be to keep up with the

38
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:21.360
field.
So here are the best resources to do that.

39
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.880
First is my youtube channel.

40
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.620
I'm going to be pushing AI content here nonstop every single week,

41
00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:33.270
so hit the subscribe button to get notified of new content if you haven't yet.

42
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.910
Next is the machine learning subreddits.

43
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.120
It's a place where people are working both in academia and in business on ml

44
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.080
share their findings.
Twitter is also a really underutilized resource.

45
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.590
Twitter acts like a real learning feed if you use it the right way.

46
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.010
Follow really smart people and scrolling down your feed.

47
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.700
Unlike most social platforms won't drain you.
In fact,

48
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.360
it will enrich you with knowledge.
Ml researchers love to use Twitter.

49
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.830
There are some really good academic debates that happened there as well.

50
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.910
Some examples of researchers I follow are Elliot Sutzkever,
Trent mcconaughey,

51
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.290
Andre Carpathy,
Andrew Trask,
Pieter Abbeel,

52
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.100
Chris Olah and Nando defrayed us.
There are many more.

53
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:22.420
I'll link to them into description.
Hacker news is another must have.

54
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.600
The audience is well versed in the technical details of the topics mentioned so

55
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:31.240
you know that the only the best arguments rise to the top.

56
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.140
All of the resources I suggest are going to be video based.

57
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.380
I just learned so much better using videos and short form written content on the

58
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:45.550
web and by using a plain textbook that just lists equation after equation after

59
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:48.610
equation with no real life application.

60
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.120
Now on to the first month learning the math,

61
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.590
we'll start with the portion that makes up the most of machine learning linear

62
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.483
Algebra,

63
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.610
one of the most popular courses on Mit's open course ware website is the linear

64
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.700
Algebra course taught by Gilbert strong.

65
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.880
He's got a kind of infectious enthusiasm for this stuff and there are 35 video

66
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:15.160
lectures available on Youtube as a playlist.

67
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.260
Watch each one at two x speed if possible,
three x if you can handle it.

68
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.710
Take the time to hand write your notes as you watch,

69
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.960
not necessarily for your record,

70
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:29.830
but just to engrain what you're learning into your head that much more

71
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:30.664
efficiently.

72
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.440
Studies show that taking notes by hand really does enhance your brain's ability

73
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.540
to retain the concepts you're learning.

74
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.730
Then you can move on to calculus three blue one brown has an incredible playlist

75
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.160
called the essence of Calculus grants.

76
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:47.350
A friend of mine and I can vouch for his work.

77
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.860
He'll teach you calculus in a way that makes you feel like you could have

78
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:55.861
invented it yourself and when it comes to probability and statistics at x has a

79
00:04:56.471 --> 00:05:01.240
really good course called the science of uncertainty taught by Mit.

80
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.480
You'll also find an awesome course on algorithmic design and analysis on ex

81
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.780
taught by UPN.

82
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.670
Dedicate a week to each one of these courses even though they say they take

83
00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:13.390
longer.

84
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.390
We're practicing what's called accelerated learning two to three hours every

85
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.560
single day of undistracted absorption.
You are going to be like a sponge.

86
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.990
Watch a lecture at a faster speed,

87
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.300
take notes as you go and complete one project at the end of every week,

88
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.710
preferably one of the harder ones at the end of the course to complete yourself.

89
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.630
Each of these subjects has a one page cheat sheet you can find on the web
anyway,

90
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.640
don't feel bad if you complete a course faster than what the authors suggest.

91
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.180
Learning is just about downloading data into your brain.

92
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.550
You can use tools to accelerate that process.
Now we're ready for it.

93
00:05:53.551 --> 00:05:57.890
Month to machine learning.
I've got three playlists for you to watch an order,

94
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.360
learn python for data science,
the math of intelligence and intro to tensorflow.

95
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.350
Then checkout you.
Udacity is free intro to machine learning course.

96
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.230
It's pretty well made for the next two weeks.

97
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.490
You're going to pick some cool machine learning projects to complete and code

98
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:15.290
them yourself using python.

99
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.940
I've got a great compilation of ideas in the form of a good hub link to help
you.

100
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.380
This is going to help you develop a sense of when to use a specific machine

101
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:29.330
learning model and how it would work for an application specific use case.

102
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.720
I also recommend participating in a Kaggle competition.

103
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.110
It's a great way to learn and earn money.
At the same time,

104
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.890
it's this ability to categorize certain types of problems,

105
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.210
certain types of machine learning models that well-paid machine learning

106
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:46.670
consultants provide for companies.

107
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.470
If you can build this intuition yourself,
you'll be much better off.

108
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.710
I'd suggest picking and choosing two projects a week and building each from

109
00:06:56.721 --> 00:06:57.380
scratch.

110
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.300
This will give you hands on experience with the pillars of machine learning

111
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.270
including optimization,
data,

112
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.510
preprocessing types of learning,
data set,

113
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.760
splitting and model evaluation.

114
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.710
This is all about turning sponge mode into code and a lot of the art of data

115
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:20.711
science lies in the dozens of micro decisions you'll make to solve a specific

116
00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:23.600
problem.
This is the perfect time to practice.

117
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:28.601
Making those micro decisions and evaluating the consequences of each side can't

118
00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:32.630
learn is a really easy framework to quickly implement some machine learning

119
00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:35.750
models.
You'll find that over time to complete a problem,

120
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.800
you'll be asking yourself the same questions,
how to best split the data,

121
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.880
what are the best parameters,
et cetera.
At the end of this month,

122
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.110
you should give yourself a final project and that would be to code up the simple

123
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:50.480
gradient descent algorithm from scratch.

124
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.500
It's the most used optimization strategy in machine learning.

125
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.330
If you can code this from scratch,
literally everything else becomes easier.

126
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.420
All right,
onto the third month deep learning,

127
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.370
the specific algorithm called a neural network when given vast quantities of

128
00:08:07.371 --> 00:08:12.371
data and vast amounts of computing power outperforms almost everything else.

129
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.410
Almost every time and that's why it's so popular.

130
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.650
Check out my intro to deep learning course on youtube.

131
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.140
Then checkout fast.ai deep learning course,

132
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:25.400
36 hours of high quality lessons for free for the last two weeks.

133
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.460
Just implement deep learning app after deep learning APP.

134
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.140
Over this time period you should have at least five to 10 projects related to

135
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:35.660
machine learning and deep learning on your get hub.

136
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.860
You'll be surprised how fast you can go from learning about simple perceptrons,

137
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.810
two state of the art models.

138
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:46.070
The difference being usually just a few minor tweaks in the architecture of the

139
00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:50.090
deep learning space as of now is rich with technical literature and some of the

140
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:53.960
best stuff is free.
At the end of these three months,

141
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.590
you should feel confident enough to take your knowledge and either a work in the

142
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:00.780
field as a machine learning engineer,

143
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:06.080
be start a consulting firm or see start your own product based AI company just

144
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:09.030
to figure things out as you go.

145
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.470
Stop telling yourself that you can't learn it or you're not smart enough to

146
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.800
remember.
Learning is a life long process.

147
00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:19.620
No matter how old you are or where you're from,

148
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:24.000
you can get to the point where you can make an impact in this field.

149
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.330
Thanks to the Internet and look,
if you don't like my learning plan,

150
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.720
make your own.
Do what suits you best and better yet,

151
00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:33.810
get a friend to commit to the same learning path as you.

152
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.680
