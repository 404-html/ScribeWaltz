1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.500
My beautiful,
healthy baby boy.
Thank you CRISPR.

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.100
Hello world.
It's Saroj in a few days ago,

3
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:12.690
a Chinese scientists claim to have created the first genetically modified

4
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:17.220
humans.
This triggered memories of that Dystopian eugenics book,

5
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:21.090
brave new world that I spark noted in high school.
No regrets.

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.420
He used a very popular gene editing tool called Crispr to modify the embryos for

7
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:31.590
a couple during fertility treatments to make them resistant to HIV infection,

8
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.060
which resulted in the birth of twin girls immediately afterwards,

9
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:40.830
one of the inventors of crisper through some scientific shade at him by calling

10
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:45.630
for a global moratorium on using it to create gene edited babies.

11
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.240
<v 1>MMM.
This</v>

12
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.240
<v 0>fiasco has brought some really hard questions in biotechnology to the limelight</v>

13
00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:56.080
that I'm going to address.

14
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.910
Should we be engineering our own biology and that of our offspring.

15
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.010
What are the other potentials for this technology and what does it even mean to

16
00:01:06.011 --> 00:01:06.844
be human?

17
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.970
In 1919 to Hungarian agricultural engineer Carl Iraqi key saw a time when

18
00:01:12.521 --> 00:01:16.300
biology could be used to turn raw materials into useful products.

19
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.920
He coined the term biotechnology to describe the merging of biology and

20
00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:21.754
technology.

21
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.230
We can consider agriculture to be a form of early biotech.

22
00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:31.000
When farmers introduced their plans to new environments and selectively bred

23
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:34.720
them with others,
they inadvertently altered their genetics.

24
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.220
Also brewing beers,

25
00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:41.221
so hipsters are basically biotechnologists and after more than 40 years of

26
00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:43.090
running on parallel tracks,

27
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.240
the information and life sciences are slowly beginning to fuse into a single

28
00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:53.770
technological and economic force.
We're using computers to decipher,

29
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.490
manage,
and organize that amounts of genetic data,

30
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.530
which is the raw resource of the emerging biotech economy.
A wreck.

31
00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:04.780
He's vision has now been realized.

32
00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:09.781
We are at the stage where we're able to program living systems and organisms to

33
00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:14.860
solve problems and make products introducing glow in the dark water.

34
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.600
Thousands of biotechnology startups are popping up across the world with

35
00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:23.830
products like new medicines,
medical devices,
resilient crops,

36
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.110
biofuels and pollution controls.

37
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.240
We're creating biological data banks using genetic information of millions of

38
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.820
years of evolution to remake the natural world.

39
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.210
The breakthrough that laid the groundwork for modern biotechnology came when the

40
00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:44.281
structure of DNA was discovered by Watson and Crick in the early 1950s DNA is a

41
00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:48.490
long coiled molecule found in the center of a cell.

42
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.260
It provides the full blueprint for the construction and operation of a life form

43
00:02:53.261 --> 00:02:56.860
be a minuscule microbe,
an elephant,
or even a human.

44
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.870
Every cell in an organism holds complete copy of that organism's DNA.

45
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.460
That data in DNA is not stored as ones and zeros as it is on silicon chips,

46
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.000
but instead,
as code made up of four basic building blocks,

47
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.060
a c t and g called nucleotides.

48
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.350
The order they appear is like the order of the letters that spell words.

49
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.590
Their order forms different genes and each gene contains the instructions for a

50
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:24.310
specific protein.

51
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.290
The genes in the DNA of a cell can be either active or inactive depending on the

52
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:31.810
cells needs.
Once a gene is active,

53
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.410
it's data is used to make the protein for which it coats.

54
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.280
Proteins can put molecules together,
break them apart,

55
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.380
relay messages between cells,

56
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:46.381
act as antibodies to defend against diseases or act as structural building

57
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:49.420
blocks,
giving shape to cells and organs.

58
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.360
Now you can retake your bio exam and pass.

59
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.190
Bio Technology is advancing really fast these days due to two reasons.

60
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.430
Ai and crisper.
For example,
IBM's Watson.

61
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:04.900
Ai Uses an ensemble of different machine learning models to derive insights from

62
00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:09.901
data and in a demo was fed 70 k papers published around one single protein.

63
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.370
What would have taken a well trained human years to understand Watson was able

64
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:18.310
to do instantly.
It integrated the data,

65
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.720
created a map of interaction and added seven new protein interactions that

66
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.940
humans later discovered independently.

67
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.300
And then there's crisper scientists usually don't like using the word miracle,

68
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.110
but it seems like they make an exception when it comes to this crisply named

69
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.640
gene editing tool.
Crispr stands for clustered regularly.

70
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.240
Interspaced short palindromic repeats.
Yeah,

71
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.800
the name sounds ridiculous.

72
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:49.801
I know it refers to unusual DNA sequences that help protect organisms by

73
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.020
identifying threats like viruses and attacking them.

74
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.280
When we look at the DNA sequences themselves,
they are clustered.

75
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.310
They are spaced out at clear intervals and when assigned letter values they do

76
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:07.240
look like short palindromes repeating over and over with slight variation.

77
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.690
Bacteria uses these repeats like collections of mugshots to identify bad viruses

78
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.790
and another crucial component here is cas nine this is an enzyme that can cut

79
00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:23.791
apart DNA bacteria fight viruses by sending the CAS nine enzyme to cut up

80
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:26.650
viruses that have a mugshot in the collection.

81
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.030
Researchers have used a similar approach to turn this micro virus fighting

82
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:35.200
system into the hottest new lab tool.
An organism's genome.

83
00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:39.370
The entire set of its DNA instructions can be altered quickly and efficiently.

84
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:42.730
Using Crispr,
it's low cost,
easy to use.
In fact,

85
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.390
you can buy a $150 kit to use CRISPR at home.

86
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.830
Some middle schoolers are already doing it in their science classes and all I

87
00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:55.600
got to do was cut open a frog for those who don't want to conduct experiments

88
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.380
locally.

89
00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.380
Cloud labs like transcriptomic makes it possible to do so remotely using

90
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:04.880
robotics.
It automates the tedious stuff like tool building,

91
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.680
which lets aspiring bio data scientists focus on answering questions.

92
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.570
Crispr and cas nine works as a homing device that guides molecular scissors to a

93
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:16.070
target selection of DNA.

94
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.790
It's like a computer mouse just point at the place in the genome and you can do

95
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:21.440
anything you want at that spot.

96
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.390
Both the cost of gene sequencing technology and computer processing power has

97
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:29.810
dropped dramatically allowing for this field to flourish.

98
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.910
The question then becomes,

99
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.290
how can we engineer our world with biotechnology?
Well,

100
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:40.910
to start by ending hunger,
huge questions.
Vex the future of food.

101
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.890
How do we feed 9 billion people?

102
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.640
How do we form in an era of unprecedented climate uncertainty?

103
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.130
Will Starbucks survive in Italy?
No.

104
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.520
So far genetically modified organisms or GMOs have been used to help feed the

105
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:55.760
world's hungry,

106
00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.140
but they are still not seen as a sustainable solution by some governments

107
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.320
because it involves inserting desired foreign genes into the existing genome of

108
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:08.210
a plant or animal,
but gene editing techniques,

109
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.240
namely CRISPR instead modifies the organism directly without introducing foreign

110
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:14.780
genetic material,

111
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.490
which allows for a new realm of both legal and scientific possibility.

112
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.230
In Subsaharan,
Senegal,

113
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:26.120
researchers tested thousands of wheat varieties using CRISPR before developing

114
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:27.710
wheat.
That could flourish.

115
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.970
Despite heat hovering constantly above 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

116
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.260
They're wheat yield,

117
00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:38.261
required less water and had five times more protein as well as more vitamins and

118
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:42.890
minerals than Senegalese rights.
All Right,
I'm getting hungry now,
but look,

119
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:48.130
we can use CRISPR to protect and repair the environment from any harm we cause.

120
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.880
One example,

121
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.470
our biofuels plants naturally turned carbon dioxide and sunlight into

122
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:55.310
byproducts.

123
00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.320
With crisper we can use the sugars that's or alcohol is produced by them as

124
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:04.970
potential alternative fuel sources.
We can even turn plans into sensors.

125
00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:09.710
They already are naturally by responding to chemicals in their environment,

126
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.940
but by re-engineering them we can get them to signal the presence of

127
00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:17.030
environmental pollutants and once identified,

128
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:22.120
it could trigger a bio remediation pathway and we can think about environmental

129
00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:27.290
sustainability in an entirely new way.
In the form of bio design,

130
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:32.030
people are already modifying genes to redesign extinct species,

131
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.811
make plans,

132
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:37.340
glow in the dark and help flowers change color depending on the time of day.

133
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.970
Adidas even made a shoe from bio engineered fiber,

134
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.870
which was inspired by spider silk,
still cheaper than Yeezys.

135
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.490
Taking it a step further.

136
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:51.491
We could theoretically engineer a tree's DNA to grow into a tree house or even

137
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:55.530
engineer entire cities to be built from an around nature,

138
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.210
living harmoniously with it,

139
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.290
and if we can engineer physical objects and living things with DNA,

140
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.590
why not create computers out of it?
Instead of silicon?

141
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:09.810
A cryptographer named Bernard Adelman use DNA to solve the traveling salesman

142
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:10.620
problem.

143
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.760
The goal is to find the shortest route between a number of cities by going

144
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:15.630
through each city.

145
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:20.631
Once Adelman was able to show that billions of molecules in a single drop of DNA

146
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.620
can be used for computing.
He represented seven cities in the strands of DNA,

147
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.300
the sequences of genetic alphabets,
a s,
a,
t c and g represented cities.

148
00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:33.900
And the path he mixed the DNA molecules in a test tube.

149
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:38.790
Some strands stuck together and chains of strands where the possible answers he

150
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:43.680
eliminated the wrong molecules using chemical reactions and what was left was

151
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:44.970
the optimal answer.

152
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.740
I know this makes c plus plus programming seem easy,
a f,

153
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.840
but DNA molecules are able to store billions of times more data than silicon

154
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:59.610
devices.
It's abundant,
cheap,
environmentally friendly and compact.

155
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.120
We can use DNA for both storage and computing.

156
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:08.070
Eventually replacing entire server farms with a box that fits in the size of

157
00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:12.900
your palm,
but democratizing technology of any kind has potential risks.

158
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.830
If gene editing becomes easily accessible to anyone via CRISPR,

159
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.970
it could be used as a tool by aspiring biological terrorists.

160
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:26.270
They could use it to grow and disseminate lethal chemicals or other pests onto a

161
00:10:26.551 --> 00:10:27.930
population of people.

162
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.000
The UN drafted an agreement called the biological and Toxin Weapons Convention

163
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.980
where countries agreed to never under any circumstance acquire or retain

164
00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:42.960
biological weapons.
It's just a start,
but if governments are on board,

165
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.550
it makes it much harder for rogue agents to synthesize harmful material.

166
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.331
So far,

167
00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:53.331
the possibilities we've discussed only include engineering our outer world using

168
00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:54.450
biotechnology,

169
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.640
but the most exciting potential of biotechnology is engineering our inner world,

170
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:03.060
meaning not gene therapy,
but gene enhancement.

171
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:08.340
There are over 10 k diseases caused by mutations in a single gene known as

172
00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:12.690
monogenic diseases and many more caused by mutations in multiple genes.

173
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:17.160
We can use gene editing to cure these diseases.
Sin Gamo Therapeutics,

174
00:11:17.161 --> 00:11:17.940
for example,

175
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.530
help demand with hunter syndrome by injecting him with their replacement copy of

176
00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:26.760
his flaw gene,
but why and at curing diseases,

177
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.190
why not cure death itself?

178
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.300
If we could choose when to die rather than succumb to a genetically

179
00:11:33.301 --> 00:11:34.440
predetermined death,

180
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:39.000
it would give us much more of an opportunity to experience life.

181
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.590
Some say that death is the only motivation to do great things in life,

182
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.480
but why assume it's like that for all people.
Curiosity,
competition,

183
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.620
spicy ramen.
There are a wide variety of motivations for people.

184
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:57.250
Rejuvenate bio is a startup that has plans to reverse aging in dogs.

185
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.170
Then reverse aging in humans.

186
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:04.270
They've used gene therapy to add additional instructions into the DNA of aged

187
00:12:04.271 --> 00:12:09.271
mice and use these instructions to regulate and modify the activity of various

188
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:10.204
genes.

189
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:14.590
They're plan is to increase or inhibit gene expression depending on its

190
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:16.210
contribution to aging.

191
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:21.010
In an attempt to restore the production of secreted molecules to youthful
levels,

192
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.390
we could also modify genes to theoretically make ourselves more fit,

193
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.310
smarter,
more attractive.

194
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.350
An ex NASA scientists was inspired by a report from China about the first gene

195
00:12:32.351 --> 00:12:37.351
edited dog that grew muscles and injected himself in front of a live audience

196
00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:42.280
with a gene he edited to prevent his Myostatin genes from inhibiting his muscle

197
00:12:42.281 --> 00:12:43.114
growth.

198
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:47.860
And that brings us to the Chinese scientist who claimed to have created the

199
00:12:47.861 --> 00:12:51.790
first genetically modified babies to be HIV resistant.

200
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:56.910
Parents can theoretically use gene editing technology to create the ideal type

201
00:12:57.131 --> 00:13:00.880
of child in their eyes.
They can enjoy raising a super genius.

202
00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:03.040
You grows up to be faster than who,
same bolts,

203
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:08.170
more beautiful than Lana del Rey and more creative than Sheil above somehow.

204
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:13.380
But should we be modifying humans at an early age in a world where that's

205
00:13:13.691 --> 00:13:16.600
possible and it is fast becoming a reality?

206
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:21.750
Some people will and their children will have a clear advantage over the rest.

207
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:22.690
In fact,

208
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:27.690
someday it could be considered morally outrageous to not use gene enhancement on

209
00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:33.121
your child to help them keep up with an increasingly information dense and fast

210
00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:34.180
paced society.

211
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.480
And wild genetic data will give people the power to predict and plan their lives

212
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.770
in ways.
Never before possible.

213
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.360
It could also be used by governments and employers to determine insurance

214
00:13:46.361 --> 00:13:48.490
premiums,
employment prospects,

215
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.640
and give rise to a new form of discrimination based on a genetic profile.

216
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:57.400
Our very notion of equity could be transformed.

217
00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:02.110
Meritocracy could be transformed into Jenna talk cracy where people are

218
00:14:02.111 --> 00:14:04.060
categorized by their geno type.

219
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.180
Think of it like an informal biological caste system.

220
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.030
Indians know what I'm talking about here.
Let's not do that again.

221
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.590
Legal safeguards are usually put in place to prevent them from discriminating

222
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.820
against features.
We can't control like race and sexuality,

223
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.060
but they do discriminate.
What we can control,

224
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.210
like our education level and work experience.

225
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.350
If we can control our genetic profile,
why wouldn't they?

226
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.350
In a world where it's accessible to everyone,

227
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.750
this could quickly become a reality.

228
00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:39.760
We need to make these tools widely available and begin the process of educating

229
00:14:39.761 --> 00:14:44.761
the population on them today and if we can engineer ourselves our basic biology,

230
00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.520
what does a future human look like?
Currently,

231
00:14:48.521 --> 00:14:53.180
we all have hundreds of cognitive biases that can't control and are well suited

232
00:14:53.181 --> 00:14:56.030
for the world of our hunter gatherer ancestors,

233
00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.240
but in an increasingly interconnected and globalized world where we can interact

234
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:04.430
with people thousands of kilometers away instantly.

235
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.610
Global security demands a more inclusive,

236
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:12.730
impartial and intellectually sophisticated conception of us that embraces all

237
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:15.020
sentient beings.

238
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:20.150
A hyper developed capacity for empathic understanding could be theoretically

239
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:24.650
engineered and genetically synthesized.
Think of it like empathy in a pill form.

240
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.400
Okay.
I made myself cringe a bit,
but I'm serious.

241
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.500
As we extend our lifespan,

242
00:15:30.501 --> 00:15:35.501
we are changing so much of our society so fast or engineering everything and

243
00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:39.890
biology.
The fundamental building block of life is next.

244
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:43.550
Some of us define being human as our limitations.

245
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.260
I prefer to define us as a species that seeks and succeeds in going beyond our

246
00:15:48.261 --> 00:15:49.130
limitations.

247
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.660
The humans of the future won't need to get drunk or stoned.

248
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.130
Their wellbeing will infuse ideas,
modes of introspection,

249
00:15:58.131 --> 00:16:02.690
varieties of selfhood and whole new sense modalities that haven't even been

250
00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:03.890
dreamt of today.

251
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:09.130
While the prospect of altering the genes of people has caused a rift in the

252
00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:10.820
scientific community.

253
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.830
This type of research is happening all over the world and we are on the verge of

254
00:16:15.831 --> 00:16:19.070
finally being able to modify our own evolution.

255
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:24.050
The question of the century then is can we use this new super power in a

256
00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:27.500
responsible way that will benefit the planet and its people?

257
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.800
We can't leave this huge decision to just doctors or just politicians if we

258
00:16:33.321 --> 00:16:37.230
don't figure out how to ensure that everyone will benefit from the potential a

259
00:16:37.231 --> 00:16:39.320
bio technologies like Crispr,

260
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:44.060
we risk the creation of a genetic underclass that has to struggle to compete

261
00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.230
with the genetically modified offspring of the rich wizards.

262
00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.290
It's up to us collectively to get this right.

263
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:56.440
We are blessed to have both an enthusiasm for technology and an interest in how

264
00:16:56.721 --> 00:17:00.320
to use it to benefit the world alone.
We are strong,

265
00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:05.000
but if we work together a future more bright than any of us could have imagined

266
00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.420
is just beyond the horizon.
What do you think of biotechnology?

267
00:17:08.421 --> 00:17:11.270
Does it excite you to let me know in the comments section,

268
00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.550
please subscribe for more programming videos.

269
00:17:13.551 --> 00:17:17.120
And for now I've got to upload my DNA,
so thanks for watching.
