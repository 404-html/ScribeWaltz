00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.480
Hello world.
It's Siraj and welcome to the learn python for data science series.

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.960
In this video we're going to set up our python environment and write a 10 line

3
00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:11.950
script that can classify anyone as male or female given just their body

4
00:00:11.951 --> 00:00:12.670
measurements.

5
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.750
Data Science is the study of data and a data scientist is someone who solves

6
00:00:16.751 --> 00:00:21.010
problems by studying data.
It's a pretty much all science is data science.

7
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.510
We observe,
we make predictions,
we test and we update our ideas,

8
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.920
so if we weren't given a data set of media right landings over the past 10
years,

9
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.860
we could come up with questions that we think that data might help us solve.

10
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.070
Like what area is most likely to get hit or how does atmospheric pressure affect

11
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.220
me?
You're right trajectory.

12
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.670
Then we could write a little code that trains a machine learning model on that

13
00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:44.200
data and predicts the answer.

14
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.130
We can use an existing model and there are a lot of them or build our own.

15
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.930
Traditionally you needed a phd for this stuff,

16
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.200
but with the world's data doubling every two years and machine learning

17
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.380
algorithms getting more powerful,
anyone can become a data scientist.

18
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.680
You just need time and motivation.
If you have those two things,

19
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.280
you'll be able to complete a bunch of data science projects and upload them to

20
00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:10.420
your get hub.
Get hub is the new resume.
It's not about how many degrees you have.

21
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.410
It's about what you can do.
Machine learning democratizes scientific discovery.

22
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.550
Okay,
I'm talking to you.
Yes,
you sitting right there.
You can be a data scientist.

23
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.600
Anyone can,

24
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.660
and the tool we're gonna use to help us learn from our data is the python

25
00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:28.120
programming language.
I'm going to teach you python,

26
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.240
but not just by talking about syntax.
You'll learn by doing.

27
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.600
In each episode we're going to focus on a different data science project.

28
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.440
I'll give you a coding challenge at the end that extends that project and you'll

29
00:01:38.441 --> 00:01:41.620
learn python along the way.
I'm picking python for two reasons.

30
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.680
It's designed for readability and its general purpose.

31
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.330
Check out this speech recognition APP.

32
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.650
It uses a library called Sphinx to read an audio file converted to text and

33
00:01:50.651 --> 00:01:51.310
print it out.

34
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.820
That's just five lines of code and we can still read what it's doing since every

35
00:01:54.821 --> 00:01:58.900
word is descriptive and compact.
Now let's look at a similar APP and c plus plus.

36
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.190
That's about a hundred lines.

37
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.700
<v 1>Hello,
so</v>

38
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.600
<v 0>beautiful.
To build our gender classification APP,
there are four steps.</v>

39
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.890
We'll install python,

40
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.730
set up our environment and star dependencies and write the python script.

41
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.120
Let's start by installing python.
If you're on a Mac or Linux machine,

42
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.380
python comes pre installed.
If you're on windows,
it doesn't yo what the,

43
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.100
regardless,

44
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.510
you'll want to download the latest version of python 3.5 0.2 as of today on Mac,

45
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:29.990
you can download the installer package and go through the necessary steps to

46
00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:30.530
install it.

47
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.530
Then you'll be able to compile your scripts from terminal using the python

48
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:37.310
keyword like so on Lennox.
You can download the source than in terminal.

49
00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:39.020
Type in three commands to install it.

50
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.100
You'll then be able to run python scripts using the python keyword on windows.

51
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.630
You can go download the installer.

52
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.500
Make sure add python dot exe to path is set to be installed on your local hard

53
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:52.010
drive and once it's finished,
you can run python right from command line.

54
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.980
Now that we have python installed,
let's set up our environment.

55
00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:58.790
The text editor we'll be using for this course is sublime text since it's super

56
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:02.680
simple to use,
but what about emacs?
No.

57
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.220
Both Mac and windows have an installer that you can use to install it for Linux.

58
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:09.790
You can install it via the APP to get package manager.
With these three commands,

59
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.810
once we have it installed,

60
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:14.710
we can type our python code in there and compile it with terminal by pointing

61
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:17.260
our python interpreter to our script.
That's it.

62
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:20.170
We only need terminal and our text editor to run our scripts,

63
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.970
so we've got our environment set up.

64
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.400
Let's move on to installing our dependencies.

65
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.160
Dependencies are packages that are code depends on,

66
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.670
we call them at the top of each script we write with the import statement.

67
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.980
Any programmer can write a package to say,

68
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.920
figure out who shot her Rhombi and a thousand lines of code,

69
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.600
upload it to the Python package server.

70
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.360
Then we could download it and call it with a single line of code.

71
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.340
All Code is part of a greater whole.

72
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:45.670
It's all linked together in a grand chain of dependencies.

73
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.970
It's like building a house in order for you to be able to build the roof of a

74
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:51.460
house.
It'd be nice if you already had the dependencies.

75
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.630
The Python package manager pip helps us install dependencies and we'll use it

76
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:56.470
right from command line.

77
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.710
You can install pip for python three using these commands for whichever

78
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:01.150
operating system you're using.

79
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.780
The only dependency we'll be using in this video to build our gender classifier

80
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.381
is psychic.

81
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:09.070
Learn a machine learning package with a bunch of prebuilt models for us to use

82
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.520
dope.
We have our dependencies installed and now we're ready to write our script.

83
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.300
We'll start by importing it first as we should for all dependencies are going to

84
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:20.740
use a specific sub module of psychic learn called tree that will let us build a

85
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:22.750
machine learning model called a decision tree.

86
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.300
A decision tree is like a flow chart that stores data.

87
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.130
It asks each labeled data point,

88
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:30.460
it receives a yes or no question it does it contain x or not?

89
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.270
If the answer is yes,
the data moves one direction.
If the answer is no,

90
00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:36.850
it moves in the other.
It'll build every node in the tree,

91
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:40.330
the more data points it receives.
Then when we have a new unlabeled data point,

92
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.680
we can feed it to the tree.

93
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.290
It will ask you a series of questions until it labels it.

94
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.530
That label is our classification.
The more data we train it on,

95
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.240
the more accurate the classification.

96
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.850
Let's start by creating our Dataset programmatically.
All right.

97
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:54.430
Our first variable x as a list of lists,

98
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.150
a variable is a value that can change and will soar or list of lists in it.
Oh,

99
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.660
this is a data type in python that can store a sequence of values.
Here.

100
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.840
Each value is a list itself that contains three numbers that represent the

101
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:07.960
length,
width and shoe size of a person will write 11 of these,

102
00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:12.370
so our data set size is only 11 people who write one more variable called why to

103
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:13.540
store a list of labels.

104
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.080
Each label is a gender and is associated with a list of body metrics in the

105
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:18.910
previous list.
Well,
write them as strings,

106
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:21.880
which is a data type used to represent texts instead of numbers.

107
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.660
Now that we have our dataset but want to define a variable to store our decision

108
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:26.410
tree model,

109
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.040
let's call it CLF short for classifier and it'll store our decision tree

110
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:30.760
classifier.

111
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.600
We can reference our tree dependency directly by calling it here and initialize

112
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:38.200
the decision tree by calling the decision tree method on the tree object.

113
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.880
Now that we have our tree variable,
we can train it on our dataset.

114
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.860
We'll call the fit method on the classifier variable,
which takes two arguments.

115
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.850
We'll store our x and y variables as the arguments and the result will be stored

116
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:50.500
in the updated CLF variable.

117
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.110
The fit method trains the decision tree on our dataset.

118
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.810
Let's test it by classifying the gender of someone,

119
00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:57.500
giving a new list of body metrics.

120
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.890
We'll create a variable called prediction to store the result and call the

121
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:03.410
predict method of our decision tree to predict the gender.

122
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:06.020
Given these three values in a list,
then we can print it out,

123
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:07.340
determine all via the print command.

124
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.210
We can run this script in terminal by saving it as demo.py and running it via

125
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:14.090
the python demo.py command.
So to break it down,

126
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.080
data scientists solve problems using data and because easy to use machine

127
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:21.560
learning libraries and abundant data are now available everywhere you can become

128
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:21.800
one.

129
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.630
Python is a programming language for both beginners and experts and emphasize

130
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.390
readability.

131
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.050
And a decision tree is a model that classifies data by creating branches for

132
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:31.310
every possible outcome.

133
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.120
The challenge for this video is to use any three different classifiers from the

134
00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:38.240
psychic learn package on this same dataset.
Compare their results,

135
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.740
then print the name of the best one.

136
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:43.040
Sometimes you have to try a few models to see what gives you the most accurate

137
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:45.290
predictions.
Poster,
get hub link in the comments.

138
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.290
I'll pick a winner within one week and mentioned them in the next video.

139
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.080
Please share this video if you liked it and subscribe for more programming

140

videos.
For now,
I've got to drink some soylent,
so thanks for watching.
