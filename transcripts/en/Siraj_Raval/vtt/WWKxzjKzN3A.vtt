1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.680
Visualize quantum mechanics.

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.011
Hello world.

3
00:00:06.011 --> 00:00:11.011
It's Saroj and data visualization is one of the most exciting parts of data

4
00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:12.040
science.

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.540
It's the art of turning raw numerical data into a visual representation that

6
00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:20.170
actually lets people understand its significance.

7
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.680
We're going to visualize a medium blog post text dataset using the Plotly python

8
00:00:26.471 --> 00:00:31.000
library and in the process learn about the three fundamental types of data

9
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:35.530
visualizations,
relationships,
comparisons and compositions.

10
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.890
We're already at the point where the amount of data in the world is too much for

11
00:00:41.501 --> 00:00:44.350
humans to analyze without proper tools.

12
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.460
We need algorithms to help us make these huge datasets consumable and

13
00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:00.724
presentable.

14
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.890
Native visualization allows us to instantly scanned through massive amounts of

15
00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:07.810
data and derive patterns from it.

16
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.350
These patterns let us derive insights and then we can make decisions based on

17
00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:18.340
those insights.
Data visualization involves math,
science,

18
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.110
psychology and design.
Hans Rosling,
a data visualization expert,

19
00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:28.090
one set that most of us need to listen to the music to understand how beautiful

20
00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:32.800
it is,
but often that's how we present statistics.
We just showed the notes.

21
00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:37.480
We don't play the music.
Data literacy means understanding those notes.

22
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.670
It's knowing the difference between concepts like means and medians and all

23
00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:45.430
sorts of things like that and when to use one over the other.

24
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.810
But visual literacy is the music itself.
Data leads to insight,

25
00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:54.010
which can form a narrative and narratives are what helped make a data story.

26
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.480
Visual literacy asks questions like,
is this chart memorable?

27
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.130
Is it beautiful?
Is the meaning clear?
Will it make me more attractive?

28
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.240
Yes,

29
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.240
it's important to understand how charts can help us specifically what charts

30
00:02:09.311 --> 00:02:12.490
say,
what charts mean and what charts do.

31
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.040
These are three distinct categories.

32
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.080
All charts say things they're creators intend and many say things that were not

33
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.943
intended.

34
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.810
A well designed chart let's US interrogate a dataset very closely.

35
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.170
This can be thought of as what a chart says explicitly and we optimize for this

36
00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:36.481
by choosing the charting method that maximizes the ability to display and query

37
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.870
data.

38
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.340
Precision accuracy and recall are all qualities that are aligned with this

39
00:02:42.341 --> 00:02:42.940
approach,

40
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.890
but charts also make implicit statements as communication mediums.

41
00:02:47.891 --> 00:02:52.891
Charts are subject to rhetorical devices and stylistic form over content.

42
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:54.783
For example,

43
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.820
orienting a bar chart downward and shifting its color can reinforce the subject

44
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.530
and theme of a chart.

45
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.920
And this implicit channel of data visualization can be even more powerful than

46
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:09.640
the explicit channel.

47
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.890
There's also what charts mean and to consider there's an intentional meeting,

48
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:19.300
but there's also a historical,
cultural and contextual meaning.

49
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.590
We've got to take this into account as we visualize data,

50
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.660
we need to have a clear idea of the audiences for our charts and the context

51
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.800
around the data in order to communicate a cohesive story.

52
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.250
But the most important thing about a chart is not it's aesthetics or even the

53
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:41.470
technology used to create it.
It's the impact.

54
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.050
Impact is what a chart does.

55
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.740
A well-designed chart is one that's optimized for impact.

56
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.180
It allows us to make very important decisions with absolute clarity.

57
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.620
Before computers,

58
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.450
data was found in books and manuscripts in order to make charts from it.

59
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.280
Statisticians,
how to use tools like rulers,
dividers and protractors.

60
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.050
Nowadays we have data visualization tools that are orders of magnitude more

61
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:09.760
powerful and easy to use.

62
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.680
So let's look at three of the most popular tools starting with the Jupiter

63
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.420
notebook.
This interface has fields for code input,
markdown input,

64
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.890
and has the ability to run code to deliver visually readable images based on

65
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:26.290
whichever visualization technique is chosen.

66
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.650
Google's online colab environment and Kaggle's colonel environment both mirror

67
00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:33.040
this functionality.

68
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.420
They're both backwards compatible with existing Jupiter notebooks,

69
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.920
which allows us to use python without having to configure our installation

70
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:43.270
environments locally.

71
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.680
It all happens in the cloud including dependency installs.

72
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.340
My dependency of choice for visualization is Plotly.

73
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.230
Plotly is an open source library built on Plotly dot js which in turn is built

74
00:04:56.231 --> 00:05:00.280
on the Popular Javascript Visualization Library d three dot.
Js.

75
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.070
We can use a wrapper on Plotly called cufflinks,

76
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:05.710
designed to work directly with pandas data frames,

77
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:09.790
so our stack will look like cuff links on top.
Then Plotly,

78
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.930
Holly Ijs,

79
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.680
then d three and what that means is that we get the efficiency of coding in

80
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:19.681
Python with the worldclass interactive graphics powers of d three this lets us

81
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:25.090
create charts in a single line with interactive elements for investigating data.

82
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.270
Many options to explore and easy customization for a final presentation.

83
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.370
What more could a data scientist ask for?

84
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.800
Will you get out of here if you don't want to code?
However,

85
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:40.000
there's also tableau.

86
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.860
This is a drag and drop tool that's especially effective for delivering

87
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.750
interactive data visualizations for the results derived from big data

88
00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:54.640
operations,
deep learning algorithms and multiple types of AI driven apps.

89
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.120
It can be integrated with AWS,
my sequel I dupe.

90
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.160
It's a very versatile tool for creating detailed graphs and it's used widely in

91
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:04.520
the industry today.

92
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.710
There are a variety of products available including a public version that's free

93
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:13.280
to use.
Another underutilized tool is Google charts.

94
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.630
It's free and offers a massive variety of visualization types that we could

95
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:22.100
spend hours browsing through from simple pie charts all the way up to

96
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:24.680
multidimensional interactive matrices.

97
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.500
There are also many adjustment options,

98
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:32.501
which makes me happier than for WRAL since it renders the results in html five

99
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:33.830
and Svg.

100
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.830
It's compatible in any browser and because it combines data from multiple Google

101
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:40.430
services like Google maps,

102
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.620
it allows us to produce interactive charts that use real time data and can be

103
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:50.240
controlled using an interactive dashboard.
So that was just three examples,

104
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:55.241
but there are a lot of very powerful data visualization tools out there and when

105
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:57.560
we're using any one of those tools,

106
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.330
it can be tempting to use the many different options available in any of them to

107
00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:05.990
make our visualization as mesmerizing as possible.

108
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.260
But this isn't the best idea.
For example,

109
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.110
let's say we're a Mexican wine company Olay.
We have a wine called Latrobe,

110
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.990
Alberta.

111
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.430
We want to compare the average price of our wine with the rest of the world.

112
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.150
If we create a bar chart of a wine price data set,

113
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:27.350
we can add all sorts of features to our bar chart,
rotated texts,

114
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.100
borderlines grids,
titles,
rainbow colors.

115
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.810
But when you look at the bar chart,
pay attention to where your eyes land,

116
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.240
what attracts your attention first here,

117
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.040
notice how there are so many things screaming for your attention.

118
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:45.140
It's hard to know where to focus.

119
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.590
Now let's remove the colors better,
right?

120
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.540
But notice those grid lines are still distracting.
So let's remove them too.

121
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.940
Now it's much more clear,

122
00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.110
but this rotated text is probably making you turn your head to read this.

123
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:04.460
So let's just rotate the bars and turn this into a horizontal bar chart.

124
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.440
Now we can immediately tell which country has the highest wind price.

125
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.140
And since we're comparing our wine to the rest,

126
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.050
let's very selectively use color here.

127
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.860
We have to tailor our graph to what we were really trying to convey.

128
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.930
But now we finally made a chart that immediately makes our points to a first

129
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.790
time viewer.
As you can see,
visualizing data is both an art and a science.

130
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.650
So let's cover the three basic types of visualizations we can convey.

131
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.520
Our relationship,
a comparison and a composition.

132
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.740
A relationship shows the connection or correlation between two or more variables

133
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:48.010
through the data presented like the market cap of a stock over time versus the

134
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.760
overall market trend.
If we have two variables we're comparing,

135
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.720
we can use a scatter plot.
A lot of real world data has a time element.

136
00:08:57.721 --> 00:09:01.710
So if we plot out the evolution of these variables over time,

137
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.640
this scatterplot can let us see how these variables have changed.

138
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:11.030
Notice how in one line we got a nicely formatted time series x axis added a

139
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:15.900
secondary y axis because our variables have different ranges and added in the

140
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:20.400
titles of the Dataset as Metadata.
If we have three variables,

141
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.720
we can set the sides of the plotted points to change in proportion to the

142
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:27.000
magnitude of a third metric.

143
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:32.100
This bubble chart lets us visualize the relationship between more variables

144
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.280
easily.
Oh and don't forget about correlation heat maps.

145
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.380
This can show the relationship between many variables all in one chart.

146
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.620
The second type of visualization is a comparison.

147
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.840
This sets one set of variables apart from another and displays how those two

148
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:50.160
variables interact,

149
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:54.540
like the number of buyers of five competing showerheads in one month.

150
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.320
There are many different types of charts we could use here.

151
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.560
The wind dataset chart we use beforehand was one example of a bar chart.

152
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.520
We can categorize the type of chart we use by whether or not we are including

153
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:13.020
time as an element.
Then further dividing by variables,

154
00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:15.150
categories and periods of time.

155
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:20.190
Line charts are a really easy way to compare many categories of variables that

156
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:25.191
change over time together all at once and with proper color coding they tell a

157
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:30.921
story with little effort and the third type of relationship is a composition.

158
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.910
This collects different types of data that make up a hole and displays them

159
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:40.911
together like the different search terms visitors used to land on our site or

160
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.650
how many of them came from links.

161
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:48.930
The canonical example here is the pie chart showing the total data set as the

162
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:52.050
sum of its parts be as some feature that we select.

163
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.490
But if we want to demonstrate time as an element in our Dataset,

164
00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.820
we can use a stacked chart like a stacked area chart or a stacked column chart.

165
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.720
Again,
it shows how pieces of data all come together to make a hole.

166
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.990
Now I do want to mention that there is actually a fourth type of visualization

167
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.220
and that's a distribution.

168
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.660
It lays out a collection of data to show how it correlates and helps us

169
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:23.400
understand if there's any interaction between the variables like the number of

170
00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:28.401
bugs reported during each month of the latest ios developer preview over 9,000

171
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:34.640
but we learned about distributions last week so I won't go too much into it this

172
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.500
week.
When we make these plots in a notebook,

173
00:11:37.501 --> 00:11:42.420
notice a small link on the lower right hand side of the graph that says export

174
00:11:42.421 --> 00:11:44.700
to Plotly.
If we click that link,

175
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.970
it'll take us to chart studio on online offering.

176
00:11:47.971 --> 00:11:52.470
That lets us touch up our plots for a final presentation with features like

177
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.610
annotations and color options.

178
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:59.800
Then we can even publish our finger online so anyone can find it with a link.

179
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.560
Partly itself is a graphics company.

180
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:07.590
It's library is free to use and we can make unlimited charts in offline mode and

181
00:12:08.171 --> 00:12:11.170
25 charts in online mode.
Overall,

182
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:14.680
there are three data visualization terms to remember from this video.

183
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.980
A relationship shows a connection or correlation between two or more variables

184
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:21.603
in a dataset.

185
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.940
A comparison sets one set of variables apart from another and displays how those

186
00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:32.251
variables interact and a composition collects different types of data that make

187
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:36.940
up a hole and displays them together.
What data said,
do you want to visualize?

188
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:37.390
Next?

189
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.900
Let me know in the comments section and please subscribe for more programming

190
00:12:40.901 --> 00:12:44.620
videos.
For now.
I've got a scatter,
so thanks for watching.
