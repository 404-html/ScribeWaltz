Hello world,

2
00:00:00.781 --> 00:00:05.250
it's Saroj and today I'm going to talk about five ways that you can make money.

3
00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:07.710
As a programmer.
Everybody needs to make money.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.980
It's just the reality of life and if you learn how to do it well,

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.290
your life will be substantially better.

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.470
So let's start with the first way contract work.

7
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.280
If you're someone who's never earned money before as a programmer,

8
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.590
this is the first method you should use.

9
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.220
There are people out there that need your skills so you just have to find them.

10
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.500
You can find contract work online on sites like upwork and freelancer and a few

11
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:33.420
others that I've listed in the video description.

12
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.190
Think of your name as a brand and like all brands you need to build trust.

13
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.550
That way you can do that is by gaining a positive reputation.

14
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.400
If your client is happy with your work,
you'll get a great review.

15
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.640
You want them to rave about you to tell our friends about you,

16
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:50.250
and if you put in the necessary effort,
they will.

17
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.010
But how did you get the clients in the first place?

18
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.360
Basically you need to get really good at selling yourself and that all starts

19
00:00:57.361 --> 00:01:01.110
with believing in yourself.
That means that given some uncertain environment,

20
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:04.320
like a project with requirements you've never taken on before,

21
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.730
you trust yourself enough to be able to figure it out before you start asking

22
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:11.310
people to trust you.
You have to trust yourself.

23
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.700
When you create your profile and one of these sites you have to sell yourself

24
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:18.570
well.
That means every project or past experience that you list should be both

25
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.130
detailed and impressive.

26
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.370
So if you made it mobile APP and you implement it a custom networking

27
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:24.204
architecture,

28
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.990
make sure to include that kind of impressive detail when it comes to picking the

29
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:29.670
type of contract you should work on.

30
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.750
It's about what's valuable to the market and what you would enjoy doing.

31
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.760
Machine learning is hot right now.

32
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:40.761
Hundreds of thousands of companies and individuals need someone to integrate AI

33
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.840
into their stack or build an APP that uses facial recognition or perform some

34
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:50.280
analytics on their database.
There are endless use cases and luckily for you,

35
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.490
not many people understand how it works at all.

36
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.630
So if you have at least some knowledge that's your competitive advantage,

37
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.030
you can basically get paid to learn.

38
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.770
Once you've either posted yourself as available for work or reply to a contract

39
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:07.650
listing,
you'll eventually get interest from a client.

40
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.400
You'll then have your first meeting to discuss the details of the project and

41
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.530
your job is to be over prepared for it.

42
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:16.950
That means do your homework on all the requirements beforehand.

43
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.980
Have a list of features in mind and a plan on how to get there.

44
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.850
This will be really impressive to your client and there'll be more likely to pay

45
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:28.140
you well.
When it comes time to discuss the payment,
don't underprice yourself.

46
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:31.560
You can always negotiate your rate down,
but if you start off with the low rate,

47
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.950
you can't increase your rate later on.
If it's your first contract,

48
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:38.790
just charge a flat fee and pick one that is short term,
like a month or less.

49
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.630
Researched the price for similar projects that have been completed and if the

50
00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:44.640
program or had a similar background to your own.

51
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.300
Once you've done one or two contract projects with a flat fee,

52
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.120
you can move on to charging an hourly rate,

53
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.770
always charged market rate or above,
and increase your rate as you improve.

54
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.620
You can also find contract work in person.

55
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.320
If your client can meet with you face to face and knows your name,

56
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.700
then it's easier for them to trust you.
Everyone could use a programmer,

57
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.090
call up some local businesses and ask if you're in college.

58
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:13.810
You can usually find work on bulletin boards and use the resources you have

59
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:16.180
locally.
When I first moved to San Francisco,

60
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.650
I lived in a hacker house with 12 other dudes and I hustled pretty hard to find

61
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:24.220
some contract work.
When I finally did it was lucrative.

62
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.900
A couple months of work gave me the freedom to travel through India,
Thailand,

63
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.340
and Japan for six months and write my first book.
He centralized applications.

64
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.860
Contract work can free you.

65
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.360
It can give you the space you need to think about the impact that you really

66
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:43.840
want to have in the world and experience all the things that you've always

67
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:47.140
wanted to.
The second way is to start a business.
Now,

68
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.430
this is the most difficult but also the most potentially lucrative way to make

69
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:54.670
money.
The chance of succeeding is relatively slim,

70
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.750
but you can definitely increase that chance by doing a few things.
First of all,

71
00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:01.630
your main goal should be to have a positive impact.

72
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.500
You have to believe in the cause.
Secondary to that should be the money,

73
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.160
not the other way.
There's a very thin line between the two,

74
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:12.130
but it's such a crucial one.
Startups are hard,

75
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.240
you are fighting for survival in the market and the number of uncertainties can

76
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:19.150
occur,
but if you have that drive,
then it doesn't matter.

77
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.980
Your belief in a cause greater than yourself will help you to push through all

78
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:28.390
the hard times,
all the rejections.
Think about a problem that you want to solve.

79
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.540
Close Your eyes and envision a world where this problem is solved and from that

80
00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:37.270
vision work backwards.
How do we get to that world?

81
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.830
That's where your startup comes in.

82
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.690
Marc Andreessen once famously said that software is eating the world.

83
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.960
At the same time,
AI is eating software.
Soon,

84
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:50.500
machine learning will be happening in every single layer of the stack from

85
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:53.830
operating systems to rendering,
to networking,
all of it.

86
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.810
So that means you can just apply AI to some existing idea and boom startup.

87
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.350
You need to be sure that the idea is something that people want.

88
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.610
I had a robotics startup in college.
I built a team,
built a prototype,

89
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:09.190
raised money,
but after eight months of building,

90
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:12.190
we found that our clients in really want our product.

91
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.660
We could have saved all our time and energy if we had some committed customers

92
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.280
from the start.
So make sure you have that in an excel spreadsheet.

93
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.580
These big companies like Amazon and Google are buying up AI startups like candy,

94
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.260
which is a very lucrative exit strategy.

95
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.260
The third way is a full time job or internship.

96
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.310
Start out by working for a smaller company first where you'll have a lot of

97
00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:39.670
responsibilities.
You want to optimize for learning.

98
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.900
You'll learn a lot in a fast paced environment and since you're not used to the

99
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:46.120
comfort of a bigger corporation yet,

100
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.350
it'll be easier to do and please don't do any unpaid internships.

101
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.080
If you know how to code,
you should be paid for it.

102
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.590
The fourth way is to participate in programming contests.

103
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.400
You enter into one of these things as either a team or a single person and

104
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:02.690
you'll learn a lot.

105
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.790
There are several sites online like hacker rank and topcoder that will pay out

106
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:10.670
prizes to the winners of a given programming challenge.

107
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.140
Local hackathons are also a great way to do this.
If you can't find one near you,

108
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.930
start your own.
Call up the potential sponsors.

109
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.800
Say a company who's Api you really like and say that you're organizing a

110
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:25.790
hackathon,
that we'll get programmers to build tools using their software.

111
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.470
You get a cut up the earnings,

112
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.640
the programmers get the learn and the company gets more attention.
Lastly,

113
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.800
the fifth way is to complete bounties.

114
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.270
The idea is that people essentially give out a flat fee for someone to fix a bug

115
00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:41.480
in their repository.
It's like monetizing get hub issues.

116
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.400
You could potentially fix one down t a week for some fun spending money or make

117
00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:47.234
a living off of it.

118
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.890
Down these horse and bound defy are two great resources to do this and that's
it.

119
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.600
Go forth and make it rain wizards.

120
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.140
Please subscribe for more programming videos and for now I've got to get back to

121
00:06:57.141 --> 00:06:59.180
the grind,
so thanks for watching.
