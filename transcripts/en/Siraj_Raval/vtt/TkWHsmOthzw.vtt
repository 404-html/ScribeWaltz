Hello World Saroj here.
Let's talk about five ways to use bitcoin.

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.640
The first way to use it is to make money transfer faster.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.270
The current system of money transfer is centered around banks.

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.910
Even though Bitcoin doesn't require big account,

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.430
I'm still a fan of the idea of a big,

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.920
I'm not saying banks are a hundred percent trustworthy,

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.440
but I am saying I trust my mind enough to use it.

8
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.720
It provides security as service.

9
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.350
I can put all my money in my bank account and not have to worry that it will be

10
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:32.370
stolen because they built that trust over a long period of time with many,

11
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:33.240
many people.

12
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.990
I get a debit card and don't have to carry cash on me and if my card is stolen

13
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:40.560
and fraudulent charges are made,
my bank or funding,
it's great,

14
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.460
but one thing that my bank could do better is transfer money faster.

15
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.900
Bigs can use the bitcoin protocol to make money transfer instance.
For example,

16
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.100
international money transfer usually takes five business days.

17
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.160
That's because the banking system was designed pre-internet,

18
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.200
so money has to be routed to a bunch of different checkpoints before it reaches

19
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.130
the recipients.

20
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.330
The bitcoin protocol runs over the Internet to the recipient will receive your

21
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:08.520
money instantly to do this.

22
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.110
Banks can create their own internal cryptocurrency peg to their states currency.

23
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.700
Since bitcoin is so volatile,

24
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.370
so one bank coin could equal one US dollar always and bank queen could piggyback

25
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.010
off the speed and security of the bitcoin block chain to a user.

26
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:26.940
All transaction would occur in Derek currency of choice,
just like always,

27
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:29.370
they wouldn't even know it,
but under the hood,

28
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.430
this technology would not only make money transfer instance,

29
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.810
it would also allow you to send money to directly to bitcoin addresses,

30
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.200
not just traditional bank accounts.
I mean,

31
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.090
not everyone has the privilege of having trustworthy banks in their country,

32
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.220
particularly in the developing world.

33
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.720
A third of the world's adult population doesn't have a bank account in

34
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:55.440
developing countries.
Financial infrastructure can be totally,
totally absent.

35
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.640
People need bank accounts to participate in the global economy to get paid and

36
00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:01.320
access loans and build credit.

37
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.930
The coin makes a barrier to entry for getting a bank account,

38
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.900
zero open a bitcoin wallet,
and you're good to go.

39
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.220
The bitcoin protocol can increase the region who we can send and receive money

40
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:14.190
from.
Not just people with traditional bank accounts,

41
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.690
but people would stand alone.
Bitcoin addresses as well.
Basically,

42
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.040
anybody with a phone can have what is essentially a bank account in their
pocket.

43
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.570
That's pretty cool,
right?

44
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.350
The second way to use it is to make it easier to earn money online.

45
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.790
Online transactions involving traditional currency involved transfer foods,

46
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.660
which means you can't really pay people a few cents at a time because the

47
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:38.970
payment would be lower than the fee itself.

48
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.640
Bitcoin allows people to get paid with really,

49
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:44.160
really small amounts or micropayments.

50
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.770
Since the transaction fee is almost nonexistent.

51
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.530
That means instead of being paid every two weeks at your job,

52
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.430
you could be able to get paid by the power minutes or even seconds.

53
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.280
People could page other fractions of pennies for data,

54
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.680
whether that be images or videos or articles,
whatever.

55
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.320
So if you were to write the song and posted on the Internet,

56
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.520
you could ask people to give you 1 cents or even half a cent per view and

57
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:08.620
bitcoin finally makes this possible.

58
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.410
The third way to use it is to help grow your startup.

59
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.850
Let's say you want to start a startup.

60
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.580
You create a product and incorporate your company.

61
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.640
Now you just need to raise money to get started.

62
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.860
Crowdfunding could be a cool idea,

63
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.820
but people might not be as likely to invest in you if all they get is a free tee

64
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:25.480
shirt.

65
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.890
What if you could reward people with equity or shares in your company using

66
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:30.250
bitcoin?

67
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.820
You could create your own currency with a few clicks and you can think of your

68
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:38.230
coins,
this shares and your company.
Each share would be linked to one coin.

69
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.830
You can give them out to people who back you early on or early adopters.

70
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.190
The value of your coins and grow as the value of your company grows,

71
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.990
just like in a traditional corporation to not just crowd funding the crowd

72
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.670
equity.
It's like an IPO,

73
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:55.120
but on day one it'll allow you to raise money much faster and since people will

74
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:59.560
be more invested in your company succeeding,
you get much more exposure,

75
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.830
but the possibilities don't end there.

76
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.510
Advances in robotics and automation technology are increasing at an accelerating

77
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:11.650
rate.
Robots are going to replace a lot of humans for Labor based jobs,

78
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.610
and then the need for a social safety net for people will become more apparent.

79
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.260
Well,
micropayments will allow people to get paid for their data if might not be

80
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:22.600
enough to fulfill their basic needs entirely,

81
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.640
which brings us to our fourth teams.

82
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.050
There could someday be a cryptocurrency that creates a global basic income.

83
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.200
That's right.
The cryptocurrency that gives people money for doing nothing.

84
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.540
We'd all be able to do whatever we want.
We'll all the robots do the word travel.

85
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.700
Do Research,
do drugs up.
Sorry.
No.
Anyway,

86
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.600
we need to find a way to prove one person could only create one account perhaps

87
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:47.020
by verifying existing government backed ids.
Then a consent.

88
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.280
Everyone who owned coins is small dividends every week just for existed,

89
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.660
and we could call it social coin.
There's so many possibilities.
I mean,

90
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.300
there had been many other cryptocurrencies created since bitcoin.

91
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.220
There's light coin and Doge coin and conduct am a God kind of pleased you head

92
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:05.980
to spotlight and all of them have their own unique features.

93
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.990
Like coin has faster transactions.

94
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.160
Bitcoin uses the computing power of its minors to solve scientific research

95
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:16.710
problems.
Zero Point makes transaction history,
privates.
The list goes on.

96
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.200
Our fifth use is efficiently connecting all monies.

97
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.340
The future of money is one where there is a thin layer of software around all

98
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:28.120
currency and we can just transact in the currency we're most familiar with and

99
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:32.680
take advantage of different currency features under the hood protocols like

100
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:34.690
stellar and to do just that.

101
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.700
Two of the biggest problems in the world war and poverty are directly linked to

102
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:41.380
the uneven distribution of wealth.

103
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.410
Global Bitcoin can help optimize how money is transferred across the planets and

104
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:48.970
make the world more safe and equal and free.

105
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.610
If you have more ideas on ways to use the coin,

106
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.850
please share them in the comments below.
I'd love to read them.

107
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.750
Thanks for watching.
