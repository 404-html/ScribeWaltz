00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.260
Move 37 it's finally here.
Hello world,

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.290
it's Saroj and I've been teaching a course called move 37 for the past 10 weeks.

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.180
I wanted to culminate it all.

4
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:16.530
Every RL technique we've talked about with this one video,

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.830
I'm going to explain what moved 37 is and three reasons why it's so significant

6
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:26.280
for our future in terms of human jobs,
health and lifestyle.

7
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.120
The go board game is very popular in large parts of Asia.

8
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.950
It's very old and some players have dedicated their entire lives to mastering
it.

9
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.110
When polled most AI researchers believed it would take several decades for

10
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.500
computers to reach the standard of a human expert player.

11
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.750
It's a very challenging game with more potential board positions and there are

12
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:50.310
atoms in the universe.

13
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.670
A player has to learn how to recognize abstract patterns in hundreds of pieces

14
00:00:55.741 --> 00:01:00.630
placed across the board and even experts have a hard time explaining why a

15
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:04.050
particular move is either beneficial or problematic.

16
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.260
So when deepmind's Ai Program called Alphago Zero beat the world champion at go

17
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.930
much earlier than expected history was made starting with the training set of

18
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:19.971
recorded games that contained over 30 million moves made by expert go players.

19
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.280
The AlphaGo zero algorithm used a model proven to be able to learn from image

20
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:28.770
data directly called a convolutional neural network.

21
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.940
It was fed a series of games states as input meaning the positions on the board.

22
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.230
The network learned how to predict the next move and learn to predict the

23
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.170
outcome from different arrangements on the board.

24
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.290
Since go has so many potential moves,

25
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.340
a brut force search would take way too long,

26
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.640
even longer than it'll take apple to release an augmented reality device.

27
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.880
So instead the convolutional network was deployed in the context of a search

28
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:59.340
algorithm called a Monte Carlo tree search.

29
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.670
This tree search was used to initially explore many possible moves on the board,

30
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.990
then focus that exploration over time as certain moves were found to be more

31
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:12.510
likely to lead to wins than others.

32
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.940
Alphago used the neural network to both predict moves to help guide which

33
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:22.941
branches of the game treatise search and it use it to evaluate the positions it

34
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:25.770
encountered during its search.

35
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.020
This allowed it to intelligently search upcoming moves and ultimately beat the

36
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:35.100
world champion at the game.
But even more important than Alpha goes.

37
00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:37.890
When was one moment during the game,

38
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.580
the moment that caused Lisa Dole to leave the room?

39
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.880
Alphago played this move,
which I want to hear more about in a second,
but uh,

40
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.270
ray has left the room.
He left the room manager that room after that move.

41
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.740
It was a move that seemed terrible to everyone who saw it,

42
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.980
but it turned out that move 37 was an move to play and it was instrumental in

43
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:04.150
helping alpha go win the game.

44
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.100
Somehow a computer program knew something about the game that we didn't.

45
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.090
Somehow,

46
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.710
it's intuition was both different and better than human intuition.

47
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.310
One of the players fan way said,
it's not a human move.

48
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.810
I've never seen a human play.
This move.
So beautiful,
beautiful,
beautiful.

49
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.730
Ai thinks you're beautiful too fast.

50
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.340
Move 37 offered us a glimpse of what an intelligence looks like that thinks

51
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:35.230
differently than we do,
but it's still very much capable of accomplishing tasks.

52
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.130
Interestingly,

53
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.750
Lee played his own move in a later game with Alphago since they were playing

54
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:44.470
through a series of them,
which helped him win one of the Games.

55
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.850
Move 78 called the divine move or brilliant [inaudible] by some.

56
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.800
The designers of Alphago called it a one in 10 thousands move because Alphago

57
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:58.420
calculated that there was a probability of one out of Ken thousand that a human

58
00:03:58.421 --> 00:03:59.470
would play that move.

59
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.800
Lee's move 78 caused Alphago to make suboptimal decisions in the next round.

60
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.660
Lee learned that Alphago was superior at playing the right moves to optimize for

61
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:11.710
small gains,

62
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.510
but it could fail and extreme situations where the gain of points in one move

63
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.130
would be more important.

64
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.640
This was an example of intelligence augmentation.

65
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.800
Better designed algorithms lead to better performances and better performances

66
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.080
help humans make better decisions.

67
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.380
Humans who make better decisions can create environments where algorithms fail.

68
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.640
I.
E.
Divine moves and learning about these failures helps us design better

69
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:40.510
algorithms.

70
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.040
The AlphaGo algorithm influenced Lee's gameplay and vice versa.

71
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.050
We can work together with this machine intelligence in many different ways to

72
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:54.010
further extend our capabilities across every industry.

73
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.570
This kind of technology can help us achieve goals that we could not do alone.

74
00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:00.940
And I'll outline the three biggest ones.

75
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.580
The first is health care cancer,

76
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.690
all timers and a host of other major diseases plagued humanity.

77
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.870
Many die every year because our best scientists haven't been able to find a cure

78
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.200
in the USA.

79
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.030
The path to develop a new medicine takes at least 10 years on average and costs

80
00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:24.031
an average of 2.6 billion US dollars and less than 12% of the candidate

81
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:26.230
medicines that make it into phase one.

82
00:05:26.231 --> 00:05:29.350
Clinical trials are approved by the FDA.

83
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.390
There are billions of possible lead molecules that could be used as potential

84
00:05:34.391 --> 00:05:35.140
cures,

85
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.910
so a scientist has to use their intuition to pick one that would most likely

86
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:43.690
have the desire properties for curing the disease in question.

87
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.970
The process of synthesizing and testing a single new molecule in a lab could

88
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:52.150
cost thousands or tens of thousands of dollars.

89
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.780
So the early stage guessing process is really important.

90
00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.230
We can use AI help generate a potential molecular structure,

91
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.470
say using a model like generative adversarial networks,

92
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.670
which have shown a lot of promise generating different types of useful data in

93
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:12.290
these dueling networks where one progressively becomes a better data generator

94
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.430
by trying to fool the other into thinking what it's generated is real through a

95
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:17.390
feedback loop,

96
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.650
feeding in bass quantities of molecular data that no human could process all at

97
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:26.120
once could result in some incredible advances and human scientists could test

98
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:29.330
what they've generated to see if it's a valid cure along the way.

99
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.330
They'd come up with more clues in the right direction,

100
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.490
tweaking their algorithm as they go along.

101
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.150
This is an example of the intelligence augmentation process.

102
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.180
Realized AI could also help offer a second diagnosis for a doctor to help aid in

103
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:44.870
their diagnosis,

104
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.950
giving them yet another perspective to consider to best help their patient.

105
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.760
The human body is itself an extremely complicated system.

106
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.440
Absolutely rich with data.

107
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.120
Ai Can help us ask questions that we never even thought to ask and help

108
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.840
individual humans by learning about their specific health needs,

109
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.040
delivering personalized medicine or treatments when they need it.

110
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.340
The second is software design.

111
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.460
We humans are not the best at writing software and when a software project

112
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:19.190
becomes big enough like say the Google chrome browser,

113
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.340
it's hard for a single human besides Jeff Dean to understand the entire code

114
00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:25.790
base.

115
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:30.790
Imagine a form of programming where we give high level input to our machine and

116
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:34.310
it decides on the implementation details by itself.

117
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.190
Take Consensus Algorithms.
For example,

118
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.390
the hype around crypto currencies has been around for almost a decade now and we

119
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:46.070
still haven't figured out a way to create a scalable blockchain consensus

120
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.180
algorithm that doesn't to demand so much electricity to run.

121
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:55.220
Proof of work is a human designed algorithm and so are the different blockchain

122
00:07:55.221 --> 00:07:56.780
consensus mechanisms.

123
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.000
There's so much theory that goes into designing these from economics to

124
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:05.960
cryptography to distributed systems to sometimes even physics.

125
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.830
It's a hard problem that will require a radically different way of thinking to

126
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:12.740
come up with the solution.
Perfect.
For an AI.

127
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.210
Google's auto ml is one example of AI automated software design.

128
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:22.430
It learns how to tune hyper parameters for specific models and companies can use

129
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.820
this all in one solution to fit their business needs.

130
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:30.920
Just give it a Dataset and an objective and in the ideal scenario it learns

131
00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:34.730
which model to use,
what it's hyper parameters should be,

132
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.790
and how it should clean and regularize the data.

133
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.290
And this principle of AI assisted design doesn't just have to apply to software.

134
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:44.360
It can be any creative endeavor.

135
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.520
Brandmark uses AI to generate a whole host of potential logos and themes for a

136
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:50.354
new startup.

137
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.890
Just give it some initial parameters of what you want and watch as it gives you

138
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.210
many options and googles.

139
00:08:57.211 --> 00:09:02.211
Magenta project has resulted in some very cool web demos that let humans play

140
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:04.260
music alongside Ai.

141
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.910
The Ai can learn your style of playing and adapt and you can do the same.

142
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.170
In this way,
the duet becomes greater than the sum of its parts.

143
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:18.090
In fact for any idea that we have,
we can use AI to visualize it,

144
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.330
assess the different possibilities and pick the best one,

145
00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:24.300
be it a scientific or creative endeavor,

146
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.180
and the third is a personal assistant.

147
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.840
The amount of data in the world doubles every two years.

148
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.640
We are constantly getting flooded with a whole host of options of content,

149
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:40.670
of choices from the Internet and different algorithms across the applications we

150
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:44.280
use are constantly manipulating our behavior,

151
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.180
tweaking our opinions and attention through subtle design tricks,

152
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:53.390
engineering the reward signals that are native to human psychology to get us to

153
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:54.571
do something,

154
00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:58.980
whether that's clicking on an ad or buying a specific product.

155
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.840
We have to parse through all of this noise for ourselves to see what is the most

156
00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:07.440
meaningful to us.
This is a very,
very hard task.

157
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:12.530
A personal AI assistant stored locally trained on our data with a transparent

158
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.720
backend could help us navigate the complexity of life and ways we did not think

159
00:10:17.911 --> 00:10:21.060
possible.
It could know us better than any human could.

160
00:10:21.061 --> 00:10:26.061
Concatenating data points about us from our web browsing history to our heart

161
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:29.430
rate.
It can tell us how to best achieve our goals,

162
00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:34.230
whether that's in fitness or in school,
in a career or in a relationship.

163
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.100
We can use this feedback to help guide our own decisions.

164
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.260
Move 37 also catalyze the current AI renaissance that China is currently

165
00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:46.860
undergoing in the West.
Go isn't as common a game,

166
00:10:46.861 --> 00:10:49.680
but in China it's a highly respected game.

167
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:54.810
Many even believing that it's a sacred game connecting humans to the universe in

168
00:10:54.811 --> 00:10:55.680
its complexity.

169
00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:00.540
Alphago defeating the world champion at a game thought to be so sacred in China

170
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.440
was huge,

171
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.440
bigger than in the West because the general population is more familiar with

172
00:11:06.721 --> 00:11:08.820
just how complex the game is.

173
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:14.150
The Chinese government promptly created an AI development plan to become the

174
00:11:14.191 --> 00:11:18.840
world leader in Ai by 2030 and it's definitely executing on it.

175
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.041
Ultimately,

176
00:11:20.041 --> 00:11:25.041
automation technology will help free humans from Labor based jobs and create new

177
00:11:25.141 --> 00:11:29.160
classes of jobs that we actually enjoy doing.
I hope you liked the video.

178
00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:33.390
Please subscribe for more and for now I've got to try to play go somehow.

179
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.860
So thanks for watching.
