00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.560
Hello world,
it's Saroj and isn't scheduling a pain.
And this video,

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:06.810
what you're seeing behind me is what we're going to build.

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.220
It's a slack Bot that can schedule meetings for you.
So you just say,

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.090
I want to schedule a meeting with this person at this specific time.

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.840
And what it will do is they will go through their process of going through both

6
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:23.700
your calendar and that person's calendar looking for if,
if that time works,

7
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:26.400
if it doesn't work,
it will.
Then if it doesn't work,

8
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.810
it's going to try it another time.

9
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.190
It's just going to keep going until it finds a time for you guys to meet with no

10
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:33.024
conflicts.

11
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.830
And it's using AI in the way that it's being able to read your texts through

12
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:40.920
natural language processing and convert that into an action.

13
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:43.800
Or in our case we can call it an intent.
Okay,

14
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:45.570
so that's what we're going to build in this video.

15
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.890
And this is very useful for recruiting firms.
It's useful for teams,

16
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.300
it's useful for,
you know,

17
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:54.330
anybody who needs to schedule meetings and doesn't want to have to worry about

18
00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:57.630
that back and forth.
You know what I'm talking about?
Between emails of,
Oh,

19
00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:00.720
can you meet on this day?
Oh no,
that's not okay.
How about this day statewide,

20
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.280
it's a lot of time.
It's a lot of brain process and AI can take over for us.
Okay.

21
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:09.420
So this is how scheduling can be applied to many industries,

22
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:13.710
but the industry we're going to focus on in this video is recruiting.
Okay?

23
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:18.711
So there's a lot of different technology that recruiters use to help speed up

24
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.620
that pipeline,
right?
So from natural language processing,
you know,

25
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:26.280
reading resumes,
analyzing the text within a resume,

26
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.000
summarizing it's giving it each candidate a score automatically,

27
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.200
let's say out of a hundred,

28
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.730
being able to sift through all the dozens of applications that they're getting,

29
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.870
uh,
being able to say,
well,
this candidate is a specific fit for this job,

30
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.180
or know this candidate is actually a better fit for this job.
Uh,

31
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.590
that's all natural language processing people analytics,
right?

32
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.370
All of your social media information says a lot about you,
right?

33
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:52.170
And so you know it,
it can be kind of scary,

34
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:56.820
but employers and potential potential employers can learn a lot about you

35
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.990
without you even having met them in real life before rights that can analyze

36
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.680
your Facebook,
your Twitter feeds,
you know,
your cloud score,
et cetera.

37
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.170
And they can learn what kind of person you are.

38
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.870
Sentiment analysis is another great example.

39
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.790
If recruiters wants to see what would be a good potential pool of candidates,

40
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.680
they can say,
well here is my brand.

41
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.890
Let's see what percentage of users on Twitter are expressing a positive

42
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:25.620
sentiment about my brand.
And they are technically adept,

43
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.500
or at least they're adept to be a good fit for this role.

44
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:32.610
So people who are good fits and like by brand,
let me reach out to them,
right?

45
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.900
So there's a lot of things that recruiters have to do just manually that they

46
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:41.820
can automate with AI across the entire pipeline.
And this applies to recruiting,

47
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:46.821
but it also applies to anybody who wants to use AI to increase their

48
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:49.890
productivity in a business environment.

49
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.830
So scheduling interviews is a very,
very time consuming process.

50
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.050
How can we increase productivity here?
Right?

51
00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:00.730
So that's what we're going to build is this slack scheduler Bot.

52
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.420
It's in Java script and we're going to be using certain technologies to build
it.

53
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:07.420
Then I'll talk about right after I get through this very short history of

54
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:12.010
recruiting.
So there are five ways that recruiting is changing because of Ai.

55
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.830
One is the advent of,
of course,
big data.

56
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:18.400
There's so much out there that if you're not using it,
whatever industry,

57
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.960
even recruiting agriculture,
any,
if you're not using big data to make decisions,

58
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.060
you are objectively doing it wrong.
The decline of job portals,

59
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:31.700
right?
So in the,
in the late 1990s,
uh,

60
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.190
monster.com popped up,

61
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.720
a bunch of job board websites popped up and they were a way to move away from

62
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.280
newspapers and classified ads to the Internet for candidates to then post their

63
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:43.114
jobs there.

64
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.620
And then they could then find the relevant companies that would hire them.

65
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:50.100
But the problem is that this,
there's been a decline here in,

66
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.370
in job portals because in a network to the digital era,

67
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.930
there's not as much of a neat to do that.

68
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.140
There are different ways to find companies that you're interested in.

69
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.990
They're not necessarily job portals.
Word of mouth,
social media.
That's true.

70
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.980
That's another one.
Linked in get hub,
crowdsourcing talent.

71
00:04:05.981 --> 00:04:07.300
It's becoming very popular.

72
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.650
And also it's becoming a world where remote work is becoming the norm.

73
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.370
And that's,
I'm not saying it's a norm right now,
but it is becoming the norm.

74
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.720
And because of that,

75
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.130
there's all these micro entrepreneurs that these companies are now hiring that

76
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:23.200
are not necessarily fulltime employees.

77
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.260
They're on demand employees and even very big companies,

78
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:28.660
traditional companies are moving towards this model.

79
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.730
And the last point is experience losing premium.

80
00:04:31.731 --> 00:04:36.731
So the world is changing so fast because of AI and it skills get dated fast.

81
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:41.290
So degrees and experience are losing their edge as learnability and adaptability

82
00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:44.230
are more important skills in this increasing market.

83
00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:46.630
And just listen your degree and listen to your,
you know,

84
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:51.310
static experience is not as important as how adaptable you are,
as,

85
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.530
as,
as,
as how driven you are.

86
00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:56.530
And that's something that you can't just list in a resume,

87
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.760
but big data can help inform that decision,
right?

88
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:05.320
So there are major factors that are affecting the recruiting industry right now

89
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.140
that there is a,

90
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.050
and the reason I say this is because there's a huge opportunity to apply AI to

91
00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:15.190
this field because of these trends.
One,
all the baby boomers,

92
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.420
those are people born in the fifties sixties postwar are beginning to retire and

93
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:23.800
vacate jobs.
So there's going to be more job openings to SAS is on the rise.

94
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.670
Again,
building a second tech boom software as a service companies,

95
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:28.480
they're rising.

96
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.160
Social media is becoming very commonplace and younger generations are used to

97
00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:34.970
this social media outlet.
So you're,

98
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.740
what you're saying is more job openings and more people applying for jobs so

99
00:05:39.741 --> 00:05:41.950
that the market is increasing on both ends.

100
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.520
So just huge opportunity to help both ends of those markets.
Right?

101
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:48.610
So what does that,
what does that saying about the gold rush?

102
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.850
More people made money giving a shovels to the gold miners and the ones actually

103
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:54.910
fishing for gold.

104
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.820
Only a very small percent percentage of those people actually found goal.

105
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.620
But the people who were smart gay built shovels to sell to those gold miners.

106
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.890
And that was the same case for cryptocurrency rights.
You know,

107
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:10.370
very few people may a lot of money off of cryptocurrency even though it seems

108
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:11.360
like everybody is.

109
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.710
But the people who really made money were the people built businesses Asex

110
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.600
[inaudible] mining rigs,
you know,

111
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:21.710
different cloud mining solutions to help those people in there get rich quick

112
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:24.470
schemes.
The same can be applied to the recruiting industry.

113
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.820
What tools can you make to help recruiters improve the efficiency of their

114
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:29.570
pipeline?

115
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.890
What tools can you make to help candidates that are assessed their own profiles

116
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:38.150
and improve them?
So,
you know,
there are a lot of different websites that are,

117
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.140
that are offering tools for all of these things.
One example is reo,
right?

118
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:44.690
So Aria is automated AI sourcing.

119
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.350
What a recruiter can do is they can just type in a keyword and say,

120
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:50.870
I want a candidate that fulfills these,
these fields.

121
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.020
It will then crawl the web to find those candidates.

122
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.830
So it just imagine how much AI it's using in the background,
right?
It's,

123
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.240
it's taking certain keywords.

124
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.170
It's then searching for candidates that fit those keywords and they're suitable

125
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:06.730
for your job description because there's so much data out there,
it's,

126
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.460
it has to be able to segment that data and find the quality data out there.

127
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.690
One that I think is very cool is Clara.
So Clara labs is an,

128
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:18.050
is an AI assistant for scheduling emails.

129
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.920
So Clara labs is a very cool,

130
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:26.921
because what it does is it allows the candidate to book more interviews and

131
00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:32.090
focuses on each candidate.
So it you're,
you're able to say,
okay,

132
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:35.090
I'm going to CC Clara,
right?
So if you're a recruiter and you want to,
you know,

133
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.070
schedule an interview with a potential job candidate,
you can just cc Clara,

134
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.910
which is an AI.
It's all in AI and say,
I'd love to show you a demo.
Let's,

135
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.410
how about Tuesday?
And then Clara,

136
00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:48.590
we'll take it from there without having their need to be a back and forth.

137
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:49.760
What Clara is doing,

138
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:54.761
the reason it's an AI is it's using natural language processing to understand

139
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:56.220
the sentiment,
the,

140
00:07:56.221 --> 00:08:01.120
the intent behind different texts and then coordinates via the Google calendars

141
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.550
for both,
for both parties.
And all of this is done automatically,

142
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:05.690
which is very cool.

143
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:09.200
And they built a multimillion dollar business in just two years,

144
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:13.010
which is incredible.
It's incredible.
And there's a lot of room,
uh,
for,

145
00:08:13.011 --> 00:08:17.900
for this to happen.
This is an right,
this is one use case,
right?
Recruiting X.
Dot.

146
00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:20.570
Ai is doing,
do these for different industry.

147
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.110
Thin is doing this for travel planning.
There's a lot of different industries,

148
00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:29.060
but the basic idea remains the saying save people time and money and you will

149
00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:32.330
succeed in what your,
whatever your startup is.
I should be doing this right now.

150
00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:33.820
I should be.
But the thing is,
I'm,

151
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.780
I'm making so much revenue from what I'm doing right now that I just,
um,
I'm,

152
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:41.010
I'm pretty happy.
So,
so what,
what,
what,

153
00:08:41.011 --> 00:08:43.340
what I'm trying to say is that scheduling is different.

154
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.360
If you're a salesperson and your sales team is measured by the total number of

155
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.010
meetings you've scheduled,
right?

156
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:52.700
So it's not like every single industry is going to be,
you know,

157
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.840
optimized by the fact that they have meetings.
Right.
But some like recruiting,

158
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:02.070
well let's get into the technology.
I've talked enough about the background here.

159
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.670
So what is the architecture of what we're going to build?
So this is an Ai Bot.

160
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.690
It's a slack Bot and what it's going to do is it's going to use four different

161
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:14.220
technologies.
The first one is api.ai.
I made a video for them back in the day,

162
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:17.760
like a year and a half ago.
And then they got bought out by Google.
But it is,

163
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.690
it is a machine learning tool used to process natural language.
It's very,

164
00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:23.520
very cool.
Uh,
basically,

165
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:27.150
I mean they renamed it to dialogue flow once Google bought it,

166
00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:30.750
but it's the same backend.
So if you type in api.ai,
you'll go,

167
00:09:30.751 --> 00:09:34.290
you'll go to the website.
And basically what it lets you do is say,
you know,

168
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:39.330
what I want is for all of these different phrases to result in the same
response.

169
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.770
So,
and it's it,
it uses machine learning,
right?
So you can say,

170
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:48.240
hello world,
what's up?
You know,
that's a different training phrase.
How are you,

171
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:53.250
you know,
how are you doing?
And then it's what it's going to do is it's going to,

172
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:57.570
uh,
create a vector representations of all of those sentences.

173
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.560
So there is a single vector representation that encapsulates every single

174
00:10:01.561 --> 00:10:03.330
response that you've input to the model.

175
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.580
This is different from a hardcoded bought,

176
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.700
because you can say a couple of training phrases,

177
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.430
you might not have all of them rights,
but you can say a couple.

178
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.090
And what it's gonna do is it's going to find this semantic similarity between

179
00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:18.000
different words.
And the way it does that is work to,

180
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:20.340
Beck is one example of an algorithm that does this.

181
00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:24.900
It converts words into vectors.
And if you think about a word,
right,

182
00:10:24.901 --> 00:10:28.120
if you think about a word,
it's a collection of ones and zeroes,
right?
It's,

183
00:10:28.121 --> 00:10:30.090
it's just numbers behind it's a string.

184
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.890
And there is one representation that can represent all the different words that

185
00:10:34.891 --> 00:10:37.200
are spelled differently,
but they really have the same meaning.

186
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:42.150
So how are you and how are you doing and what's going on?
Those are,

187
00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:43.740
those are spelled totally differently,

188
00:10:43.741 --> 00:10:48.330
but they have the same intent until what api.ai does is it lets you define an

189
00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:52.800
intent.
So in this example,
I'm defining an intent as welcome,
right?

190
00:10:52.801 --> 00:10:55.950
So in the welcome intent,
if a user says any of these things,

191
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.640
and this is training data that I'm giving it to in addition to other texts that

192
00:10:59.641 --> 00:11:03.480
it learns,
right?
So you can give it a data set of texts or you can say,
here's,

193
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:06.750
here's the words and then just learn the vector representation.

194
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.770
The intent behind all of this and if anything that a user says is,

195
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.550
is even remotely close to the responses that I've typed in,

196
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.010
it's going to hit that intent and it's an output.

197
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:20.250
The predefined response right here that I can say,
you know,

198
00:11:20.251 --> 00:11:23.250
the response is going to be,
you know,
good day greetings,
I'm doing fine.

199
00:11:23.251 --> 00:11:27.900
Whatever you want,
I'm doing fine.
So it's not a fully,

200
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:32.850
um,
general artificial intelligence chat Bot.
It's not a hard coded Chat Bot.

201
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:37.330
It's a very happy medium between those two.
So that's one example.
That's,

202
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.180
that's the machine learning tool that we can use.

203
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.800
There are so many of these tools out there.
Ibm's Watson,
uh,

204
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:48.570
Alexa,
you know,
uh,
this api.ai are so many out there that makes,

205
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.780
uh,
making chatbots were conversational interfaces and very,

206
00:11:51.781 --> 00:11:54.580
very easy if you're not building one,
and you should be,

207
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.730
because messaging apps are the new social media since last year,

208
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.760
more users are using messaging apps and they're using social media.

209
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.490
If you're not using,
if you're not building a chat Bot,

210
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.990
if you haven't built a chat bot yet,
you should do that after this video,

211
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:10.570
or at least pause the video,
subscribe to my channel,

212
00:12:10.571 --> 00:12:15.190
and then then build a chat bot.
It's very easy.

213
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.520
You're going to feel fulfilled.
You can put something on your get hub repository.

214
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.450
You'll feel good about yourself.
Definitely do that.
Okay.
If you haven't yet.
Okay.

215
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.950
But anyway,
the other tool is slack.
So slack,

216
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.100
I mean we have a slack channel for this,
for this community.

217
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.000
And slack was originally made for teams,
but we kind of,
I think we're,

218
00:12:35.001 --> 00:12:40.001
we're almost breaking it by the fact that we have 18,000 users in this slack

219
00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:44.170
channel.
It was never meant for this many people,
but slack is great.
I love it.
Uh,

220
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.480
the community loves it.
If you haven't joined the slack,
you should,

221
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.370
you should join at Lincoln at the video description.

222
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:53.200
But that's going to be the medium for us to interact our AI to interact with the

223
00:12:53.201 --> 00:12:57.070
users.
But remember,
if there can be different mediums,
we can use email,

224
00:12:57.071 --> 00:12:59.740
we can use,
um,
you know,
Facebook messenger,

225
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:03.310
but we're going to choose slack for this example.
Google calendar Api.

226
00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:05.310
That's the other tool we're going to use because we're,

227
00:13:05.311 --> 00:13:10.170
we're going to have to have our AI have access to both our calendar and that

228
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.860
that's the third parties calendar,
right?

229
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.090
And so they have to be able to authenticate with Google to do that.
And lastly,

230
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:16.924
it's expressed.

231
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:21.790
So you know the mean stack writes a Mongo express angular node,
right?

232
00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:25.150
That's the javascript stack for building a standards centralized web APP.

233
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.560
We're going to use express to create a backend server.
So here are the steps.

234
00:13:29.561 --> 00:13:33.130
Let me give you the steps here.
When our slack Bot is sent a message,

235
00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:36.640
like schedule a meeting with a person at a time on a specific date,

236
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.310
what it's gonna do is it's going to send that request,

237
00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:42.250
that NLP request to api.ai just like this.

238
00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:45.460
It's going to send it to api.ai via their API.

239
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:50.740
It's going to hit an intent that we defined that that is a predefined intent.

240
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.740
Setting up meetings,
writes the schedule or bottle,

241
00:13:53.741 --> 00:13:57.280
then check to see if it has permissions to add events to both users.

242
00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.700
So we just use the api.ai,
um,
API,

243
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.100
and now we're using the Google calendar Api to check.

244
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.630
It will then check both calendars to see if there are any preexisting conflicts.

245
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.410
If there are,
then the bottle responds saying,
Hey,
you know,
there are conflicts.

246
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.050
Let's reschedule.
Then that sends it up to the intense,
again,

247
00:14:14.051 --> 00:14:15.540
if not boom in books,

248
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:19.900
but it keeps repeating that checking process until it finds suitable times for

249
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:24.160
you.
And it's very easy because it's going to offer different times.
So you don't,

250
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:26.170
you can just click on which ones you want to use.

251
00:14:26.171 --> 00:14:27.400
You don't have to like say you know,

252
00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:31.830
between this side it's very simple and this is all done juke [inaudible] using

253
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.591
Java script.
Okay.

254
00:14:32.591 --> 00:14:37.591
So that was quite a short textual explanation behind it before we get to the

255
00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:41.980
code.
But I really just wanted to get to the code for this one.
So let's,

256
00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:46.600
let's get into the code here.
Okay.

257
00:14:46.601 --> 00:14:48.610
So,
uh,
there's,
there's,

258
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.250
there's quite a lot of code but I think really the key code that we can go over

259
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:56.840
here is inside of this RTM client that Jay has function specifically in the

260
00:14:56.841 --> 00:15:01.100
process message function.
What it's doing is inside of this process,

261
00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:02.430
message function is being,

262
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:06.850
this function right here is being called whenever the Chat Bot is,

263
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:11.040
is activated.
So that is whenever a user sends a message to the Chat Bot like,

264
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.810
hello,
I want to schedule a meeting.
Boom.
This function is called right here.

265
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:18.320
This is the function that is sending that,
that query,

266
00:15:18.321 --> 00:15:23.321
that text query to api.ai that getting that intense and then retrieving the

267
00:15:23.571 --> 00:15:26.960
response.
So inside of this,
uh,

268
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.730
inside of this block right here,

269
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.570
we're sending that message as a query to api.ai.

270
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.440
We're adding the essential headers to make sure that the API call goes through.

271
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.680
And once we do that,
we're going to get a call back.
Okay?
So the call back,

272
00:15:39.681 --> 00:15:43.250
we'll say,
please accept or decline the previous reminder if,

273
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:47.240
if we're trying to schedule a reminder,
if not,
it's a,
so,

274
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.870
and this is all the reminder code.
If not,

275
00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:53.510
if it's a meeting that you're trying to schedule,
not a reminder,

276
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:57.950
it's going to say,
okay,
here is the intent,
which is called meeting.ad,
right?

277
00:15:57.951 --> 00:16:02.900
So we will have an intent specific for adding meetings to our calendar.

278
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:05.990
And we can do this with Api Audit Ai.
Once we get that,

279
00:16:05.991 --> 00:16:09.320
we can store that in this array right here called the invite array.

280
00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:14.090
Now for however many people you want to add to the meeting,

281
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.900
we're going to iterate through all of them.
So for each user,
okay,

282
00:16:17.901 --> 00:16:20.180
so for each user and all of their calendars,

283
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.650
we're going to say let's get that user and then,
and then once we were treated,

284
00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:27.110
that user will create a new meeting.
Okay?

285
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:30.500
So we're creating a new meeting variable right here as a new meeting,

286
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.140
and we're going to define it by the user id,

287
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.010
by the Channel Id in this slack channel,
whatever the subject is,
the date,

288
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:40.460
the time,
the invitees,
these are the details of the meeting,

289
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:46.370
okay?
And so once it has those things,
it's going to check for conflicts,
right?

290
00:16:46.371 --> 00:16:49.430
So inside of this check for conflicts with all of those users,

291
00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:51.620
that can be one user,
it could be 50 users,

292
00:16:51.621 --> 00:16:54.680
but it's going to check for conflicts between all of those users.

293
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.230
And once it does that,
it's going to check for conflicts.

294
00:16:57.231 --> 00:17:00.920
And then if there is a conflict,
that's where the Google Api comes in,
right?

295
00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:02.840
It's going to check all those conflicts.
It'll say,

296
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.300
would you like me to create the following meeting?
Right?

297
00:17:05.301 --> 00:17:08.570
And then so you'll say yes or no,
and depending on what you say,

298
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.520
it's going to give you a different response.

299
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.460
So a lot of this looks like hardcoded code,
right?
It's like,

300
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:18.560
well either you know this is a good start time,
here's a good end time,
or sorry,

301
00:17:18.561 --> 00:17:22.220
there was a scheduling conflict and then you can retry again and again and
again.

302
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.960
But the point is that it's using AI for natural language processing.

303
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:31.480
I want to end this video with giving you some great resources to look at.

304
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.300
So besides api.ai,
if you,

305
00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.610
if you ever want to look at too into some of the,

306
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.160
the the really cutting edge techniques and natural language processing,

307
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.690
definitely checkout,
archive sanity.
So just type in natural language processing.

308
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.750
Just like this.
For me,

309
00:17:47.751 --> 00:17:51.030
I'm very excited about natural language processing.
It's,
it's one of my,

310
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:55.080
one of my favorite sub fields of machine learning because there's so much there,

311
00:17:55.081 --> 00:17:56.760
right?
We speak in language,
we,

312
00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:01.170
we think in language and there's a lot of potential to do great things with

313
00:18:01.171 --> 00:18:04.350
machine learning with NLP.
So once you type in natural language processing,

314
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.580
type in most recent,
and then what it's gonna do,

315
00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.400
it's going to give you the most recent papers that cutting,
cutting,

316
00:18:11.401 --> 00:18:13.890
cutting edge papers right here.
Like this one for example,

317
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.810
released just yesterday,

318
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.830
learning image to image translation using paired and unpaired training,
uh,

319
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.520
samples,
visual globalization,

320
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.970
a superconducting apple optoelectronic neurons.

321
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.780
There's a lot of stuff here.
Um,

322
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.760
and it might require some knowledge of different fields of science,

323
00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:35.750
like you know,
this one,
but this one looks pretty cool.
Pop,

324
00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:40.530
polite dialogue generation without parallel data,
polite dialogue generation.

325
00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:44.040
That's,
that's pretty cool.
So NLP,

326
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:48.900
great subfield of machine learning.
Um,
I think a great course on NLP,

327
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.850
uh,
is taught by Michael Collins.

328
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.390
If you want to see more on NLP.

329
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.400
This is the one right here.
Michael Collins.
Yes,
yes,
yes.

330
00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:07.410
Where are the videos?
Oh,
they're on Coursera if you follow this link,
but um,

331
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.850
oh,
come on.
Yeah,

332
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.280
here.
Right on Youtube.

333
00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:27.200
So in this last week of the class.
So here's the playlist right here.
Uh,

334
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:30.720
but my point is that Michael Collins is a great NLP professor.

335
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.250
He was one of the,

336
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.960
he was one of my inspirations actually at Columbia when I took NLP there.
Um,

337
00:19:36.961 --> 00:19:40.860
I was lucky enough to take it with him and I later met him a few years later

338
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.930
when I just walked,
actually,
like this was a few months ago.

339
00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:45.920
I just walked in to Columbia and I saw him there and you know,

340
00:19:45.921 --> 00:19:48.990
it took a selfie with him.
You know,
I took a selfie with him because to me,

341
00:19:48.991 --> 00:19:53.010
he's like,
he's like,
dude,
you know,
the Ai God.
And,
um,

342
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.730
it was cool.
It was cool.
But uh,
yeah,
that one,
our current sanity,

343
00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:01.320
Michael Collins Nlp course,
and when it comes to recruiting an AI,

344
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.950
there is a lot of potential and I hope that you build something you put on your

345
00:20:04.951 --> 00:20:08.660
get hub,
uh,
whether it's for recruiting or any industry,
um,
it's gonna,

346
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.690
it's gonna help people learn a lot.
So you've got to learn by doing,

347
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.410
get hubby's really,
you know,
Google for code.

348
00:20:16.411 --> 00:20:19.980
So if there's any idea that you have,
if there's anything that you're,
that you,

349
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:24.090
that you think would be a good idea to build,
it's always best to search,

350
00:20:24.091 --> 00:20:28.410
get hub first,
right?
So if I want to build a recruiting tool for,
um,

351
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:33.510
for recruiters using ais,
I would search recruiting AI and then there we go.

352
00:20:33.511 --> 00:20:35.700
We have some different examples.
You know,

353
00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:39.330
one thing I do is I looked her python examples,
right?
So python is generally,

354
00:20:39.331 --> 00:20:42.630
you know,
more Ai.
If it's not python,
it's,
it's,
it's,
you know,

355
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:46.620
it could be anything,
you know,
not necessarily Ai.
And once we do that,
here we go,

356
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:51.820
um,
Rhonda Ai a year ago,
boom.

357
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:56.650
Just like that.
Ideally they have a read me,
I also sort by most stars.

358
00:20:56.651 --> 00:20:59.960
So generally the Bourns with most stars have the most developer activity.

359
00:20:59.961 --> 00:21:03.970
So that are the most updated.
But yeah.
Anyway,

360
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:06.100
I just wanted to give you that as those final examples.

361
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:07.720
Check out the code for this.
It's in the Github.

362
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.070
Read me and thanks so much for watching.

363
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.960
Please subscribe for more programming videos.

364
00:21:10.961 --> 00:21:14.290
And for now I've got to go to Google io.
So thanks for watching.
