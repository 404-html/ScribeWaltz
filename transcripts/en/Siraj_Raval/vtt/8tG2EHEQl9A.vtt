Hey George.
How's it going?
Pretty good.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.990
What is one thing you really like about self driving cars?
But I have one.

3
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.200
Tell us if we'd say that favorite part of the software stack.

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.440
The hardware you work out of your garage.
Describe that experience in one word.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.650
That's fake news.
What was the last project you worked on?

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.480
Crypto kitties.
If you could spend an evening with one famous person,

who would it be?
Oh God,
I don't know man.
Elan,
come on.
Yeah,

8
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:33.780
you on.
What do you do to relax?
Nothing.
Life is work.

9
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:38.430
People you like,
whoa.
I'll tell no last thing you made with your hands.

10
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.800
Ooh,
I don't know.
I put the laces in these shoes.
What's a hard problem?

11
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:46.350
You're working on self driving cars.

12
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.330
What advice would you give yourself 10 years ago?
Nothing,

13
00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:55.350
man.
I'd be afraid of messing it up.
What's a hard problem you're working on?

You asked that one already.
What website do you waste time on Twitter,
man.

15
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.450

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.980
New York.
Yeah,
that's hitting the world.
Where do you go to relax?

19
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.200
No,
I don't believe in relaxation.
This is a scam from the advertising agency.

20
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:24.240
They're trying to sell you vacations and those kinds of things.

21
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.810
Would you visit marks once they have five star hotels?

The first program you ever,

29
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:04.350
It printed out dirty words when I was like three.
I thought it was hilarious.

I mean I guess,

34
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:23.760

Recency bias.

35
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.460
What is one area of Ai that interests you?
A lot.

36
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.630
I wish reinforcement learning worked.

37
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.320
What is a misconception people have about self driving cars?

38
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.730

Self reflective.
What is one thing that really excites you?

45
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.540
The future?
Best advice you've ever received.
Uh,

46
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.670
don't start a company which the bravest thing you've ever done and I don't

47
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:20.230
believe in that.

Ai?
Uh,
I view the whole world that way now.

55
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.390
I view the whole way I view myself as an AI agent.

56
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.010
