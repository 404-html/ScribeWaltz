Hello world,
it's Saroj and welcome to AI humanities.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.500
I've spent the past few weeks reading 10 books that I'd like to share with you.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.240
I call it AI humanities because it relates AI to various aspects of human

4
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:15.300
culture and society.
My list is sequential.

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.690
Each book will answer questions that come up from the previous book.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.260
The average person only reads a few books a year,

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.070
but the average CEO reads four or five books a month.

8
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.660
Leaders are readers.
If someone spends decades accumulating knowledge on a topic,

9
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.100
then puts it all into a book and you can read that book in one or two days.

10
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.040
You can download decades of knowledge instantly.

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.400
The way I read so many books so fast is that I listened to these books as audio

12
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:48.621
books at three x speed and I scheduled my reading time usually one hour a day.

13
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.770
If you don't schedule your reading time,
you'll be much more likely to skip it.

14
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.430
So let's start with the first the master algorithm.

15
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.650
This was a pretty high level overview of the entire field of machine learning

16
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.090
aimed at the layman,

17
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.710
but I wouldn't say this book is meant for someone who's never even heard of

18
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:08.670
machine learning.

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.810
The first couple chapters are probably accessible to the layman,

20
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.280
but it's in the later chapters that the author starts detailing various

21
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:21.780
algorithms in a way that presumes at least a little bit of background knowledge.

22
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.640
If you want an absolute beginner book to get into machine learning like a

23
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:28.410
prerequisite to this list,

24
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.790
I'd recommend hands on machine learning with psychic can't learn and tensorflow.

25
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.080
Anyway,

26
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.850
what I liked most about this book was the conceptual model that was created of

27
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:39.684
the field.

28
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.280
The author categorized different areas of thought in machine learning into their

29
00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:47.910
own respective tribes.
There are the symbolists that connectionists,

30
00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:49.140
the evolutionaries,

31
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:53.850
the Bayesians and the analyzers each have their own perspective on what the

32
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:57.390
best,
most generalized smartest algorithm is.

33
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.640
He then goes on to actually algorithmically describe backpropagation and genetic

34
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:07.080
programming master algorithms for each of these tribes,
which was pretty cool.

35
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.980
Ultimately he argues that the eventual master algorithm able to learn how to do

36
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:15.540
any task is likely a combination of all of these and we are slowly getting
there.

37
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.070
Discovery by discovery.

38
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.510
I like how he makes connections between these separate methodologies saying that

39
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.440
no matter what technique we use,
all of them are meant to do the same.

40
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:29.820
Three things represent,
evaluate and optimize.
Reading.

41
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:33.480
The master algorithm got me thinking more about the future of Ai.

42
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.950
If we did create the master algorithm,
how would we use it as a species?

43
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.750
What would the future look like?

44
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.900
And that led me to the book life 3.0 by MIT professor and physicist Max Tegmark.

45
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.930
Tegmark goes on to describe life 1.0 as biological evolution life 2.0 as

46
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:54.840
cultural evolution and life 3.0 as tech evolution.

47
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.980
My favorite part of the book was the fictional story of the super intelligent AI

48
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.820
called prometheus's and how it was used by a company to basically conquer the

49
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:06.010
world.
It was actually plausible.

50
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:10.600
He mentioned it's using tools like AWS and gaming the stock market to

51
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:15.601
demonstrate a concrete example of how things could go wrong overall.

52
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:19.720
That's what stood out for me from the book how things could go wrong,

53
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.960
and that question led me to read super intelligence by Professor Nick Bostrom.

54
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.580
This is the book on Ai Safety,

55
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:30.880
how things could go wrong and how we can possibly stop it.

56
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.800
The example that sticks out above all else is his paperclip maximized your idea

57
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.310
that if we tell an AI to make as many paperclips as possible,

58
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.780
that could potentially go wrong in that the AI would then turn all matter

59
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:47.920
including humans into paperclips in order to complete its objective.

60
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.821
Scary stuff.

61
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:53.680
But I do think Bostrom could have been more specific in his ideas about which

62
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:57.850
algorithms in particular he fears the most and how that could happen in a

63
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:02.080
detailed way.
What entity would do this?
What would be the context?

64
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.910
Things like that.
In general,

65
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:08.620
the fear mongering around AI is really distracting to what the actual problem

66
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:11.470
is.
I'm not afraid of superintelligent AI.

67
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.340
I'm afraid of humans using AI to exploit other humans.

68
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.840
Technology is like fire.
It can be used to either burn us or to give us warmth.

69
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.280
So above all else,

70
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.360
apocalyptic AI is actually a problem of human morality.

71
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.340
Whoever creates a real AGI will decide how to use it based on their morality and

72
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:33.340
how do we even regulate morality on a global scale.

73
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.150
We can't even decide on what good and evil is as a species.

74
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.230
Thinking about morality had me reread a book from my favorite classical

75
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:44.590
philosopher,
Nicha called the beyond good and evil.

76
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.410
I remember during my first year at Columbia,

77
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.360
we had a list of philosophers that we had to read about from content to Plato,

78
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.210
but none of their philosophies really resonated with me.
Then I read Nicha.

79
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.750
He basically tore down every other philosophers conception of morality.

80
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.100
His base conviction is that the universe is in a constant state of change,

81
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:10.840
so absolutes like good or evil or even God are too rigid.
In fact,

82
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:13.960
they are forms of enslavement in his eyes.
In particular,

83
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:18.961
he digs into how the institution of the Church has enslaved man and hampered his

84
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:23.320
will to power this drive for freedom and domination over other things.

85
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.070
He criticizes how the Church has failed to truly represent Jesus,

86
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.480
how it demonizes flourishing in life and glorifies living an apathetic life.

87
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.460
Nietzsche is like the angsty teen of philosophers.
Now,
I myself am not religious,

88
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:41.080
but it did get me thinking about how religion does offer order in the midst of

89
00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:46.081
the complexity and chaos of our reality by providing a set of rules to abide by

90
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.570
and in a world where as an ea would put it,
God is dead,

91
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.800
where the scientific rationality that sprung up during the age of enlightenment

92
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.170
triumphed over sacred revelations.

93
00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.530
We need some sort of set of principles or rule book to live by,

94
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.790
especially in this information age where there's just so much data that's being

95
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:06.620
thrown at us from every angle.

96
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.890
So I went ahead and write a book that's currently very popular called 12 rules

97
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:15.500
for life by Dr. Jordan Peterson,
a clinical psychologist.

98
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:20.540
The book delves into a set of basic life principles that we can use to become

99
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:22.730
more disciplined,
behave better,

100
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.880
act with integrity and balance our lives while enjoying them as much as we can.

101
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.880
Each rule is simple like aim to do what is meaningful,
not convenient.

102
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.860
He combines ideas from Uwm,

103
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.890
Nietzsche or well and Freud to help make suggestions on the basis of psychology.

104
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.470
Now,

105
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.420
I don't agree with everything he says in the book and I don't endorse any one

106
00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:48.710
particular political ideology because education applies to everyone.

107
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.300
I like how Peterson illuminates the spectrum in which all opinions and beliefs

108
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:58.100
lie.
He acknowledges that the world is not binary.
It has incredible complexity.

109
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.510
There are many layers to society and human nature and he mentioned that in this

110
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:06.500
information era,
we become increasingly polarized in our beliefs.

111
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.480
He's right about that society has become very polarized the past few years.

112
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.040
My theory being that it's largely due to the rise of social media to help

113
00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:20.660
examine that theory.
I then read 10 reasons to delete your social media.
I,

114
00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:22.820
one of my favorite authors,
Jerome Linear.

115
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.850
I've actually read several of his works before,

116
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:30.500
which inspired me to write my own book years ago.
Linear has technical authority.

117
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.480
He's one of the founders of the Internet who evangelize the power of technology

118
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.340
early on,
but is now one of the most critical figures when it comes to it.

119
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.330
Look,

120
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.980
I use social media and without it I wouldn't be able to give you this message so

121
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.050
there is a benefit to it,

122
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:52.610
but the larger idea that he argues is that social media has allowed for

123
00:07:52.611 --> 00:07:57.611
industrial scale manipulation and behavioral modification in a way that's never

124
00:07:57.741 --> 00:08:02.741
before been possible and Ai Algorithms both in a direct and indirect way or

125
00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:04.760
polarizing society.

126
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.240
The best AI engineers in the world are working on ads,

127
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:10.580
figuring out how to maximize your attention.

128
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:15.020
Ai Is of course also being used to benefit humanity in a lot of ways,

129
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.430
but this book in particular made me want to really narrow my focus on what

130
00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:23.900
exactly I personally found to be the most exciting part about Ai.

131
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.820
Deep minds,
Alpha fold victory.

132
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:29.720
Applying AI to biology was definitely a promising direction.

133
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.310
Biology in general.

134
00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:34.190
It's something I felt like I needed to refresh my knowledge on.

135
00:08:34.191 --> 00:08:39.020
So I read the gene,
an intimate history by doctor Mukherjee,
an oncologist.

136
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:43.880
The book takes the reader through the history of the gene and genetic research

137
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:48.910
all the way from Aristotle to crick and describes the decades of progress in

138
00:08:49.491 --> 00:08:52.790
this area,
like a riveting adventure.
It was like an action movie,

139
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.640
an insight from one scientist on evolution that into other insights from other

140
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:58.530
scientists on how genes could work together.

141
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.620
I learned that a lot of things that I was so excited about regarding the

142
00:09:01.621 --> 00:09:06.180
possibility of human enhancement using genetic technology had already been

143
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:09.660
talked about and debated for decades.
The atom,

144
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.010
the gene and the bite he argued are the three fundamental building blocks of

145
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:18.510
science and technology and the intersection of each would define progress in the

146
00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:21.900
21st century like Alpha fold recently did.

147
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.420
One area of the book that I found particularly interesting was that there's

148
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.850
still so much about genetics that we don't understand.

149
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:34.620
The gene actually doesn't give us the whole story behind our actions and our

150
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:38.670
traits.
In fact,
an entire field called epigenetics,

151
00:09:38.671 --> 00:09:43.110
which literally means on top of genetics refers to the information layered on

152
00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:45.900
top of the sequence of letters in DNA.

153
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.610
It describes inheritance by mechanisms other than through the DNA sequence of

154
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:53.490
genes and that field is still evolving.

155
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:58.550
So I started looking up books on epigenetics and I came upon a book called the

156
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:04.260
physics of God.
Again,
I don't ascribe to any one religion,
I'm agnostic,

157
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.790
but this book was definitely eyeopening.
It aims to unify quantum mechanics,

158
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.080
consciousness,
neuroscience,
and genetics into one cohesive theory.

159
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:18.420
The author argues that scientific materialism has only been able to explain so

160
00:10:18.421 --> 00:10:23.421
much and that there exists a holographic energy body that governs the billions

161
00:10:23.731 --> 00:10:28.680
of coordinated biochemical events happening at the genetic level at every second

162
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.420
be a quantum entanglement.

163
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.650
The author points to various eastern mystical concepts about the soul from

164
00:10:34.651 --> 00:10:38.190
various religions as alluding to this idea in a primitive way,

165
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.730
the very notion of a holographic energy body is nonmaterial.

166
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.450
It would live on a different plane and couldn't be empirically tested,

167
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.800
but it would help fill the gaps that genetics and epigenetics have yet to

168
00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:53.820
explain the idea that all living things are connected to each other,

169
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:56.880
that we are more than the material machinery of our bodies.

170
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.380
It's a comforting idea for sure.
I'm not sure if it's true or not,

171
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.980
but it did get me to question the nature of reality.
More fundamentally.

172
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:10.020
Eastern and western philosophy have been separated by physical distance for

173
00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:14.580
hundreds of years,
but with the Internet and better mediums of communication,

174
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.440
we can bring the best ideas from these disciplines together to help solve the

175
00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:24.441
mysteries of the universe and in thinking about the potential for eastern

176
00:11:24.511 --> 00:11:29.020
philosophy,
I picked up a copy of AI superpowers by Doctor [inaudible],

177
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.330
former head of Google,
China.
I really liked this book and youth,

178
00:11:33.331 --> 00:11:37.110
a lot of the insights from it to make my video on AI in China.

179
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.820
It opened my eyes to how China is shaping AI and how the future might not

180
00:11:41.821 --> 00:11:45.900
necessarily look western,
but instead be shaped by China.

181
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:51.290
The amount of AI innovation happening there is incredible and his description of

182
00:11:51.421 --> 00:11:55.060
how different the market in China was fascinating.

183
00:11:55.330 --> 00:12:00.330
I really liked how he avoided vague AI apocalyptic predictions and instead focus

184
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:05.290
on mass scale unemployment due to AI as the real problem that could occur.

185
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:10.090
Kai Fu believes that not all human capabilities can be replicated with AI,

186
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.710
that we still have something about us that's not purely mechanical and his

187
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:19.711
narrative becomes pretty emotional in some parts as he describes how he survived

188
00:12:19.961 --> 00:12:24.010
cancer,
which made him appreciate his humanity that much more.

189
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:29.280
This book got me pretty hype about how much China is embracing Ai Technology and

190
00:12:29.801 --> 00:12:34.240
I've never even been to China yet.
So to learn more about Chinese culture,

191
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.300
I rent the last book on my list,
the three body problem.

192
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.590
This is a wildly popular Chinese side by novel that was a few years ago,

193
00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:46.150
transcribed to English for the first time and I absolutely love this book.

194
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.730
It got pretty technical in some parts.

195
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.810
She Chines explanations of physics and computing.
We're on point,

196
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.150
and I especially liked how he brought characters like fond NOI,

197
00:12:56.151 --> 00:13:01.151
men and Einstein and Aristotle back to life in the simulated game environment to

198
00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:03.700
help explain it.
Different concepts.

199
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:09.150
This book was full of big grand ideas and it allowed me to peek into Chinese

200
00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:14.080
culture and that there were a lot of colloquial references to food and tradition

201
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.041
overall.

202
00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:20.041
It helped me appreciate humanity's progress in science much more so that's it

203
00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:22.450
for my list.
I hope you found it useful.

204
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:26.560
Joined the school of Ai Book Club Channel In our slack group to discuss your

205
00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:28.510
ongoing thoughts with peers.

206
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:32.620
I'll give a Twitter shout out to the first wizard that finishes of my list.

207
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.410
Let me know when you do,
what's your favorite book?

208
00:13:35.411 --> 00:13:38.740
Let me know in the comment section and please subscribe for more technology

209
00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:43.180
