1
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.160
Hey brian,
what's up?
How's it gotten?
Pretty good.
How are you?
Great to see.

2
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.100
Do you mind if I ask you 67 questions?
Yeah,
let's do it.
Cool.

3
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.330
Yeah.
How'd you get into work today?
Believe it or not,

4
00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:23.180
I took a Lyft favorite part of the software stack.
Hmm.

5
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.150
Uh,

6
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.650
I really enjoy building front end data visualizations.

7
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.990
Favorite thing about working at Lyft?

8
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.120
I love our secret hidey holes all across the office.

9
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.210
What was the last project you worked on at Lyft?
Uh,

10
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.490
I've been managing our data warehouse migration over to hive.

11
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.940
Uh,
my favorite professor that I never actually had this professor would be Peter

12
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.773
Singer.

13
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.790
If you could spend an evening with one famous person,
who would it be?

14
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.720
Someone that I've always wanted to have dinner with would be,
uh,

15
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.950
Nick Bostrom and I'd love to chat about Ai.
Do you play any sports?

16
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.570
I haven't played any sports since I used to play field hockey back in Australia.

17
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.190
Do you miss being a student at the University of Melbourne?
Uh,
you know,

18
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.880
I thought it was fine,
but I really prefer working in industry.

19
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.600
What music genre are you currently into?
Uh,
I listened to a lot of chill.

20
00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:30.030
Slash.
Ambient.
Is there a programming language that you really like?

21
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.690
Really like,
um,
you know,

22
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.700
I work mostly in sequel and Python,
but,
uh,

23
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.450
I'd say python is pretty flexible.
What about a language you really don't like?

24
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.530
You gotta be Matlab.
He's waiting after that at uni.

25
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.360
How are you liking San Francisco?

26
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.290
San Francisco is the best city that I've ever lived in.

27
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.580
What's something you've built with machine learning?
Um,

28
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.400
I've,
uh,
what's something I've built with machine letting,
well,

29
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:06.480
I can't tell you the confidential projects,
but uh,
but I've built a,
uh,

30
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.550
an operations model.
What's the most beautiful thing in the world?

31
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.020
The most beautiful thing in the world would have to be,
um,

32
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.140
would have to be watching the sunrise with a friend.
Do you miss your home town?

33
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.980
Uh,
yeah.
I really miss my family,
but my friends all moved out to SF,

34
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:29.580
so I'm pretty lucky.
That programming language of choice for machine learning.

35
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.600
Definitely.
Python.
What website do you waste?
Time on?

36
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.130
Big Time waste is how can use last person you emailed?
Uh,

37
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.630
I am out of candidate who is looking for data engineering jobs.

38
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.040
You get an all expenses paid trip to one city.
Where do you go?

39
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.340
I wish that they would just pay for me to stay in San Francisco.
Honestly,

40
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.490
this is a pretty good spot.
Would you visit Mars?
Uh,

41
00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.230
that depends on the price and how much of the earth technology is available on

42
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:03.890
Mars?
What is one thing that excites you?
Uh,

43
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.280
what is one thing that excites me?

44
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.430
So I'm really interested in how you can use data to improve policy decisions in

45
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:16.810
the world.
What is one thing you're afraid of?
Gosh,

46
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.670
irrelevance.
Best advice you've ever received.

47
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.190
Uh,
choose the people you surround yourself by very intentionally.

48
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.630
What the big misconception about you?
Uh,

49
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.690
I think that it's very easy for people to look like they've got it all worked

50
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:39.370
out when really they've got no idea what's going on.

51
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.470
What's the bravest thing you've ever done?

52
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.670
Probably moving out to San Francisco without a job and trying to,

53
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.440
trying to get established here.
It's tough.

54
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.350
What is one piece of advice you'd give yourself 10 years ago?

55
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.030
I think just keep doing what you're doing.
If you were a Pokemon,

56
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.150
who would it be?
A,

57
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.790
I would be mew because then you could learn all of the moves.

58
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.950
Do you have any pets?
Not.
What's something you've learned in the past month?
Oh,

59
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:12.250
I really enjoyed the neurolink article on brain computer interfaces.

60
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.980
What's a topic and machine learning you'd like to explore more?
Uh,

61
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.360
let's say a topic and machine learning.

62
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.740
I would really love to learn more about self driving car autonomy.

63
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.470
Do you think will solve intelligence in your lifetime?

64
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.850
I hope I live long enough to see that happen.
If you ran the world,

65
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.910
what is one thing that you would enact?
One law.

66
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.350
One law that I would enact would be listened to.
Your economists.

67
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.750
That was one person you looked up to when you were in college.
I'm in college.

68
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.950
Uh,
I guess it was Bill Gates seems to be doing some pretty impactful stuff.

69
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.540
What were you like as a kid in grade school?
Probably pretty weird and annoying.

70
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.470
What deep learning library besides tensorflow,

71
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.600
do you what besides the nights it's tends to play.
It's the only one.

72
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.700
What's something that excites you about the future?
Um,
Gosh,
uh,

73
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.630
just we live in like the most exciting time.

74
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.440
So everything about the future is,
is an open book.

75
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.600
What is one major unsolved research problem you'd love to see tackled?
Um,

76
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.260
so there was some really interesting research in the,
uh,

77
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.450
how to get alignment correct with Ai.
I would love to see more research there.

78
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.930
What's more interesting?
Generative models or discriminative models?

79
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.200
I think there's a lot of business problems right now that you can solve with

80
00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:35.710
discriminative models.
If you could be a superhero,
who would it be?

81
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.360
A superhero is Ozymandias a bad answer?

82
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.280
What's your spirit animal?

83
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.350
Spirit animal would have to be a bash favorite computer scientist.

84
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.820
Um,
I dunno if this counts as a computer scientist,

85
00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:54.520
but Richard Fineman was pretty cool.
If you had a time machine,

86
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.140
when would you visit?
Well,
uh,

87
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.300
I would love to fast forward in time and try to get to the other side of the

88
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:04.760
great filter.
Do you still use Uber

89
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.290
the last time?
I used to,
but it was when I was traveling internationally.

90
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.480
Android or iPhone.
Android.
What would surprise people about life?
That list?

91
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.070
I think you're just,
you've given a lot of responsibility.

92
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.000
Favorite Linux distro.
They boot two is pretty user friendly.

93
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.860
Have you ever been in love?
Yeah,
luckily enough.
What's the point of life?

94
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.760
Oh my God.
Um,
to,
uh,

95
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.220
to like to make the world a better place and to be happy.

96
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.390
Have you ever built an app with machine learning that you use in your day to day

97
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:41.090
life?
You know,
I haven't,

98
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.440
but I would really love to build a app that helps you manage your friendships

99
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:47.600
and let you know who you should be messaging when.

100
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.250
If you were to start from scratch today,

101
00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:52.400
what is a learning resource you would use to learn machine learning?
Uh,

102
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.880
I would use the open science data masters,

103
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.650
open data science masters.
What is something you do to relax?

104
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.240
I drink tea with my housemates.
Awesome.

105
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:07.520
Well thanks for waiting for answering those questions and their worries.

106
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.320
All right.
Have a good one.
Have a good one.
