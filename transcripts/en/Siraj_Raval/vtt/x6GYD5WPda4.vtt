00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.170
You're about to see how deep this rabbit hole go.
Hello world.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.200
It's survived and freelancing keeps getting more and more popular as a career

3
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:11.094
option.

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.280
I'm going to explain how you can do freelance AI programming in this video.

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.640
I've done freelancing myself on and off for years when I was in college and in

6
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:24.960
between jobs.

7
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.020
It was an awesome way to make money as someone who came from a lower middle

8
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:32.040
class background,

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.400
making 80 to a hundred dollars an hour doing programming contracts was a big

10
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:43.131
deal for me and gave me the runway necessary to work on my own personal projects

11
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.310
as well as spend time traveling and learning.

12
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.500
I now earn revenue from a multitude of sources.
Youtube ads,

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.420
Patrion book sales,

14
00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:59.421
my paid courses at the school of Ai and now that I built a recognizable brand in

15
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:03.960
the AI community,
companies like intel,
Google,

16
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:08.910
and Amazon consistently approached me to do sponsored videos.

17
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.440
Still no Microsoft though.
Being a freelancer is awesome.

18
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.050
You can live anywhere you want to.

19
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.170
I just spent an entire year living in Amsterdam before moving back to the

20
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:22.830
states.
Recently.

21
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.250
We work makes it easy to have an office in pretty much any major city across the

22
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:32.220
world and you won't have a traditional boss,

23
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.620
but it's not all roses.

24
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.740
It takes time to build a sustainable income.

25
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.170
There's a lot of competition out there.

26
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.380
You need to be very disciplined and it can be a somewhat lonely journey at least

27
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:50.250
at first because you're usually working by yourself.

28
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.020
With all that said,

29
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.050
the freelance workforce is accelerating and it's growth and almost half of all

30
00:01:57.421 --> 00:01:59.700
millennials are now freelancing.

31
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:03.000
So now is the time to try it out.

32
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.260
If you never have before your first step in this journey,

33
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:09.270
it should be to make a game plan.

34
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.430
How much time per week do you have available to do freelance work?

35
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.760
Made sure to factor in lesser known tasks like time required for finding work,

36
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.210
learning about tools,
meetings,
and setting up your workflow.

37
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.330
Are you going to do this part time or full time?

38
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.050
What kind of projects interest you later on?

39
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.050
You can change your plan once you get started,

40
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:37.650
but this practice will help you frame your journey.

41
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.240
There's a lot to plan,
so don't take this step lightly.

42
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.900
Made sure to factor achievable weekly,
monthly,

43
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.690
and yearly goals into your schedule.

44
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.960
This will give your journey momentum as you achieve them according to a recent

45
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:56.190
study by upwork.

46
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.430
Ai Programming is one of the most in demand skills for freelancers.

47
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.130
So if you find AI interesting,
you are very lucky.
Also I love you.

48
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.780
Make a list of some of the subtopics in AI that excite you the most.

49
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.050
Then make a list of some of the most in demand AI skills out there like chat bot

50
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:17.974
development,

51
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.100
computer vision and tensorflow and see what the intersection between the two

52
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:25.330
lists are.

53
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.600
Once you've found that you know that type of skills you need to learn.

54
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.210
Learning by doing is the best way to learn anything and even though paid work is

55
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:38.674
the goal,

56
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.800
you can jumpstart your portfolio by contributing to open source projects on get

57
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:45.190
hub.

58
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.190
This is a great way to both improve your skillset and expand your network.

59
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.520
Muybridge publishes a monthly top 10 open source projects list on get hub that

60
00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:02.020
highlights some cool machine learning projects you can contribute to.

61
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.380
And as you get to know other developers of the project via slack or get her

62
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:13.210
channels,
you'll learn more and expand your network of opportunity.

63
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.600
Also be sure to take advantage of all the incredible free machine learning

64
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:21.850
content that's available on the Internet.

65
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.130
I have some great curriculums and playlists to help guide you on your journey.

66
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.650
Links to those will be in the video description.

67
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.500
When you feel your skills are up to par,

68
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.640
that's when it's time to start the dance of finding clients.

69
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.200
One often overlooked group are your existing contacts.

70
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.210
Lots of successful freelancers get their initial work through friends,

71
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.390
family and acquaintances post on your social media channels that you are

72
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:57.481
available for freelance work and join some social groups on Facebook that act as

73
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:00.970
freelancer marketplaces.

74
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.360
You should create a list of platforms that you can browse to look for work.

75
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.820
There are the more popular ones like upwork and freelancer.com both of which I

76
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:17.560
have personally used to both fine and give work,

77
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.230
but there are also other lesser known ones like top,
top,
top tool,

78
00:05:22.231 --> 00:05:25.420
pre screening applicants and is very selective.

79
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:27.430
But if you're accepted,

80
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.180
expect access to some world class job openings.

81
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.110
Another one is angel list.
Just use the filters,

82
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.150
data scientist and contract and you'll instantly find startups offering contract

83
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:44.290
work.
Founder dating is another.

84
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.370
It will connect you with entrepreneurs who need advisees.

85
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.710
Filter your search by those.

86
00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:53.860
Looking for a background in data analytics.

87
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.100
guru.com is quickly gaining popularity as a job listing platform and we work

88
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:00.861
remotely.

89
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:05.420
Dot Com has a pretty slick interface which makes it fun to use.

90
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.780
Try to find the lesser known smaller job listing platforms on Google as those

91
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:13.550
have less competition,

92
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.790
which makes it easier for newcomers who don't have as established a reputation.

93
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.320
In addition to job listings,

94
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.380
real life events can act as networking opportunities to find potential clients.

95
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.820
Sites like Katie Nugget's,

96
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.880
O'Reilly Strada meetup and data science central offer networking events all

97
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:39.071
around the world for data science and you can be sure that people are looking

98
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:42.410
for talent will be attending these events.

99
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.780
You can connect with them in person there.

100
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.020
In my experience in person meetings definitely help build trust faster,

101
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.670
which is crucial and you'll definitely want to bring some business cards with

102
00:06:55.671 --> 00:06:58.730
you linked to a great service for that in the video description.

103
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.310
Once you have some potential clients,

104
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.910
you need to decide how much you're going to charge.

105
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.330
Maybe something reasonable like 1 million bucks or maybe it's Maybelline.

106
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.000
All right.
Jokes aside.
For each project,

107
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.990
you'll either charge an hourly rate or a fixed fee.

108
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.310
If you're a client wants to use a fixed rate for their project,

109
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.540
make sure to fully understand the scope of the project,

110
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.630
otherwise you'll risk being massively underpaid should the project run long or

111
00:07:32.361 --> 00:07:36.650
requirements change.
It's best to start off with an hourly rate.

112
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.730
There are a lot of factors that go into deciding this rate,

113
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.060
like your location,
your level of experience,

114
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.980
and your skill set that can affect what you charge as an hourly rate.

115
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.350
So to help with this complexity,

116
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:56.590
you can use the online rate explorer@codementor.io to decide what you should

117
00:07:57.981 --> 00:08:02.630
charge per hour.
And when you decided on an hourly rate,

118
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.740
don't ever go lower,
only raise it over time.

119
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.110
It may be hard at first to find a client,

120
00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:14.111
but all it takes is one to validate your rate and the next ones will be easier

121
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:19.130
to get.
Earning freelance money is a liberating experience,

122
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:22.940
but you need to be sure that you stay organized financially.

123
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:28.330
With the freedom of freelancing comes the responsibility of managing finances,

124
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:32.810
your own finances,
and that means paying taxes yourself.

125
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:37.070
It's best for tax purposes to create a business bank account.

126
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.150
Instead of having it all go through your personal bank account,

127
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:46.480
it makes it easier to track your spending and earning and let you be more

128
00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:49.580
thorough about budgeting.
Trust me on this one.

129
00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:51.410
If you're serious about freelancing,

130
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:55.130
it is worth the effort to create a business bank account.

131
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.020
You will thank yourself when it's tax season.

132
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:03.150
A great tool to help with managing financial work is Hello Bonzai.

133
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.010
You can manage your proposals,
invoicing,
payments,
time tracking,

134
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:10.470
and more all from this one platform.

135
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.590
It's just a different way of living.

136
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.860
Similar to rising up the ranks at a company.

137
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.920
The longer you successfully do freelancing,

138
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.670
the more credibility you gain for your personal brand.

139
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.510
That means the more projects you successfully complete,

140
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:32.810
the better your reviews will be on freelance websites and the more work you can

141
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:34.860
showcase to future clients.

142
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.600
The best way to boost your marketability is to keep on building,

143
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:44.530
have projects on your get hub,
make sure your linkedin profile is up to date,

144
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.660
and have a personal website that links everything together.

145
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.840
It is absolutely crucial to have your own personal websites to showcase your

146
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:58.200
portfolio.
Use a simple code free tool like Weebly.

147
00:09:58.201 --> 00:10:02.220
If you need to just make it happen and keep it technical.

148
00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:04.740
Don't put on our band or on it or something.

149
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.810
Doing these things will make you prepared to begin the job hunt,

150
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.260
but ideally your clients come to you,
right?

151
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:18.660
One great way to do that is to showcase your technical expertise by developing

152
00:10:18.661 --> 00:10:19.830
technical content.

153
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:25.260
That means a blog or a podcast or a youtube channel,
whatever.

154
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.980
Consistently make tutorials,
opinion pieces,

155
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.220
analyses of different topics in machine learning,

156
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.510
and you will slowly build a following.
The bigger your following,

157
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.790
the more people that will recommend you.

158
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.630
And all of this will add to your credibility.
As a brand.

159
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:47.930
I get more than enough requests to do consulting work because of the amount of

160
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:51.990
technical content I've pushed.
And so can you,

161
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.910
once you get started with the pirates life,
the navy is just way too boring.

162
00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:01.830
Car Ipc jobs at this point and no matter how good the offer is,

163
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.890
I would never give up the freedom and flexibility of my lifestyle to work at a

164
00:11:07.411 --> 00:11:08.310
corporation.

165
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:13.730
But remember you will need to master the art of self discipline to do this well.

166
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.420
You set your own hours,
you are your own boss.

167
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.320
So you also need to make sure to do things for yourself.

168
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:27.380
Like give yourself a vacation when you need it and wake up at a good time that

169
00:11:27.871 --> 00:11:31.140
you decide it's hard at first.
But if you're consistent,

170
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:35.550
it becomes second nature.
Three things to remember from this video.

171
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.210
Freelancing is a perfectly viable career choice.

172
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.530
It gives you the freedom and flexibility to live the life you want,

173
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.520
but you'll need to master the art of self discipline.

174
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:52.680
You can use web tools to optimize your workflow from upwork,
Pew,

175
00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:55.630
hello,
and to be successful,

176
00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.640
you'll need to build your online presence by building projects for yourself and

177
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:02.470
for clients.
Plus,

178
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.290
building an audience through technical content definitely helps.
I've got a lot

179
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.450
<v 1>Fredrickson here where it says crime in general.
For now,</v>

180
00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.670
I've got to put the pirates.
