00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.290
Hello world it Saroj and I'm going to talk about a topic I very rarely talk

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:06.210
about.
It's called East sports.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.220
So e-sports refers to any kind of online gaming related to tournaments and

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.090
players earning rewards.
It could also be related to fantasy football,

5
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:17.670
fantasy basketball or even real life sports.

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.020
But the idea is that you consider a game where with other players as a kind of

7
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:24.240
sport and there was some reward involved.

8
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.140
And specifically I'm talking about this because there is this great intersection

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.750
between cryptocurrency and East sports.

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.470
So I'm going to talk about four different tokens in this space that are

11
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:37.290
intersecting these two spaces very well.

12
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.820
And in along the way I'm going to explain how proof of stake works.

13
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.290
So it's really hard to find any kind of readable proof of state code,

14
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.980
but this is a great way to do it because one of these coins actually uses proof

15
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:53.340
of stake.
And I'm going to use that as a segway to talk about proof of stake.

16
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.911
Also,

17
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:57.270
I'm going to talk about how token sales work because two of these coins do that

18
00:00:57.271 --> 00:00:58.590
really well and very easily.

19
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.090
So if you want to make your own coin related to East sports or gaming or any of

20
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:06.690
the above,
then you're,
it's,
it's easier for you to do so.

21
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.910
So this market is growing very,
very fast.
If we look at the data,

22
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.660
the revenue from east sports by the way,
is that it's really a,
a newer thing.

23
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.250
East sports and the revenue from east sports is growing at a staggering rate

24
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.890
every single year.
If we,
if we look at this graph right here,

25
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.630
right in the past five years even,
it's gone from 0.5 to 1.5 on this,

26
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.770
see agr scale and the audience is growing as well.
So millennials,

27
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.850
my generation and even the generation that's younger,
loves east sports.

28
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.700
So just going to grow over time.
The core audience,

29
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:42.330
the data shows globally is 85% male.
Okay?

30
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:45.380
So it's between 16 and 36 year old males,
uh,

31
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.450
that and they have an average household income of about 75,000 US dollars.

32
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.750
So there was a survey of over a thousand video gamers in the u s and they were

33
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:56.760
asked a bunch of questions about cryptocurrency.

34
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.770
The these were gamers by the way.

35
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.890
So 75% of them said they wished they could exchange their virtual goods for

36
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.530
currencies that they could buy and sell on other platforms.

37
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.860
So generally when gamers are earning tokens inside of a game,

38
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.390
they can only spend it within the game.

39
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.580
But what if they could spend it outside of the game?

40
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.690
And that is really the key for where cryptocurrency can play into video game

41
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.010
based assets.

42
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.480
Two thirds of them want more opportunities to use cryptocurrency within their

43
00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:25.410
video game network.

44
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.360
And 55% of millennials have millennial video gamers own cryptocurrency.

45
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.770
So that's cool.
That's a lot.

46
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.030
That's more than half of millennial video game players own cryptocurrency.

47
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.600
So there's a huge market for this.
And why do they want this?
Well,

48
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:41.520
it turns out that it's easier to use.

49
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.150
There's low exchange rates and there's heightened security,
right?

50
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:50.130
Because there's a blockchain involved.
So there's some more stats,

51
00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:50.821
et Cetera,
et cetera.

52
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:55.821
But the point is that this is a new class of digital assets and it's all powered

53
00:02:56.101 --> 00:02:57.120
by cryptocurrency.

54
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.180
So there was a East sports tournament recently that was held online and the,

55
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.710
and the prize pool was worth a hundred thousand US dollars.
This was a big deal.

56
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.430
So you can consider the gamers who trade in game virtual items,

57
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.230
also called skins in this case,

58
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.440
to have a similar experience to cryptocurrency traders.

59
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.390
They both deal in digital property,

60
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.950
they both face risks involved with trading online and they both have concerns

61
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:23.230
about the security of their online wallets.

62
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.100
Here's a picture of a popular tournament in Korea.

63
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.280
So the first point I want to talk about is XP coin.

64
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:34.030
So we can go to its website here,
x p coin,
that Io.

65
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.790
So they say it's to incentivize rewards through using this digital currency.

66
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.660
So I did,

67
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.990
I did a bit of research on XP coin and they've partnered with a bunch of people.

68
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:47.530
They partnered with global e-sports,
cooler master,
red bull and video twitch,

69
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:48.460
Zodiac Razor.

70
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.760
So there's a lot of companies that have partnered with this coin and that seems

71
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:55.090
to be key in this space to partner with these leading brands that can then

72
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:58.330
promote your,
your token to the gamers worldwide.

73
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.510
And ideally these companies have gamers that are already embedded in their

74
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:04.960
communities.
They now have the number one Overwatch team in India.

75
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:06.400
So that's top 10 in Asia,

76
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.840
they're developing an e sports arena in Asia with a bunch of high end PC.

77
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:14.110
So once you had this network built,
once you have this community,

78
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.710
then you can use the token to fund these things like a physical place.

79
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.490
You can use it to fund tournaments,
you can use it to fund,
you know,

80
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.310
different things.

81
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.560
And the community can even use these tokens to fund their own thing.

82
00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:28.960
So you can have essentially a decentralized movement that the creator,

83
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.950
the token,
they just kind of set rules into the protocol and,

84
00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:34.930
and let it flourish and then let the community take over from there.

85
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.590
But they're working on an ecommerce store as well where you can purchase all

86
00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:40.390
sorts of end game assets and items.

87
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.170
And this network that they built consists of a bunch of roles.

88
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.500
So this is a very important concept when creating any kind of community.

89
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.100
When you have your token,
you don't just want to have an ICO and just say,

90
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.040
you know,
buy this coin,
et Cetera,
that's it and we're going to use it.

91
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.100
You want to have some kind of rule set for your community.

92
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.300
So it's best to think of this beforehand,
right?
So they've got these,

93
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.830
they have this idea of a super node and a Dev node and a sales note and a Geo

94
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:09.790
node master node.
And all of these nodes have different roles in the community.

95
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.391
For example,

96
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:15.391
the sales node will receive XP coin in return for selling some kind of

97
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.210
experience or sales related product.

98
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.880
The Dev node is going to be related to development.

99
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.810
The supernode is kind of getting money from the other nodes to maintain the

100
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:28.060
network.
Geo nodes are location based.

101
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.790
So as long as you have these roles and they're clear set,

102
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.110
people will take them up.

103
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.980
You've got to have a good plan in place for your token to actually take off.

104
00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:37.960
You can't be in it just for the money.

105
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.100
There's gotta be some value that you're providing or your coin will tank and the

106
00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:45.850
market will decide for you.
So what they did was they forked pure coin.

107
00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:49.930
So pure coin was a fork of bitcoin that implemented proof of stake.

108
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.290
And this was a really good idea because proof of stake is the way to go.

109
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.630
It's theory is using it or they're going to start using it,

110
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.390
and the whole space will start moving towards proof of stake because it's more

111
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:04.391
energy efficient and it's just a better system in general for security purposes,

112
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.050
proof of work is being consolidated by a bunch of big GPU farms,
right?

113
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:14.051
So the idea is that proof of work prevents any kind of 51% attack because you'd

114
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:15.860
have to have a lot of computing power.

115
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.240
But the problem is that two thirds of the network is owned by a few entities.

116
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.390
So there is a centralization when it comes to big coins,

117
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.890
a proof of work algorithm.

118
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.150
So the way out of this is by using proof of stake and that's what pure coin
uses.

119
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:33.140
That's what XP coin,
you know,
they,
they forked off of it.
But what I wanted to do,

120
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.250
what I want to do is take,
take this opportunity,

121
00:06:35.251 --> 00:06:39.440
this to segway into proof of stake and how proof of stake works,
right?

122
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.620
Because they're using it and it seems to be a very good protocol is getting more

123
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:46.580
and more popular.
So you might've heard a lot about Ethereum's Casper if you're,

124
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:48.050
if you're into ethereum,

125
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.200
the word Casper is showing up a lot in forums and you know,

126
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:54.440
slack channels and all this stuff.
But basically what Casper is,

127
00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:56.600
is it's a version of proof of stake.

128
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.550
It's the latest version and they plan on implementing it very,
very soon.
But,

129
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.100
but it's,
it's a four step process,
Casper and it's,

130
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:08.690
it's the proof of stake process.
So step one is the validators steak,

131
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.160
a portion of their ethers.

132
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.670
So the validators of the network are confirming transactions,
right?

133
00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:14.950
And they're getting paid in the theory.

134
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.290
So what they'll do is they'll stake a portion of their ethers,

135
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.650
like whatever x is.
So we can define that in the protocol.

136
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:24.860
So let's say I've got a hundred ethers,
I'm going to take 10 of them.
Okay.

137
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:27.710
So that's step one.
I've,
I've staked 10 ethers.

138
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.340
Step two is that after that they'll start validating the blocks.
That's,

139
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.830
that's confirming that these transactions are valid.

140
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.130
When they discover a block that they think can be added to the chain,

141
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.170
a proper valid block,
they will validate it by placing a bet on it.
Okay.

142
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:44.840
So they'll say,
okay,
this is very likely a valid block.

143
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.130
I'm going to bet that it is.
So if the block gets appended to the list,

144
00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:50.030
to the blockchain,

145
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.270
then the validators will get a reward proportionate to their bets.

146
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.890
So the more you bet on a block,
the more a validator bets on a block,

147
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.020
the higher the reward is,
right?

148
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:04.580
So if the validator acts in a malicious manner and tries to do nothing at stake,

149
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.930
they'll immediately be reprimanded and all their steak is going to get slashed.

150
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.360
So that's kind of the security mechanism here,
right?
Because evaluator,

151
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.430
in order to say a block is valid or not has to stake some of their coins.

152
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.370
And if they're trying to,
if they're trying to defraud the system,

153
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.900
then they're their stake that they had to um,
put into this.

154
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.540
Essentially an escrow like service will be,

155
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.200
will be wiped out and then they won't get to get that money back.

156
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.990
So in order to vote,
you have to have stake in the network.

157
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.430
And if you try to do something bad,

158
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.240
if you try to say of transaction was valid and it's,
it wasn't,

159
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.980
then that state goes away.

160
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.550
So this is really the best pseudocode that I could find.

161
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:45.860
It's not even pseudocode,
it's just python,
but it's,

162
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:48.170
it's the ethereum Casper script.
Uh,

163
00:08:48.171 --> 00:08:49.910
and what we're going to do is we're going to take a look at it.

164
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.550
It's about 400 lines.
So it's quite a long time.
I know.

165
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.980
But let's just try to understand how this works programmatically.
You are right,

166
00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:59.280
we know the basic idea that we have a set of validators in the network.

167
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.770
They're going to put some amount of ether at stake there.

168
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:05.910
Once you vote on whether or not a block is valid.
And if they are correct,

169
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.560
then they earn some money.
If they're not,
if they've,

170
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.230
if they've tried to beef defraud the system and they're going to lose that
steak.

171
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.610
So that's the basic idea.

172
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.580
So at the start we're going to define all of these variables.

173
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:19.290
There's quite a lot of variables here.

174
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:23.730
So what in the in here we have this concept of a dynasty.

175
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:28.020
So validators are grouped into what are called dynasties and dynasties are

176
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:29.100
groups of validators.

177
00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:32.880
It's just a way of segmenting up the network to improve the speed of

178
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:36.690
transactions and of voting on whether or not a transaction is valid or not.

179
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.570
There's a bunch of his historical check when Hashes.

180
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.720
So checkpoints in this case are just meant to speed up a transaction validation,

181
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.740
right?
Because if we have a checkpoint,

182
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.340
a validator doesn't have to validate every single block that came before,
right?

183
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.680
We can just have this checkpoint and say it's starting from here.

184
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.790
Start validating onward.
So it just speeds up a computation in the network.

185
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.750
If we keep going down,
there's quite a lot of variables,

186
00:10:00.751 --> 00:10:02.760
but I think the best thing for us to do,

187
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.420
it's to look at the main coach is just get an idea of the programmatic

188
00:10:06.421 --> 00:10:10.770
implementation of proof of stake.
So if we go down here,
we're going to see,

189
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:11.813
let's see.

190
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.070
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

191
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.903
<v 0>the,</v>

192
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.400
the voting process,
right?
So this is under deaf vote.

193
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.550
So this is the voting process right here.
So because it's in python,

194
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.860
it's going to be downloaded by every node in the network.

195
00:10:26.861 --> 00:10:28.930
Every validator is going to be running this code.

196
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.220
So under the vote function we can see what does it take for validator to get to

197
00:10:33.221 --> 00:10:37.420
vote.
So the vote message is going to be the vote for a validator.

198
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.510
And so when a validator executes the vote function,

199
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:44.440
that vote message is going to be input as the parameter to the function.

200
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:48.250
So it's going to be,
you know,
simply we can think of it as a binary.
Yes,
no,
right?

201
00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.130
But it's a 10 24 byte message.
So it fits onto a blockchain.

202
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.000
It's a very thin message.
And once they voted,

203
00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:59.650
then it's going to do these series of steps here to say whether or not the vote

204
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:03.610
was valid.
So the first step really is to say,
let's start a dynasty.

205
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.590
So let's start a dynasty.

206
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.770
So a dynasty consists of a set of validators right here.

207
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.710
And so once we have that dynasty,
we're going to say,
well,
what is the,

208
00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.290
what is the overall vote of that dynasty?

209
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.840
So another reason for having a dynasty is to say,

210
00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:21.910
what is the majority vote of this dynasty to speed up the voting process?

211
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.260
Just kind of similar to the l,
the electoral college in the,
in the United States.

212
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.940
It's not that every single person votes,

213
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.190
but it's kind of like a delegation of votes.

214
00:11:30.191 --> 00:11:33.460
And then what is the larger vote of his delegation?
We send them,

215
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.190
we send that up to the federal level.
So it's kind of like that,

216
00:11:36.191 --> 00:11:39.310
but for proof of stake voting,
who is it?
Okay.

217
00:11:39.311 --> 00:11:44.230
Here's the current vote of the dynasty wardrobe in a store in current dynasty.

218
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.460
And once we have that,

219
00:11:45.461 --> 00:11:49.300
we can record that the validator voted for this target epoch.

220
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.350
So they can't again.

221
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.060
So what happens to this record of whether or not the validator,

222
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.510
the record that this vote took place and then inside of the current dynasty will

223
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:03.340
increment all of those variables that we initialize earlier to say,

224
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.410
well the validator index,
he voted,

225
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.870
let's add one to it and then do it for the next validator.

226
00:12:07.871 --> 00:12:11.770
So there's some count of the number of validators in the network and now that

227
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:15.220
this validators voted increment the validator index to the next one.

228
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.340
So we can say,
okay,
this new identity is going to be the next validator.

229
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.160
So this is really the,
the validation part right here.

230
00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:22.720
So once the validators voted,

231
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.290
if enough votes with the same source epoch and Hash are made,

232
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.480
then the hash value is justified.

233
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:33.130
That means that if enough validators that have put stake into the system have

234
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:36.310
voted and that and those votes were indeed valid,

235
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.050
then and only then can that vote be added or that block be added to the

236
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:42.970
blockchain.
Right?
Because it is a valid vote.

237
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.630
And that's essentially what this last part does.
But yeah,
there's,

238
00:12:46.631 --> 00:12:49.390
there's quite a bit to proof of stake.
But that's the general idea.

239
00:12:49.391 --> 00:12:51.100
And I just want it to go into that for a second.

240
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.040
But let's keep going here because we have quite a bit more to cover.

241
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.640
So wax wax is another cryptocurrency in this space.

242
00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.230
So these are essentially utility tokens that allow for virtual goods to easily

243
00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:05.300
be tokenized that and exchanged for cryptocurrency.

244
00:13:05.301 --> 00:13:08.350
So any kind of endgame asset,
whether that's,
you know,

245
00:13:08.351 --> 00:13:12.700
looking at the amount of shields that you got in some,
you know,

246
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.840
medieval game or some kind of,
you know,

247
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.280
map that you bought or some skin for some new kind of you weapon in some kind of

248
00:13:21.281 --> 00:13:23.410
counter strike like game,
anything like that,

249
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.410
you can tokenize that and then sell it using this cryptocurrency.

250
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:31.060
And you can link all of those in game assets to this cryptocurrency.

251
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.210
So there are timestamped on the blockchain and then you can have the name of it

252
00:13:34.211 --> 00:13:38.020
as well embedded in that,
uh,
25 character hash.

253
00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.690
So it's provable.
That's the point.
So it's provable.
So the,
the wax platform,

254
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.550
you know,
they have,
they have a lot going for them.

255
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:50.170
But what I find really interesting is how they raised their token sale.

256
00:13:50.171 --> 00:13:53.590
So if we look at their token sale,
they raised quite a lot.
They,

257
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.850
they raised quite a lot of money.

258
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.010
But the really interesting bit is that if we look at their,
uh,

259
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.310
token contract,

260
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:05.550
it's essentially just a fork of the Zeplin solidity standard token contract.

261
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:11.020
So Zeplin basically makes making Erc 20 tokens very,
very easy.

262
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:14.950
And if you look at this code,
it's only 89 lines of code.

263
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.980
And what they did was they just forked it and they just added their own,
uh,

264
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.390
customized parameters to the code.
So if we look in here,
we say,
okay,

265
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.330
the constant Amy,
it's a wax token,
here's a symbol,

266
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.940
here's how many decimal points.
So eight decimal points,

267
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:32.230
and here's the initial supply.
And they used,
you know,
scientific notation to say,

268
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.600
this is there.
There are quite a lot of tokens.

269
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:39.250
So if we look in all of these functions here,
that's just it.

270
00:14:39.251 --> 00:14:44.050
It's just transfer.
It's transfer from address,
approve,
increase approval.

271
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.180
Why not paused,
decrease approval.

272
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.160
There's only seven functions in this code and they raised at least 50 million

273
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:55.850
USD.
It's quite a lot of money,
but it's just the power of ics,
of tokens,

274
00:14:55.851 --> 00:14:58.850
of exchanges.
There's,
there's quite a lot and you know,

275
00:14:58.851 --> 00:15:01.430
a lot of it isn't even justified.

276
00:15:01.431 --> 00:15:04.640
It's just people don't even understand what they're investing in and they just

277
00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:06.080
see something and they're like,
okay,

278
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.260
I need to pour a lot of money into this because it seems like it's good,

279
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.540
but a lot of times it's really just smoke and mirrors.

280
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.930
So we have to be very careful into what we invest in.

281
00:15:14.931 --> 00:15:18.950
And the best way to do that is not,
is not to look at landing pages,

282
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:23.510
it's not to look at,
uh,
the hype around something.
It's to look at the code.

283
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:28.130
If you can do that,
if you can understand the code behind some protocol,

284
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.120
then you're set then and only then should you really invest a lot of money

285
00:15:32.121 --> 00:15:35.330
because the code is really what matters,
right?
That's,
that's the real,

286
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.380
that's the real value that some unique token provides,
right?

287
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.960
If you have a bunch of coins for some space,

288
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:43.700
whether that's e sports or this or that,

289
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.900
and there's 20 different players in the field,
who is gonna win,
right?

290
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:50.150
Who's going to be the token that the most people adopt?

291
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.520
It's going to be a token that has the most value,
right?

292
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.820
And if all of them are just forks of the same token,
who's going to win?

293
00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.790
It's the one that provides that unique code base and that unique code base

294
00:15:59.791 --> 00:16:01.970
that's not just unique,
but it provides real value.

295
00:16:01.971 --> 00:16:04.700
And the best way to do that is to look at the code.
So this is just kind of uh,

296
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:05.631
an analysis,

297
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:09.620
an example of how you should be analyzing all of these tokens in the space.

298
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:13.400
Let's keep going.
So unocoin it's another one.
Unicorn bet.
Play Watch,

299
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:17.540
same exact idea.
It's for in game assets,
for bedding on the ethereum blockchain.

300
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.970
Interestingly,
Mark Cuban invested in this,

301
00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:24.410
so they've got $100 million token sale.
Quite a lot of hype behind this one.

302
00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.660
But if we look in their token distribution contract,
we'll see again,
same thing.

303
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.520
Zeplin template,
right?

304
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.630
What's the difference between Unicorn and a wax?

305
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.560
Nothing really programmatically.
It's the same exact contract.

306
00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:42.890
They've got an ERC 20 they've got a different landing page,
they've skinnded,

307
00:16:42.891 --> 00:16:47.360
they've wrapped it differently.
But under the hood,
it's the same exact template.

308
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.100
They have a different number of coins.

309
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.920
They have this a presale token allocation cap.

310
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:57.110
We have a post sale token allocation cap,
and they have a few more variables.

311
00:16:57.111 --> 00:16:58.430
But essentially it's the same thing.

312
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.320
So it's really important to be able to look at these and say,
you know what,

313
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.770
how good something is and how good it's not.
So let's go to the last one.

314
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.960
So this one is really interesting.
So it's called Chimera,

315
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:13.670
and they say that this is the ultimate blockchain game development platform.

316
00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:18.410
But crucially they don't have any code because they just don't have any code.

317
00:17:18.411 --> 00:17:20.030
It's just a landing page.
But they've,
they've,

318
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.090
they're raising quite a lot of money from just a landing page.
Right.

319
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.820
That's what I look for first for first is do they have code?
Yes.
No,
the answer,

320
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.960
no,
I'm just,
I'm just going to keep walking.
Right.

321
00:17:29.961 --> 00:17:33.140
So that's something you should do as well anyway,
so they want,

322
00:17:33.141 --> 00:17:35.150
so I'm not saying that there are fraudulent,

323
00:17:35.151 --> 00:17:39.050
I'm just saying that this is something that helps investors.

324
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.810
If you want people to invest,
if you want more hype,

325
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.860
have your code base available for people to view.
So these are,

326
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.560
so the idea is that you can take a video game,

327
00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:51.390
any kind of game and decentralize it on the blockchain.
What do I mean?

328
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.860
So if right now games are hosted on giant servers,
world of Warcraft for example,

329
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.440
Blizzard owns the server.
So you're connecting to blizzard.

330
00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:02.250
It blizzard decides to stop,
you know,
maintaining world of Warcraft,

331
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.110
then everybody doesn't get to play anymore.
But in,
in a decentralized space,

332
00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:10.620
there are multiple servers holding this game and people can interact with each

333
00:18:10.621 --> 00:18:15.210
other in a pure to pure way.
There's no way to shut the game down.
Also,

334
00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:18.270
if you're an indie game developer,
then the costs,

335
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:22.320
the costs of the infrastructure to get your game out there in front of many,

336
00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:24.780
many people,
it's a lot.
So you might be thinking,

337
00:18:24.781 --> 00:18:27.990
how are they putting an entire game on the blockchain,
right?

338
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.900
Games or multiple gigabytes of data.
They're not.

339
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.200
And if you have any kind of game that's related to the blockchain,

340
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.140
you shouldn't put it on the blockchain.
Just try,
it's not gonna work.

341
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.550
It's too big.
Right?
Blockchains are very,
very thin clients.
And,

342
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.250
and to have every node in a network download the game,
it's preposterous.

343
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.130
It's not going to work.
What should you do instead?
Well,

344
00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:50.400
you should use what's called the distributed hash table to store the data.

345
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.720
What the blockchain is for is for application level constructs.

346
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.280
So usernames,
uh,
tweets,
anything that the network has to agree upon.

347
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.280
Game states,
that's what you would use a blockchain for.

348
00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:04.980
Application level constructs go on the blockchain.

349
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:09.570
The data itself is stored in a distributed hash table like IPFS.

350
00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.600
So that's how they should do it.
I Dunno how exactly they're doing it.

351
00:19:12.601 --> 00:19:15.780
They weren't very specific,
but they have this idea of game channels.

352
00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:19.530
So game channels are what are called off chain transactions.

353
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:23.100
So in the bitcoin network there's this concept of a lightening network.

354
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.580
And the lightening network says,
W I'm a node,
you're node.

355
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.660
Let me transfer you some value without going on the bitcoin blockchain.

356
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.480
So which is the peer to peer note what?
What is,
what's going on?

357
00:19:33.481 --> 00:19:37.720
The blockchain is a record of that transaction,
but it's a very thin record.

358
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.400
It's not a huge record like an unnormal blockchain transaction takes a lot of

359
00:19:41.401 --> 00:19:42.081
time right there.

360
00:19:42.081 --> 00:19:46.170
There's a lot of time involved in the transaction and at least 10 minutes at

361
00:19:46.171 --> 00:19:47.730
this point,
but that's too long.

362
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.880
And so the reason they call it a lightening network is because it's very fast

363
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.010
because it avoids using a blockchain.

364
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.860
It's a direct peer to peer transfer without it being on the chain.

365
00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:01.100
So they're using this concept to store game states very fast because game states

366
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.440
need to be fast in terms of the game,
right?
If you're in position,
hey,

367
00:20:04.441 --> 00:20:07.170
you need to go to position B,
the network needs to agree that you moved,

368
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.170
but you need to do this in a fast way.
Game channels are the way to go.

369
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:15.210
But if we look at this code here,
let's,
let's look at some code.

370
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:17.910
So even though they don't have any code available,

371
00:20:17.911 --> 00:20:19.860
I did find some game contract code.

372
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:24.930
So this is a protocol called Izea x and it's a game protocol that uses smart

373
00:20:24.931 --> 00:20:29.140
contracts to agree on application level constructs.
So they have fun,

374
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.520
they have four different um,
smart contracts,

375
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.190
which is very interesting and I think this is a good way to do things.

376
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.690
They have one which is called game.

377
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.070
And that's defining the base abstract concept of your game.
You have token game,

378
00:20:41.071 --> 00:20:43.710
which defines the Games token rev share game.

379
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.890
And so this is an example of how to share that value between players and then

380
00:20:47.891 --> 00:20:50.830
game controller.
So this is which control.

381
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:55.060
So this controls which token holder has what and to what extent they can

382
00:20:55.061 --> 00:20:56.320
participate in the game.

383
00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:01.540
And they have contracts for all of this and solidity.
But interestingly,

384
00:21:01.541 --> 00:21:04.360
the game contract is probably the one that we should be looking at right now.

385
00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.060
So up here they have some rules of the game,
like two roles,

386
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:13.510
essentially the game issue or places,
the number of prizes into the,

387
00:21:13.511 --> 00:21:17.140
into the contract and the seed to calculate those hashes.
They're unknown.

388
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:20.040
And kept in secret.
So once players play the game,
the issue,

389
00:21:20.041 --> 00:21:22.270
or may give a secret seed to the winter,

390
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.460
the winter claims the prize and gets a reward.

391
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.390
So this is an example of using an application level construct for something

392
00:21:28.391 --> 00:21:31.690
that's essentially a massively online multiplayer game,
right?

393
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.540
Keep the thin stuff in the smart contracts,

394
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:39.400
the big stuff in the distributed hash table,
and we're good to go.

395
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:39.971
Anyway,

396
00:21:39.971 --> 00:21:43.060
I hope you found this video useful and please subscribe for more programming

397
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:47.140
videos.
For now.
I've got to visit decentral land,
so thanks for watching.
