1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.300
Million dollar salaries.
That's Ai,

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.020
hello world it Saroj and how are you supposed to get an AI internship,

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.960
whether it's doing research or applying it to the real world.

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.060
Ai based jobs are some of the highest paying jobs on the planet and AI

5
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:22.260
internships are a great way to get your foot in the door at a company you really

6
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:25.950
want to work for.
Interns get to learn from professionals,

7
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.220
the gain real world experience outside of the safe bubble of academia and they

8
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:35.100
get a chance to build a strong professional network,

9
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.810
but getting an AI internship won't happen overnight.
Unfortunately.

10
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.940
It's going to take some time and effort like all things worth working towards

11
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.640
and before you start applying for internships,

12
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.170
there are four steps you'll need to take,
which I'll detail in this video.

13
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.270
I'm going to list a lot of helpful resources here and all of them will be in the

14
00:00:57.271 --> 00:00:58.500
video description.

15
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.460
The first step is to decide what path you want to take.

16
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.320
Ai has so many subfields that you could pursue,
natural language processing,

17
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.090
computer vision,
skynet you'll never run out of topics to explore.

18
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.220
That's why I've been able to push out so many educational AI videos consistently

19
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:21.510
for over two years now.
This field is moving insanely fast.

20
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.980
There's always something new that's been released be at an open source library,

21
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.490
research,
discovery,
new application,
et cetera.

22
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.000
Follow researchers in the field on Twitter,
linkedin,

23
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.020
join Aai groups on Facebook,
Reddit,
our slack channel.

24
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.450
I've got a nice list for you in this regard.

25
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.730
You'll need to decide whether you want to work on applied AI or AI research.

26
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.030
Applied Ai involves using the technology to solve problems in a specific domain.

27
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.390
For example,

28
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.390
using computer vision to help identify diseased plants in a crop yield or using

29
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.440
unsupervised learning techniques that cluster the users of a platform based on

30
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:04.770
their interests,
which can help create targeted sales strategies.

31
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.900
To get an applied AI internship,

32
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.190
you'll need to understand how machine learning algorithms work and what

33
00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:13.440
assumptions they make about the data.

34
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.280
That includes what makes these algorithms fail.

35
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.260
You'll also need to know how to implement and design machine learning pipelines

36
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.890
using popular libraries like tensorflow and Pi Torch.

37
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.220
If you know how to implement these pipelines at scale on say AWS,

38
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.340
that helps as well and don't forget knowledge of data preprocessing.

39
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.580
It's a well known fact that most applied AI tasks involve mostly data.

40
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:44.430
Preprocessing real world data is unclean,

41
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:48.720
so knowing how to prepare a dataset like that into something that can

42
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:53.100
successfully be fed into machine learning algorithms to make valuable

43
00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:55.260
predictions is a crucial skill.

44
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.980
I've already made a video called learn machine learning in three that will help

45
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:04.900
you fulfill all of these requirements if you want to do AI research.

46
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.810
In addition to the skills I've just listed,

47
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.960
you also need to have a strong grasp of the mathematics of machine learning.

48
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.630
Meaning you should understand why certain algorithms like random forests and

49
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.240
neural networks can learn effectively from data.

50
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.040
I've got a great video that will help you with this called how to learn math

51
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:31.270
fast.
You'll also need to be able to read research papers.

52
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.130
Archive sanity is a great website that indexes the latest research papers

53
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.310
according to metrics that you can select yourself.

54
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.350
I also have a video called how to read research papers that will help you with

55
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:49.351
this and you need to prove your ability to conduct research through a prior

56
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.583
publication.

57
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.660
This is one of the main reasons why undergraduates have a hard time getting AI

58
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.523
internships.

59
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.740
You're competing with Grad students who have three to five years more experience

60
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:03.670
than you,
but my video,

61
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:07.390
how to write a research paper will help you bridge that gap.

62
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.490
Once you've picked a path,

63
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.930
you'll want to make an excel spreadsheet that lists all the companies that

64
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:15.040
you're interested in.

65
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.870
I've got a massive compilation of AI companies that are hiring interns and you

66
00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:22.450
can check out,
just go through each of them,

67
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.620
check out their website teams and see if you like what they're doing.

68
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.710
You can also use hashtags with relevant keywords on Twitter to help find job

69
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:33.640
lists,
things that aren't as public.

70
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.530
The point is be proactive about compiling the list of companies you want to work

71
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:43.090
for and I can't stress enough you should genuinely want to work for the

72
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:45.730
companies that you end up applying to.

73
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.860
Some of the most consistent feedback from employers is that a candidate didn't

74
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:54.460
seem to know or care much about their company.

75
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.790
Employers will often forgive a lack of experience when a passion for their

76
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:04.210
mission statement is made abundantly clear and remember,

77
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.330
there are more companies than just the big four.

78
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.570
Just because Amazon is hiring a lot of data scientists doesn't mean you'd be a

79
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:13.834
perfect fit.

80
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.370
There could be lots of smaller companies where you'd fit in way better.

81
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.260
Tiny startups,
nonprofits,
government data journalism.

82
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.650
Think outside the box here.
Jeffrey Hammerbacher,

83
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:31.651
the founder of Cloudera said that the best minds of my generation are thinking

84
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:35.320
about how to make people click ads.
That sucks.

85
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.410
We can do so much with Ai.

86
00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:43.411
There's never been a time in history where common people can make such a massive

87
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.400
impact in the world and AI has enabled this.
So choose wisely.

88
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.790
Next,
it's time to build out your personal brand.

89
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.620
What makes you worth hiring?

90
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.340
Getting into one of the leaderboards on Kaggle is one great way to do this.

91
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.440
Kaggle has built a community of data scientists that are all teaching and

92
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:04.880
learning from each other.

93
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.450
It's both a collaborative and competitive environment.

94
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.900
If you successfully place in one of their challenges,

95
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.930
you can link to that page in your portfolio.

96
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.120
It will definitely get you noticed.
There's also numerous [inaudible],

97
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.150
a community run hedge fund that hosts data science competitions applied to

98
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:25.940
finance.
Also,

99
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.970
it's absolutely crucial to have between three to five get hub projects available

100
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:35.900
for your employers to view pick projects you actually enjoy and focus on

101
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:38.960
improving your skills.
If you have that focus,

102
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.640
you'll view the inevitable obstacles and time pressures as things to help you

103
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:47.990
grow instead of irritating roadblocks in pending your way.

104
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.470
Each of your projects should use AI to solve a problem and be well documented.

105
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.700
Use a mainstream language like python or Java scripts,
own his points.

106
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:03.701
If you include automated testing and can apply it at scale as these relate to

107
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.000
the real world,

108
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.770
you can have the most comprehensive AI project in the world on your get hub,

109
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.630
but if it doesn't have good documentation,
no one will give it a second look.

110
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.960
I'm now the number 10 most followed developer on get hub out of 28 million and

111
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:25.151
it's because I've got tons of well documented repositories at developers love to

112
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:26.390
use.

113
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:31.250
So check out my get hub page to see some great well documented examples.

114
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:36.320
You'll also want to create a few valuable pull requests for popular open source

115
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:39.590
frameworks like Pi Torch.
If they get accepted,

116
00:07:39.591 --> 00:07:43.910
you can say you contributed on your resume and employers can see that.

117
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:45.890
Speaking of resumes,

118
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.950
I've got a great video on how to make an awesome resume called resume for

119
00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:54.230
machine learning.
Definitely watch it.
Also,

120
00:07:54.231 --> 00:07:59.231
one thing that many aspiring interns don't do is create a personal website.

121
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:04.310
You can list your experience projects linked to everything on this website.

122
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:09.610
You can use Weebly if you want a really easy drag and drop interface or make one

123
00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:13.940
from scratch.
And lastly,
this might be the best way to build your brand,

124
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:18.380
make AI content,
blog posts,
videos,
podcasts,

125
00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:23.240
find a medium you enjoy and teach other people about what you've learned so far

126
00:08:23.241 --> 00:08:26.840
in your AI journey.
Because I've built a personal brand.

127
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:31.640
I've been blessed by being given many relevant opportunities and so will you.

128
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.230
After you've done all of this,
you'll want to work on building your network.

129
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.700
Networking means offering to help other people that you admire.

130
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.630
If you help other people,
very often they will help you.

131
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.480
The best resource to do this is linkedin.

132
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.470
The community on Linkedin is professional and experienced.

133
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.430
Pick a handful of people you really admire and offered to help them in some way.

134
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.150
If you offer to work on one of their projects for free,

135
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.770
you can gain a lot of experience and often after you start working on a

136
00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:08.730
repository,
you start becoming more valuable to its future.

137
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.680
We can sometimes lead to your volunteer work,
converting into paid work.

138
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.810
When you find people on Linkedin who work at the companies you want to work at,

139
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:23.040
send them an email saying you're looking for some guidance on what they would

140
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:24.990
want to see in a future intern.

141
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:29.550
You're helping them by aligning yourself with what they're looking for.

142
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.100
Also,
if you attend a university,

143
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:36.720
find out where people in your school that you're above you went for their summer

144
00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:37.554
internship.

145
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.460
Find a time to hang out with them and ask them what their experience was like.

146
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.860
Often just by showing this kind of interest,

147
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.320
they'll then offer to help you out as well.

148
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.820
Use all of this interaction time to help you hone your soft skills,

149
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.130
meaning how you engage with people,

150
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.280
explain concepts you've learned about your mathematical intuitions and

151
00:09:58.441 --> 00:10:00.240
demonstrate your curiosity.

152
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:05.780
Universities usually have underutilized networking opportunities and resources,

153
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:06.930
so use them.

154
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.670
Go to your school's career advancement center and learn more about jobs you're

155
00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:15.270
interested in.
Finally,
it's time for the interviews.

156
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:20.100
I've got a great video on this called how to succeed in any programming

157
00:10:20.101 --> 00:10:23.070
interview.
The key is to practice.

158
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.040
You can get a friend to mock interview you first,

159
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:31.041
which will help be confident and honest about what you know and what you don't

160
00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:35.460
know.
If there's a question you have no idea about,
say it.

161
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.300
Rather than saying um,
and struggling at the end,

162
00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:42.420
they'll ask you if you have any questions about the company.

163
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:47.310
Always ask at least one question.
This shows your interest,

164
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.850
and remember,
everybody gets rejected a few times,

165
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.850
including top researchers like Ian Goodfellow.

166
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.620
So try and enjoy the process.
You can join our slack community for that.

167
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:03.090
Tons of wizards are encouraging each other to complete whatever goal they're

168
00:11:03.091 --> 00:11:07.590
trying to achieve.
And I've just created an internships channel as well.

169
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.680
If you're looking for an intern to hire a post in there,

170
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.620
and if you're looking to get hired,
check it out as well.

171
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.700
We live in a time of endless possibilities,
thanks to AI technology,

172
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.310
and there's never been a better time to get started.

173
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.000
I can't wait to see your progress.
Please subscribe for more programming videos.

174
00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:28.380
And for now,
I've got to hire some interns at some point,
so thanks for watching.
