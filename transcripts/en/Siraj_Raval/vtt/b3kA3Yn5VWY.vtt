00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.350
There's a mathematical order inherent in our universe.
Take a look at this river.

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.920
If we measure the length of it and divide by the direct route from the start to

3
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:11.040
the end,
we'll get [inaudible] or Ben Denas.

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.150
We found that the average tenure [inaudible] of every single river in the world

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.103
is pie.

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.400
The same mathematical constant use to calculate the mass of an electron and the

7
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:24.210
gentle breathing of a baby helps define how bendy all rivers are.

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.940
It's digits never end and never show a pattern,

9
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:31.200
but they can't possibly be random because they represent the inherent order of

10
00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:34.170
so many things in nature.
At a smaller scale,

11
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:36.540
we can observe that this drop of water is a liquid,

12
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:39.090
but depending on how the molecules are arranged,

13
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.630
it could also be a solid or a gas.
Only if it's liquid though,

14
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.570
is it considered wet?
Not all water is wet.

15
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.520
It's this specific arrangement of molecules caused by surface tension that gives

16
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:52.740
it the emergent property of wetness.

17
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.400
If we were to arrange these water droplets together in a certain way,

18
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.050
we could get a waterfall.

19
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.460
All waterfalls across the world fall at the same speed because they are all

20
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:06.900
subject to the same acceleration gravity that Nabi or stokes equation describes

21
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:09.480
how all fluids like the water and this waterfall,

22
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.560
we'll move and behave and it also explains everything from how blood flows in

23
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:16.860
our body to how we can best simulate water.
In video games.

24
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.910
We can understand the order of the universe by studying the patterns that emerge

25
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:24.690
from it.
Even something as seemingly random as the shape of a tree's branches has

26
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:25.320
ordered,

27
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.040
the main trunk of a tree will grow until it produces a branch which has two

28
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:33.840
growth points and each stem ranches into to this pattern is repeated for every

29
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:36.930
new stem.
We can model this using the FIBONACCI sequence.

30
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.400
Each successive number is the sum of the previous two and the average ratio of

31
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:45.800
every two consecutive terms in the sequence gives us a famous constant called

32
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:50.310
the golden ratio.
We can find examples of the golden ratio everywhere in nature,

33
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.340
the seed pods of a pine cone or a spiral pattern.

34
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.630
If we measure the angle offset between a leaf on a plant stem and the one below

35
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:00.660
it,
we'll find the average value uses the golden ratio.

36
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.290
It's even present in the formation of waves in the ocean.

37
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.740
This mathematical order applies to mammals as well.

38
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.720
What makes something alive or dead?

39
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.530
The difference between a living bird and a dead one isn't that we're adding some

40
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:14.910
secret life juice to it.

41
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.690
It's state depends on the specific pattern of its molecules.

42
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.580
Many birds use celestial objects like the sun or stars to navigate their flight

43
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:26.730
path,
and this requires some trig in the metric calculations,

44
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.610
but it's not that they're calculating these things consciously.

45
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.280
Animals simply do what comes natural to them.

46
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.780
Millions of years of natural selection helped equip them with the capabilities

47
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:41.070
to survive in their evolutionary niche birds or solving a trigonometry problem.

48
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:46.020
In the same way a waterfall solves the Navi or stokes equation or a dog salts

49
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:48.720
object location using visual and chemical signals.

50
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.430
Mathematics is just the language that helps us interpret all this activity.

51
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.110
So the question is,
can math also help us understand how our own brains work?

52
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.010
Can we quantify the feeling of meeting someone special for the first time?
Uh,

53
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.810
what's been your favorite trips?

54
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.593
Oh yeah.

55
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.110
Or the feelings you get when you spend time with them.

56
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.060
Consciousness is a mathematical patterns when information is being processed

57
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.320
governed by a set of patterns like those found in the branches of a tree or the

58
00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:31.340
fluid dynamics of a waterfall.
The way it feels is consciousness.

59
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.900
It's a beautiful emergent phenomenon arising only when molecules are arranged in

60
00:03:35.901 --> 00:03:38.260
a certain pattern.
Just like how wetness arises.

61
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.330
Only one water molecules are arranged in a certain pattern.

62
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.650
Math gives us a framework to reason about what the order behind these patterns

63
00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:47.390
could be and we can use beauty,

64
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.630
the beauty that's all around us as our torch in this journey.

65
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.710
One that we hold up and follow with the belief that eventually it might just

66
00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:55.820
lead us to truth.

67
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.240
<v 2>Hello world gets to Raj.
I'm here in Portland,
Oregon,
just hiking.</v>

68
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.560
I hope you guys like the video.

69
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.730
The winner of the coding challenge from the last video is Michelle botcher bad

70
00:04:04.731 --> 00:04:09.410
ass of the week and the runner up is set to ear.
No coding.
Challenge this video,

71
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.390
relax,
take a breather and happy holidays to you and everybody you love for now,

72
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.050
I've got to go hike up to a waterfall,
so thanks for watching.
