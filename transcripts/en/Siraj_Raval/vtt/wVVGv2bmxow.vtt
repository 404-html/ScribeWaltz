00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.020
Hello world,
it's Saroj and who's ready to learn some blockchain.

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.953
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.990
<v 0>For me to be able to write the decentralized applications book two years ago,</v>

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.970
I needed to study block chain technology,

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.090
hard a f and fast AAF and efficiently AAF since I was simultaneously traveling

6
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:23.220
through different parts of Asia.

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.870
So if I were to start learning blockchain from scratch today,

8
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.890
this is the two month study plan I'd make for myself,

9
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.380
but I'm going to open source it for you wizards since I love it.

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.880
This is a two month curriculum dedicated to in order one week of cryptography,

11
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.150
two weeks of Bitcoin,
two weeks of ethereum,

12
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.700
one week of other cryptocurrencies,

13
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.480
and lastly two weeks of decentralized applications.

14
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.640
But before you do anything else,

15
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.700
remember to hit the subscribe button if you haven't yet to stay updated on my

16
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:03.780
content.
This channel is my life's work.
As you learn this technology,

17
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.900
make sure to follow several blockchain authorities on Twitter to keep up with

18
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:12.990
the pulse in this space.
And yes,
in Soviet Russia,

19
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.360
blockchain authorities follow you.
Oh,

20
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:20.010
and for more things to remember before we get started with this curriculum.

21
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.260
First watch videos.
At two x speed and eventually three x speed.

22
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.590
As her brain learns to adapt to faster pacing.

23
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.210
Take notes by hand as you watch for memory retention.

24
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.630
Dedicate at least two hours every single day to uninterrupted learning and yes,

25
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.540
that includes weekends and find a study buddy in our slack channel or someone in

26
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:49.560
real life.
It will help keep you motivated.
Remember,
this is not a game.

27
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.500
The links for everything will be in the video description.

28
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.950
Before you get into the weeds with crypto currencies,

29
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.100
you have to understand why the word crypto is used in crypto currency crypto

30
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.690
short for cryptography is the art of securing information.

31
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.050
Given some sensitive data,
it asks the question,

32
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.930
how do we prevent a third party,

33
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.260
a k a an adversary from reading that data?

34
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.680
Most people don't realize just how crucial cryptography is for humanity.

35
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.900
Pretty much any kind of money transfer,

36
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.990
authentication flow and mission critical system relies very heavily on

37
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:35.421
cryptographic techniques to help maintain secrecy and cryptography itself sits

38
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:40.770
at the intersection of math,
computer science,
and even physics.

39
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.950
But luckily for us it's prerequisites aren't worthy of dedicating weeks of study

40
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:51.150
too.
We can pick them up in a single well structured cryptography course.

41
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.010
After reading some reviews,

42
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.930
it seems that the intro to cryptography course on Coursera is the best option

43
00:02:57.931 --> 00:02:58.860
here to get started.

44
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.860
It's a seven week course that we're going to complete in a single week.

45
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.190
Don't do any of the graded projects until you finish all of the videos.

46
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.370
Knock them out one by one at the end of this week.

47
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.150
Do the final exam for week seven.
Really put in an effort,

48
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.540
then double check your answers to learn from your mistakes.

49
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.250
Now on two weeks two and three we're going to focus on the blockchain that

50
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:26.170
started it all bitcoin,

51
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.320
so normally I almost never recommend reading books to learn this kind of thing

52
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:33.790
since videos are so efficient,

53
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.830
but sometimes there are exceptional books out there like the deep learning book

54
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.930
and where's Waldo.
In this case,

55
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.840
I'm going to recommend my friend Andreas onto Nepalis,

56
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:46.120
his book mastering bitcoin.

57
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.420
It's open source and available to read on get hub.

58
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.550
Andreas does such a great job of breaking down all the moving parts of the

59
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:58.690
bitcoin protocol.
His technical writing skills are next level.

60
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.970
There are 12 chapters in this book.

61
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.470
We're gonna read two to three chapters every single day until we finish them

62
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.070
all.

63
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.070
Pacing ourselves included in the book are technical instructions for configuring

64
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.270
and using the bitcoin protocol.
Go ahead and do those via your terminal.

65
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.530
If you get an error at some point,
try to fix it,
but if no luck,

66
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.250
don't get too caught up on it for too long.
Just move on.

67
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.230
After you've completed the book,

68
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.830
go ahead and read the official bitcoin white paper,

69
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.930
specifically an annotated version to make it easier to understand those
concepts.

70
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.040
Then download a bitcoin wallet and buy some Bitcoin.

71
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.020
It can be a really small amounts,

72
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:45.650
but it's mostly just to feel like you're a part of the network and experienced

73
00:04:45.651 --> 00:04:50.380
the cryptocurrency world firsthand.
For the second week of bitcoin learning.

74
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.850
Take the bitcoin and cryptocurrency technologies course on Coursera.

75
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.230
When you're done with that,

76
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.760
spend the rest of the week building a blockchain that uses the proof of work

77
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:05.530
consensus algorithm from scratch in your favorite programming language of
choice.

78
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.350
I'd recommend either python or javascript.

79
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.170
There's a great article that explains how to do this,

80
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:12.910
that I'll add too in the links.

81
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.180
Add as many features to it as you can to get some hands on experience in

82
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:22.240
blockchain technology.
Now that you've got a handle on Bitcoin,

83
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.090
it's time to go down the second rabbit hole.

84
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.800
Etherium bitcoin removed the need for an intermediary.

85
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:32.410
When sending someone money over the Internet,

86
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.100
recording all transactions on a public database,

87
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.430
the theory I'm developers realized that they could use the same underlying

88
00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:46.441
blockchain technology to remove the need for an intermediary for running code.

89
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.290
Think of it like a world computer,

90
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.320
a decentralized virtual machine to build uncensorable applications.

91
00:05:56.141 --> 00:05:56.980
On top of,

92
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.470
there's a free really short etherium course on you to me that you should first

93
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.290
check out to help you understand the etherium architecture.

94
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.540
Then you should read the annotated etherium white paper for a better

95
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:15.170
understanding.
It's much more complex than the bitcoin one,

96
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:19.130
so really take the time to go through all the details.

97
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.900
It will help you as soon as you start building etherium apps using the solidity

98
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:27.290
programming language.
Oh and speaking of solidity,

99
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.090
once you finish the course,

100
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.300
you can learn solidity using this crypto zombies game where you learn how smart

101
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:38.720
contracts work by building them and applying them to this game world is actually

102
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:40.310
pretty fun.
Lastly,

103
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.340
block geeks.com has a collection of really in depth articles on etherium that

104
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:46.970
I'd recommend checking out.

105
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.680
Just hit them up one by one once you search for the etherium keyword until you

106
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:54.380
understand all the parts of the architecture.

107
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.740
So bitcoin and etherium are out of the way,

108
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.540
but what about the other billion cryptocurrencies out there with all of their

109
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.550
unique features and ideas?
Are they worthless?
Yes,
no.

110
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:11.600
Some of these projects have synthesize some really great ideas,

111
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.610
so we should dedicate this week to learning about some of those best ideas.

112
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.690
I've got a great playlist that goes over the cryptocurrencies.

113
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.280
I find the most interesting right here on youtube that you should definitely

114
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:26.114
check out.

115
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.100
Remember to go through the associated code and helpful learning links in the

116
00:07:31.101 --> 00:07:34.940
video description for each of them to get a better understanding.

117
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.880
You can spread this bit out to an entire week.

118
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:42.590
There are rabbit holes you could go down for any of the cryptocurrencies I talk

119
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:47.540
about from Minero's ring signatures to Cardonas settlements layer.

120
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.840
Let your curiosity guide you this week and for the last part of this curriculum

121
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.690
you're going to wrap it all up by learning about the longer term vision for all

122
00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:02.540
of these technologies.
Decentralized applications.

123
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.410
Start off by reading my book on the topic.

124
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:11.060
You can find a free version if you Google the name with the word free
afterwards.

125
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.080
Also,
if someone posts a link to the free version in the comments,

126
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.760
I'll pin it so you can check it out.

127
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:21.790
That'll take you a full week and a lot of the code is deprecated now because of

128
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.720
all the dependencies being updated over time,
but the pseudocode,

129
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.780
the ideas and the theories remain for the very last week.

130
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:34.490
Build a decentralized application yourself.
Pick an idea,

131
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.730
ride sharing or social networking for example,

132
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:42.910
and use the fastest method to prototype approach to build something in a single

133
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.060
week and that's it.

134
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.360
I just launched my decentralized applications course at the school of Ai,

135
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.310
but we've currently got a full class,

136
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.750
so sign up there if you want to be notified when the next course opens up.

137
00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.530
I hope you found these tips useful.
Please subscribe for more programming videos,

138
00:09:00.531 --> 00:09:03.950
and for now,
I've got to upgrade the web,
so thanks for watching.
