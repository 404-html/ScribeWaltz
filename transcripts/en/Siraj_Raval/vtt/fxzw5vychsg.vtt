00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.990
Hello world,

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.490
it's Suraj and I'm going to list 10 people that I admire today.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.320
In no particular order.
These amazing people are a mix of AI researchers,

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.890
blockchain researchers,
philosophers,
storytellers,

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.240
and artists that I personally look up to and gain inspiration from.

6
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:20.520
So hopefully by sharing them with you,

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.260
you too can learn from them a link to all of them in the video description and

8
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.430
remember to hit the subscribe button if you want to keep up with all of my

9
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:33.330
educational content.
Number one is naval Ravikant.

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.660
Nevada is the founder of the popular Angel List website,

11
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.930
which aims to connect startups to the resources they need,

12
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.270
like investors and initial hires.

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.480
He invested in some of the most valuable companies that exist today early on and

14
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:51.570
has an eye for spotting potential,
but he's much more than that.

15
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.430
Neval has a way with words.

16
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.780
I follow him on Twitter and some of his tweet storms just make me sit back and

17
00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:01.260
question the foundational structures of society.

18
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.470
He's really into blockchain technology mostly for its potential to reorganize

19
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.710
the fabric of humanity.
And if Nietzsche were alive today,

20
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.540
his tweets would probably look very similar to Nevada and the Internet is going

21
00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:18.210
to become a giant grid.
Additionally,

22
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:21.360
some of his blog posts are worthy of Pulitzer prizes.

23
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.160
He's able to connect the dots between politics,
technology,
religion,

24
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.370
and social media in a way very few people can.

25
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.470
Number two is oriel venules in almost every single AI paper that matters a lot

26
00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:38.760
to me.
Oreo is listed as one of the authors neural machine translation,

27
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:41.790
which improved language translation immensely.

28
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.920
Sequence to sequence learning,

29
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:48.030
which brought chatbots to a whole new level wave net,

30
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.890
which was one of the top three advances in all of deep learning last year,

31
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.830
a new standard in speech recognition.

32
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.810
I was really excited when he was listed as one of the 35 innovators under 35 by

33
00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:04.800
MIT technology review.
Clearly Oriol is onto something.

34
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.390
His ideas are pointing in the right direction for where we should be headed in

35
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:13.170
terms of research and what are the avenues worth experimenting with.

36
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.450
Number three is Andrew Trask.

37
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.350
When I first started making videos about AI almost two years ago,

38
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.620
I remembered stumbling on a blog post by Trask on how a neural network works.

39
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.191
At the time,

40
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:31.191
it was by far the best technical explanation I'd ever seen on how a neural

41
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:36.390
network works.
Thinking about gradient descent,
like dropping a ball into a bowl.

42
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.370
Now that's an analogy that I can understand as opposed to the dozens of other

43
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:46.020
tutorials that forced me to think about it in terms of concepts I wasn't as

44
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:49.890
familiar with.
Trask later collaborated with me on the deep learning course.

45
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.630
I taught at Iu Udacity and there I got to know him a bit better.
Later on,

46
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:57.690
we met up in London where I interviewed him for the channel.

47
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.730
We ended up getting along really well.
Andrew gets it.

48
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.880
He understands that data is the key to democratizing AI and he's working on

49
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:11.140
solving this problem full time right now as he builds the open mind to
community.

50
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.910
He's one of the best technical writers alive right now.
Number four,

51
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.740
Balaji Srinivasan.
I remember watching his talk on exit at y Combinator,

52
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:21.574
startup school,

53
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.450
<v 1>Uber,
Airbnb,
Stripe Square,
and of course,
you know,
the big one,
Bitcoin,
uh,</v>

54
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.420
are all things that threaten dcs power.

55
00:03:30.421 --> 00:03:34.470
It is not necessarily clear that the u s government can ban something that it

56
00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:35.360
wants to ban any.

57
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.500
<v 0>It was a revolutionary idea that silicon valley should secede from the United</v>

58
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.550
States and his reasoning relating the US constitution to deprecated code

59
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.730
networks as nation states and geographic communities to cloud communities

60
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.010
fundamentally changed the way I view the world.

61
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160
Balaji's tweet storms are really insightful and his new startup earned.com is

62
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.390
probably the most successful implementation in production of blockchain

63
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:06.130
technology out there right now.

64
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.270
And it's because he's been thinking about this stuff for so long.

65
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.400
His list of accomplishments are pretty long and overall his view on where things

66
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:19.900
are headed,
our unparalleled number five,
Brian Johnson,

67
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.840
Brian puts his money where his mouth is.

68
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.160
He grew up in a modest family and earned his wealth over the years.

69
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.260
He made huge amounts of money with his previous startup brain tree and decided

70
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:36.190
to put 100 million of his own money to fund his current venture.

71
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.230
Colonel Colonel is dedicated to building a brain computer interface.

72
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.280
Essentially,

73
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.300
they want to build a device that connects your brain to the Internet.

74
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.370
Solving AI and connecting our brains to the Internet are two of the most

75
00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:54.730
important problems of our time.
If we do that,

76
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.960
we literally become limitless in our ability to do anything.

77
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.700
So when people say to me they think I'm crazy for what I'm trying to do,

78
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.420
I would say I would be crazy not to.

79
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.620
I had the opportunity to meet Brian at his office in La a few weeks ago,

80
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.760
and the conversations we had had me thinking for hours afterwards.

81
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.500
He's trying to create an environment where discoveries happen and the best

82
00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:24.040
discoveries tend to happen by accident like that of DNA.

83
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.510
Every day he wakes up excited to solve that problem and it's really inspiring.

84
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.000
Number six,
Tristan Harris.

85
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.050
I first heard Tristan Harris while listening to a podcast by a modern

86
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:39.310
philosopher I really like named Sam Harris and he blew me away.

87
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.230
The thing is that any attention based companies,
snapchat,
Netflix,
um,
uh,
you know,

88
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.760
uh,
meditation after even they all need more attention to be successful.

89
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.250
He used to be a design ethicist at Google,

90
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.340
but is now working full time on what he calls the time well spent movement.

91
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.900
Basically he sees how these big tech companies are creating algorithms that are

92
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:07.271
optimizing for users attention since that's what fuels their ad revenue business

93
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:11.840
model.
And these algorithms have become runaway AI eyes.

94
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.320
Even the creators don't understand how they fully work.

95
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.560
The Facebook newsfeed is an example of that and this poses an existential

96
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.920
threat.
The content it shows us isn't necessarily good for us.

97
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.840
It's just what grabs our attention.

98
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.200
Tourists and argues that instead of optimizing for attention,

99
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.440
they should be optimizing for our time well spent content that would benefit the

100
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:39.800
users as AI development accelerates.
Now more than ever,

101
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.300
we need someone like Tristan helping guide AI so that it's built in a safe

102
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.050
beneficial way.
Number seven Tupac Shakur.
Okay.

103
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.640
I know this one is kind of random and I know Tupac rapped about violence and

104
00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:53.061
drugs,

105
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:58.061
but what I find most inspiring about him is the amount of courage he had.

106
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.940
Tupac wasn't afraid of anyone or anything.

107
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.800
He spoke his truth during the time of real political and social turmoil in

108
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:07.610
America.

109
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.050
Very few people had the kind of charisma that Tupac had and he was a man with a

110
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:12.530
plan.

111
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.530
You just wanted to follow him despite being constantly degraded by the media and

112
00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:18.554
the police.

113
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.250
He fought for what he believed in a brighter future for people in poverty.

114
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.640
He never lost sight of who he was.
Number eight,

115
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.410
Kwan Bennet one was my roommate back in San Francisco for a bit and I worked

116
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:33.650
with him a bit on his project.
The interplanetary file system,

117
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.940
IPFS and file coin are an implementation of quants,

118
00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:39.440
greater vision for the web.

119
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.190
When one talks about blockchains and distributed hash tables,

120
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.190
he makes things seem not just possible,

121
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.430
but simple to achieve that wouldn't have otherwise.

122
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:55.350
<v 2>We built IPFS a protocol to remove those central points of failure to improve</v>

123
00:07:55.571 --> 00:07:58.930
the resilience of the Internet and the web and to give information and a

124
00:07:58.931 --> 00:08:00.070
stronger sense of permanence.

125
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.720
<v 0>He has this thirst for knowledge that's really inspiring and when he talks about</v>

126
00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:09.380
the pioneers of the web from burners lead to Bram Cohen,

127
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.370
he makes you realize that you too could come up with a great idea.

128
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.530
If you build a great protocol,

129
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.920
people will use it and it'll become a key part of the web.

130
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.240
IPFS is a beautiful system and I could tell that he'd really done his

131
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.730
distributed systems research.
When I read it,

132
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.450
it's people like Kwan that will move the web and as a result,

133
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:33.110
all of humanity forward.
Number nine,
Steve Jobs,

134
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:35.630
say what you want about Steve Jobs.

135
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.920
Say that he was hard to work with or he wasn't doing the real engineering behind

136
00:08:39.921 --> 00:08:40.940
Apple's products,

137
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.650
but no one can say Steve jobs wasn't an inspirational speaker.

138
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.440
When jobs spoke,
people listened.

139
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.950
<v 3>Apple Apple's place in is totally different and believe me,</v>

140
00:08:51.951 --> 00:08:55.590
the products and the distribution and manufacturing,
we understand that

141
00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:02.580
what values and core values,
those things shouldn't change.

142
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.610
<v 0>He was able to weave a story into the fabric of the company he was creating,</v>

143
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.320
giving apple something more to believe in than just building products.

144
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.940
I've read his biography and I've probably seen every single Steve jobs video

145
00:09:16.941 --> 00:09:21.290
that exists at this point.
He's truly one of a kind.
Number 10 is trends,

146
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.480
mcconaughey,
kind of like Andrew Trask.

147
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:28.660
Trent is one of the few people that understand both artificial intelligence and

148
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.120
blockchain technology really well.
Not only that,

149
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:37.150
Trent understands the need to democratize access to data and he's working on it

150
00:09:37.191 --> 00:09:39.230
full time on ocean protocol.

151
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:44.590
