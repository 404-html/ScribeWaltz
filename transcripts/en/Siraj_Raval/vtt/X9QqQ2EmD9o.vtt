1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.780
Hello world.

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.780
It's the Raj and today I'm introducing a crypto currency for our community

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.030
called Saroj coin that will help grow us so we can solve AI faster.

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.710
It's designed for programming wizards and will act as the fuel for our global

5
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:21.390
network to expand to fund AI research,
collaborate with me,

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.130
empower each other to spread AI knowledge and ultimately become the school of

7
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:26.910
Ai.

8
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.910
There is no ICO and this isn't some get rich quick scheme tron coin and as I

9
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:34.860
explained this,
you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.700
I'm going to talk about our history,
where we are now and where we're going.

11
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.560
Then I'm going to explain exactly how I built Saroj coin and how you can help.

12
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.970
And just about two years,

13
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.060
our youtube community has grown to about 270,000 developers coming from over 150

14
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:54.720
countries globally that speak over 200 languages.

15
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.320
I've since traveled around the world to meet some of you in person.

16
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.010
I started the channel while I was living in San Francisco,

17
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.500
but now I kind of live all over the place.

18
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.690
I've had subscriber meetups in Amsterdam,
London,
New Delhi,
Los Angeles,

19
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.920
and New York City.

20
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:15.921
So far our community ranges in age from eight years old up to people in their

21
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.550
eighties.
Yes,
eight years old.

22
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:22.200
I'm serious young wizards like Simon who I recently took the train to meet in

23
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:26.700
Brussels already has a headstart on his neural network projects

24
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.130
recurrence,
uh,
which is uh,
uh,

25
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.060
all that works examples.
That's why it says

26
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.370
current network and I'm making up for grade,
which

27
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.020
was our slack channel is massive with a new wizard joining every two seconds.

28
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.390
And we have active community members on Twitter,
Facebook,

29
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.610
and read it every single day.

30
00:01:56.611 --> 00:02:00.690
Between 500 and 800 wizards join our community on Youtube.

31
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.640
And I've received countless mindblowing coding submissions from our best and

32
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:07.500
brightest on this channel.

33
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.740
We truly are a global network of developers with a single mission to solve AI

34
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.180
through research and education and use it to benefit humanity.

35
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.050
So how does a crypto currency fit into all of this?

36
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.580
What consider us a network.
Networks are digital organisms.

37
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.610
There a symbiosis of digital and biological intelligence more capable than the

38
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:32.910
sum of its parts.

39
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.350
Edges between humans in the graph are strengthened by automation.

40
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.860
If incentives are democratized to all nodes,

41
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.800
it can grow an order of a magnitude faster.

42
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.670
I've got an incentive to grow this community by gaining subscribers,

43
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.640
but if I can give you guys that incentive as well,

44
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.250
together we can grow much faster.

45
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.320
Saroj coin is a crypto currency that you can both earn and spend.

46
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.650
In order earn Saroj coin.
You can give a referral link to a friend.

47
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.600
Once you have your own Saroj coin public address,
you can use your referral link,

48
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:11.680
which will be at Saroj coin.io/your public key.

49
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.400
When you share your referral link and a friend clicks on it,

50
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.060
it will take them to my channel asking them to subscribe.

51
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.880
If they do subscribe,
you earn Suraj coin.

52
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
The web app acts as the intermediary between calling the Youtube Api for a new

53
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:31.720
subscription and the Saroj coin blockchain.
This is an oracle.

54
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.880
The community has the public key of the Oracle and can govern what the Oracle is

55
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:41.230
allowed to do,
like grant coins.
It's publicly verifiable.

56
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.790
The reason for using an oracle is because blockchain's can't access data outside

57
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:46.624
their network.

58
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.490
On oracle is a data feed provided by a third party service designed for use in

59
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:53.440
smart contracts on the blockchain.

60
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.890
Oracle's provide external data and trigger smart contract executions when

61
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:00.880
predefined conditions meet.

62
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.840
These conditions could be any data like weather,
temperatures,

63
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.040
price fluctuations,
or in our case Youtube subscriptions.

64
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.740
There is also a treasury for our community.

65
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.100
This will be a fund that the community can vote on proposals for and decide

66
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.700
where the funds go.

67
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.860
The funds can be spent on AI research initiatives electing community

68
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.890
representatives who can do things like host hackathons or moderate the slack

69
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:35.041
channel or even funding other creators that are dedicating their time and

70
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:39.910
resources to spreading AI knowledge.
No one,
not even me,

71
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.670
can withdraw money from that fund it.

72
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:47.671
We'll take the consensus of the community to decide how much and if certain

73
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:50.740
proposals received funds allocated to them.

74
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.150
The more Saroj coins someone owns,
the more voting power they have.

75
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.270
This idea was inspired by the dash and card Dano.

76
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.740
Cryptocurrencies validators in the network receive rewards for validating

77
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:05.980
transactions.
There are two types of transactions,

78
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.620
taxed and non taxed transactions.

79
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.920
The tax transactions are from a member receiving Saroj coin for referring a new

80
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:17.170
member and the validator gaining a reward.

81
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.440
15% of the transaction is sent to the fund of the Treasury and 10% is sent to

82
00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:28.180
me.
Send and receive transactions between members are not taxed.

83
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.841
This way.

84
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:33.370
The treasury grows in value over time and I received Saroj coined that.

85
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.060
I can then give back to the community in novel ways that I think of.

86
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.160
So that's how you can earn through Raj coin,
but what can you spend it on?

87
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.400
Usually there is some scarce resource that gives a currency value and in our

88
00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:50.170
case that scarce resource is me.

89
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.500
You can use Suraj coin to spend it on my attention via hourly meetings and video

90
00:05:55.781 --> 00:05:56.860
collaborations.

91
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.110
It will also unlock access to any merchandise I decide to sell private events.

92
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:06.260
I host an exclusive content that I could make some time in the future.

93
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.650
So Raj coin is built on tendermint proof of stake.

94
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:14.360
Consensus tendermint is a blockchain engine that lets you write blockchains in

95
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:15.470
any language.

96
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.710
The specific framework used is called lotion and it's a javascript framework

97
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.000
built on tendermint,
which makes it easy to create blockchain applications.

98
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.220
It lets you write a scalable blockchain that can easily inter operate with other

99
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:33.440
blockchains at any moment in time.

100
00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:38.441
The whole state of your blockchain is represented by a single javascript object

101
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.080
called the state.
Users can create transactions.

102
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.310
These are javascript objects that tell the application how to modify the

103
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:47.690
blockchains state.

104
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.730
Every user who runs a lotion APP will interact with the same blockchain and

105
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:57.410
anyone can create a transaction and it will automatically find its way to

106
00:06:57.411 --> 00:07:01.460
everyone else running the app and modify their states.

107
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.870
Everyone's states objects.
We'll constantly be kept in sync with each other.

108
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.850
A lotion application is just a single function of signature state transaction

109
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.750
which modifies your blockchain state in response to a transaction.

110
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.800
Both are just objects.
This is made possible by tendermint,

111
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.950
which exists specifically for synchronizing state machines across networks.

112
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.030
The goal of a blockchain is to represent a single state being concurrently

113
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.380
edited in order to avoid conflicts between concurrent edits.

114
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.750
It represents the state as a ledger.

115
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.350
A series of transactions apply to an initial state.

116
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.390
The blockchain must allow all connected nodes to agree about which

117
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:48.890
transformations are valid and they're ordering within the ledger to accomplish

118
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:52.520
this.
A blockchain is composed of three protocols,

119
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.760
the network protocol,
the consensus protocol,

120
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.830
and the transaction protocol.

121
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:02.240
The network protocol is how nodes in the network tell each other about new

122
00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:05.060
transactions,
blocks and other notes.

123
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.610
Usually a pure to pure gossip network.

124
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.560
The consensus protocol is the set of rules that nodes should follow to determine

125
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:17.570
which particular ordered set of transformations should be in the ledger at a

126
00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:20.090
given moment.
In bitcoin,

127
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:25.100
the chain with the highest difficulty seeing via node is treated as the highest

128
00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:25.934
truth.

129
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.530
The transaction protocol describes what makes transactions valid and how they

130
00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:34.850
should modify the blockchains state.
When we're writing a lotion APP,

131
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.390
we're only responsible for writing the transaction protocol.

132
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.610
Under the hood.
Tendermint is handling the consensus and network protocols.

133
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:48.080
When we start our lotion APP,
uh,
tendermint node is also started,

134
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.700
which will handle all of the communication with other nodes running our lotion

135
00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:57.000
app.
There are three points to remember from this video.

136
00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.160
So Raj coin is a cryptocurrency for programming wizards that will help grow our

137
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:04.920
community so we can solve Ai.

138
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:09.270
It will act as the fuel for our Global Ai Community to expand,

139
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.480
fund AI research,
collaborate with me,

140
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.810
and empower each other to spread AI knowledge.

141
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.360
Ultimately becoming the school of Ai.

142
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.490
You can earn Saroj coin by referring new wizards to the community and eventually

143
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:26.700
by creating educational content around Ai,

144
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.350
doing AI research or by being elected as a community representative,

145
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.460
you can spend Saroj coin on meeting time with me.

146
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.130
Video collaborations together,

147
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.700
merchandise exclusive content and private events.

148
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.240
And Saroj coin was created using lotion,

149
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.920
a framework for building blockchains in javascript powered by tendermint

150
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:50.790
consensus.

151
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:56.180
Everyone who holds Saroj coin will be incentivized to help grow the network.

152
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.460
In addition to needing more subscribers,

153
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.790
I need help creating subtitles for my videos,

154
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.990
for promoting my content on social media,
getting more PR coverage,

155
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.790
moderating the slack channel,

156
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.270
and so many other things I haven't even thought about right now.

157
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:17.250
The great thing about a cryptocurrency is that it allows for the creation of a

158
00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:19.980
decentralized governance structure.

159
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:25.310
All of these tasks can be proposed by anyone in the community and we can

160
00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:28.710
collectively fund someone to complete those tasks.

161
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:33.540
If that person's successfully does the task,
it benefits everyone,

162
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.840
not just me.
Since everyone holds Saroj coin,

163
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.620
this is quite an ambitious experiment and a lot can go wrong,

164
00:10:40.621 --> 00:10:42.330
but if you believe in me,

165
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.890
you believe in this community and you believe in our mission to solve Ai,

166
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.390
believe in Saroj coin.

167
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.810
This week's coding challenge is to contribute to Saroj coin.

168
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.010
Check out the get hub repository for ways that you can contribute and post your

169
00:10:56.011 --> 00:10:59.580
github pull request link in the youtube comments section.

170
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.400
I'll announce the top two entries next week.

171
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.430
If you want to find ways that you can earn Saroj coin right now,

172
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.770
check the video description for some info.

173
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.620
Please subscribe for more programming videos,
and for now,

174
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.620
I've got to work on Suraj Goin so thanks for watching.
