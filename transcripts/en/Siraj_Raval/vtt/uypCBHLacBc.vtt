Hello World Saroj here.
The interplanetary file system.

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.170
More IPFS is a new protocol that could upgrade the entire Internet.

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.100
A protocol is just a set of rules written with software and the Internet is made

4
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:15.210
up of a bunch of them.
They want handled different things.
Email,
data,

5
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:18.940
transfer page layout,
a bunch of stuff.
The http protocol,

6
00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:20.880
because the most popular one you don't go.

7
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.900
When you go to a website it says http and at the beginning of the URL bar,

8
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.110
that's because your web browser is using the http protocol to retrieve the page.

9
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.460
Each GDP was created by a stream of gene and Tim Burns Lee in 1989 it defines to

10
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.020
an a client and a server and it enables each to request data from the other back

11
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:43.800
and forth if their request was successful or response to send back.

12
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.340
So when you type in http colon slash slash [inaudible] dot com in your browser,

13
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.503
which is the client,

14
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.100
it uses HDP to request as well main page and Google server using http to send it

15
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:55.530
to you as a response.
That's it.

16
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.610
That simple protocol is the backbone of the entire worldwide web.

17
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.470
It connects all of our computing devices together,
phones,
tablets,
laptops,

18
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.100
everything.
But ADP isn't good enough anymore.
In fact,

19
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.440
it's kind of totally broken.
AGB has made the web become totally centralized.

20
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.810
That means I'd handful of apps on all of our data.

21
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.530
It profit off of our data that we freely give to them to return for a free

22
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:23.580
service.
Well,
this may seem cool at first.
This is actually shrinking the economy.

23
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.450
We're living in a data economy.
Data is the asset of this new world.

24
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.360
In a good economy,
we should be monetizing more and more.

25
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.840
But in a centralized internet,
we're monetizing less and less.

26
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.000
These central servers are getting more and more powerful by absorbing all of our

27
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:43.940
data.
Servers are given a unique IP address,
which defines its location,

28
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.670
but that location is far away.
It takes longer to retrieve the data,

29
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.980
and because data is a location address,

30
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.450
if that location gets shutdown at data is lost forever.
All of it,

31
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.280
it's just not sustainable.
But maybe we could make a permanent web,
uh,

32
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:02.910
web where links never die.
That's the vision of IPFS.

33
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.410
It's a pure to pure protocol.

34
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:07.470
There's no central server people connect to each other directly.

35
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.270
That means if you built a website on IPFS,
it could never be shut down by anyone.

36
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.570
Even if the government shuts down Internet access during protests,

37
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.950
people could still communicate with each other offline with Ip effects.

38
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.200
That is a potential to say actual human models and data will be owned by us.

39
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.000
The people,
not by one group.

40
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:30.480
We could get paid for our data instead of one group profiting off of all of it

41
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.920
and because IPFS is peer to peer data transfer is much,
much faster.

42
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.430
The network give data,
a content address,
not an IP address,

43
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.110
so if you want to load a website,

44
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.800
you set up your computer requesting it from a server across the world,

45
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.420
it'll find the nearest copy.

46
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.130
Maybe that random dude sitting next to you in chemistry has it on his laptop and

47
00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:53.610
your computer would retrieve it from there directly and if multiple people have

48
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:57.840
copies of it,
your computer would request it from all of them at the same time.

49
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.800
The more peers no faster than download videos with loads so much faster.

50
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.690
You can download games 10 times faster.
It's just better in every way.

51
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.130
IPFS who's going to help our computers talk to each other much more efficiently

52
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.000
and one day if we become an interplanetary species,

53
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.300
IPFS could be a protocol we use to communicate with each other.

54
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.930
If you're on Mars,
you don't want to have to stream that video from Earth.

55
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.620
If your friends sitting next to in the Martian don't Ardi has checkout IPFS best

56
00:03:27.621 --> 00:03:31.420
dot ios to start learning more about it and ways that you can build

57
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.680
decentralized apps.

58
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.030
There are a couple of great demos to get started right on the website.

59
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.880
If you'd like to see more technology videos,
please subscribe.

60
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:42.370
I really appreciate it and as always,
thanks for watching.
