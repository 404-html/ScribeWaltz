00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.360
Yo this protein needs to fold faster.
Add some AI to it.

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.170
Hello world,
it's Saroj.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.130
And last month an AI lab called deep mind entered their algorithm,

4
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:16.050
dubbed Alpha fold into a competition to predict the shapes of proteins and won.

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.110
This is a big deal,
unlike the rest of the teams.

6
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.320
Deepmind had zero experience in molecular biology,

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.730
yet they still beat top pharmaceutical companies with a hundred k plus employees

8
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:30.000
like Pfizer at this challenge.
And not only that,

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.900
they won by an unusually large margin over second place.

10
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.050
Deep mind demonstrated that an engineering solution,

11
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:41.910
not necessarily a breakthrough insights could accelerate scientific discovery.

12
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.340
Deep Mind,
we'll probably release the Alpha fold code and paper later this year,

13
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.410
but I just couldn't wait for that.
So I went ahead and recreate it.

14
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:53.610
It programmatically as best I could.

15
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.820
I'll explain the theory and code in this video.

16
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.170
Click subscribe if you haven't yet,
but before we do that,

17
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:05.660
we need to zoom out to see the bigger picture here.
Okay.
Not that far.

18
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.500
Almost everything new,

19
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.530
all knowledge and innovation in science and technology centers around one of

20
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:16.110
three ideas.
The atom,
the bite,
and the gene.

21
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.850
All three are building blocks,
basic organizational units of a larger whole,

22
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.170
the Adam for matter,

23
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.150
the bites for digitized information and the gene for biological information

24
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.190
matter.
Information in biology are all inherently hierarchically organized.

25
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.360
Understanding the smallest part is crucial to understanding the whole,

26
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.570
and while these three ideas have dominated science and technology in the 20th

27
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:42.624
century,

28
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.690
their convergence will dominate the 21st Alpha fold is the perfect example of a

29
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:53.130
convergence between two biology and information.
The gene and the bite.

30
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.390
A gene is a region of DNA that encodes some instructions.

31
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.000
DNA is the blueprint for all living things.

32
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:04.650
A copy of it is found in every cell of an organism from a strand of your hair to

33
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:05.484
your moneymaker.

34
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.840
Think of it like software and the cell with its molecular machinery is the

35
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:11.820
hardware running the software.

36
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.500
DNA needs a living cell to carry out its instructions in the proper setting.

37
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.480
These instructions are powerful,

38
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:23.430
producing a whole human being from just a single cell as it did with each of us

39
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:26.580
during our eight months of gestation in the womb.
DNAS.

40
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:28.890
Instructions are used to make proteins.

41
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:32.820
The complex molecules that do most of the work in our bodies.

42
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.150
The instructions of DNA are transcribed to an intermediary molecule called RNA.

43
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.260
The information contained in RNA molecules are translated into the language of

44
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:46.290
amino acids,
which are the building blocks of proteins.

45
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.300
This language tells the cells protein making machinery the precise order in

46
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:54.930
which to link the amino acids to produce a specific protein.

47
00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.190
This is a big task because there are 20 types of amino acids which can be placed

48
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:04.480
in a whole lot of different orders to form a wide variety of proteins.

49
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.490
These proteins fight viruses,

50
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.670
transmit signals to coordinate biological processes,

51
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.960
provide structural support for cells,
transport molecules act.

52
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:16.270
As storage devices make you swole.

53
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.250
They have a huge range of functions in the body.
Proteins are complex molecules.

54
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:24.580
They aren't stable in their unfolded or fully extended shape.

55
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.650
They spontaneously fold inside and outside of the body based on interactions

56
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:32.710
between amino acids and different environments.

57
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.980
The ability to predict a protein's shape allows us to better diagnose and treat

58
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.480
diseases that are believed to be caused by misfolding proteins like Alzheimer's,

59
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.810
Parkinson's,
Huntington's,
and cystic fibrosis.

60
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.460
Knowing how proteins operate opens up new potential within drug discovery.

61
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.380
It will enable scientists to create much more effective cures for diseases more

62
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:57.214
efficiently,

63
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.540
which would ultimately improve the quality of life for millions of patients

64
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.820
around the world.
In fact,

65
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.140
any material with any set of desired properties could be constructed using

66
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:08.974
proteins.

67
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.660
We could build a material as hard as a turtle shell or as soft as a jellyfish.

68
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.290
We can build liquids that dissolve plastics or the most flexible fibers in the

69
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:24.220
known universe.
Think of proteins like generalized materials.

70
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.240
If we understood the inverse function of material properties,

71
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:30.190
meaning their protein structures,

72
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.360
it would change the world far beyond the monetary value of the invention.

73
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.400
We could improve crop efficiency by creating insecticidal proteins or frost

74
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:40.480
protective coatings.

75
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.370
We could regenerate tissue in disabled veterans through self assembling
proteins.

76
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.770
A whole new realm of cosmetic and enhancement supplements for improved health

77
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.240
could be introduced.

78
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.590
Solving protein folding doesn't just need curing diseases.

79
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.260
It means helping solve world hunger,

80
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.120
enhancing our own physical capabilities and creating new biomaterials.

81
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.100
A protein starts off as a straight string of amino acids chained together in a

82
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:10.210
unique ordering.

83
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.280
Then an initial folding process occurs that includes a few twists and zigzag

84
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.440
folds,
giving it more of a three d shape.

85
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.030
This folding progress's as component amino acids come together through

86
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:22.864
attraction,

87
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.580
across disparate lengths of the protein and sometimes the resulting protein will

88
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:32.320
attach to other proteins after finishing folding in order to function properly.

89
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.220
This whole process is driven by energy minimization.

90
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.530
We can imagine the process of protein folding as a hiking expedition across the

91
00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:44.680
field of rolling hills to find the deepest valley.

92
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.480
The tops of hills described protein folds that are very unlikely to occur and

93
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:53.680
the valleys described states that the protein is drawn towards the native state.

94
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.070
For a given protein of x amino acids,

95
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.870
there are about three to the x possible folds.

96
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.740
This quickly becomes intractable for proteins of meaningful size,

97
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.360
which contain hundreds of amino acids.
It's a high dimensional landscape.

98
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:12.620
Trying to predict the shape of it remains difficult for most methods.
Thus far.

99
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:17.060
Scientists have been able to predict some protein shapes using experimental

100
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:21.560
techniques like cryo electron microscopy,
nuclear magnetic resonance,

101
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:23.150
and x Ray crystallography.

102
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.840
Each of these methods is a time intensive process.

103
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:31.841
Lots of trial and error are involved and it often takes years and tens of

104
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.470
thousands of dollars per structure,

105
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.690
but the rapidly dropping cost of genetic sequencing has increased the amount of

106
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:41.000
available genetic data to train on,

107
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.180
and this is a major reason why biologists are turning to AI as an alternative to

108
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:49.400
traditional prediction processes for difficult proteins.

109
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.560
Casp the community wide experiment on the critical assessment of techniques for

110
00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:59.561
protein structure prediction was established in 1994 and became the gold

111
00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:04.220
standard for assessing different protein folding prediction techniques.

112
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.690
It's helped catalyze research and measure progress on the newest methods for

113
00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:10.970
improving the accuracy of predictions.

114
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.030
Eat mind entered into the competition and won against a total of 98 competitors.

115
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.600
Vastly out competing the team winning.
The second place the mind be like Gary,

116
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.570
Brad,

117
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.910
while a team in second place could predict only three of 43 proteins Alpha fold

118
00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:31.100
correctly predicted the structure of 25 of those.

119
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.110
The protein folding problem has been worked on now for over five decades.

120
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.250
The challenge is that DNA only contains information about the sequence of a

121
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:42.500
proteins,
amino acid chains.

122
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:47.210
It's building block predicting how these chains will fold into the intricate

123
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.990
three d structures of a protein is the hard part.
Over the years,

124
00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:55.130
as scientists have been able to discover various protein structures using

125
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:56.090
different techniques,

126
00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:00.560
a database of proteins was compiled called the protein data bank.

127
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.830
It's a Dataset that contains over 146 k proteins and deep mind that use 29 k of

128
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.570
them to train its neural network.

129
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.640
The input would be the amino acid sequence and the output or label is the

130
00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:17.630
collection of coordinates that represent the resulting proteins.
Three d shape,

131
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:18.321
Yay.

132
00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:22.820
Supervised learning Alpha fold was able to learn the relationship between the

133
00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:26.360
amino acid chains and their resulting protein structures.

134
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.540
Then given a new amino acid chain,

135
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.240
it could predict and associated protein structure.

136
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:37.520
Alpha fold consisted of two deep residual convolutional neural networks.

137
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.570
We've seen a lot of advances in tasks like image recognition and speech

138
00:08:41.571 --> 00:08:45.320
recognition by simply stacking more layers on to neural networks.

139
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.440
The more layers and network has the deeper it's considered,

140
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.680
but simply stacking more layers onto a network only goes so far and after a

141
00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:57.000
certain threshold accuracy starts to drop.

142
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.140
Microsoft research thought of a brilliant solution to this problem.

143
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.750
Just sorry about that.

144
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.250
Just connect the output of previous layers to the output of new layers.

145
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.280
Assuming you have a three layer network for example,

146
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.900
you wouldn't only pass the output of layer one to layer two and so on,

147
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.250
but you would also add up the outputs of layer one two the outputs of layer to

148
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:25.610
this residual architecture help them when the image net competition in 2015 and

149
00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:28.770
deep mind repurposed it for protein structure prediction,

150
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.480
there are two resonates predicted the distances between pairs of amino acids and

151
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:37.800
the angles between the chemical bonds that connect those amino acids.

152
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.060
They use the popular gradient descent to optimization technique using a

153
00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:46.320
combination of these predicted features to optimize full protein chains

154
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:47.154
structures.

155
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.390
They input the results of their predictions into a three d modeling software

156
00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:55.350
suite called Rosetta to help visualize the resulting proteins.

157
00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.330
Rosetta is able to construct a protein structure in both Cartesian and internal

158
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:02.970
coordinate representations using these features.

159
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.470
In another method they use a generative network called a direct recurrent

160
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.540
attention writer or draw,

161
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:14.070
but it's not clear how exactly it was used so we're not going there right now.

162
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.060
I also have a great video on how gradient descent works.
By the way,

163
00:10:18.061 --> 00:10:21.390
link will be in the video description,
so that's Alpha fold.

164
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:26.420
It used this Dataset to generate new structures from a given set of amino acids

165
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.110
and we scored on its accuracy using two deep residual networks.

166
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:31.950
Dennis,

167
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.670
CEO of deep mines stated that they didn't solve the protein folding problem

168
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:37.860
entirely,
but it was a first step.

169
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.480
It's likely that the next step for them is to incorporate reinforcement learning

170
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.960
into the pipeline to help increase Alpha folds accuracy.

171
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.070
We have no idea how much computing power was used here,

172
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:55.200
but I think it's fair to say a lot like all machine learning techniques though

173
00:10:55.201 --> 00:11:00.201
it's only a matter of time before some wizard somewhere finds a way to run it on

174
00:11:00.481 --> 00:11:05.430
a fraction of a fraction of the necessary computing resources.
In fact,

175
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.780
that's the coding challenge for this week.
Replicate Alpha fold as best you can.

176
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:13.890
Post your get hub link in the comments section of this video and I'll give a

177
00:11:13.891 --> 00:11:17.370
video shout out to the top two entries two weeks from now.

178
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.680
Three things to remember from this video.

179
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:24.300
Proteins are unimportant component of every cell in the body and if we can

180
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:27.900
predict how they fold,
then we can cure many diseases.

181
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:32.190
Boost crop yields massively and enhance our own physical capabilities.

182
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.290
Deep minds Alpha fold use to residual networks to predict the distance between

183
00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:41.940
pairs of amino acids and the angles between chemical bonds that connect those

184
00:11:41.941 --> 00:11:42.900
amino acids.

185
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.610
They optimize these networks using gradient descent and input their predictions

186
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.230
into Rosetta software.

187
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.910
The visualize the resulting proteins in three ultimately placing first in the

188
00:11:53.911 --> 00:11:55.080
CASP competition.

189
00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:59.060
What kind of science experiment you and apply Ai to let me know in the comments

190
00:11:59.061 --> 00:12:02.820
section and please subscribe for more programming videos.
For now.

191
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.670
I've got to release a music video,
so thanks a lot.
