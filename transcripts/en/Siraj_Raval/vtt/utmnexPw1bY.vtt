Hello World Suraj here.

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.980
Let's talk about five reasons to build decentralized apps.

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.720
He centralized apps or apps that are peer to peer,
no central server whatsoever.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.730
They users connect to each other directly.

5
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.670
The first reason is that you would own your data.

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.160
The weapons become totally centralized.

7
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.190
That means a handful of apps on all of our data,

8
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.060
all of our texts and images and videos take whatsapp.
For example,

9
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.190
whatsapp was acquired by Facebook for $22 billion when it only had 35 engineers,

10
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.840
35 dudes on 500 million users.
Data.
Facebook didn't buy the 35 engineers.

11
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.650
They about the 500 new users data that they own and profited from profit that

12
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:41.070
those 500 million users should have gotten a little sheriff but didn't.

13
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.910
In a decentralized APP,
you would maintain ownership of your data.

14
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.870
People would pay each other for data instead of one group profiting off of all

15
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:52.860
of it.
Your data is your most valuable asset in a new data economy.

16
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.410
When robots begins to replace all Labor based jobs,

17
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.180
which are half of all current jobs.

18
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.290
The value that you provide to people that no robot can ever take from you is

19
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:03.120
your data.
Your five senses,

20
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:06.750
your unique perception of the world that you output with tweets and pictures and

21
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:10.560
videos,
you should be paid for it.
With decentralized apps,

22
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.660
you could be because you would own it.

23
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.710
We did use cryptocurrency to pay people for their data or piggy for hosting our

24
00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:21.090
own dance.
It would create a new economy where everyone is earning money online,

25
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.650
everyone every day,
just by being on the Internet.
By participating,

26
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.840
you are contributing to the data economy.

27
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.630
The second reason is increased data reliability and a centralized APP.

28
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.740
All data historical on a central server.

29
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.090
If that central server gets shut down for any reason,
that data is lost forever.

30
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.960
So if you uploaded a really precious photo to Dropbox and Dropbox got hacked,

31
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.480
which has happened before,
that thought it was gone,

32
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.550
the link to it is broken forever.

33
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.050
It's just not sustainable in a decentralized absence,

34
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.780
there is no central point of failure.
You can choose to either Sawyer,

35
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.030
Dennis cheerlead yourself or have your data replicated across many different

36
00:01:57.031 --> 00:02:00.630
clients.
It moves us towards a permanent web,
uh,

37
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:04.160
web where links never died.
Stupid for affords.

38
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.150
The third reason is faster data transfer.

39
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.250
We're moving into a new Europe data transfer soon.

40
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:12.050
We're going to be sending huge files across the way.
I'm talking petabytes.

41
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.390
Centralized absolutely allow you to retrieve data from one central server,

42
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.000
which can take forever to download restraint,

43
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.930
especially if it's across the world in a decentralized that if you want a little

44
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:26.250
website,
is that of your computer requesting it from a server across the world,

45
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.630
it'll find the nearest copy.

46
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.980
Maybe that random dude sitting next to you in chemistry has it on his laptop and

47
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:36.000
your computer would retrieve it from there directly and if multiple people have

48
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:40.290
copies of it,
your computer would request it from all of them at the same time.

49
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.180
The more peers,
the faster the download videos would load so much faster.

50
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.320
You could download games 10 times faster.
It's just better in every way.

51
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.530
The fourth reason is that it couldn't be shutdown.

52
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.640
Centralization means governments can block a website from reaching uterus in its

53
00:02:56.641 --> 00:02:58.350
country.
For whatever reason,

54
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.500
the Chinese government has easily blocked Facebook from its citizens.

55
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.740
That's 20% of the global population,

56
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.550
and recently the Egyptian government is easily shut out the internet to stop

57
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:12.130
people from protesting.
Isn't that crazy?

58
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.690
And if the data center goes down or an ISP has an outage,
you're out of luck.

59
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.530
A decentralized APP could never be shut down by anyone.
Even if a government,

60
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:22.570
Chuck's down Internet access during protests,

61
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.800
people could still communicate with each other offline in their local area

62
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:29.350
networks by connecting to each other directly.

63
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.220
The fifth reason is it's the wild west of software.

64
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.150
We've barely begun to unlock the potential of decentralized technologies like

65
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:38.500
bitcoin and bitcoin.

66
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.760
The first people to make successful decentralized apps will be remembered for

67
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:46.330
many years and will provide a huge amount of value to the world.

68
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.370

71

I really appreciate it.
As always.
Thanks George.
