1
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.840
It is 9:45 AM we are picking up another passenger on this extremely long road to

2
00:00:18.531 --> 00:00:21.420
who will Ohio.
Um,
if it gets longer by the minute,

3
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.340
there was actually a guy before you who was a passenger and we were blogging him

4
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:28.080
and then he's like,
can you guys cut the shit out?

5
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.760
So we just were quiet for 30 minutes and we didn't say anything.

6
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.040
You're wondering why are you so annoyed sir?

7
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.080
Then he ended up in an accountant office and we understood 15 minutes to get to

8
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:44.160
the shoreline amphitheater but it's very close by.

9
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:46.770
It's just the fact that the traffic is so massive.

10
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.320
That's the road you got to save for the journey.

11
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.930
Walking to Google io.
Uh,
this is mountain view,

12
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.970
California and there's a lot of traffic here by,
it's going to be good.

13
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.930
We are here at Google io.
This is huge and everything is here.

14
00:01:22.931 --> 00:01:27.930
Everybody is here.
I'm sure I'd go,

15
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:31.300
what's your name and part of what brings you to Google io?

16
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.710
I'm an android developer.

17
00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:36.070
I got to learn the latest and greatest stuff to work on.
Damn.
Stuart Fried.

18
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.180
I head up the scholarships team,

19
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.040
Udacity and it's about connecting people with opportunities they might not

20
00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:46.260
otherwise have.
Yeah.
This is my first year here at this amazing opening.
Was

21
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.460
excited about the future and what's coming soon.

22
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.090
Show mark court work on the actual actions.
Marco.
Hey,
I'm Alice.

23
00:01:57.091 --> 00:01:59.400
I also work on it and Google Assistant.
Hey,

24
00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:01.350
I'm out of all on what kind of student assessment?

25
00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:04.770
Just like the other two and one thing you're most excited about about Google io

26
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.970
this year.
Meaning all the many people,

27
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.540
many different developers along the work.
Yeah,

28
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.430
I'm excited about the developers that came from really far away that are

29
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:16.920
building totally innovative ways we hadn't thought about,

30
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:19.050
especially with the new machine learning.
Yeah.

31
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.990
Getting all the feedback from so many developers all around the world.

32
00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:24.990
So three to Excite Dr. Oh great.
Thanks.
Thanks guys.

33
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.783
<v 2>Okay.</v>

34
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.080
<v 1>Can I ask you a question about Google io?</v>

35
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.420
I can so far here.

36
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.720
<v 2>Okay.</v>

37
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.420
<v 1>But there's so many core people here from all over the world,</v>

38
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:45.420
and it says one of those places where you come and you feel,

39
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:48.920
you understand your talk,
you eat,
you watch keynote.

40
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.650
This is the place to be.
So if you want to go to a conference,

41
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.380
you got to go to w I.
L I'm having a great time here.

42
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.200
Alrighty.
Here on entering Google io is that android

43
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.353
things?

44
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.370
A lot of stuff here that,

45
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.550
there is a lot of stuff here.
These look really cool.
What are these?
Yeah,

46
00:03:35.551 --> 00:03:37.560
these are like machine learning flowers.

47
00:03:37.561 --> 00:03:42.330
If you actually look right in the camera,
the camera's x.

48
00:03:42.331 --> 00:03:46.260
You're filming your facial expression.
So if you look at it and smiles

49
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.140
for if you frown.

50
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.040
<v 3>So this is Manny,</v>

51
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.190
Manny the hand by who has bill using Andrea things,

52
00:04:04.191 --> 00:04:06.400
bass kit with a whole bunch of accessories.

53
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.910
We have used a tensor flow model to teach gestures to this guy so that it can

54
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:14.590
identify what you're actually doing.

55
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.880
<v 1>UNCANNY,

Resemblance</v>
