00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,810
Hello world,
it's Saroj and stock price prediction.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,350
How can we use AI to predict stock prices?

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,290
And this is the part of the Ai for
business series that I'm doing.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,330
And what you're seeing behind me is a
demo of using AI to predict stock prices.

5
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:17,190
So this is actually a game.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,140
What I'm doing is I'm competing against
an AI to see who can make better buys

7
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:24,360
and sells.
And this is a simulated markets.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,240
So I'm going to say I'm going to
buy some stock right here. Okay,

9
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:31,800
so you see this dark blue, um, the AI
already beat me so I can start over again.

10
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:36,801
But the idea in this simulation is that
the AI and I will both be buying and

11
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:40,680
selling stocks and we're going to
see who can make the better buy,

12
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:45,240
sell orders in this simulated environment.
So it's going to start like this.

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,970
I can speed it up,
I can slow it down and I'm going to say,

14
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:51,300
I'm going to buy a stock right here and
then notice that the stock is bought.

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,370
It's going to go up and
down and up and down.

16
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,560
I can speed up the timeline
and I'm going to say, okay,

17
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:58,200
let's wait for it to go
up. Oh, time to sell. Okay,

18
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:01,080
so I sold it there and now the
AI is doing the same thing.

19
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,770
I'm going to buy it here and then I'm
going to try to sell it higher than I

20
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:08,850
bought it, right? That's the
point. Come on. There we go.
So I made a little kind of,

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,270
well, not really some kind of profit,
but the AI is going to do the same.

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,840
We're going to see who has better.

23
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,250
So that's the AI buying right there
and it's going to learn over time.

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,620
So this is the demo that
we're going to build today.

25
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,840
It's using the linear regression model.

26
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,620
But in this video we're going to go
over several different types of AI

27
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:30,540
applications. When it comes to finance,
it's not just about stock prediction.

28
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:34,100
Ai can be used immensely
in the field of Fintech.

29
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,110
And we're going to talk about how we're
going to talk about who is doing this.

30
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,640
We're going to talk about everything. So
sit down and get ready for this. So how,

31
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:44,370
how do we start here?
What do we talk about first?

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,640
What we know that the finance industry
in general has been an early pioneer of

33
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:51,960
AI technologies since the 70s.

34
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:56,340
Wall Street has been using predictive
models to try to predict the prices of the

35
00:01:56,341 --> 00:02:00,240
market, right? How is, what trend,
what direction is the market moving in?

36
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,320
How can these hedge funds best
allocate their funds such that they are

37
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:07,890
optimizing how much money they're
earning at any given point, right?

38
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,820
There's so many different data points
out there on the web and these techniques

39
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:14,130
are very closely guarded as secrets.

40
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,950
They don't want us to know how
they're doing things, right?

41
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:20,430
That's their trade secret. Why
would they open source that? That's,

42
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,570
that's their value. That's, that's how
they make money. But to me, I don't care.

43
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:27,340
Like I'm making enough money
from Youtube ads and you know,

44
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,290
partnerships and et cetera. So I don't
care. I just want you guys to, you know,

45
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:35,040
make, make that money. So just listen up
for, you know, all the different ways.

46
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,150
I'm going to tell you how it's done.

47
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,140
So there's so many different data points
out there. Rights, there's tweets,

48
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,130
there's reddit posts, there's in
general sentiment analysis, right?

49
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,250
From news headlines from
people, consumers, businesses.

50
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,860
How are they feeling
about a specific stock?

51
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,160
So we can think of that as classification.
At the same time,

52
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,010
we can use all of the
financial Ma Metadata,

53
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,190
think of what's all those financial data
points, dividends that are being sent,

54
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,510
stock prices obviously, but p, and e,

55
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,970
all of these different little financial
metrics, these numerical data points.

56
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,860
How can we use that to perform
a regression analysis as
in time series analysis?

57
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,130
Given these numbers in the past,
what is a number in the future?

58
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,220
And if you think about it,
it's not a single variant problem.

59
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,840
It's a multivariate problem,

60
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,280
but we can graph that out in a line that's
two dimensional for us to view later

61
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:25,810
on,
and I'll talk about that as well,

62
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,010
but basically what I'm trying to say is
that there are different ways that we

63
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:33,220
can classify this problem.
It can be a classification problem,

64
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,220
it could be a regression problem there,
different models we can use.

65
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:40,360
We can use a neural network,
we can use a support vector machine,

66
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,360
we can use linear regression. So
we'll go into that later on. Um,

67
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,060
but Citibank or Citi group estimates
of the biggest banks have doubled the

68
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:53,170
number of people that they employ
to handle compliance and regulation.

69
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:56,350
And this is costs the banking
industry billions of dollars,

70
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,610
lots in loss of money.

71
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,880
So this was a very interesting survey
that I found were a bunch of banks were

72
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:03,790
asked,
uh,

73
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,930
are you considering deploying an
AI solution in the next 18 months?

74
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,900
And the majority said that
they have it on their roadmap,

75
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,560
the majority of the responses
within the next 18 months.

76
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,390
So there is an opportunity here to work
with these bigger fintech companies and

77
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:24,390
say, Hey, I know you have
this on your roadmap. I have
this great solution. Use It,

78
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,770
try it out and you won't be disappointed.
Right?

79
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:30,370
So for those of you who want to
start an AI startup in Fintech,

80
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,720
this is a great opportunity.

81
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,060
And 90% of the world's data has been
collected in the past two years.

82
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,740
Never before has this happened. So
the opportunity, the time is now.

83
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,080
If you're going to do
something now is the time.

84
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:48,760
Because we are in this renaissance of
data and there's so much of it and nobody

85
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:53,761
has any idea of how what to do with it
or about AI in general or how it works.

86
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,430
So you, if you have some interest
in both AI and in finance,

87
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,030
it's your responsibility to do
something good for people using that.

88
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,890
Make companies more profitable good
companies and give people jobs, right?

89
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:09,430
You'd be a job creator in this way.
Like what numerous is doing.

90
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:12,410
They're giving jobs to data
scientists across the world. They're,

91
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:16,420
they're putting real money into the
pockets of talented developers by

92
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:19,960
crowdsourcing their hedge fund. That's
one great idea we'll get into later.

93
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,480
But if you're a CFO of a big company,

94
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,430
your job is to figure out in what ways
AI can help increase the efficiency of

95
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:32,050
your organization. Operational accounting,
financial reporting, allocations,

96
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:35,620
adjustments, reconciliation's,
intercompany transactions. These,

97
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,760
these are just the few ways that AI
can be used to make your company more

98
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:43,510
efficient. And then in another
survey where companies were asked,

99
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:47,530
where do you expect AI to be introduced
in your organization in the next three

100
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:49,990
years?
Most said risk assessment,

101
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,170
which is a really interesting response
and we'll talk about that and it in

102
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:56,080
general.
But to really drive my point home,

103
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,470
the market for AI in finance is expected
to grow from 1.3 billion last year to

104
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:06,800
7.4 billion in 2022 that's
four years from now.

105
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,310
That's a lot. So the
market will grow. Okay, so,

106
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,720
but the problem is that there are
problems with integrating AI rights.

107
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,140
They've got these, these companies have
these legacy technology environments.

108
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,560
It's hard to upgrade. They have
the lack of skills and expertise,

109
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:22,490
the lack of budgets,

110
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,690
all of these problems that are
pain points for these companies.

111
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:30,890
They want to grow, they want to,
you know, perform fraud detection.

112
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,070
They want to optimize their budgeting,

113
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:38,420
they wants to allocate resources most
efficiently to then grow the company.

114
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:40,940
But they have all these problems.
So if you can tackle,

115
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:44,750
remember a single niche problem very,
very well,

116
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,180
then you are golden.
They will come to you.

117
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:52,181
And you will build a brand around this
as I built a brand around AI education.

118
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,900
So you've got to really pick one niche
field and just go in all the way,

119
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,980
right? So there are a lot of problems,
especially data silos, right?

120
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:05,420
So here's a little map for you to see all
the different ways that AI can be used

121
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:06,500
in the fintech market,

122
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:10,820
from credit scoring to personal finance
assistance for millennials. So there's,

123
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:13,430
there's also opportunity in
the consumer space as well.

124
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,070
Young millennials prefer or not prefer,

125
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:19,520
but they're more willing to listen
to financial advice from not a human,

126
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:21,950
but from an AI, right? A Chat Bot, hey,

127
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:24,270
I see you have this goal for
your budget to be, you know,

128
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,440
saved this much amount in this month.
Here's your bank account,

129
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:30,140
I see what you're spending,
here's how you can best spend,

130
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:33,410
here's a good budget for you. And it
can update in real time. Right? Right.

131
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:37,520
So there are there opportunities
here for consumers as well. So there,

132
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,820
there are startups in this space and
we're going to talk about them as we go.

133
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,210
But one huge use cases,
increasing security rights.

134
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:49,390
How can these companies increase the
rate of or decrease the rate of false

135
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:55,721
positive studies that are transactions
that are classified as fraudulent but

136
00:07:57,021 --> 00:08:00,800
they're not really fraudulent. They
just belong to a good person. But this,

137
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,990
the human behind the process misclassified
it and an AI can help reduce that,

138
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,210
right?
So there's,

139
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,930
I mean this causes billions in losses
for retailers and this is a real problem.

140
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,930
And remember any money you
can save these institutions,

141
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,140
they're going to throw money at you,
right? So because they are saving money,

142
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,650
save them money and then you will
make money, right? That's the,

143
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:25,520
that's the whole idea here. Save these
companies money and you will make money.

144
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,610
So, um, when it comes
to improving security,

145
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,850
mastercard implements what's
called decision intelligence.

146
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,110
So this is just one example of a
fintech company that's using AI to,

147
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,110
for security.
In this case it's fraud detection.

148
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,890
What they're doing is anomaly detection.
Obviously this is closed source,

149
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:47,230
but I'm going to guess that they're using
some deep autoencoder where they are

150
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,160
trying to detect the anomaly
in a transaction data set.

151
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,190
And that is pick the
needle in the haystack,

152
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,560
that transaction that doesn't
look like all the others.

153
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,640
And do I mean by look like in our case,

154
00:08:56,641 --> 00:09:00,050
right look like it means there are
hundreds of thousands of features. Um,

155
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,080
the time that our user Spence putting
their mouse on one specific corner of the

156
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:06,060
screen,
the amount that they purchased,

157
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:10,190
where they're purchasing from data
points we wouldn't even think about, um,

158
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,700
an AI can learn from.

159
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:15,840
So remember that the consumers
are generating a lot of
data and when it comes to

160
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:17,130
the fraudulent transactions,

161
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,150
you can use a network on neural network
or any type of model really that will

162
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,960
perform. Anomaly detection on auto
encoder is a great example of that.

163
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,100
Google or youtube auto encoders
Suraj for a great video on that.

164
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,090
Science is another, a startup
that is focusing on this. Um,

165
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,820
but they're collecting data from over
6,000 websites and then using that in

166
00:09:37,821 --> 00:09:39,200
their fraud detection solution.

167
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,450
Another great example of Ai in Fintech
is reducing processing times, right?

168
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:48,500
So one example would be receipt
like processing receipts, right?

169
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:51,500
So one startup that's focused on this,
it's called Paris script.

170
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,740
And what they're doing is
they're using OCR that is object,

171
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:59,950
optical character recognition technology
to read in receipts and create a data

172
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:03,860
set from that and easily, you know,
that's just data input, right?

173
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:07,430
It's a manual human data input that
they're replacing with automation.

174
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,120
Great use case. Another one is
obviously algorithmic trading,

175
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:13,430
which is a topic of our video today.

176
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,570
Yeah,

177
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:19,570
well we have some past data set and what
we do is we take this past dataset and

178
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:24,800
we learn from it so that we can predict
the price of certain companies stock in

179
00:10:24,801 --> 00:10:29,270
the future. And there are lots of hedge
funds that are doing this right now.

180
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,610
Obviously they're very close source
because that's their, you know,

181
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,710
that's their secret,
right?

182
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:37,790
But what we can do is we can look at
the open source hedge funds out there.

183
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,560
A newer one is new Mariah.

184
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:45,000
And what new Muray does is they have
built an open sourced hedge fund for data

185
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:49,260
scientists where you can submit a model
based on some data that they provide and

186
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,250
they will award. And the best data
scientists with some cryptocurrency,

187
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:56,400
so if your model outperforms
the others you will win.

188
00:10:56,401 --> 00:11:01,350
So that's a great way of imagining
what a good hedge fund looks like.

189
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,410
Obviously there's a lot of room
for improvement here and there,

190
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:08,610
just one company and you can definitely
make a competitor to new Muray find a

191
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:12,860
pain point that they don't really focus
on and focus on that since the and

192
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:14,280
technologies is another one.

193
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,140
What they've done is they
used AI to create a high
frequency trading bot that is

194
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:24,190
is running trillions of simulated trading
scenarios using public data so they

195
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:27,420
can squeeze 1800 days of
trading into a few minutes.

196
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:31,140
That's incredible and that's something
that only a machine, not a human could do

197
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,310
credit lending, right. If you think about

198
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,420
deciding whether or not to give
a person some insurance or alone,

199
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,620
what you are doing is you're
making a prediction, right?
Based on their past data,

200
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,010
where they're from, how much money
they make, their marital status.

201
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,060
These are features.

202
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,770
This is a perfect application for machine
learning and that's what we're just

203
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:56,860
going to to see over time. Zest.
Finance is one startup that does this,

204
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:02,250
but there's a lot of room for competition
in the space approved borrow borrowers

205
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:05,650
that other lenders are missing a,
so check out that link as well.

206
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,000
Portfolio management, right. So this
goes back to what I was talking about,

207
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:14,220
about helping millennials keep track
of their finances, right? So if you,

208
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,290
if they have a human financial advisor,
that's expensive,

209
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:21,730
but not everybody has the money for that.
So ideally that they don't need that.

210
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:24,070
They can use a machine.
The, this could be an APP,

211
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,240
this could be some kind
of chrome extension. Uh,

212
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,800
but what it does is it's a Robo advisor.

213
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,780
We could call it a Robo advisor that
will spread investments across asset

214
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:39,010
classes and financial instruments in
order to reach the user's goals. Like,

215
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:41,860
I want to save x amount in the next years.
Okay,

216
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,010
let's see how much money you have. Let's
see what fields you're interested in.

217
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,430
Let me invest in this, this, this, and
this. And then track returns over time.

218
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,700
Use those returns and learn from
them and then just keep investing.

219
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:56,260
So it's an optimized wealth experience.
Responsive dot. Ai Does this,

220
00:12:56,261 --> 00:13:00,670
but there's a lot, like I said, a lot
of room for competition in this space.

221
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,990
So I just wanted to go over a few examples
of startups that are doing this right

222
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:08,620
now. And now what we can do is we
can look at some theory, right? So,

223
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,970
so how do we do this, right? Using the
tools that we have at our availability,

224
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,600
we have the python programming language,
we have tensor flow, we have care os,

225
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,840
we have psychic learn. These are
open source machine learning models.

226
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:24,340
We have datasets available online, uh,
from Quantopian, from Google finance,

227
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:28,330
from a Kaggle. There was a bunch of
public transaction data sets online.

228
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,110
It's stock data sets online and we have
Twitter. We can scrape the Twitter. Um,

229
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,850
we can scrape Twitter, we can
scrape, read it, we can scrape a CNN,

230
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,030
a bunch of news headlines. But how
do we really learn from this? Right?

231
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:41,080
That's the real question.

232
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,870
So there's a lot of different
data points that we could use,

233
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,650
but then it comes down to do we want
this to be a regression problem or do we

234
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:49,690
want it to be a classification problem?

235
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,980
And the answer is we could do it both
ways, right? So one way to think of it as,

236
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:57,730
as a regression model where we are
only using numerical data, right?

237
00:13:57,731 --> 00:14:01,270
So the simplest way to think
about this is a multi is a,

238
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,040
is a single variable regression
problem, right? So in this image,

239
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,790
what you're seeing is aligned.
The slime called y equals mx plus B,

240
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,790
mx plus B,
which is a slope of a straight line.

241
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:17,080
And what we can do is we can say,
based on the prices alone,

242
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,720
let's try to predict the
price in the future. Great.

243
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,450
But the problem is that there
are more data points than that.

244
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:25,660
We could build a simple model like that,
but if we wanted more data points,

245
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:29,980
we would just add them in as
rose, as rose in a Dataset, right?

246
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:30,940
Not just prices,

247
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:35,941
but all these different financial
data points that would be inside of a

248
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,030
financial report, for example. So returns,
dividends, et Cetera, things like that.

249
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,980
So that's one way to think about it. Given
the past data, what's the next point?

250
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,670
Another way to think about this as, as
is as a classification problem, right?

251
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:51,650
So binary, yes, no buy or right,

252
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,400
the price will go up or it will go
down. And how do we do that? Well,

253
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:58,340
we can use numerical data as well,
but another way we could do,

254
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,660
we could think about is using
textual data. So sentiment analysis,

255
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,180
we could compile all of these tweets,

256
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:09,350
we can compile all of these right poets
and then we could say good or bad, right?

257
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:13,070
Then we can run a sentiment analysis
algorithm on all of those. Uh,

258
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,890
one great one would be a neural
network that's pretrained.

259
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,850
So we can use a pre trained neural
network that's been trained on different

260
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:21,440
types of texts,
labeled datasets.

261
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:25,100
So it knows if some Texas is
generally positive or negative,

262
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,120
some great libraries that do this,
right? How do the box are? Um,

263
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,790
um, text blob is one. Text blob is
one, but there are others as well.

264
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:39,210
But I'm going to get back to you on what
some of those good libraries are. Um,

265
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,183
there we go.

266
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,190
Nltk yes, Nltk is another great
library, but NLTK and text blob.

267
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,630
So we could think of,
think of it as regression.

268
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:56,780
We could think of it as classification.
And then you might think, well, okay,

269
00:15:56,781 --> 00:16:01,220
what if I want to combine both the
numerical data and the textual data?

270
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,430
How do I do that? Well, what
you can do is you can say, okay,

271
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,650
I'm going to compile a Dataset of, for a
given company, all of the reddit posts,

272
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,710
all of the tweets, all the blog
posts, all of the comments,

273
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,300
everything for a given date.

274
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,150
And I'm going to run sentiment
analysis on all of that.

275
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,960
And it's going to be like, yes,
no, yes, no, yes, no, you know,
good, bad, good, bad, good,

276
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,640
good dad.
And then we can say,

277
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:27,050
let's take the majority of
those sentiments and say
that the majority is going

278
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:30,500
to be the overall sentiment for that day.
So let's say the majority are good,

279
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,270
then we can just say,
well for this day,

280
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,170
the sentiment generally for
this stock is good. Yes,

281
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:37,430
no zero one.

282
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,330
So we then turn that into a numerical
data 0.01 then we could say,

283
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:44,510
here's what we already
run sentiment analysis.

284
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,540
Let's take that zero or one and add it
to our numerical data set and then we

285
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:52,070
could classify it as a regression problem,
right?

286
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:56,120
So we've already run sentiment analysis
and we can take that sentiment data

287
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,160
added as as as a row,
a single row in our numerical data set.

288
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,040
And there we go. Now we have
a regression problem, right?

289
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,200
So that's how we would do that.

290
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,690
So let's think about this.
When it comes to linear regression,

291
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,230
that's the simple equation.
Y equals mx plus B.

292
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:19,280
I've got a great video on this called
linear regression using gradient descent

293
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,940
Saroj. But anyway we can do is
if we have a single data point,

294
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:27,230
the price and the dates, we can build a
model around that, the line of best fit,

295
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,650
then we could use that line, plug in a
new date and it's going to output the uh,

296
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,890
price. And that's going to
be either higher or lower.

297
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,460
And we can buy based on that.
And now that this is very easy to do,

298
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,360
we can do this very simply using
the psychic learn library, right?

299
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:45,740
So we'll load up a data set.
This is a Dataset of Boston house prices,

300
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:48,200
but this is just for show.
Then we'll say, well,

301
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:52,260
we want a single feature from the Dataset,
which are the prices for a given date.

302
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,290
We'll split the data into
training and testing.

303
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:59,610
And once we do that in a single line,
we can build a linear regression model.

304
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,240
Once we have that model, we can then
predict the next price for the next day.

305
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,140
That's the easy way.
So, so that's one way.

306
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:09,690
Another model we could use is
the support vector machine.

307
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,920
So support vector machines,
same exact concept. We can say,

308
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:15,420
instead of doing linear regression,

309
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,300
we'll just say support vector
machine just like that.

310
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,040
And so for support vector machines,

311
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,100
we just replaced that single line of
linear regression with the word support

312
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:25,920
vector machine.
So it's the same library second learn,

313
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,620
but we replaced it with support
vector machine. So remember,

314
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:33,621
support vector machines can act as both
a regression analysis or as sentiment

315
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:35,940
analysis for classification either or.

316
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:41,040
In this case we're talking
about regression then comes
neural networks, right?

317
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:45,150
We can't have a video on stock prices
without talking about neural networks.

318
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,410
Neural networks. I've been very popular
in recent years, but it's very simple.

319
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:51,840
If you think about it,
it's the same equation right here.

320
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:55,230
What we're looking at is the
equation for a simple neural network.

321
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,660
We have some input data.
We give it to this model.

322
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:01,410
What the model does is essentially
taking every single data points,

323
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,190
multiplying it by input
times a weight matrix,

324
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,670
and then we're going to add a bias value.
That's going to be the output.

325
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,080
We apply a nonlinearity or activation
function to that and it's going to give an

326
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,600
give us an help put yes, no, right up,

327
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:19,800
down or in the case of regression it can
say what's going to be the next stock

328
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:24,420
price. So it's, it's, it's very
simple in this case as well. However,

329
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,860
when it comes to neural networks,

330
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,630
the one that has outperformed most others
when it comes to stock price analysis

331
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,470
is the LSTM network. This is the
long short term memory network.

332
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,460
So neural networks can predict
prices that are short term,

333
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:42,930
but a long short term memory network can
make predictions about sequences far in

334
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:47,200
the future. And these had been applied
to textual character recognition, um,

335
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,150
modules. They've been applied to
new numbers as well. And so that's,

336
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:52,830
that's what's really given a lot of,
um,

337
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,140
that's what's given a lot
of progress in this field.

338
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,860
What we can do is we can use the care
Ross deep learning library to do this,

339
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:02,190
which is built on tensorflow.
And here's an example of that.

340
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:05,790
We use the same psychic learn
library to load the input data,

341
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,010
and we're using tariffs
to build a simple model.

342
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,640
Now there's one more type of
learning I want to talk about.

343
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,500
And that's reinforcement learning.

344
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,530
So reinforcement learning is all
about learning from trial and error.

345
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,230
And I think that in in the,
in our case,

346
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,270
the best way to really learn from our
input data is to use reinforcement

347
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:27,270
learning combined with a
supervised learning model.

348
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:32,010
What I'm talking about is a supervised
and unsupervised learning forecast.

349
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,440
They provide a forecast that predict
future events and reinforcement learning

350
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,110
optimizes future outcomes.
There's a difference, right?

351
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:44,010
So what we can do is we can say
inside of a simulated environment,

352
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,010
let's run some markets.
But outside of that,

353
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,050
have an agent that's a learning
from multiple simulations.

354
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,340
What to do and what not to
do to reinforcement learning
is all about trial and

355
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:58,990
error. An agent in an environment,
we'll take old, make an
action, receive a reward,

356
00:20:59,050 --> 00:20:59,890
update itself,

357
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:04,240
and repeat to try to optimize for that
action to receive that reward, right?

358
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:09,241
So the best way to do this or the
easiest way is to use the open Ai Jim

359
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,630
Environment,

360
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,050
which makes making reinforcement learning
agents very simple with just a few

361
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:17,110
lines of code and what we
can do is use the siren,

362
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,450
a open AI reinforcement
learning environment.

363
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,830
This is pulling data directly from the
interactive brokers Api to create an

364
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:28,831
interface for off the shelf ml algorithms
to trade on real live financial

365
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,000
markets.
Very exciting stuff.

366
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,050
So I definitely recommend checking
that out when it comes to our demo.

367
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,840
Now it's time for our demo.
When it comes to our demo,

368
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:41,980
what we're really doing is we're just
using a simple linear regression model for

369
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:45,040
the sake of this demo, but
it's a, it's a package web app.

370
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,740
You can run it directly
from your local machine.

371
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,510
There's a web demo of it as well.

372
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:53,050
But what I really wanted to do was give
you this kind of skeleton that you can

373
00:21:53,051 --> 00:21:55,720
then just plug and play
your own model very easily.

374
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,730
You don't have to think
about other models, right?

375
00:21:57,731 --> 00:22:00,820
And you can just plug and play your
model right here and it's going to work.

376
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,550
But if we look in the
gets stock data function,

377
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:05,380
which is the really the interesting part,

378
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,560
what it's doing is it's pulling
that stock data from Quandl,

379
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,920
which is an API for um,
for financial data.

380
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,360
And it's using this API key to pull
that data. And it's right here,

381
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:19,570
I'll show it to you in a second.
But once it's pulled that data,

382
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:24,370
this is just based on past stock prices
for a given stock, right? So past prices,

383
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,160
once it's pulled that data, it's
going to format. It's right.

384
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:31,870
So adjusting price opening, Clive
price, high, low close, et cetera.

385
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,580
Once it's formatted that notice that all
it's doing is it's using psychic learn

386
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,200
to perform a simple linear
regression, right? Input
output. The input is the price.

387
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,880
The outputs is the, is a date, right? So
that's it. Well, the input is the date.

388
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,340
The output is the price.
What's the mapping? Right?

389
00:22:48,341 --> 00:22:53,080
So this is the most simple version of
a stock price prediction algorithm we

390
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:56,860
could make. But the, the
idea is the same, right?

391
00:22:56,861 --> 00:23:01,000
So if we have that input data,
whether it's one feature,
whether it's 10 features,

392
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:04,780
whether it's hundred features, we can
always put that into a simple model.

393
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:07,900
So with these libraries like carrots,
with the psychic learn,

394
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,820
we don't have to build them from scratch.

395
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,030
We don't have to think about all of
those magic numbers, the parameters,

396
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,300
all of these, you know, different
things. We can just say in a single line,

397
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,870
you know, LSTM network. If this was chaos,

398
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,210
we could say support vector machine.
If this is,

399
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,350
if this is a psych,
it learn,

400
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,320
it's always the same thing.
But this is the basic idea here.

401
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:31,840
If you compile it and run it,
it's going to look like this.

402
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,730
You can compete against an AI.

403
00:23:33,731 --> 00:23:38,110
So the AI in this case a is making
decisions based on the past.

404
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,790
These, these, these data points are all
random and you can compete with them.

405
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,200
So this is just one way to do it.

406
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,990
If you have any kind of conference or
a project or presentation coming up,

407
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,500
definitely feel free to use this web app
as a base templates to then, you know,

408
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:54,980
just plug and play inside of gets stuck
data. Yes, you could get the stock data,

409
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:56,360
you can add in more data,

410
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:59,840
like sentiment analysis from
Twitter Api from the reddit post.

411
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:04,841
And remember you just add those in as a
single feature in your excel spreadsheet

412
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:06,440
zero or one.

413
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,670
So then you can run numerical analysis
on what's essentially textual data.

414
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,770
So I hope this video was helpful to you.

415
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,250
Please subscribe for more programming
videos and for now I'm going to predict

416
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:18,350
the future.
So thanks for watching.
