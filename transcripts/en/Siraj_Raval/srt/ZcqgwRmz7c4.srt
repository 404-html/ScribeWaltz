1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,430
My parents never had much.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,720
They risk everything they had to immigrate
from India to the u s in search of a

3
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:10,710
better life and when I was born,
they loved me unconditionally.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,000
No matter what happened in my life,
I always knew that I could trust them.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,440
In fact, I first learned what it meant
to trust from my relationship with them.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,120
Trust is the foundation of
every human connection, culture,

7
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:28,620
community. In fact, our entire
civilization depends on trust.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,830
It's the ability to predict
what others will do.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,390
It governs every interaction we have
with humans. In personal relationships.

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,680
Trust means exposing your vulnerabilities
to someone and believing that they

11
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:44,370
won't take advantage of that openness.
When you first meet someone,

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,010
you can't predict where
that relationship will go,

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,730
but if you're willing to give them
your trust, you can get to know them,

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,140
their hopes and fears,

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,360
their wildest dreams in their darkest
secrets and as all that trust compounds

16
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:58,194
over time,

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,320
the benefits of closeness and intimacy
far outweigh the possibility of pain and

18
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:07,140
betrayal. Part of the human
condition is to make predictions.

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,730
We are constantly forecasting ahead by
building internal models of the world

20
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,330
based both on our experiences
and what others tell us.

21
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,270
Then use these to guess
what will happen next.

22
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,140
We trust that people will take
their responsibilities seriously,

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,980
that they'll abide by whatever
rules apply to the task at hand.

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,560
We trust teachers to educate our children,

25
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,670
chefs to serve a sanitary food
and coworkers to do their part.

26
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,410
We've collectively built systems of
trust all around us to facilitate our

27
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:41,100
interactions with each other and the
data shows that in countries where people

28
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,270
highly trust each other,

29
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,890
there also tends to be low
levels of income inequality
as well as high levels of

30
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:51,180
political and economic stability.
So how do we know who to trust?

31
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,100
A 17th century English philosopher named
Thomas Hobbs argued that in order to

32
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:59,160
maintain civil peace and
social unity in a society,

33
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,210
there needed to be some kind of sovereign
power responsible for protecting the

34
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:08,010
security of the Commonwealth and granted
absolute authority to ensure the common

35
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:10,980
defense.
He called this power the Leviathan.

36
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,920
The first Leviathan
was organized religion.

37
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,720
The idea was that if people put all their
trust in God and followed his will on

38
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,480
how to interact with others,
they behaved themselves.

39
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,150
But soon another Leviathan emerged.

40
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,560
The Nation state it offered to handle
the complexities of managing society

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,210
through the creation of laws and the
enforcement of those laws be a uniformed

42
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:38,070
police force. But now we are
witnessing the rise of a new Leviathan,

43
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,830
the network with the rise of the network.

44
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,880
Anyone in the world can communicate
with anyone else and because of that,

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,930
we also now have the ability
to trust anyone in the world.

46
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,610
Trust was once an expensive pursuits
in order to convey it. Banks,

47
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,110
elite schools and government offices
were built from luxurious materials to

48
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:02,290
declare solidity and tradition,
but the network has changed all of that.

49
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,940
Now we're prepared to place our lives
in the hands of people we know nothing

50
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:11,941
about because of the emergence of network
services that enable to strangers to

51
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:16,780
trust each other. We share rides
with Uber, stay in homes with Airbnb,

52
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,300
hire workers with upwork.
The list goes on.

53
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,220
These services have codified reputation.
They've built webs of trust.

54
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,990
The number of stars next to someone's
name makes it possible to trust them even

55
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,310
though we've never met them,

56
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,940
but these systems of trust
we've created have been abused.

57
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,930
Many governments across the world have
shown that they can't be held trustworthy.

58
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,160
The series of pro-democracy protests
across the Middle East now as the Arab

59
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:46,360
spring were hampered when
local governments cut off
the protesters Internet

60
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:50,470
access. The Chinese government routinely
sensors data from its populous,

61
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,430
which accounts for about a fifth of
the world and even in more developed

62
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:59,170
countries like the u s trust
in the federal government
is at an all time low as

63
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:01,630
income inequality continues to rise.

64
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,740
This has led to the rise of the incubator
Trump with his die hard followers

65
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:07,810
demanding he drained the swamp.

66
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,550
The corporations that have built on the
neutral playing field other web now own

67
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:16,660
most of our personal data and we've
learned that several of them have breached

68
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:20,830
our trust in many ways using personal
data and time and time again,

69
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,000
corporate banks have stolen money from
countless people and influence the

70
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:29,140
direction of entire governments with
the power we've entrusted in them.

71
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,000
The sheer size of these institutions we
built make the situation look hopeless,

72
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,110
competing with the government banking
cartel is illegal and can be severely

73
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:38,944
punished.

74
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,690
They define monetary policy and our need
to use money that depends on them has

75
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:47,050
become our straight jacket.
But a few years ago,

76
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,400
a paper was posted in a cryptography
mailing list detailing a system called

77
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,240
bitcoin that could challenge the most
powerful monopolies in the world.

78
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,250
It was the first system to show that it
was possible for two people to exchange

79
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:04,600
value over the Internet without the
need to trust a third party like a bank.

80
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,820
Bitcoin currently has a market cap of
$80 billion and has remained secure after

81
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:10,990
all these years.

82
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:16,000
Soon people started wondering what if the
underlying technology of bitcoin could

83
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:19,840
be used to remove the need for a
trusted third party. In other areas,

84
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,070
the blockchain,

85
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,420
bitcoin's data structure
and its associated proof of
work algorithm are starting

86
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:29,530
to be applied to other concepts,
insurance, law, healthcare,

87
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,610
anywhere where a risky amount of
trust is involved can be a space where

88
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:38,170
blockchain technology can improve the
system by offloading some of the trust

89
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,620
necessary from humans to machines.
For example,

90
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,970
there's a blockchain enabled microgrid
service in Brooklyn that lets individuals

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
sell their excess solar energy directly
to neighbors without involving a central

92
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:52,090
utility company.

93
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,800
We can create new organizations like
this that are distributed and autonomous

94
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,550
systems that are open trustless and
meritocratic with humans at the edges and

95
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:06,170
automation at the center. But last year
we learned something really important,

96
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,870
one of the most popular
blockchain communities,

97
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,650
etherium second only to bitcoin
in market cap. Hard for it.

98
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,300
What that means is after a hacker stole
$60 million worth of their internal

99
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:18,134
currency,

100
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,400
the community collectively made a
controversial decision to rewind the

101
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:25,970
blockchain. So the money would
go back to the original owners.

102
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,960
This shocked many people
in the wider community.

103
00:06:28,961 --> 00:06:33,380
Since one of the core character juristics
of a blockchain is it's ability to

104
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:34,550
remain immutable.

105
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,850
The hard fork proved that blockchains
are not in fact immutable and it also

106
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:44,540
proves something much more significant
that the blockchain is not in fact a

107
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,550
trustless system.
Yes,

108
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:49,700
we don't have to trust any one
party like a bank to utilize it,

109
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,470
but we do trust three parties. When
you hold cryptocurrency in your wallet,

110
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,640
you are trusting the miners to secure
the network and validate transactions,

111
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,320
the developers to maintain and improve
the code and the users to use the

112
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:06,380
platform.
So you're not trusting one party,

113
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,600
you're trusting the entire
community. Blockchains don't
offer a trustless system,

114
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,460
but rather a reassignment of trust
amongst many parties instead of one.

115
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,750
The more distributed the trustees,
the more the risk of fraud decreases.

116
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,440
So instead of building systems
that try to eliminate trust,

117
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,420
maybe we should build systems that
strengthened it. Not more trust, less,

118
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,340
but more trust fall. Imagine apps that
are run by the community that uses them.

119
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,840
That means a writer and a driver not
eating a for profit third party to help

120
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:42,950
them find and trust each other or a
consumer owning their own demographic

121
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:47,330
profile and choosing what to disclose
to service providers in exchange for

122
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:48,350
economic value.

123
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,730
So wild trust is necessary in every
interaction we have with humans.

124
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,470
There are many cases where minimizing it
is beneficial and we can use blockchain

125
00:07:57,471 --> 00:08:01,400
technology to do that,
but the need to trust won't go away.

126
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,600
And that's okay.

127
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,190
We can't escape human reliance as
fallible and imperfect as we are.

128
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,120
There will always be some risk involved
in our interaction with humans.

129
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,000
And the higher the risk,
the higher the reward.

130
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:18,890
As we build better systems that nurture
and nourish trust will be able to extend

131
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:23,630
our capabilities in every
way by augmenting our
intelligence with the power of

132
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:26,420
the web becoming ever more
connected with each other.

133
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,320
And when I think back to the dreams
my dad had from me as a child,

134
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,640
or the ones that all that eager young
developers I've met have for success,

135
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,300
or the ones I have in my
most intimate relationships,

136
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,250
I realized that trust can be the bridge
between where we are now and where we

137
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:45,200
all want to be home.

138
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,363
Okay.

139
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,900
Hey guys,
hope you liked the video.

140
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,170
The winter of last week's coding
challenge is Zacharias Bowler.

141
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,700
Saccharides created a decentralized
machine learning journal using IPFS.

142
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,520
So awesome. I've already
bookmarked this for my own use.

143
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,990
He's got some great documentation too, so
definitely check it out. Very well done.

144
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,080
And the runner up is a new guitar who
created a decentralized Dropbox on IPFS.

145
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,230
Very ambitious.
