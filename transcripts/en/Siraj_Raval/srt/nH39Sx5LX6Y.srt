1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,470
Hey Stephen, how's it going?
And so I'm just not bad.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,060
Do you mind if I ask you 67 questions?
Sure. All right, let's do this.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,810
What is the culture like at salesforce?
How the culture is great.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,340
It's a real emphasis on research and uh,
really I guess advancing Ai.

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,100
What excites you the most
about machine learning?

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:19,460
Thinking.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,740
So the capability for people to do stuff
that no one had really been able to do

8
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:25,750
before that,
like an entire workforce of people.

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,550
Okay.
Do you miss about where you grew up?

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,300
Okay. One thing about
Australia is eucalyptus leaves.

11
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,500
They are beautiful and they smell so nice.
Eucalyptus trees everywhere.

12
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:40,130
And Luckily we have a few of them in
California. What time do you wake up?

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,280
I wake up, uh, oh gosh. More like 10:00 AM

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,520
it was one of the most stressful but a
truly pleasurable experiences in my life.

15
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:52,510
I loved so much.

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,783
What website?

17
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,140
I would have to say Twitter is
my main vice. And also verse year

18
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,770
favorite machine learning

19
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,140
mixture of soft maxes.

20
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,810
One person. Who would it be? Uh,

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,620
Shannon from entropy.

22
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,570
Your last AI started Gacaca wired by
salesforce. How did you celebrate?

23
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,670
The whole team went out and had drinks
and one of the nearby bars so we're

24
00:01:30,671 --> 00:01:34,910
pretty tight. So a normal, what's it
like doing research as a full time job?

25
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,680
As a full time job?

26
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:39,650
It's amazing cause you actually get to
hurt it on the exact problem that you're

27
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:42,080
interested in and just stay
there and keep working at it.

28
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,010
Bravest thing you've ever done.
Um Ooh.

29
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,040
Probably move to the u s but
away from friends and family.

30
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,310
What is one thing that scares you?
I would say heights.

31
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,230
Honestly. This is something that I don't
think I'm ever going to be able to work.

32
00:02:00,231 --> 00:02:04,640
Poss favorite movie
inception.

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,910
Do you play any instruments? Uh, yeah.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,710
I'll actually play piano and Trump burn
and get tall. What's more interesting?

35
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,630
Neuro Science. Physics early
because we can understand that

36
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,540
better at the moment.
That's present you've ever received.

37
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,750
When I was like I think nine or 10.

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,250
My parents actually gave me a computer
but they sat it in the middle of the

39
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,770
carto and I didn't even realize
it until I go to the room.

40
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,790
What is something you do to relax?
Uh,

41
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,820
best thing is usually television
shows or movies with friends.

42
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,210
What is something surprising about you?

43
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,000
I am probably one of the pickiest eaters
you'll ever meet and chicken nuggets

44
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:48,280
and frozen coker are basically my life.

45
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,170
You prefer cats or dogs?
Horses.

46
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,190
What's the machine learning model
that doesn't get enough attention?

47
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,920
I think studying,

48
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,070
I think starting um,

49
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,520
with like the simplest baseline
models is the best way to go. Sir.

50
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:12,820
Just stick with multilayer
perceptron for the starting point,

51
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,190
what's your favorite

52
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,900
operating system? I got to say
Linux. Do you play any sports?

53
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,800
Not really. No. Most adventurous
thing you've ever done.

54
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,860
I'm a multiday hike through
the Australian outback

55
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,450
source. Do you use to stay up
to date and machine learning

56
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,000
please? Twitter again, like the people you
find there was this amazing programming

57
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,410
of choice for machines.
Hyphen. Favorite professor

58
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,400
did James, Karen from the
University of Sydney, Australia.

59
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,660
Why do you think programming is fun?
I think programming,

60
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,550
it enables you to do some completely
and utterly a tremendous things. Again,

61
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:56,660
you'd never be able to do yourself.

62
00:03:56,661 --> 00:04:00,020
You can control a machine that can
run billions of calculations a second.

63
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,720
What's the most amazing thing

64
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,420
society? Because I don't see where the
end point is for it. Favorite? Yeah.

65
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,740
Chicken nuggets. Name one
person. You really admire?

66
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,510
One of my curve. Uh, my um,
colleagues. James Bradbury.

67
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,400
What was your first program?
Oh, sorry. First program.

68
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,840
It was a hello world app that literally
just read in my name and then spell it

69
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:29,674
out back at me.

70
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,910
Didn't you talk to on the phone?

71
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,470
Um, Brad and from, and video.

72
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,210
Where do you go
back home to Australia.

73
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,660
Would you live on Mars?
What is one thing you can't live without?

74
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,860
Unfortunately my laptop.
What is one skill you wish you had?

75
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,870
I honestly don't know.
What is the last thing you do before bed?

76
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:04,531
Okay,

77
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:09,531
so I actually play the same set of four
songs from a soundtrack every night from

78
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,870
Ender's game.
What texts editor do you use of them?

79
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,700
What open source library you
really high torch is beautiful.

80
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,890
What was the hard problem you recently,

81
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,630
so most recently, um, language modeling.

82
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,690
What's the meaning of life,
friends, family, and um,

83
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,100
I guess science.
Who is one offered you really like,

84
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,130
I love, um, Isaac Asimov. What
is one thing that excites me?

85
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,560
[inaudible] we're

86
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,480
getting back into space. Best
advice you've ever received. Um,

87
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,460
just go for it. Even if you have
no clue what you're actually doing.

88
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,980
What is one piece of you'd give yourself

89
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,813
10 years

90
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,240
less worried about making mistakes.

91
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,880
You spend more time on the
internet or real life and to not.

92
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,420
Well and truly do you spend,
do you have any pets?

93
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,790
Yes. If you count my
parents or it's three dogs,

94
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,470
one cat and three horses.

95
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,770
What's something you've
learned in the past month?

96
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,210
Difficult audio is in terms of actually
processing it with deep learning.

97
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,450
Do you like spicy food? No, not at all.

98
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,850
What is a movie that made you
cry? Uh, up the beginning of,

99
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,500
if you ran the world,
what is one live you'd enact in?

100
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:44,740
Oh, I'm going to try and stay away
from being too controversial. Um, a,

101
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,780
a very soft universal income.

102
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,340
Is the singularity near not
near enough to worry about yet.

103
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,500
Who is one person you looked up
to when you went to college? Um,

104
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,940
John.
Jonathan Comma fells.

105
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,760
Her basically taught me a good chunk
of the programming. I know her.

106
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,460
What deep learning library I touch.

107
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,090
If you were to start from scratch today,

108
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,180
what is a learning resource you
would use to learn machine learning?

109
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,680
Uh, foster AI by Jeremy
Howard and Rachel Thomas.

110
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,870
What is one goal you have in the
next 10 years and the next 10 years?

111
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,890
I want us to be able to compose an
entire orchestra without having to think

112
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:29,630
about it. Favorite subject in
school when you were growing up? Oh,

113
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,583
a Latin.

114
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,870
If you could be a superhero,
who would it be?

115
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,350
Something to be said about iron man
for the fact that he had to develop

116
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:41,610
everything himself.
What's your spirit and Oh,

117
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,760
probably slough.
I'm kind of lazy.

118
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,100
What do you predict comes next
after the deep learning height?

119
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,060
Hopefully the deep blending her
a hype doesn't die down. But, um,

120
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:58,310
I think everything connected devices,
bitcoin or ethereum. Ethereum.

121
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,380
Did you delete your Facebook?
Nope. Google home or Amazon? Alexa,

122
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,000
neither.

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,350
I don't want anything listening to me.

124
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,220
You prefer supervised or
unsupervised learning? Unsupervised.

125
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,020
Favorite conference you've ever been to?
Uh,

126
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,410
probably nips last year.
Awesome. Steven. Well,

127
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:21,680
thanks for answering those questions.
Thanks man. All right. Have a good one.
