1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,410
Let's see,
am I live?

2
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:09,390
Is the question.
Okay.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,620
I just want to start off by giving a
quick shout out to my friends. Oh, on,

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:18,400
on Youtube. She makes some cool fashion
and illustration educational videos.

5
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:22,470
So check her out and link to her will
be in the description. Anyway. Hello,

6
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:23,030
we're all,

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:28,030
it's Siraj let me mute that
and it's good to see you guys.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,180
Glad to be back back in black.
Not really black,

9
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:36,600
but this is kind of like a shiny, if
that's the color, it's not, anyway,

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,830
I'm in this new space so that I'm, I'm
happy about that. That's my picture.

11
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:43,230
I just took her myself
and I'm just kidding.

12
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:45,540
That's just something that's
been there. Uh, but yeah,

13
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,450
I mean this is like virtual reality
space right now. I've just moved into,

14
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:49,950
so there's going to be a lot of cool,

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,050
crazy videos that I'm going to make with
mixed reality soon. So get hyped. Uh,

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,470
let me,

17
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,470
let me refresh this page so I can see
your comments because right now it's

18
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:05,070
loading and I don't like loading. I don't
like loading. I want to see, there we go.

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,330
Okay. So now we've got some
people. Okay. Wow. Hi Guys. Wow.

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,260
Everybody's in the room right
now. We've got 79 people. Um,

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,880
so I'm going to start off this. It's
1:00 AM in India. Okay. Sorry guys,

22
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:22,110
about this timing. Well, not next time.

23
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:23,580
We're going to do it in an hour earlier.

24
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,480
So for everybody in India and do an hour
earlier, okay, next time. Anyway, so, uh,

25
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,780
hi guys.
Uh,

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,350
let's do a five minute Q and a and then
I'm going to explain the concepts and

27
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:37,080
then I'm going to, uh, we're
going to code this thing.

28
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,810
And so what we're going
to code this time is it,

29
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,650
it's a python script that's going to
pull 20 of the most popular words from a

30
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:47,580
Wikipedia article and then it's going
to display the frequency count of all of

31
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:50,880
those works. And this is going to be
useful. And I'm going to talk about this.

32
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,820
Why are we going to do this in a second?
But first of all, five minute Q and a.

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,800
Here we go. Uh, hi Sudarshan.

34
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,780
Thanks Ted to Haas. Um, and Josh,

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,140
this session is going to take 45 minutes.
Um,

36
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,120
if you want to do a masters
in CS program at, uh,

37
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:11,120
at Columbia or any school,
uh,

38
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,360
the rec prerequisites would do a
computer science undergrad degree,

39
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,720
um,
cafe or tensorflow.

40
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,620
We want to use tensorflow because cafe,
uh,

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,340
I actually have video on this called deep
learning frameworks explained to check

42
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:30,540
that out. All right. Uh, hey everybody.

43
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,860
Where do I do my hair? I, uh,

44
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:39,720
so there's a sky who, uh, he also
does, uh, Travis colonics hair.

45
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,320
Who's the Uber Ceo? I didn't know that. I
just went through this so long. Like, Yo,

46
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:46,060
what's good? And then he's like cutting
and he's like, oh, I do. Travis is,

47
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,310
I was like, oh my God, I need to keep
you, cause that's awesome. So that,

48
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:53,400
that's the guy, his name is
Antony. Anyway, okay. So, um,

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,130
can I build my own neural network
from scratch and dependencies?

50
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,260
I'm going to do that in a later video.
Um,

51
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,600
if you want to do a master's
in deep learning at Montreal,

52
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,870
you should totally do that because that
place is becoming a super cluster for

53
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:06,220
machine learning research.
Okay.

54
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:10,650
You've got Yoshua Bengio over there and
that guy's a g a bunch of cool stuff. Um,

55
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,550
anyway, are you going to use
beautiful soup? Yes, I akuno.

56
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,003
Um,

57
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:20,550
okay.

58
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,600
How difficult is it to get
into a Master's program? Uh,

59
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,250
well it depends on the school.
For the one in Montreal,

60
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:30,250
I would say it's going to be pretty,
pretty difficult. Yeah. I mean it's, it's,

61
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,370
it's going to be world class,
so the harder, I mean, the, the,

62
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,590
the better the quality, the harder
it's going to be too sick to get in.

63
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,420
What's my favorite APP in
machine learning? Um, wow. Uh,

64
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,700
probably just chatbots in general.

65
00:03:44,701 --> 00:03:47,580
Like I want to see better and
better a more human like chatbots.

66
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,840
I'm really excited for that.

67
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,350
Got Any tips for getting into
deep learning research? Um,

68
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:58,070
I would try to find a paper that you
find to be interesting and replicate the

69
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:02,340
results to find the source code and
then replicate the results maybe in a

70
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:06,540
different deep learning library or your
own virgin. But if you can do that, uh,

71
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,050
that would be a great demo coat to
show a professor and say, hey look,

72
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:14,520
I replicated this code. I can do this
stuff. And you know, a lot of the times,

73
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,580
enthusiasm plus a resume on get up,
it's enough to get it.

74
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,720
Is it wise to go in deep and deep learning
with very minimum machine learning

75
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:24,590
experience? Uh, yeah, because I mean,

76
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,200
machine learning is just a
bunch of statistical methods
of predicting the future

77
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,400
using existing data.

78
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,480
Deep learning is taking
what's existed since the 50s.

79
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,510
A neural network that's been around and
applying it to huge datasets and lots of

80
00:04:38,521 --> 00:04:40,590
computing power.
And guess what?

81
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,120
Deep neural nets outperform almost every
single machine learning model almost

82
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:49,830
all the time. So you don't even need
to really think about other things.

83
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:53,730
If you can do other types of ml models,
if you can do deep known as well,

84
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,050
can you suggest any tutorial from machine
learning? Noobs I would say my channel,

85
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,420
my channel is the best stuff out there.
Download the code,

86
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,320
make sure to download the code associated
with each video and run it locally.

87
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,490
Okay. Um, any videos on
Basie and approaches?

88
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,430
I actually do have one on that is,
it's called one shot learning. Um,

89
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,740
okay.

90
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,960
What do you think would be a good
approach for doing sentiment analysis for

91
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:20,010
plagiarism? Uh, sentiment
analysis for plagiarism. Uh,

92
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:23,160
I don't think that's actually sentiment
analysis. That's, that's like, um,

93
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,160
that's like Red Cross reference
checking. There's, there's,

94
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,230
there's an API for that actually, like
just a Google plagiarism. All right,

95
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,150
one more question before we get started.

96
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,643
MMM.

97
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,150
What is the most impact a chat bot has
created to date to the best of your

98
00:05:41,151 --> 00:05:43,850
knowledge?
Uh hmm.

99
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,600
I think that the best one so far has
been the most impactful chatbots so far.

100
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,660
I mean, aside from Siri and Google now,
uh, probably like, uh, in terms uses,

101
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,810
like in terms of people using it,
probably like sports,

102
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,830
even though I'm not a sports fan,

103
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:04,700
like sports chatbots because it
gives you the game game time score.

104
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,920
People who don't do this,
like, look at chatbots.

105
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,580
I've been using this stuff anyway. Uh, so
that's had the most impact. Anyway, so,

106
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:17,170
okay, so that was it for the Q and a.
Now we're going to get started. One more.

107
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:21,670
Actually, one more. What if I'm 16?
If you're 16, you're at a perfect day.

108
00:06:21,671 --> 00:06:25,060
Should get started with this stuff.
Don't hesitate. Don't wait, get started.

109
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:27,550
You're going to be awesome by the
time you're 21 plus. Okay. Anyway,

110
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,570
so now we're going to get started.

111
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:33,370
What we're going to do in this video
is we're going to write a 50 ish line

112
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:37,690
script in python and that's going to
get 20 of the most popular words from a

113
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:40,450
Wikipedia article that we,
that we choose.

114
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,040
And it's going to list the frequency of
those words in terminal a in terms of

115
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:49,120
word count. All right? So
that's what we're going to do.

116
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,600
And uh, it's going to, uh,

117
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,920
the 50th words. And, uh, the
reason we won't, we won't,

118
00:06:56,921 --> 00:07:00,490
we even would want to do this is
because recommender systems, uh,

119
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,570
could highly benefit from this.
We could have a recommender systems that,

120
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,630
you know, if you have a user who like
lights, you know, that meant, for example,

121
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:11,980
we can then query Wikipedia yet the top
20 words in the Batman article and then

122
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:15,170
show the users suggested things that
they would like because, you know,

123
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,040
it's related to Batman. We
could build chatbots, right?

124
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:21,340
So if a user says something to Chat
Bot could then pour your Wikipedia,

125
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,940
get 20 related words, what
the is feeling, and then, uh,

126
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,750
use those to create an intent of what the
next thing the chat Bot is going to do.

127
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,080
Um, could do sentiment analysis.
We could do data visualization, uh,

128
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,830
we can do market research.
There's a lot of possibilities.

129
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,020
But the basic fundamental step here that
I'm trying to teach in this video is

130
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,230
how to scrape data from the web.
Okay. That's what we're trying to,

131
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,670
we're trying to scrape data from the web.
And to do that efficiently in python,

132
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,590
uh, is going to be a relatively easy,
and we're going to get started. Okay.

133
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,180
So here we go. I'm going to start
to coding now. So let's see.

134
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,420
Screensharing time desktop.

135
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,240
Start the screen share.
All right.

136
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,400
Boom. And let me show myself. All right.

137
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:17,900
So here we go. With this. Hold on.

138
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,450
I gotta make sure that I'm visible.

139
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:25,340
I'm visible because I liked being visible.
Unless her,

140
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:28,340
my ex girlfriend who I just broke up with.
Oh,

141
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,110
I don't want to be miserable to her
anyway because I don't have time for that.

142
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:35,870
I have to do this. Okay, here we go.

143
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,450
Here we go. Hold up. Move
out of the way. Okay.

144
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,750
Okay, so now, so here's what, here we go.

145
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:50,270
So the first thing we're gonna do is
we're going to import our dependencies,

146
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,880
right?
So let's import our dependencies

147
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,580
and then we're going to, uh,
uh, writer script, right?

148
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:04,810
So let's import our dependencies. Uh, the,
so the first thing we're going to do is,

149
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:08,080
let me make sure this is a,
you guys can see this, right?

150
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:11,170
Like this is a good visible code.

151
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,910
Like this decides this is good,
right? Let me know. So, um,

152
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,420
okay.

153
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,010
The first dependency we're going to
import is a beautiful suit, right?

154
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:25,340
Beautiful suit is going to let us,
uh,

155
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,890
it's going to pull data out
of html and it's going to,

156
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,970
uh, it's going to an XML and so
we can, we can parse it later.

157
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:36,710
So when we pull the data from Wikipedia,

158
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,050
it's going to be html and we
want to parse it properly.

159
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:42,020
So that's what beautiful soup is.
Gonna help. It's gonna help us do that.

160
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,621
The next one,

161
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:46,160
we're going to import this called requests
request gets over 7 million downloads

162
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:49,980
a month. It is like the
Python Library for, uh,

163
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,610
dealing with the wet, like pulling data
from the web, pushing it to the web.

164
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,250
Next we're going to import re,

165
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:58,220
which is going to help us
perform regular expressions.

166
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,420
Regular expressions are they
describe a search pattern.

167
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:04,250
So if anything we want to do to a word,

168
00:10:04,251 --> 00:10:07,280
like remove the second a
character of a word every time,

169
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:10,100
or add a period at the
end or remove a space,

170
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,050
that's what regular
expressions help us do.

171
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,110
I'm going to make this code available
later, so don't even worry about it.

172
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,840
All right,
so now we're going to import the operator.

173
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,550
A module operator is basically a wrapper
around functions that already exist in

174
00:10:22,551 --> 00:10:25,420
python, like addition,
subtraction. We're going to,

175
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,900
that's what offered is
going to help us do.

176
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,250
It's just a more readable way of doing
these things for the sake of pretty

177
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:31,084
supportive.

178
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,150
Now we're gonna import dates on which
is going to help us hearts are Jason,

179
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,390
which is what we're going to retreat
from the web. It's going to be Jason.

180
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,440
She's a format for pulling
data from the web. Okay? Uh,

181
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,750
and now we're going to import tabulate.

182
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:50,170
So what is tabulary calculates
is it only has one function.

183
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,060
That's it.
That's the only thing this library does.

184
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,650
Tabulate is going to take a list of lists
and it's going to create a nice pretty

185
00:10:57,651 --> 00:11:00,890
table in terminal. Where are we going
to display all of our words? Okay,

186
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,730
so that's what tabulate
does. Thanks guys. Uh,

187
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,530
and so now we're going to import six.
We're just going to let us make sense.

188
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,920
Some calls, uh, which, uh,

189
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,620
specifically in this is going
to let us get the user input,

190
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:16,770
which is the user input is going to be
what's the Wikipedia article that we want

191
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:20,010
to get data from? Right?
Okay. So that's just, uh,

192
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,720
and now we're going to import the last
library is called stop words. Well,

193
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:29,640
what are stop ports?
Stop words are words that don't matter.

194
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:31,290
And natural language processing.

195
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,640
We always want to remove our stock boards
before we perform anything on our data,

196
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:37,830
whether it's machine learning or you know,
cleaning,

197
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,330
whatever stop words are words like Duh.
And to act and stop words.

198
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,290
This libraries. Now let us remove all this
software. It's at once. Okay, so that,

199
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,730
those are our dependencies.

200
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,020
Let's go ahead and get started with
getting our data from Wikipedia. Okay?

201
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,240
So the first step we want to do is say a
quick are linked to though we could pee

202
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:57,790
at Apr,
right?

203
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,040
So here's our thing and it's
going to be his variable.

204
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,540
And I'm going to paste in the link right
here cause I already have the link.

205
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,030
Um, okay so here it is. So let's
go over to this link for a second.

206
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,200
So wikipedia.work,
s w slash API or a PHP,

207
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:21,010
that's going to let us access the API.
The format is going to be Jason.

208
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:23,230
So that's the first parameter.
Um,

209
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,020
the next is the action is
going to be called query.

210
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:28,720
Because we are querying
that data from the web.

211
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,110
The list type is going to be search.
What does that mean?

212
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:34,540
That means that whenever we
type in a word like that, men,

213
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,860
it's going to search for all the Wikipedia
articles related to Batman and it's

214
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:43,330
going to listen. And then the last
parameter is going to be sr search,

215
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,830
which is what we're going to add.
We're going to,

216
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,350
that's going to be the
name of our article,

217
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:51,310
which we're going to add to this string
later. Okay? So that's the string. Okay.

218
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,130
So it's going to be a little long.
So it's going to go over the page.

219
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:57,220
If you want to see it again, just let
me know. Okay, so that's a string.

220
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,000
Let's make one more link,
a Wikipedia link.

221
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,210
So this is just the link to the Wikipedia
page. Why do we need to as well?

222
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:08,830
I'm going to explain that in a second, but
right now, let's just type this in. Uh,

223
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,110
in.wikipedia.org/wiki. All
right, so those are our links.

224
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,370
Uh, and now, uh, yeah, let me put the
URL in the chat. That's a great idea.

225
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,190
Let me just, you're watching this later.
If it's recorded on any new or about it,

226
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,670
just to me through seconds. Boom.
There we go. Okay, so let's, okay,

227
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:30,550
so that's the data from Wikipedia.
Oh, so those are our URLs.

228
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,180
So now let's get the user
inputs. So let's say, um,

229
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,460
at the length of the user inputs,
uh,

230
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,280
is going to be small,
then go ahead and print,

231
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,710
enter a valid strength because
you're not, you're, you haven't,

232
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,250
you haven't typed in a valid string.
And then we're going to exit the program.

233
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:55,060
So this is an error. So if a search word
is too small, throwing an error. Okay.

234
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,480
And the next thing we're going to do
is get to search for it. All right?

235
00:13:58,481 --> 00:13:59,980
So what does a search word,

236
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:03,770
so the user typed in
inter-terminal what type of uh,

237
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,490
what type of article they
want to search for it.

238
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:10,150
So we're going to store that into the
string query variable and we're going to

239
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:13,690
retrieve that using the [inaudible]
function and are the six modules,

240
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:18,110
r and d function as the first
parameter, okay? And now we,

241
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,060
we also want to say, by the way, this is
what this is going to look like, right?

242
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,400
So W so whenever we type in,
you know,

243
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,690
whenever we run this gonna look like
this python made up by the name of the

244
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:31,660
article and then yes or no.
Okay? What does that mean?

245
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,340
I mean this is going to pull all the
top 20 words from the Batman article and

246
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:39,970
yet, or no, just means do we want to
remove the stop words or not? Okay?

247
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:42,250
That's what it's gonna look like.
And we want to say yes.

248
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:47,310
So we want to say if the length of the
second argument is greater than two,

249
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,630
then yes,

250
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,910
we want to set the search mode true.

251
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:58,550
Which means remove stop words.
Oh, and this needs to be at
the capitol. Right? Okay.

252
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:03,470
So next thing is else.
Uh,

253
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,950
why don't I apply for a job at Google?
I mean like, I'll think about it,

254
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:10,990
but like I'm not leaving you guys. I know
I've built something to awesome. Fair.

255
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:13,820
It should leave you guys. Okay. So, um,

256
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:16,670
so this is going to remove the stop
words if we, if we want to. All right?

257
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:20,300
So let's go ahead and create
our URL. A Url, right?

258
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:22,070
So you were all at this point to hold on

259
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,440
URL out of the way.

260
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,510
Okay. So, um, why are there
so many Indians here? Well,

261
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:37,511
because Indians are really into
technology and Indians and up and coming

262
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:39,050
country. Okay. So here we go.

263
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Wikipedia Api link plus spring query.

264
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,370
What did I just do?
Well,

265
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,550
we took our spring query and we added
it to the end of that link that I just

266
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:52,610
sent you, right? Add it to the
end of search. So we've basically,

267
00:15:52,611 --> 00:15:56,960
the computer science terminology is
contaminated. You can catenate it a strip.

268
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,880
Okay, so we clear your up. All right,
we're ready to search for Batman. Okay.

269
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:06,290
We have our URL and how do we want
to make this? Um, and you know,

270
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:10,250
Bronx was awesome to New York City is
awesome. I want to spoil that. Okay.

271
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:13,640
So how do we want to make our reflects
what we want to create what's called the

272
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:16,580
try block and try and accept block.
Why?

273
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,540
Because in a tribe except blocked off,
you try something and if it doesn't work,

274
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,440
you make an exception.

275
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,560
And guess what happens whenever
you deal with the web exceptions,

276
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,420
you want to handle exceptions, right? That
you are, did you type in the wrong URL?

277
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,960
And this is a server down is
your [inaudible] provider APP.

278
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,610
Did you not pay your monthly bill?
All this stuff, it doesn't work.

279
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,570
So anyway, if anybody's late,
don't even worry about it.

280
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,300
All the code is still here. Okay? You
can see it all from the beginning.

281
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,540
So now let's go ahead and write out our,

282
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,420
uh, response. We're going to
make our query now, right?

283
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:57,890
So we're gonna use a request
library to get the Url. Okay?

284
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,870
So that's in a store,
that data in there,

285
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,610
it's going to store our article in the um,
response variable.

286
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:10,150
And now we're going to use
the Jason module to load
the data from that response.

287
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,870
And we're going to decode it because
guess what? It's not in the right format.

288
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:19,010
And how do we do that? We say UTF UTF
eight, which is the format that we want.

289
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,120
Okay? So now are uh, stuffed
is in this data article.

290
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,250
Um, I'm going to add the
rec rejects in a second.

291
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,360
So now we want to format this data,
right? We want to format the data.

292
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,930
Me just removed it. It's like get out
of the way. Here we go. Um, all right,

293
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:40,260
so now let's, let's format
the data. And by the way,

294
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:44,700
guys at the youtube space
in La was awesome. That was
an incredible experience.

295
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:48,900
I feel so inspired to, to teach you guys
a lot of stuff in to core cool videos.

296
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,250
Okay, so we're going to format this
data, uh, using good Jason Module.

297
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,390
And we want to get that.
Um,

298
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,910
wait, wait, hold on a second. Uh, Jason
Dot. Loads responded content. Actually,

299
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,020
I, I just think that, what am I doing?
I didn't, anyway. Anyway, anyway, uh,

300
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:15,021
so now we're going to
say Wikipedia page tag.

301
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:19,080
Uh, and we want to say, let me, let me,

302
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,990
let me just write this and
then I'm going to query,

303
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,920
this is a little search and that's going
to be here and I'm actually going to

304
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:29,850
show you guys what this looks like
in the browser. Okay. In the browser.

305
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,240
What are we doing here?
Well,

306
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,990
we want to get that Wikipedia
page tag and then we're going to,

307
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:42,540
we're going to create our
new URL with that. Okay,

308
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,110
so it's going to be URL
equals Wikipedia length.

309
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:49,800
That was the one that we just made
plots the Wikipedia page tag. Okay.

310
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:51,600
So let me show you guys
exactly what I mean by this.

311
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,330
Let's take this link that I showed you.
Okay.

312
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,650
And let's run this in
our, our browser. Okay.

313
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,480
So let me just move this down here.
Boom.

314
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,580
If someone told me how many people are
viewing cause I can't even see because

315
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:08,970
it's like froze or something. So what
happens here? I'm going to take that,

316
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:11,610
I'm going to add, let's say that man
to the, what does that look like?

317
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,780
Okay,
this is just,

318
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:21,280
it's going to show all the articles that
are related to Batman. Um, one 80. Okay,

319
00:19:21,281 --> 00:19:24,130
cool. This is going to show all
the articles related to Batman.

320
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,350
It doesn't actually
show the Batman article,

321
00:19:26,351 --> 00:19:28,030
it just shows all the
articles related to that.

322
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,990
We're going to pick the first one from
this, like see it like lists of Batman,

323
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:36,520
comics, adventures of DC come, you know,
all of these are possible articles. Well,

324
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:39,400
we're going to take the first one,
which is going to be Batman himself.

325
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,650
And that's the article that
we're going to retreat.

326
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:46,050
So this first link doesn't
actually retrieve, um,

327
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,510
the, the stuff that we
need, right? It, it just,

328
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,340
it retreats the list of possible articles.
I should use the Jason, your plug in.

329
00:19:54,341 --> 00:19:59,080
I have that in chrome. Um,
so anyway, okay. So, so we,

330
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,190
and so that's what this does.

331
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,490
This is what the Wikipedia
page tag variable stored.

332
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,670
It's going to store that first link and
then we're going to create our new URL

333
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:10,150
to that Wikipedia page and we're
going to pull the data from that.

334
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,920
So this URL is going to contain all of our
stuff. Okay. All this, all of our words,

335
00:20:14,921 --> 00:20:18,520
all of our paragraphs, everything.
Okay. So that's are you around? Um,

336
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,710
I'm using safari because like, I
mean, you know, hangouts as crazy.

337
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,640
It sometimes works on chrome sent
him 2000. You never know. Okay.

338
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,300
So here we go. So it career, new euro.

339
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,650
And now I want to get the
list of words from that page.

340
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:37,030
So page word list equals get word lists.

341
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,090
You are at,
I haven't written this,

342
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,860
so that's going to get the
list of words on the page.

343
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,880
I haven't written this method yet. And
guess what? Whenever I write python, um,

344
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,080
I don't, uh, right. My helper methods,

345
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,160
helper functions first I write
them out as if they already exist.

346
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,740
Then I go back and I write those helper
functions. Okay. And that I think that,

347
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,240
and I think that is a,

348
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,900
that is great programming practice in
general to just assume what you want your

349
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:09,160
function to look like. And then,
right. Okay, so get word list.

350
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,820
Okay.

351
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,610
Url. All right. And so
now we have a word list.

352
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,660
Now we want to create a table
of word counts of word counts.

353
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:25,420
All right. Have I met M and? M? No.
Okay, I'd love to do those. Okay,

354
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:28,120
so now create table of word counts.
A page,

355
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,040
word counts equals
creates a frequency table,

356
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:38,200
page, word, what? Step variable. We
just did. So create frequency table.

357
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:40,930
Another, um, another, uh,

358
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,113
okay.

359
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,880
Function that I haven't
written yet, but I will. Okay,

360
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:48,490
so that's going to create a
frequency table of words. Okay.

361
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,320
So now we've created a table.

362
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:55,350
Now we want to sort these words
right now we want to sort sort,

363
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:00,550
sort of sorted, so we're gonna sweat sore
that can be sorted. Word frequency list.

364
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:04,420
And we're going to use a
sorted function of python.

365
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:09,370
It's a default function to sort this
to say page word count dot items.

366
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,680
We're going to get all those
items to the page where,

367
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,270
and then we want to get the key.
The key is going to be the operator,

368
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,690
the item getter. So that's what
operator comes in. It's going to get,

369
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:24,691
the first element has been reversed
it so that it's sorted in order of,

370
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,053
uh,

371
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:32,010
sorted in order of a frequency.
Okay. That's what this does,

372
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,470
sort of frequency list. So now we want
to remove our stop work. Remove. Stopped.

373
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,480
All right, so now we're gonna remove
our top roads. Okay. So, um, if,

374
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,720
if remember that variable up there,
search mode, that that's what Paul does.

375
00:22:45,721 --> 00:22:48,630
Like do we want stop work?
They're not all right.

376
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,153
And,

377
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,563
uh,

378
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,220
no, I answer all you guys.
She's our shine whenever.

379
00:22:56,221 --> 00:23:01,110
I can't and don't take it personally.
All right. Um, you know, I'm in the zone,

380
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,090
so, okay. So, um, I know my phone
is vibrating. Thank you. I need to,

381
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:10,590
who's there? Oh, it's my sister. So
he's just like, what's up? Anyway,

382
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:14,970
she's kind of, you know, just kind of
a princess, but like, you know, anyway,

383
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,010
here we go. So remove stop
words. Uh, where was I?

384
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,840
Oh Man, this is fun. Okay, here we
go. Uh, I say, here we go. A lot dude.

385
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,710
Get in the zone. Auto Zone. That
was hilarious. And isn't this,

386
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:33,030
isn't this painting crazy? Like this
guy is on it? I mean, I like it. Anyway,

387
00:23:33,031 --> 00:23:35,840
that's why it's there.
So let's remove our stop words.

388
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,250
So we're going to say sorted word
frequency list. So we're going to story,

389
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,600
it's in the starting word frequency Liz

390
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,000
frequency list.

391
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,560
And we're going to remove stop words
and that is where the red x comes into,

392
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,990
uh, in a second. And I'm going to

393
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:02,650
remove stop words.
Okay. So check that out.

394
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,300
Okay.

395
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,890
There is actually, I'm sorry. So someone
asks if stop words works for Spanish. Yes,

396
00:24:08,891 --> 00:24:13,270
it does. It works from a bunch of
languages. And um, I'm going to show you,

397
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,900
uh, it does work for a
bunch of languages. Okay.

398
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,640
So if search mode sorted frequency
list equals remove stop words. Okay.

399
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:23,320
So I'm just making sure I have that.
All right,

400
00:24:23,321 --> 00:24:28,321
so remove stop words and now we want
you sum the total words to calculate the

401
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:33,880
frequencies.
Okay.

402
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,140
Let's sum the total words to get
the frequencies is so total words,

403
00:24:38,141 --> 00:24:40,600
some equals zero.

404
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,930
All right, Dan. Oh,

405
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:50,430
OCT is my friends from high school
who ended up blowing up on youtube.

406
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,580
So that's awesome. Just for key. So,

407
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,870
so we're going to calculate
the frequencies of be
forward. So in the sorted,

408
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,273
okay,

409
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,240
I ain't got time for that. All right. Um,

410
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,900
for key value in sore knee or frequency

411
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,830
list.
Well,

412
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,940
let's get the a word some and then
we're going to say the total words,

413
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,500
some cluster. All right. Um,

414
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,550
what is that doing it? Same for all of
those words in our list. Let's get the,

415
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,120
the sum of all those words because the
value is going to be the frequency count.

416
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,110
Okay. So then, um, so now
we just want to get to 20.

417
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:43,690
Just get the top 20 words. That's all
we want to display in our table. Um,

418
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,020
we want to get the top 20 words.
All right.

419
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:53,960
What is the key on line?
What is about your key on the line 43,

420
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,490
uh, item. Get her. It's going to
be that first element in the list.

421
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,080
So just get the top 20 words.

422
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:05,230
If the lamps of the sordid word
frequency list is greater than 20,

423
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,360
um, is greater than 20,
and we don't want it.

424
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:13,580
So we just want, we just want
the 20, the first 20. Right.

425
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,690
So let's say sweating work frequency
list, and guess what? I'll till 20.

426
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,700
That's what that means. Up till 20. Um,

427
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,990
uh, no, I, I'm not jealous of
Dan. I'm a huge fan. I mean,

428
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:30,090
he gave me a shout out and one of his
videos and I gave him a shout out too.

429
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,790
It worked out great. Um, who do I get
jealous of that? Do I get jealous?

430
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,660
I get jealous of like,
um,

431
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,690
if like I have a girlfriend
and she likes other guys.

432
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,300
Sometimes I'll get y'all some that anyway,
but that's the extent.

433
00:26:45,301 --> 00:26:50,160
I don't really get jealous, look like
celebrities anymore. I used to though. Um,

434
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,170
I just feel like awesome. Good job, man.

435
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:55,531
All right.

436
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,770
So we were just going to get the top 20
words and now we want to get to create

437
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:03,540
our final list, our final list, which
is going to contain our words, um,

438
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,183
um,

439
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,930
words plus frequency
counts and plus percentage.

440
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:12,570
Like what percent of all the
words to these workmen. Okay.

441
00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:17,510
So here's our last part. Okay. Um,
mister something in line 50. Uh,

442
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:22,370
you're absolutely right.
Thank you so much Robin. Okay,

443
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,360
so here we go.
So final list.

444
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
We're going create our NP list a battery,
start to learn python, learn, learn,

445
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:30,834
python the hard way.

446
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:35,120
And My town for key value for
every key bow you can hear him,

447
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,850
the story worth frequency list,
um,

448
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,830
get the percentage value.

449
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,340
MMM,
okay.

450
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,450
And

451
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:47,883
MMM,

452
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:53,910
we'll say now you times
100 divided by total words,

453
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:57,874
some.

454
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,720
And so what we're doing is
we're populating that the
percentage frequency that

455
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,200
these words are showing up or by
multiplying by a hundred. Right? Um,

456
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,700
and then finally we'll add
it to our list as the word.

457
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,730
That's the key,
the value and the value,

458
00:28:15,731 --> 00:28:19,080
which is a number of times it shows
up in the last one is the percentage,

459
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:23,200
like what percent of words total is that?
Okay.

460
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,270
And then finally we can print
out the headers. All right,

461
00:28:29,271 --> 00:28:30,110
so here we go.

462
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:34,370
So we're going to print headers and
what are the head is going to be?

463
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,980
It's going to be in order.
It's going to be all right. Um,

464
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:42,930
why don't you see one final
list. Oh, thank you. Thank you.

465
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:47,700
Thank you. Good call. Heteros word.
We are creating skynet. Absolutely.

466
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,680
So get ready guys, because the world
is going to not come to an end.

467
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:56,370
We're not creating skynet. Don't worry
about it. Everything's going to be fine.

468
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,080
It's all good. It's all good. As long
as I'm alive, it's awkward. Right?

469
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,600
Okay. So frequency. Um,

470
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,660
if you want to take me out, I'm
trying to just like, I'm not afraid,

471
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,370
I'm not afraid. What about
a dope ass beat? It was all
right. Here we go. Frequency.

472
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:21,180
A frequency presented. Okay. So those
are our three things. Frequency,

473
00:29:21,181 --> 00:29:22,014
percentage.

474
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:32,510
All right. So that's it does it.
So that's it. Okay. That is it.

475
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,120
So that's going to print it
out. And here's what it's
gonna look like, by the way.

476
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,490
Right? So if we win, it will say,

477
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:42,190
let's say python main dot.
Py,

478
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,880
and we want to say boom, boom, boom, boom.

479
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,770
And we're going to go all the way
down, like, okay. Just like that.

480
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,880
And then yes, the code is going
to be available to download.

481
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,270
Let's see what this looks like.
Would say python maned up high.

482
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:03,220
And what is someone shout out an article
that you want me to look up. Okay.

483
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:06,070
And then I'm gonna look it up and we're
going to get the 20 words for that

484
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:10,480
article. Whoever says the first
word. Okay. All right, here we go.

485
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,860
And it's gonna be,
it's gonna be me.

486
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,210
What did install Gentoo. Okay.
And say Gentoo. All right, great.

487
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:23,190
Super Smash a Trump. Oh No, hers.

488
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:29,050
No. No. Okay. God. Trump. All
right, Trump. I see Trump.

489
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,570
And do we want to remove stop words?
Let's do it.

490
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,390
Hold on,
hold on a second.

491
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:41,830
What's going on here?
What's going on here?

492
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:47,230
Um, hold on, hold on. Let
me see what's going on.

493
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,223
Yeah,

494
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,373
there we go.

495
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,040
Uh, that wasn't a lot of
words. Let's try it. Batman.

496
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:09,070
That's better. Okay. So here we go. Let's
try Jenga actually. Yeah, that's wrap.

497
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:13,900
No Pokemon.
So what's happening here?

498
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:17,710
Okay, so let's take a look at
this. We have the top words, right?

499
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,620
POKEMON games release generation.
Um,

500
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,380
and then we have the frequency of all
those words. It's showed up 253 times,

501
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:31,120
and it's 7.4% of all words.
Okay. Once we do this,

502
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:35,690
we can apply this to a lot of
other things like NLP. We can, uh,

503
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:40,090
we can apply this to salmon analysis
and we can recommend things for people.

504
00:31:40,091 --> 00:31:44,770
We can do market research, we can
build chat bots with this. Um,

505
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:49,570
I know Pokemon is the most frequent
word at this Wikipedia article.

506
00:31:49,571 --> 00:31:53,680
I know that's kind of weird, isn't it? But
that is the case games. The second one.

507
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,490
Um,
and I'll do one more,

508
00:31:57,491 --> 00:32:01,700
cause you guys are really into this. It's
like how arrangers, I don't know. Did I?

509
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,310
Okay.

510
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,143
Maybe it's like,

511
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:09,490
actually I think I need to do like
under Hauer underscore rangers. Yes,

512
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:16,610
there we go. So Rangers is the most
frequent work, right? Isn't that cool?

513
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,170
Um, so anyway, okay, so
that, so that's that. Um,

514
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,830
I'm going to upload this
code to get up and um,

515
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,640
it's going to be available for you guys
to look at and I'm going to close this

516
00:32:28,641 --> 00:32:33,350
session out with a final five minutes
of Q and a and then we're good to go.

517
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,280
And I'm going to do a live session next
week too. And uh, definitely comments,

518
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:41,290
what kind of live sessions
you want to see. And it's,

519
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,570
I'm definitely going to keep that
in mind. Okay. So here we go.

520
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,360
A five minute Q and a go.
Is there a way to remove duplicates?

521
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:55,270
Singular and plurals? Um,
yeah, yeah, there is a,

522
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,440
you would just use rec
regular expressions.

523
00:32:57,441 --> 00:33:01,380
So you'd want to remove the s at the end
of a word, which would mean it's plural.

524
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:06,030
Right. And that's, that's basic,
I mean, some words. Um, anyway,

525
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,850
uh, thank you. I'm glad you guys loves
me. I love Jesus too. And where are,

526
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:14,280
where am I right now? I'm in
San Francisco, California. Uh,

527
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:18,840
hopefully Jesus doesn't love Trump,
but everybody deserves love in some way.

528
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,530
How am I doing? I'm doing
pretty good. I'm, I just got
back from the youtube space.

529
00:33:22,531 --> 00:33:26,460
La Right. Was there for a week. Youtube
flew me out. I won this contest next up.

530
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:30,260
And that was crazy because it was like
20 creators and they were amazing people.

531
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:34,850
They were just, they were so they were
just, they were leaders and like it was,

532
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,060
it was cool but I was like the weird
ones, like no one understands code. Like,

533
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,640
cause like I'm in my bubble
here in San Francisco, right?

534
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:42,510
I'm just like doing machine
learning all day and I'm,

535
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:46,700
I'm not even thinking about making videos
about like the format in data or like

536
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:50,660
how do you get out? Because to me that's,
stuff is so simple, but guess what?

537
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,170
I'm in a bubble. So like
that's the biggest realization
I got when I was there.

538
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:56,900
It was like, oh my God, I need to make

539
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:02,080
much more accessible videos because
like those people like did not,

540
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:05,380
they were smart but they just didn't get
what I was doing them so specialized.

541
00:34:05,381 --> 00:34:07,810
So, so it was awesome.
I'm doing pretty good.

542
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,840
I am newly single and I'm focused on
my work and I'm trying to just become,

543
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:16,630
you know,

544
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:21,460
awesome and like do physical activities
and have interests and have a lead,

545
00:34:21,461 --> 00:34:23,710
a busy,
awesome dope life.

546
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:24,970
Okay.

547
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,720
Um, so anyway, I'll take
three more questions.

548
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,780
Can I make a video to guide
beginners? I mean, I think,

549
00:34:30,781 --> 00:34:33,960
I think that's like all my videos, but
I'm going to get better at that. Trust me.

550
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,860
Um, what is your source of income?
I mean, there's like Youtube ads,

551
00:34:37,861 --> 00:34:40,560
which isn't really much.
Patrion is really the biggest one.

552
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,070
I can get clients who come in and
ask you to make videos for them,

553
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:47,020
but like I,
I just,

554
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,470
that takes away from the videos I make
for you guys. You know what I'm saying?

555
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,000
I don't want to just make
videos for other people,

556
00:34:52,001 --> 00:34:56,680
so I'm trying to just focus on this
channel. And that's it. And the,

557
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:01,210
and the way I'm supporting myself is
youtube ads and patriots fan and it's not

558
00:35:01,211 --> 00:35:03,640
enough yet, but like I feel
like it will be eventually.

559
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:07,960
I'm just going to keep doing one more
question and then we're good to go.

560
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,160
Uh, I am single with this hair but
it's all good. Like it's whatever. Um,

561
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:19,970
do you know anything about bioinformatics?
Uh,

562
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,120
okay.

563
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,570
Bio Informatics.

564
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:26,260
I mean like some like a fingerprint
reading and an eye scanning.

565
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:29,530
So actually I tried to write a
paper called proof of identity,

566
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,580
the way to prove your identity online
in a decentralized way without a central

567
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:36,230
server.
I tried writing that paper but it's just,

568
00:35:36,231 --> 00:35:38,430
I just couldn't of a way to do it.

569
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,180
I thought about it for six months
and one Bennett look up that guy.

570
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,360
That guy is a genius. He invented
the interplanetary file system.

571
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,570
He was like advising me but like I
couldn't do it. But yeah, that was my,

572
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,980
that was my foray into bioinformatics
stuff like using ice scanning to prove

573
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,430
that you are a unique individual online
without it being stored and server.

574
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,410
We still can't do it,
but if someone,

575
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,530
if someone were to able to solve
that problem, proof of identity,

576
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,280
then we could have online entity that
no central government controlled,

577
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:11,150
like your online passport,
which would be awesome. Um,

578
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,990
and I'm sure the blockchain
there and there's,

579
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:16,580
there's still ways of okay doing that,
you know,

580
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:20,870
high scanning and things
like that. So, okay,

581
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,580
so that's it. Thank you guys
so much for watching. I'm,

582
00:36:24,581 --> 00:36:27,390
I want to do more of these live videos,
um,

583
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,700
and I'm going to upload this
code and I love you guys and,

584
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:38,470
uh, thanks for watching and you
guys are the reason I do this.

585
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:43,000
So, uh, for now I've got to

586
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,190
get here like this guy.
So thanks for watching.

587
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,440
No love you guys.

588
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:57,880
And now I awkwardly try to close the
tab while you guys watch. Here we go.

589
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:03,280
Where is that? Anyway? Where is it? Wait,

590
00:37:03,281 --> 00:37:07,690
where is it? Oh, I may
have minimize it. Okay.
