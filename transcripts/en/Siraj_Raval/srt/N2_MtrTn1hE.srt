00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,930
Hello world it Saroj and
how am I so productive?

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,790
I get that question a lot.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,820
So in this video I'm going to reveal
five ways that I personally maintain my

4
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:14,910
productivity. If you're new here,

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,690
When I released my weekly
educational videos every week,

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,720
I make three or four technical videos
that teach complex topics in technology

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,790
like artificial intelligence,
blockchain,

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,650
and quantum computing in the most simple,
understandable way that I can.

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:32,970
On top of that,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,530
I run an international nonprofit called
school of Ai that consists of 800

11
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:42,420
representatives called beans across
400 cities globally and it's growing

12
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:44,700
insanely fast.
It's a lot of work.

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,730
The list of tasks is endless from
web development to partnerships,

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,610
legalities, coordination,
creating guidelines, et cetera.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,000
It's very stressful,
but totally and completely worth it.

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,860
There's literally nothing I'd rather do
with my time than what I'm doing right

17
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,110
now.
That being said,

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,580
the first way I stay productive is
that I protect my mental health.

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,260
In the past few months,

20
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,290
lots of popular youtube ers from h three
h three to Fusi tube to the try guys

21
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,820
have come forward to talk
about how they've had mental
breakdowns for making so

22
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:21,870
many videos.

23
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,260
The coupling of constant changes to
YouTube's algorithm with the unhealthy

24
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:32,451
obsession with remaining relevant to
keep audience metrics up has caused the

25
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,910
burnouts amongst youtubes,
most popular creators.

26
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,830
I've been doing this for two and a half
years now and there's definitely been

27
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:44,220
moments where I've felt
extremely stressed,

28
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,520
but in order for me to be able to
continue our mission of providing a world

29
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:53,280
class AI education to as
many people as possible,

30
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,420
I realize that my mental health
should be my number one priority.

31
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,080
I can't deliver content constantly to
you wizards unless I'm mentally stable,

32
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,960
so I consciously make time to disconnect.

33
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,150
Every week I spend one day,

34
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:12,450
one full 24 hour period without my phone.

35
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,460
I am completely disconnected from
the Internet. Also every night,

36
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,970
the three hours before I sleep,
I disconnect as well.

37
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,410
I spend that time either by myself or
with friends just playing for the sake of

38
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,244
playing.

39
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,340
My full time role as director of school
of Ai is to inspire and educate and

40
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:36,570
social media is the platform with
which I've been doing that so far.

41
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,950
It's how I've been able to reach
so many people across the world,

42
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,040
so it's absolutely crucial to what I do,

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,570
but simultaneously social media
is harmful to mental health.

44
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,741
Jerome Linear,

45
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:54,741
the author of 10 arguments for deleting
your social media right now has this to

46
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:59,751
say about social media usage because
you're being certainly manipulated

47
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,130
by algorithms that are watching everything
you do constantly and then sending

48
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:10,381
you changes in your media feed and your
diet that are calculated to adjust you

49
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:14,830
slightly to the liking of
some unseen advertiser.

50
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,300
The irony here is that Jerome was one
of the pioneers of the worldwide web and

51
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:24,660
advocated for a world of free
services that anybody could use,

52
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,820
but drone has seen the harmful effects
of what social media has become.

53
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,220
I don't want to let social media
manipulate me. I want to manipulate it.

54
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,910
I want to be the one in control,
not the algorithms.

55
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,200
So not only do I limit the
time that I am on social media,

56
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,640
when I do use it,

57
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,350
I use it specifically to either engage
with the community or share content,

58
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,620
meaning I literally scheduled time to
answer questions and reply to messages for

59
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,800
each of the respective social media
platforms that I use and I schedule when I

60
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:02,880
share my videos as well.

61
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,470
Another part of protecting my mental
health is by relying on a supportive

62
00:04:07,471 --> 00:04:09,330
community.
This community,

63
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,870
the school of Ai shares
seven values and a mission.

64
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,480
And because we share these values,

65
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,340
it makes it easier for us to build
lasting relationships with each other.

66
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:25,200
Vulnerability is the foundation by
which close friendships are made.

67
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,320
So I've made a point to be as vulnerable
as I can with all of you sharing my

68
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,470
deepest secrets publicly rather
than keeping them bottled up inside,

69
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,060
like the fact that I've legally changed
my name twice or the fact that I was

70
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:42,360
fired from my last job and because of it,

71
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,800
I've observed that I've been able
to reach a new level of intimacy and

72
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:48,690
connection with this community.

73
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,310
We really are one big family and I hope
to see each of you be more vulnerable

74
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:57,780
with each other as well.
Negative emotions are okay to feel.

75
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,600
It's a really important lesson
that I learned from the book,

76
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,640
the subtle art of not giving an f.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,480
It's okay to feel
anxious or sad or guilty,

78
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,610
but social media and its current state
makes us believe for a large part that if

79
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,200
we're not being positive,

80
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,230
something's wrong with us and that can
lead to a thoughts spiral where we feel

81
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:23,511
anxious about being anxious and sad
about feeling sad or worrying about

82
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:25,344
worrying,

83
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,520
accepting that negative emotions
are an inevitable part of life.

84
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,620
That there will always be some problem
that I'll have has freed me to have

85
00:05:34,621 --> 00:05:35,760
better mental health.

86
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,960
The second way that I stay
productive is that I say no.

87
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,790
I am constantly saying no every single
day I'm saying no to potential business

88
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,850
clients, relationships, video suggestions,

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,650
advice on which direction to take school
of Ai and I'm saying no to myself as

90
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:56,070
well.
I have so many things that I want to do,

91
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,400
so many different and ideas,

92
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:03,140
but I know that as a human being with
the limited time on earth and a limited

93
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:05,780
span of attention,
I can't do it all.

94
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,510
If I try to do too many things at once,

95
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,470
then each of those things won't
be as quality as they could be.

96
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,780
One of my first inspirations to adopt
this type of mentality was the way Steve

97
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:22,781
jobs handled his return to apple years
later after being fired previously

98
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,770
and focusing is hard because
focusing doesn't mean saying yes,

99
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:28,600
it means saying no.
So we say we,

100
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,180
we decide not to do a lot of things so
that we can focus on a few handfuls of

101
00:06:33,181 --> 00:06:34,170
things and do them well.

102
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,840
Focus means saying no.

103
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,410
Our slack channel has over
25,000 developers on it.

104
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,940
I say no to being very active in all
of the hundred plus channels we have,

105
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,040
but say yes to being very active in the
dean's channel where our deans share

106
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:54,330
their experiences, building AI
communities in their respective cities.

107
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,950
In fact, I like and comment on
every single post in that channel.

108
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,440
I am the most active person on it.

109
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,110
Attention is a valuable thing,

110
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:09,140
including in deep learning and as a human
I can only spread my attention so much

111
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,770
so I actively choose to
target that attention to areas
where it matters the most

112
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,900
to help achieve the goals
I've set for myself.

113
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,680
The third way I stay productive
is by asking for help.

114
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,630
Since I started my youtube channel,

115
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,690
I've always had the goal of solving AI
and using it to solve the world's hardest

116
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:34,911
problems and starting my youtube
channel alone allowed me to make all the

117
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,800
decisions myself.
I know myself,

118
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:42,830
I trust myself and because of that I was
able to both make and implement a lot

119
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:45,540
of decisions very fast,

120
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,190
both in terms of the content of my videos
and the direction I wanted to take the

121
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:52,080
channel.
I had no boss,

122
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,380
but at some point I realized that in
order to actually accomplish my goal,

123
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,490
I need it to scale and scaling
meant asking other people for help,

124
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:07,380
leveraging other human brains to
help me accomplish the larger goal.

125
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,510
The first step in that direction was
hiring a full time editor and animator.

126
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,620
I used to edit all my videos
myself and that's how I liked it.

127
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,840
I didn't think any editor would be able
to edit machine learning equations on a

128
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:23,850
screen the way that I could,

129
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,180
but eventually I found and learn to trust
my now full time editor and animator

130
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,310
and I followed a similar thought pattern
when it came to social media promotion.

131
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,580
The social media work I used to do myself
like Seo and general growth strategies

132
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,740
is now done by my social media manager.
Even content creation.

133
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,220
Our School of AI deans are
creating their own curriculums,

134
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,990
their own educational AI videos
and imbuing it with their own.

135
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,320
It's not just me anymore.

136
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,560
I have learned to ask for help across
my entire work pipeline and I'm still

137
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,280
learning how to ask for help.

138
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,290
I have a giant list of tasks I need to
complete and if it was humanly possible,

139
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,730
I would do it all myself,

140
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,040
but I'm learning how to pick and choose
those tasks that are best suited for me

141
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:21,860
to do and ask for help from specific
deans at our school for the rest.

142
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,400
This ongoing practice has
definitely boosted my productivity.

143
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:31,490
The fourth way I stay productive is
by performing rapid experimentation.

144
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,770
This is actually one of
our values at school of Ai.

145
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,680
An idea alone is worth nothing.

146
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,540
It's the execution of it that matters
and the best way to do that is to build,

147
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,890
assess, and reiterate until you
have a valid solution to a problem.

148
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,280
That 100 days of ml code challenge the
Drake in my feelings AI challenge and

149
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:55,290
even the entire school of AI organization,

150
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,420
all three of these initiatives I started
in the past three months and each was

151
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:03,060
launched with a single video on youtube.

152
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,590
Each of these initiatives
could have gone horribly wrong.

153
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,770
They could have been received negatively
and misunderstood like Saroj coin was,

154
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:18,590
but because I have the mentality of
rapid experimentation of just putting

155
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:20,730
something out there,

156
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,270
seeing what people feel and then
iterating until it's better.

157
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:29,450
I had the courage to put those ideas out
into the world regardless of how people

158
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:31,950
felt.
It's okay to fail.

159
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,520
I embrace failure wholeheartedly
and so should you.

160
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,160
It's a part of rapid experimentation.

161
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,100
It means we're learning
and growing as humans.

162
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,290
It also means that I can quickly see
what works and what doesn't work,

163
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,470
which saves me a lot of time and the fifth
way that I stay productive is through

164
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:55,590
detailed planning.
At the start of every week,

165
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,820
I use a dedicated segment of my time,
usually about five hours,

166
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:04,290
but it can take up to 10 hours
sometimes. The plan. I plan my week,

167
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,430
month, year, and five years
and as much detail as I can,

168
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,110
listing out my goals for each of these
time intervals and then for my week plan,

169
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,200
how I'm going to achieve those goals.
Specifically,

170
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,180
I try and plan out every single
hour of my day for the entire week,

171
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,340
which includes planning time to rest
and rejuvenate and all of my to do tasks

172
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,850
change every single week.
Nothing is ever static,

173
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,730
but because I take the initiative to plan,

174
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:37,890
I feel more secure with what I'm doing
and I'm able to effectively prioritize

175
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,540
and organize all of the tasks that
I need to do in an efficient way.

176
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,030
And that's pretty much it. I'm definitely
a human with flaws and I make mistakes,

177
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,980
but I learned from them and I'm committed
to growing both myself as a human and

178
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,400
community for the better.
I live to serve a AI wizards.

179
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:02,430
It brings me a very deep sense of joy
in a way that nothing else ever has.

180
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,010
So thank you for watching and for
being a part of this community.
