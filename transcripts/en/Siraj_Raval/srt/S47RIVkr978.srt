00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,810
Hello world.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,010
It's the Raj and how are you supposed
to write a great research paper?

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,900
I've written and read my fair share of
research papers and I'm going to outline

4
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:12,090
the steps you can take to write one,

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,410
whether you're a phd candidate at
MIT or a freshman in high school,

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,330
maybe you're working on a blockchain
project and once you have an initial coin

7
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:26,130
offering or you found that the model
you built in care os and left training,

8
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:31,131
overnights managed to beat the state of
the art because of a simple tweak you

9
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:34,500
made to some hyper parameters,
whatever it is,

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,310
you should publish your findings.
So before you start your journey,

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,820
you got to remind
yourself to stay positive.

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,540
Research can be hard,
it can take long hours,

13
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:50,280
required tons of time studying
and experimenting with
no good results. In fact,

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,200
you might find that you were asking the
wrong questions all along and you need

15
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:59,460
to start from scratch and that's okay to
become world class in anything you do.

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,050
It's going to take more
than just knowledge like an
Olympic athletes aiming for

17
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:07,800
the gold medal.
You've got to have a positive attitude.

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,780
And the belief that you have the
ability to discover something awesome.

19
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,170
That's the real start to
writing a compelling paper.

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,690
Then you've got to come up with a topic.

21
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,340
Start by coming up with some questions
you have about the field that you're

22
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:28,200
studying. They can be broad, they can
be specific, they can be embarrassing,

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,771
whatever.

24
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:33,660
Just come up with a list of questions
that you personally want to know the

25
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:38,661
answers to and then try to find the answer
to those questions for yourself to a

26
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:44,280
level that you feel comfortable with
and would enable you to teach others.

27
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,900
Talk to some people and see what they
think to verify that you do indeed

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,480
understand the answer to your questions.

29
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:56,510
That could mean posting your understanding
to a subreddit or to stack overflow

30
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,770
or a slack channel. As a result of
searching for an answer to your questions,

31
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,960
you'll either find an answer in the form
of existing work or you won't find an

32
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:11,430
answer, which means you found a
good area for further research. Now,

33
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,980
what are the related
subtopics to this question?

34
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,340
Start narrowing down the
broader the question.

35
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,760
The harder it will be to
answer. It's much, much,

36
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:25,410
much harder to solve a question like what
is consciousness over a question like

37
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,650
what is a more optimal
strategy to generate suitable
distributions for a Monte

38
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:35,700
Carlo tree search? In the
words of Kendrick, you got
to sit down and be humble.

39
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,360
A well articulated paper that's laser
focused on a solution to a niche problem

40
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,940
is much more useful to the community
than an ambiguous solution to a broad

41
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:50,400
problem. The next step is to
collect your data. On this topic.

42
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,720
You're going to get a lot of
articles, blog post tutorials, videos,

43
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,640
and PDFs.
When you Google it,

44
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,820
you'll need to go through each of
these systematically, but remember,

45
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,310
not all sources are created equal.

46
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,110
Just as it's important to be able to
search through a wide variety of sources.

47
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,790
It's also just as important to learn
to be critical in your assessment.

48
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,870
A source could have a possible
political or monetary bias,

49
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,820
so pay attention to who wrote it, their
qualifications, why they wrote it,

50
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,970
and when it was produced.
To see how up to date it is.

51
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,650
Pay attention to the domain,

52
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:31,651
extension.edu and dot Gov's can be
more reliable sources than dotcoms,

53
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,760
which could be pushing
content that persuades you to
purchase something. Ideally,

54
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,880
you find empirical research
that is knowledge gained
through direct or indirect

55
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,200
observation of experience. Popular
journals, conference submissions,

56
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,910
even social media like sub reddits and
Facebook groups have people sharing

57
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:56,470
relevant research daily. Google scholar
is another good way to find papers.

58
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,090
Just make sure to be specific in your
keywords so they relate to your topic.

59
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,900
If you find the paper you
really like that seems relevant,

60
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,470
go ahead and jot down some of
the cited sources it lists.

61
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,880
You can find those later and use
those as well for your own research.

62
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,010
Now you're ready to feel the learn.

63
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,280
Find yourself a cozy spot that you feel
comfortable in and start learning from

64
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:25,510
your sources. Try to make
generalizations. You are the synthesizer.

65
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,130
You are taking different
ideas from different sources
and putting them together

66
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,300
in a way that no one has thought
of before. For whatever reason,

67
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,470
you'll find common ideas
across different projects.

68
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,390
Some will have more
successful implementations
of those ideas than others.

69
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,990
This can take anywhere from a
single day to several weeks.

70
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,010
After this synthesis of data,
you'll come to some kind of belief,

71
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:56,130
some kind of possible solution that
you think might work for your problem.

72
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,420
Use this as your thesis.

73
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,720
This is a declaration of your
belief based on the data.

74
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,430
Your paper will be you defending that
belief through a series of compelling

75
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,410
arguments based on your own results
as well as the results of others,

76
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,860
and don't worry too much
about having it be finalized.

77
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,600
Your thesis will naturally change as
you experiment and develop your ideas.

78
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,210
Ask for validation of your thesis
from people well versed in your topic.

79
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,290
You don't want to spend your valuable
time researching something if it's not a

80
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,150
good idea. Email, paper,

81
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:35,920
authors directly or ask your question
on relevant social media platforms.

82
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,570
Once your thesis is validated,
go ahead and try to solve the problem.

83
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,490
It's really easy to get bogged down in
one implementation detail or carefully

84
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:48,490
tuning the wrong algorithm.
To avoid this.

85
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,310
Your first goal should be
to get something super,

86
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:55,930
super basic in place as quickly as
possible. That solves the problem.

87
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,810
Then once got a functional baseline,
you can get creative.

88
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,540
I actually learned this technique
from the Google glass team. Peace.

89
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,260
Once you feel comfortable
with your solution,

90
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,690
it's time to start writing an outline.

91
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,020
Look at papers related to your thesis
and see what kind of subsections they've

92
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,103
listed.

93
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:20,170
A lot of times you'll find some common
sub section headings between different

94
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:21,164
papers.

95
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:26,260
Go ahead and create a list of subsections
that are a generalized form of the

96
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:27,470
related papers.

97
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,420
Then think about if there are any extra
subsections you might want to add that

98
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:37,040
are specific to your project or even
some that you might want to take away.

99
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,880
Generally the format for an
outline should start with a title,

100
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,330
then an abstract which
will summarize your work.

101
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,310
Then an introduction that will give
the reader some of your motivations and

102
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,490
background data,
the methodology.

103
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,090
We'll document your research process.
Then your results,

104
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,570
a discussion at the end,
weighing all the different results,

105
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,780
a conclusion that uses the results to
answer your thesis and finally references

106
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:08,690
which will cite your sources.
Once you've done all of that,

107
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,760
you're ready to write your first draft.

108
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,520
Welcome to the world of technical writing.

109
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,790
This is the art of writing about
a technical topic in an engaging,

110
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,470
informative,
and educating way.

111
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,210
You are being of service to the larger
scientific community by writing this

112
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:30,410
paper, so don't try to sound smart
for the sake of sounding smart.

113
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,940
Rather get your point across in
the most efficient way possible.

114
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,960
Using language that ideally
your reader already understands.

115
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:44,230
Go into excruciating detail explaining
every single bit of your work,

116
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,400
every reference,
everything.

117
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:51,730
It's much easier to cut down a long paper
than to continually try to add more to

118
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:53,900
it to make it seem longer.

119
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:59,170
The ideal length for a paper is between
five to 10 pages and he less and you

120
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:02,000
aren't being detailed enough and any more,

121
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:05,750
and it's going to be a bit too long to
maintain the interest of the reader.

122
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,830
Support every statement you make
with evidence and never, never,

123
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:11,030
never played your eyes.

124
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,130
The whole point of this paper is to
show the synthesis of the ideas you've

125
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:21,050
learned about in your own words, and
it's always better to show than to tell.

126
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,880
Use tools like omnigraffle and
Inkscape to create graphs, charts,

127
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,080
and conceptual diagrams to help
illustrate your line of thinking.

128
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,880
The flow of your paper should have all
of the subsections appear interconnected

129
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,740
rather than starting and stopping in
a blunt way from one topic to the next

130
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,760
smoothly segue into the next topic.
Don't be too harsh on yourself.

131
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:48,230
The first draft. Just get something,
anything down, just let it out.

132
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,180
You can iterate on it later.

133
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,780
If you spend too much time trying
to make it perfect on the first go,

134
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,800
you'll never get anything out, so just
crank it out and iterate. Remember,

135
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,390
only you are reviewing this thing at
first. Once you've got your first draft,

136
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,010
congratulations, you are
awesome. Time to revise. First,

137
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:10,560
go through your paper and
check for content errors,

138
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,520
anything having to do with grammar,
misspelled words, et cetera.

139
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,330
Then check for factual errors
or your number's correct.

140
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,010
Double and triple check them.

141
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,810
You might find once you've written a
first draft that rearranging your ideas

142
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,900
would be more beneficial to
having a compelling argument.

143
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,080
That one idea is actually
a dependency of another,

144
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,810
so it's better to place it afterwards.
In fact,

145
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,640
entire subsections could be rearranged
to make the paper flow better.

146
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,000
Eventually after some mixing
and matching and revising,

147
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,010
you'll have a final draft.

148
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,580
You can then add some optional
content if you'd like,

149
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,990
like a table of contents at the
beginning or an appendix at the end.

150
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,120
Once you've done all of this,

151
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,130
you can submit your paper to a popular
journal like nature or a popular

152
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:02,640
subreddit for your scientific
community or even just get hub.

153
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,780
The point of this is to get your
research in front of as many eyeballs as

154
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:09,990
possible and get them
to learn from your work.

155
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,670
It's kind of hard to get a paper accepted
in some of the top journals as the

156
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:18,720
peer review process can be very, very
thorough. Basically, the journal,

157
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:20,520
we'll ask a few other scientists,

158
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:23,460
well versed in your topic
to validate your claims,

159
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,700
to ensure the integrity
and soundness of your work,

160
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,830
but if they accept it,

161
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,780
getting published in one of these
journals is an extra credential for your

162
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:37,830
paper. It gives it more technical
authority amongst the community.

163
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,750
Are you ready to become
the next Alan Turing?

164
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:43,740
Yet it's inscribed to continue to level
up your learning game. And for now,

165
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,440
I've got to hone my craft,
so thanks for watching.
