1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey Rachel, how's it going? Oh, hi sir.

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,360
Do you mind if I can ask you
67 questions there? Cool.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,220
Do you miss your undergraduate
years at Swarthmore? Yes.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,590
You got a phd in math from two. How was
that experience? It was pretty miserable.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,840
What is something you miss
about where you grew up? Um,

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,460
my friends and family and delicious food.

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,230
You need a PT to do machine
learning research? Absolutely not.

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,650
What excites you the most
about machine learning?

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,880
I just think all the real world problems
that can solve. It's really powerful.

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,980
What was it like working
at the early days? It was,

11
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,510
it was pretty chaotic. What was the
funniest part about working at Uber?

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,421
I think it was,

13
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,870
it was a once in a lifetime opportunity
and it was a really interesting data set

14
00:00:57,871 --> 00:00:59,070
to have all the gps data.

15
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,100
What website do you absolutely
love to spend time on?

16
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,550
I guess Twitter.
I love hate.

17
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,840
What country do you believe
will contribute the most
to ml and the next decade?

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,470
Oh, that's a good question.
Um, I think a lot of countries,

19
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,830
well theory till what time do you wake up?
I usually around 8:00 AM

20
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:23,560
paper machine,

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,560
morning paper of 2018 and I
think Leslie Smith's one cycle.

22
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,360
I like Tim. Nick got Bruce data sheets
for datasets. You can be one person.

23
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,570
Who would it be at the sane up to faculty.

24
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,270
What do you do to relax?

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,780
Like Yoga and playing with my daughter.

26
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,310
What's it like three research and as
a full time job it's a lot of fun.

27
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:53,270
I really enjoy kind of like the
creativity and flexibility. I have

28
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,390
words we're trying to make deep learning,

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,140
easier to use for people that don't,
can't afford expensive computers.

30
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:04,220
It might not have giant data,

31
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:07,250
sad center kind of all around the
world and from different backgrounds.

32
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,720
What's your working dynamic life?
I was really great.

33
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:15,020
We're just kind of totally on the same
page and have very similar values.

34
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,180
Um,

35
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,570
I'm really proud of our courses and just
our students' successes and kind of all

36
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:28,650
that companies they've launched
in the projects they've,

37
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:33,651
they've completed or done and I think a
finish finishing my phd and then in the

38
00:02:36,051 --> 00:02:38,330
face of kind of a lot of
uncertainty and obstacles.

39
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,850
Why are there so few
women in machine learning?

40
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,860
This is a big question.
I think there's a lot of um,

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,590
there's some toxicity in the field and
a lot of related fields of math and

42
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:53,670
computer science.
What is one thing that scares me?

43
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,740
I think our current political situation,

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,440
we were moving at Clu us now I don't

45
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,623
my daughter

46
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,580
a yoga and playing with my daughter.
What is something surprising about,

47
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,810
um, like I said, I grew up in Texas.

48
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,620
You prefer cats or dogs?
Dogs.

49
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,820
What's the machine learning model
that doesn't take it up? Attention.

50
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,690
Random forest.

51
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,000
That's my like computational linear
Algebra class was a lot of fun.

52
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,250
If you keep one experience again,
what would it be?

53
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,060
The month I spent in Japan.

54
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,670
Why do you think deep learning has gotten
so it's really, it's really useful.

55
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,560
What is your favorite operating system?
I don't have a strong preference.

56
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,440
Most adventurous thing you've ever done.

57
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,270
It said switching into tech
and moving to San Francisco,

58
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:07,150
getting rid of everything I owned
when I didn't know anybody out here.

59
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,410
One resource you use to stay
up to date in machine learning?

60
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,450

Why do you think programming is fun?

64
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,270
It's really fun to create things. It's
neat to have the power to build stuff.

65
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,510
What's the most amazing
thing in the world?

66

70
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,830
The first program that I remember was
we had to output how much interest you

71
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:59,260
would pay on a credit card.
Just like I'll put it to the terminal.

Pi Torch and the fast I library was
a hard problem. You recently saw

80
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,120
dealing with brain surgery.
What's the meaning of life,

81
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,770
I think to, to love the people around
you and to try to have a positive impact.

I've been learning a lot more about a
ethical issues and kind of disinformation

89
00:06:16,771 --> 00:06:20,300
and propaganda. You like spicy food? Yes.

health care is the singularity near now.

93
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,320
Who is one person you looked
up to when you were in college?

94
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,780
I looked up to David. Eddie
has a health care, um,

95
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:45,380
for evidence based healthcare proponent.
If you were to start from scratch today,

96
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,590
what is the learning resource you
would use to learn machine learning?

97
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,960
I may be biased, but a fast AI,
practical, deep learning for coders.

98
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,020
What is one goal you have
in the next 10 years?

Penny from inspector gadget.
What's your spirit animal?

103
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,700
Maybe a squirrel. What do you predict
comes next after the deep learning hype,

104
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,540
and I think the deep learning is
going to keep going for a while.

105
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,350
We still have so much potential
to unlock their. Cool. Rachel,

106
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,340
thanks so much for answering
these questions. Oh, thank
you. Who else you around.
