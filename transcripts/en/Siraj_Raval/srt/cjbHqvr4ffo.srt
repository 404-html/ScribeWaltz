1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,871
Hello world,

2
00:00:00,871 --> 00:00:05,400
it's a Raj and Monero is the currency
that I'm going to talk about today.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,280
So first I want to start
off by saying one thing,

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,260
I do not condone any illegal
usage of any cryptocurrency.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,530
Monero is an untraceable cryptocurrency
and definitely lots of people who like

6
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:21,750
to sell things illegally
on the internet use it.

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,780
But the reason that I'm talking
about it is not for that.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,310
The reason I'm talking about it is
because you should be able to control your

9
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:34,311
data and some of your data
is transactional data and
currently companies can

10
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:39,501
mine that data for free and use that to
make predictions about what you will buy

11
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:42,930
and what you won't buy. So they can
show you ads and stuff like that.

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,720
But ideally they pay you for this data,
right?

13
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:49,350
And the only way for them to pay you
for that data is if you control it.

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,700
And the only way you can control it is
if it's anonymous and they have to ask

15
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:56,880
you for permission to see your
transaction history. Okay.

16
00:00:56,881 --> 00:01:00,030
So monero is the currency I'm
going to talk about today.

17
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,280
And I have this image here of this,

18
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:05,430
these three different features that
I thought was the best high level

19
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:08,520
description of Minero.
So it says decentralized,

20
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,630
private and digital and Monroe
is all three of these things.

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,930
So it's decentralized
because no one controls it.

22
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,460
It's digital because you can run it over
the internet and it's private because

23
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:23,670
no one can tell who you are
when you send the transaction.

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,030
That means no one can tell
who sent a transaction,

25
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,160
who you sent it to and the amount
that you sent. So it's all private.

26
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,340
Unlike bitcoin and these three kind of
Venn diagram looking things are examples

27
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:42,930
of assets or currencies that are
examples of two of these, right?

28
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,450
So bitcoin is decentralized
cause no one controls it.

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,650
It's digital because it runs over
the Internet. Um, Fiat currency,

30
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,710
like a dollar is private because
you can exchange it by hand.

31
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,890
It's digital because you can do
it over the internet as well.

32
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,640
And Gold is decentralized because
no one authority controls it.

33
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,370
And it's private because no one can tell.
You know,

34
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:04,260
if you just take some gold
and give it to someone else,

35
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,650
there's no third party involved so
no one can tell anything about that

36
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:09,180
transaction.
Okay.

37
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:12,720
So Minero is all three of these things
and there are other cryptocurrencies that

38
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:14,010
are all three of these things.

39
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,480
But in terms of popularity and Monero
is definitely at the top right now at

40
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:22,320
least. So let's get into this
technical analysis of how Minero works.

41
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,170
I'm going to talk about all
the features and the narrow,

42
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,090
I'm going to talk about
how you can mine it.

43
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,860
I'm going to talk about how you can buy
it. And mostly this is a technical talk.

44
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:34,830
So we're gonna go into the technical
details of how these transactions are

45
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:38,280
private and what differences
it has from bitcoin. Okay.

46
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:41,880
So the first thing I want to talk about
is the difference between Minero in

47
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:42,570
Bitcoin.

48
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,040
So got this great list here of all these
different features that [inaudible] has

49
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,670
and all the different features
that bitcoin has and how
they're different, right?

50
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,820
Because they are very different.
Some of them are very similar,

51
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:58,130
like they both use the proof of work
algorithm to secure the network. Um,

52
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,100
they're both digital currencies. Um, they
both have a transaction fee. However,

53
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,110
Minero's is much less than bitcoins.
I don't know what, what is it?

54
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:09,910
Bitcoin is now like $20 a
transaction. Just crazy. It's crazy.

55
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,350
Block time is much faster from,
from a narrow,

56
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,910
but the real difference here,

57
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,600
the real key difference
is the trackable factor.

58
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,520
Monero is untraceable and it's
an linkable. Bitcoin is not, um,

59
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,450
I'm going to go into the details of what
I mean, like really into the details. So,

60
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,373
so stick around.

61
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,060
So a lot of the hype around
Bitcoin was that it's this, oh,

62
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,450
it's this pseudonymous currency.
No one can't know.

63
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,170
There's no third party involved.
There's no bank. You own your currency,

64
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:43,780
you own your data, you
own your assets. But the,

65
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:47,950
but the truth is that bitcoin is
very, very much traceable. Okay.

66
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,340
You can send bitcoin by literally only
pointing that transaction back to a

67
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:58,120
previous transaction in the chain
of blocks, right? A block chain.

68
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,900
That's the only way. And
that. And so your transaction,

69
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:06,901
when you make one in the bitcoin network
points back to every transaction that

70
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:10,600
came before it all the way back
to the coin base transaction,

71
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,220
the coin base transaction
is that transaction that
occurs when a minor and only

72
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,910
a minor can make a coin base transaction
received a reward from mining some

73
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:21,670
blocks. So it's like bitcoin
that comes from nothing,

74
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:26,140
but I mean it comes as reward for
performing the proof of work algorithm,

75
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:26,650
but right,

76
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,970
so you can trace any transaction back
all the way to the coin base transaction

77
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,130
and the bitcoin network.
And you might be saying,

78
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:36,160
well how am I able to to to do this?
Well,

79
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:40,330
it turns out that you can look up any
transaction in the blockchain explorer.

80
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,870
So that's that. And this can be
hard to do manually, right? I mean,

81
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,280
you say you send,

82
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:51,760
send a transaction to somebody else
and then they send it to somebody else,

83
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:53,950
right?
That's two links in the chain.

84
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,460
It's easy to just go click once and
then click once again on the blockchain

85
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:58,294
explorer.

86
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:03,250
But as nodes you're adding the complexity
increases exponentially, right?

87
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:07,420
Because as those funds are split and
then those funds are split and then those

88
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,170
ones are splits,

89
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,890
it gets harder and harder and harder to
tell where that transaction originated

90
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:15,790
from. And if you don't believe me
when I say that Bitcoin is traceable,

91
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,800
just ask the founder of Silk Road,

92
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:20,530
the online dark web market
for selling illegal items.

93
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,600
There are people literally sitting in
jail right now because bitcoin is in fact

94
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:29,530
a very, very traceable
system. Okay. So Silk Road,

95
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:31,570
I mean there's this whole
story on about Silk Road.

96
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,160
They should definitely
make a movie about it.

97
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm the guy was ordering hits on people
and he was doing all this crazy stuff,

98
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,430
which I don't condone and I
don't think it's cool. Uh,

99
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,160
but he's sitting in jail right now and
they probably will and they probably have

100
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:46,720
made a movie about it. But, um, my point
is that bitcoin is traceable, right?

101
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,690
Um,
so yes,

102
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:53,380
criminals don't want to use a currency
that is traceable. Um, but if,

103
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,750
but the thing is whether
or not I make this video,

104
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,120
criminals will find a fine
an untraceable currency.

105
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:03,320
You just have to type into
Google untraceable currency.
If you want to do bad,

106
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:07,160
you will do bad, right? I am not
making this video for criminals.

107
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,010
I'm making this video for
you. You are my viewer, right?

108
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,480
I'm making this video for people who
want to understand all the technical

109
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:19,481
details of how cryptocurrencies work and
then use this knowledge to then do good

110
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,160
for the world, right? This
is just knowledge in your
arsenal to do good. Okay?

111
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:28,700
So just remember that as a
motivation behind this video.

112
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,440
So you could attempt to make anonymous
transactions in bitcoin three ways.

113
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,220
So remember, bitcoin is not
anonymous. It's pseudonymous.

114
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,370
Meaning even if someone traces back
the trail of transactions back to you,

115
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,390
that is still your public address,

116
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,120
that public address says
nothing about your identity.

117
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:51,380
It's not like the word Saroj is
embedded in my public address, right?

118
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:55,640
So how can you tell ownership? Well,
there's a variety of ways, Ip addresses,

119
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,620
you know, um, finding the end
points of, I'll talk about
it. Let me, let me, let me,

120
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,130
let me show you this. So there are three
ways to attempt anonymous transactions.

121
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,060
The first way is to create a new wallet
after every transaction and coinbase.com

122
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:13,540
does this and does this like by default.
Um,

123
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,890
but as soon as that money is used,

124
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,250
that end point person could be
squeezed for information, right?

125
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:22,130
So if you send some money to somebody
and you want to remain anonymous,

126
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,470
you're creating wallets
between every transaction.

127
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,990
Eventually someone is going to use that
money in the real world for, you know,

128
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,810
paying a dentist or buying
a soccer ball or whatever.

129
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,800
And then that is an end point to
person, a real person that, you know,

130
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:39,380
people with guns or
whatever, it can say, hey,

131
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,110
give me the information and then
they can trace it back to you.

132
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,180
Another way is to wash your money through
a tumbler and a tumbler is a service

133
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:51,050
that aggregates your money with many
other funds and then sweeps them through

134
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:55,100
large financial institutions.
So if I send money to a tumbler service,

135
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,740
other people send money
to that Tumbler service,

136
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,550
those funds are then aggregated together
and then split up into little amounts

137
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,510
and then they're sent out through,
through these different gateways. Right?

138
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:10,130
So it's very hard to tell who
originated a transaction. However,

139
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:11,000
in a court of law,

140
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:16,040
this could be deemed as
supporting evidence for
criminal intent by courts. Um,

141
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,490
you could also wash your money,
wash your money by purchasing assets,

142
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,600
real world assets, you know,
um, a basketball court,

143
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,150
a house,
a car,

144
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,600
and then transferring that money back
to bitcoin or another currency and just

145
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:33,650
doing that over and over again. Um,
but that is illegal. And uh, yeah,

146
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,400
so these are all not good methods.
There possible methods,

147
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,700
but they're mostly illegal
and you will get caught. Okay.

148
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,830
So again, is it on traceability
only? Good for criminals? No,

149
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,210
no. It is good for criminals. Yes.
So with paypal in the early days,

150
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,860
so it was bitcoin in the early days.
Uh, but there are legitimate use cases,

151
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,080
um, for non criminals like us, right?

152
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:02,970
So distributed online
payment vulnerability is an
example. So a target, right?

153
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:06,930
Target the corporation or you know,
any of these corporations,

154
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,940
they mind your transaction data to
then use it for predictive analytics to

155
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:15,450
predict what you're going to purchase
and show you ads and other things to make

156
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:18,780
you purchase things. This is
your data. It's very valuable.

157
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,730
And as everything gets automated,

158
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,450
your data will be the only agency
you have in this new world.

159
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,890
It will be the only value of that you
own, right? So you should be paid for it,

160
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,530
right? And so if you understand
where this is all going,

161
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,310
you'll see that data is the most
valuable asset we have, right?

162
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,410
So watch my decentralized
application video,

163
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,540
just search decentralized
applications to Raj,

164
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:43,170
and you'll understand more about what I
mean when I say just how valuable your

165
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:47,430
data is. But the point is that if
your transaction history is anonymous,

166
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,050
then uh, they have to ask you for it,
which means they have to pay you for it.

167
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,860
And as you're getting these payments
from all these different institutions for

168
00:09:55,861 --> 00:10:00,000
your data, you're making something like a
basic income, right? Just from your data.

169
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,290
And that's where we're headed.

170
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,550
And that's the reason we'd want to use
an anonymous currency like Monero for

171
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:09,060
example, right? So of user
visits and online shop.

172
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,630
The online shop collects user data and
then an algorithm predicts purchase

173
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:16,320
probability. You should be paid
for this in short. So let's,

174
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:19,570
let's get into the technical details
now, shall we? So the Crypto,

175
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:24,240
no protocol introduced the idea of
anonymous, not synonymous transactions.

176
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,060
So it all started with bitcoin.

177
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:31,680
So by coin was the first implementation
of an anonymous, uh, currency, right?

178
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,051
It was,

179
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:35,670
this is the first implementation of the
crypto note protocol is this white paper.

180
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,490
And then there were some
offshoots of bite coin, right?

181
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:42,500
So First Buddha coin and then pallet
in coin, Bull Berry, and then Monroe.

182
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,170
And then Minero was the one
that really took off, right?

183
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,990
Minero I think is number 10 right
now on coin market cap.com. It's a,

184
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:51,720
I think $7 billion market cap.
So it's a lot of money.

185
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,550
And all of these currencies that
follows were offshoots of Minero.

186
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,140
They were forks up narrow
with added features.

187
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,460
But monero is really the most stable
and the most popular of the anonymous

188
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:07,050
currencies out there. Okay. So, um,

189
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,340
crypto transactions cannot be followed
through the blockchain in a way that

190
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:14,130
reveals who sent or received addresses.

191
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,240
So Minero is a virgin of crypto
note that hides the sender,

192
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,080
the amount that transaction
broadcast and the receiver.

193
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,280
So the sender is made anonymous
through the use of what are called ring

194
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:27,060
signatures,

195
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,900
which I'll explain the amount through
ring confidential transactions that

196
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,220
brought the transaction broadcasts,
like the location of where you are,

197
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:36,450
your IP address,
et Cetera,

198
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,890
through an ITP router called calvary and
the receiver through the use of stealth

199
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:44,040
addresses. Now I'm going to explain how
all four of these things work. Okay,

200
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,700
so let's get, let's get into this,
right? So Monroe has a lot of features.

201
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:49,560
The two main ones that really matter,

202
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:53,800
that make it unique are and
traceability and, and on.

203
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:57,340
Linkability means if I have a public
address in the narrow network,

204
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,210
no transaction can be linked
back to that public address.

205
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,940
So anyone can take my public
address and they can say, well,

206
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:07,450
what transactions were sent to and
from this address and no one will know.

207
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:12,280
Untraceable means that no one can tell
where any transaction originated from.

208
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,820
So they're, they're two
separate of descriptions there.

209
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,300
They're very similar but not quite,
and I'll talk about each right now.

210
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,350
So for an linkability,
right? So for unlikeability,

211
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,130
here's how bitcoin works in Bitcoin.
Everyone has a public address,

212
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:28,690
25 character public address,

213
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,310
and you use it to receive funds and anyone
can see how much you received, right?

214
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:36,490
Because it's a public ledger.
When sending funds,

215
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:41,140
you announced to the entire
bitcoin network that the
funds you own now belong to

216
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:45,370
the recipients public address.
So that transaction is fully public.

217
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,500
The difference in Minero is
this. So this is an image of, of,

218
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,000
of very high level image of Helmand.
Arrow works.

219
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:54,670
And I'll get into the details in a second.
So in Minero,

220
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,740
everyone has a public address like this,
right?

221
00:12:56,741 --> 00:13:01,570
So it's a much longer public
address. Um, hold on. And,

222
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:02,404
uh,

223
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,970
unlike Bitcoin, your funds are not
associated with your public address.

224
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,730
So when you send funds to
someone else's public address,

225
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,290
you're actually sending those funds to
a randomly created one time destination

226
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,390
address right here.
The commitment public key.

227
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,070
So no public record of sending
or receiving funds. When
I send funds to someone,

228
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,410
they're actually sent
to a onetime address.

229
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,110
It's just created temporarily
just for that transaction.

230
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,590
And that's what's public, not my
public key. Not that, not the scent,

231
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:35,650
not the receivers, public key,
but that commitment publicly.

232
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,770
And so that public
address will never appear.

233
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,700
So your public address will never appear
in the public record of transactions.

234
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,331
Instead,

235
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:48,220
a stealth address is recorded in a way
that only you and the recipient can

236
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:52,690
recognize the incoming funds.
So when the recipient checks for funds,

237
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,350
they need to scan the blockchain to see
if any transactions are destined for

238
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,110
them.
So the recipient has a secret beauty,

239
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,800
which is used to check each transaction
when they scanned the blockchain to see

240
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,090
if it was addressed to them.

241
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,140
And because the recipient is the only
one that knows the secret view key,

242
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,680
only the recipients can see the funds
that have been sent to them. Right.

243
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:13,630
So that's why when you
launch Minero wallet,

244
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,860
it's scanning the blockchain to see
if any transactions have occurred, um,

245
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,630
for you as a recipient. Right? So,

246
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:23,110
but anyone who has your secret view
key can also see what funds you have

247
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:26,620
received, right? So when you send a
transaction, right? So it's an input,

248
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,620
the output is going to be this
commitment, public key, which is public.

249
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,680
And then these two secret view keys,
one for the sender.

250
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:36,040
So I can see how much I sent and one for
the receivers so they can see how much

251
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,460
they received. But publicly speaking,
there's just this one time address,

252
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,340
not linked to either you or the center.
Okay.

253
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,620
And so that's the idea
of stealth addresses.

254
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:48,820
And what that does is it
hides the receiver. Okay?

255
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,530
Right? So, um, it's also untraceable.
So we talked about an linkability,

256
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:57,590
but it's also untraceable. Well, let
me talk about an traceability. Okay.

257
00:14:57,591 --> 00:15:02,030
So for an traceability, that's where the
use of ring signatures come into play,

258
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,930
right? So for ring signatures in Bitcoin,
when you, when you have an input,

259
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:08,330
so some incoming transaction,
right?

260
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,290
It uses its signed using a
signature by some identity, right?

261
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:16,550
And then all inputs are clearly linked
to a previous transaction, right?

262
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:20,660
So anyone can view this input and say,
oh, that's where it originated from.

263
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,600
But in Minero when you,
when you receive an input,

264
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,450
it's not just one input
that you're receiving it.

265
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,550
There's several and they're
all linked together.

266
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,260
So as a ring and all of these us,

267
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:35,870
all of these inputs are signed using,
uh, using what's called a ring signature.

268
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,920
And then any input is going to be linked
to more than one previous transaction.

269
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,020
So no one will be able to tell who that
input originated from because it's a

270
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:49,700
part of a ring of transactions. Let
me go into what I mean. Okay. Okay.

271
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:51,500
So here's what I mean by ring signatures.

272
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,180
So the Minero money supply is
divided into outputs. Just like a,

273
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:59,570
the u s dollar is divided in $2
bills, quarters, dimes, pennies.

274
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,540
Monero is divided into outputs,
divisions of currency.

275
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:07,160
And these outputs store a certain value
of Minero each and the value they hold

276
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:08,480
can change over time.

277
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,710
So suppose that these are all the outputs
that exist and the one you control and

278
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:16,520
can spend is highlighted in red.
So let's say these are all the outputs,

279
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:19,670
all the green ones. And I own
this red one. Number Eight,

280
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,780
which let's say is the equivalent of life,

281
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,800
let's say $300 and some
of these are like 200.

282
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,060
Some of these are $10 in Minero
currency, right? And, uh,

283
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,960
when I create a Monero transaction,

284
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,570
I'm using a ring signature to hide
which input is actually being spent. So,

285
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,240
and the way this has done is
by making it seem like as,

286
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,090
as if all the chosen inputs
are the possible real center.

287
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,000
So when I send an input,
when I send a transaction,

288
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,010
there are five other transactions that
are picked by random from other nodes in

289
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,500
the network, and we don't need
their permission to choose those.

290
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:58,820
They're just there to obfuscate where
that transaction is coming from, right?

291
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:02,030
They're all linked together in a ring
and they're all signed using a ring

292
00:17:02,031 --> 00:17:03,530
signature.
So it's so,

293
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:07,460
so in the photo you're real input is red
and the five selected inputs are light

294
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:10,310
blue and these inputs can be
controlled by anyone else.

295
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:13,040
We don't need their permission to add
their input to the rings signature.

296
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,390
We signed them all such that an outside
observer can not determine which is the

297
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:19,730
real one being spent.
Right?

298
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,880
And so once we have
selected the other inputs,

299
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,210
we need to finish creating
the ring CT ring signature.

300
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,130
So the ring CT ring signature is used
to hide the amount that is spent.

301
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,570
The rinks signature hides that the sender,
the stealth address highs,

302
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:38,780
the receiver and the ring
CT spring signature hides,

303
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:40,310
the amount of that is being sent.

304
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,540
So you sign it in such a way that all
these inputs appear to be the real one

305
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:48,140
used. And this signature includes
several other important elements.

306
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,020
So this is a more detailed view of what
a transaction looks like in the narrow

307
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:54,720
network, right? So when
I make a transaction,

308
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,090
there are up to six other transactions
that are added to the, to the ring, right?

309
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,830
All these rings, rings are signed using
a ring signature rights. And importantly,

310
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:08,880
very critically, a key image is
created from all of these transactions.

311
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,410
That key image is one hash and it's
given to the network as proof that the

312
00:18:13,411 --> 00:18:15,450
signature was created appropriately.

313
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,920
The network verifies that this image has
not been used before to prevent double

314
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:20,490
spending.

315
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,000
So it's got to list in the blockchain
of all of these key images and they'll

316
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:27,660
look for match has this key image
being sent before? Yes. Okay.

317
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:31,980
It's double spending. You can't do it.
No, this is a valid transaction. Go ahead.

318
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,630
And so that's how a double spending
is presented using the, the key image.

319
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,760
Next is the Peterson commitment.

320
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,240
So this is used to prevent other people
from knowing how much is actually being

321
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:43,980
spent. So it's a formula, right?

322
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,310
So you have the actual
amount that is spent a,

323
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,720
it's multiplied by a random number and
this constant value here and the result

324
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,650
is this number that is a result of the
formula. And that that is a commitment,

325
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,220
right?

326
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,940
You can use this commitment to commit to
spending a certain value that only you

327
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:01,050
have the authority to spend,

328
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,740
but other people don't know what
that value is because it's, it's, um,

329
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,630
the result of this formula, right? It's
not the, it's not the original amount.

330
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:13,200
It's a result of this formula. And
that's what the public, right? So,

331
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:18,780
um, so the Peterson commitment
is a critical component
of the ring confidential

332
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:23,610
transaction or ring CT hides the actual
value by adding a random number x.

333
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,300
The commission value is calculated for
the set of inputs and outputs in the

334
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:30,090
transaction and it is
broadcast to the network.

335
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,160
So that's what the network
sees is the result of that,

336
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,760
of that Peterson
commitment formula and it,

337
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,940
and so that all comes together to
form the ring. Ct rings a country,

338
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:43,170
and the result is an unknown amount of
Monroe being spent. That commitment.

339
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:46,920
Public key is what's used by the network
to verify that commitment that I talked

340
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:51,150
about before. Right? So how do
the outputs get used over time?

341
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:54,510
So we can compare a bitcoin Emma
narrow to find out, right? So,

342
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,820
and this theoretical history of the
outputs, we control all the blogs.

343
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:02,370
Highlighted reds are the ones
where the output appears.

344
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,760
And if this was for Bitcoin, we would
eat really easily be able to tell.

345
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,780
But this output was transferred from
user a to B to c. But with narrow,

346
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,110
it's not so simple. There
are three reasons for an
output to show up in a block.

347
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,750
Either it's new money and
a coin base transaction.

348
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:20,070
It was actually spent or it was added
as a decoy and a ring signature.

349
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,020
I also want to talk about covert,
right?

350
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,920
So we talked about how the sender
is hidden using ring signatures.

351
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:28,500
We talked about how the amount
is hidden using ring CT.

352
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,560
We talked about how the receiver
is hidden using stealth addresses,

353
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,070
but how about the uh, location,
right? Like where you are,

354
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,300
your Ip addressed and that's um,

355
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,460
office skated using this ITP
routing service called covert.

356
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,630
It's kind of like tour,

357
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,110
but basically your transaction is routed
through all these different nodes,

358
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,140
these Internet, um, uh,

359
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,040
what do they call these internet
invisible Internet project nodes, right?

360
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,470
I ITP nodes and these nodes,

361
00:20:53,471 --> 00:20:56,980
pasture messages along and have no
visibility over what is in them.

362
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,780
And that's under construction right now.

363
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,520
It's getting better and better over time.

364
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,000
And you can view its progress on get hub.
It's all public and open source,

365
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,840
but it's double spending proof,
right? Because we talked about that,

366
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,010
that key image that the whole blockchain
has a copy of and it's blockchain

367
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:15,400
analysis resistant. Not
Completely, nothing is,

368
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:19,090
but it's the most blockchain analysis
resistance cryptocurrency that exists

369
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,310
currently. And uh, yeah, so
this is a huge high level,

370
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:24,550
high level overview of
everything I've talked about.

371
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,790
If you want to go into more details,
really look into this. But uh, yeah,

372
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:32,290
those four components are really the
key features of, of Monero. Lastly,

373
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,590
adaptive parameters, like we said
before on the narrow transaction,

374
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,390
has an ambiguous output origin,

375
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,750
an unknown amount in a commitment
and an unknown receiver.

376
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,550
So for every transaction on the network,

377
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,110
all of the information stored on
the blockchain is obfuscated, right?

378
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,990
So let's talk about how to,
lastly,

379
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:52,990
I want to talk about how to buy him an
Arrow and then how to mine Minero. Okay.

380
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:55,810
In terms of how to buy Minero,
I've got this great link here.

381
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,650
It's in the Jupiter notebook in the
get hub description to check it out.

382
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:03,610
But Change Lee is the best
site I found two by Minero.

383
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:07,720
You can buy it using visa or
mastercard. Um, there's a,

384
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:12,721
you can buy with bitcoin and you can
buy it with even us dollar if you so

385
00:22:13,451 --> 00:22:17,080
pleased or doge or all of
these currencies. So definitely
check out this website,

386
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:18,920
change Lee and um,

387
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,870
to mind Minero I found
this a really great, uh,

388
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,280
python repository that
you can clone in docker.

389
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:30,820
It's got the all the docker
dependencies ready for Mac and Linux.

390
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,090
You can run it and you can start
mining it as well. And a, yeah,

391
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,320
it's going to be awesome.
But yeah,

392
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:38,440
it wraps this javascript
mining library for coin hive.

393
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,920
That's kind of like this generic mining
library for a bunch of cryptocurrencies,

394
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,750
but it works with any Minero pool.

395
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:47,230
So these are pools of miners based
on the stratum mining protocol.

396
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,890
You can set up your own pool. There's
no depth feet, there's no ad block,

397
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,180
and you can use any pool you'd like,
but you clone this repository repository,

398
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:58,360
you CD into it, you build it with
Docker, and then you run it with docker.

399
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,540
Please subscribe for more programming
videos. And for now, I've got a plan,

400
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:04,750
my scaling strategy for the New Year.
So thanks for watching.
