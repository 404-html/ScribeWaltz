00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,510
In the past few years,

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:06,310
we've seen incredible advances in
artificial intelligence and blockchain

3
00:00:06,311 --> 00:00:10,360
technology that have enabled
a new breed of applications,

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,170
decentralized applications
or Dapps for short.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,410
These are open source governed by the
community and crucially profitable for

6
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:24,160
both the creators and the users.
Open OpenBazaar, for example,

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,220
let's buyers and sellers connect with
each other directly with zero restrictions

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,190
on trade steam.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,200
It is a decentralized social network
where users get paid for the content.

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,460
They post opus let's music creators
keep all of the revenue they earn and

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,900
[inaudible] allows its users to earn
money by contributing to a crowd sourced

12
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,980
hedge fund.
This space is just getting started.

13
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:53,740
A new stack is emerging for developers,

14
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,100
one that will fuel the next
wave of global companies.

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,270
Etherium acts as a decentralized
computing platform.

16
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:06,510
The interplanetary file system has a
decentralized storage network and deep

17
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:11,881
learning as a layer of intelligence able
to accomplish almost any task if given

18
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,150
the right Dataset.

19
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,410
I'm so Roger Vol and this is the
first course in the school of Ai.

20
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,970
I'll show you how to combine these
technologies together to build your own

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,770
decentralized application.

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,600
We'll build dapps together that
cover a huge range of use cases from

23
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,100
decentralized gaming to ride
sharing to social networks.

24
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:38,290
Along the way, you'll have access to
an amazing community of peers, quizzes,

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,550
graded projects,

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,080
weekly live streams where
I answer questions while
building demos and your own

27
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:48,220
certificate of completion timestamped
on the blockchain for permanence.

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,510
So if you want to be a part of the future
of the web, get hype and sign up today.
