1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,830
That'd be good.

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,400
It's the right ask you use
your content creator car.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,950
The instructor I Dang,

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,960
I love have you tried to eat natural
cause he has a mission is by educating

5
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:16,830
developers to build Ai.
He's also a dad and an entrepreneur,

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,650
founder of a crowd funding platform
for developers called Harvey. Uh,

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,470
he developed Ios apps

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,230
and then has a host of open source work
sites that you like to travel musician

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,420
who was Morton and scuba diver.

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,800
And then I was like
tempted to say hello world.

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,550
I think I'll need that
again.

12
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,090
Welcome.
All right.

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,700
Hi everybody. All right.
Testing for eight, seven, six.

14
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,870
That's the next code for Bitcoin. So buy
it at that price. I'm just kidding. Okay.

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,000
Uh, yeah, yeah. You know the,

16
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:02,410
the end of that description was like
this really old description that O'Reilly

17
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:05,530
wrote when I wrote the book decentralized
applications like four years ago,

18
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,000
which at the time Havi was
yes, a crowdsourcing platform
that I helped create,

19
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:13,420
but now it's deprecated it et cetera.
You know how stuff moves in software.

20
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:17,680
It's just like hearing God and
like 30 seconds. But, uh, yeah,

21
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:20,830
so this talk is called decentralized.
Let me move out the way.

22
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,200
Let me just get a feel for how
this is going to work. Okay.

23
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,310
Decentralize artificial intelligence.
That's the name of this dog.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,760
It's really combining two
technologies that are very hot today.

25
00:01:30,761 --> 00:01:34,210
Deep learning and blockchain. We know
about these two technologies, right?

26
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,560
Even if you're a data science,

27
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,550
you studied blockchain at at some point
it's articles. It's, it's hard not to,

28
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,940
to look at this space with some,
some level of interest.

29
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,750
So we're going to talk about how to
combine these two technologies together to

30
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:47,920
make something beautiful.

31
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:54,160
So I want to start with a quote by
a very well known public figure,

32
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:57,460
or shall we say
the quote,

33
00:01:57,461 --> 00:01:59,920
is he alone?

34
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,530
Who owns the youth games for the future?

35
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,990
And this is by Adolf Hitler.

36
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,570
I just want you to think about
this quote for a second. He alone,

37
00:02:10,571 --> 00:02:14,380
who owns the youth? The gains, the
future. What did he mean by that?

38
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,080
Clearly he knew what he was talking about.

39
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,470
He was able to influence the youth to
kill people by the hundreds of thousands.

40
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,340
So I want to ask you guys this question.
Who owns the youth?

41
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,170
Single word answers is an open question.
You can raise your hand once a youth.

42
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,250
Yeah. Facebook. Okay.
Really Smart Guy. Any other,

43
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,780
any other, um, snapchat. Okay. You
guys know what's up. Yeah. Yeah,

44
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,510
exactly. Um, yeah. Facebook,

45
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:53,330
snapchat, those are, those are
some possible answers. But let's,

46
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:56,390
let's talk about what the, what the
larger answer to this question is.

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,810
Who owns the youth?
Who owns the future?

48
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,750
So in the 80s, the web was
created, et Cetera, et Cetera,

49
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:09,250
or ride the worldwide web of, you know,
we, we, we know that the web was created,

50
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:11,680
but I remember going to,
Sir sir, I was in Geneva,

51
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,460
had to talk him at cern in Geneva and
it was amazing. Like the data scientist,

52
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:20,350
they're like, we were getting
so technical, they knew
exactly what was going on.

53
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:23,950
Their questions were so beautifully
orchestrated. They were challenging me.

54
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:27,410
It was amazing. It was people, I mean, the
amount of data that cern has is amazing.

55
00:03:27,411 --> 00:03:30,670
Like, anyway, that's a
tangent. When I was at cern,

56
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,040
I remember seeing Tim
Berners Lee's office,

57
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:37,330
the creator of http hypertext transfer
protocol for the worldwide web.

58
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,410
Arguably without that protocol,
everything that we're doing, carousel,

59
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:43,570
everything about the web wouldn't exist.

60
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,300
And I remember seeing his office and just
standing there for a second and being

61
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:50,620
like, wow, this is where it all began.
And then I backed up for a second.

62
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,930
There was just like, oh my God and all
these kids are coming in. I was like,

63
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:54,580
oh I bet I bet her backup.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,630
And these kids started coming in in
mass and they were like, I dunno,

65
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,850
eight to eight or 10 years old.
It was like a school field trip.

66
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,190
And they came in and they saw
and then the teacher was like,

67
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,460
or the guidance and this is where
the world wide web was created.

68
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:09,880
And the kids were like, oh my God. And
they took a snapchat and immediately left.

69
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,730
Like they didn't even like some
of the kids just when they,

70
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:14,590
one of them when the guide said
that they just got and kept walking.

71
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,050
So that's who wants a future snapchat,

72
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,820
right?
Cause it gets you snapchat.

73
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,390
That was web 1.0

74
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,400
this man is web 2.0

75
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,110
who knows who this guy is?
Just shout it out. Jeff Bezos,

76
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:38,630
who is the richest guy in the
world right now. Jeff basis. Yeah.

77
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,330
In 98 this was Jeff basis.
He was selling books.

78
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,410
That's all he wanted to do with
amazon.com it was selling books in a very,

79
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:50,470
very small office. His office
was just a desk, right?

80
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,730
And now Amazon is more
powerful than Walmart.

81
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,160
It's market cap is higher than Walmart.

82
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,240
It's market cap is higher than any book
seller in the world. Barnes and nobles,

83
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:05,230
et Cetera. All of these global
brands, Amazon eats them up literally.

84
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:07,000
Quite literally.
Amazon acquires them.

85
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,790
So Jeff Bezos owns Amazon. He, so
he's the largest shareholder in Amazon

86
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,440
and Amazon is just one example.
We've got snapchat, we've got Google,

87
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:18,670
we've got Facebook.

88
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,990
And these entities that we've created
over time have been a result of

89
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:27,340
entrepreneurs saying, how do we take web
1.0 and how do we capitalize off of it?

90
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,030
How do we create something where we
can make money off of it, which is,

91
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:31,930
it makes sense,
right?

92
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:35,490
This is a beautiful technology and the
initial aims for the web were beautiful.

93
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,490
They were very pure.

94
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,020
Let's take this decentralized Internet
that Tim Berners Lee helped create and

95
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:44,830
let's create services on top of it, right?
So let's, let's let me take the server.

96
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,730
Right? And it started having, you know,
all of these computers talk to each other,

97
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:52,150
which was very hard to do at the time.
Let me just make one central server,

98
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,390
let me make, let me use this to
http protocol to create this,

99
00:05:55,391 --> 00:06:00,391
get and sets transfer and store all of
that data on the central server like

100
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:05,510
that. Right? And it made it easy
to do things like have an Amazon,

101
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,060
have an Ebay, have a marketplace
that was social network,

102
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:09,080
have a ride sharing service.

103
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,800
All this stuff that we use today is
because we were able to create these

104
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,520
centralized services, it worked really
well and there were no problems. In fact,

105
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,730
it was a faster way to do things,
right? It was a faster way.

106
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:22,190
And it was a more efficient way.
It just worked,

107
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,490
but what's happened now is really bad.
Objectively speaking,

108
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:31,490
this is not my opinion. It
is objective Lee, a bad fit,

109
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,750
and this is not just coming from me. This
is coming from the creators of the web.

110
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,720
Tim Berners, Lee, Jerome Linear,

111
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,410
the pioneers of the Internet don't
like what has happened today,

112
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:47,310
what the Internet has become.
How do we fix this?

113
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,280
What does web 3.0 look like not web 1.0
or 2.0 not having centralized services

114
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,340
but decentralized services.
What the web,

115
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,150
the original vision for the web
was to have decentralized services

116
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,990
in a good economy.
We monetize more and more,

117
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,630
but in a bad economy we
monetize less than less.

118
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,510
What is the most valuable
resource we have today?

119
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:12,770
Can anyone answer that question?

120
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:16,340
What is the most valuable
resource at any person has today?

121
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,520
Yes? Another word for knowledge
is data. Data. Exactly,

122
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,710
but what are we doing
with our data right now?

123
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,840
We are giving it away for free in return
for a free service. Right? That's,

124
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,180
that's a part of the terms of use for
all of these services. We use Facebook,

125
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,600
Facebook's terms of service,
snapchat, Internet service.
You let us use your data.

126
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,900
We can learn from your data.
We can profit off of your data.

127
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:43,250
We can sell your data, and in return
we'll let you use a service. That's fine,

128
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,120
right?
It works.

129
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,530
But what's happened is this is shrinking
the economy because all of that data is

130
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:50,720
being concentrated in the central servers.

131
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,620
He's connected courts that
everybody has a connector, right?

132
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:55,790
These are gateways for the wet.

133
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,400
We need that data because as automation
technology gets better and better as we

134
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,330
learn to automate all of these things,
the only agency,

135
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:08,780
the only power you're going to have
in this new world that we're very fast

136
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:12,140
moving to is your data, but right
now you're giving it away for free.

137
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,820
So what value do you bring to the world
when you don't own your data? Nothing.

138
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,470
Zero. You have no value. If you give
away your data, you have no value.

139
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,490
So you need to own your data and
profit from your data, right?

140
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,010
This is a kin to something
like a basic income.

141
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:31,490
When robotics and automation technology
and AI and deep learning and machine

142
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:34,430
learning, when all of that gets good
enough in the next five to 10 years,

143
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:38,810
probably everything will be automated.
Everything.

144
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,120
Everything that can be
automated will be automated.

145
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,920
I just made that up on the spot.
You call it my loan.

146
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,580
There's accountability as well.
Okay,

147
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,780
so accountability is we don't know what
they're doing with our data. Right?

148
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,810
First of all, we want to own our data.
We want to profit off of our data.

149
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,430
Right now we're giving it away for free
and they're doing something with it that

150
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:58,700
we don't even know what it is.
They don't have to tell us. Right.

151
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,150
They don't have to tell us what
they're doing with the data.

152
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,970
They could give it away to governments.
They could use to spy on people.

153
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,090
I was having a conversation with
a friend a few days ago. Okay.

154
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,560
We were talking about something,

155
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:12,561
a single topic later on on
her phone in the ad it said,

156
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,980
the topic that we were talking about,
they are listening on our phones.

157
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,610
They are listening in real time.
Facebook is listening. Our phones,

158
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:21,361
they're listening to us.

159
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:25,060
They are using that data because there
are no checks and balances. That's just,

160
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,500
that's just what's happened. There are
so powerful. They're all around us.

161
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,580
The Internet of things is really a
set of spy devices for these central

162
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,640
authorities and last week we are trying
to solve AI and I'm going to talk about

163
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:40,050
that at the very,
very end,

164
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:43,710
but we're trying to solve AI and we need
a way to do that and this is how we do

165
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:47,370
that. All of these problems are
shrinking economy, data, ownership,

166
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,980
accountability and towards
general intelligence.

167
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,250
All events can be sold if we moved to
web 3.0 so you guys wouldn't with me like

168
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,280
we need to move to web 3.0 rights.
This is the, this is the plan.

169
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,580
How do we do this? So I'm going
to tell you how to do this. Okay,

170
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,400
I'm going to tell you how to do this.
I'm going to show you right now.

171
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,570
How did you, you ready? Okay. There we
go. It all starts with something very,

172
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:10,404
very simple.

173
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,420
The link list. Oh, here at saint
the link list before. Awesome. Yeah.

174
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,310
Okay, so the link list is a
very, very simple data structure.

175
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,010
I've got the code for it right here.
Don't worry if you've never coded before,

176
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:30,650
don't worry about it. It's only
you know, 12 lines of code,

177
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,440
12 single lines in python.

178
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,730
And what this does is it creates a
data structure called a linked list.

179
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:43,090
And a link list is just a very simple
object that's linked to the next object

180
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,840
that's linked to the next object
that's linked to the next object.

181
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:51,260
And it just goes on it. But as much as
you want. And we can make one in python,

182
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:55,340
we'll just say class node. This is
a class, this thing, this square,

183
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,480
and let's say, let's give it
some functions. Get data. Okay.

184
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:01,100
That's going to give us
what's inside of here,

185
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:05,240
which is if we could store
it the word hello, get next,

186
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,130
get the next note in the list.
Stack sent data.

187
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,450
What do I want to put in this thing?
Hello. A number on an image or video,

188
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:19,510
whatever data and set next one's gonna
be the the data and the next link to the

189
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:23,720
next note in the link list.
That's it is a simple data structure.

190
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,490
This is going to help us move towards
web 3.0 you might be thinking,

191
00:11:28,491 --> 00:11:29,241
wait a second.
No,

192
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:32,270
this has been around since the 80s how
is this going to help me with anything?

193
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,410
So let's take this link list.
Let's,

194
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,470
let's take this linguist and let store
a copy of it on let's say a million

195
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:45,500
computers. Let's just say, hey
guys, I've got this link list.

196
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,040
I want you to store a copy of it.
And inside of this link list,

197
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,770
we're not going to store the word
Holo APP does nothing for us.

198
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,890
What's instead store I transaction
and not just one transaction,

199
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,480
several transactions, in fact, millions
of transactions between people payments.

200
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:06,040
Let's store that and let's try to make
it so that no one can modify this linked

201
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:10,540
list. No one can change the transactions
in this link list. How do we do that?

202
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,010
Okay.

203
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,870
What if we had a separate system of
people and all they did was they solved

204
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,420
random mathematical
problems with our computer,

205
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,080
and this required a lot of
computing power, like a lot.

206
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,290
So much so that in order for you to be
able to change any of the data in any of

207
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:30,430
these nodes,

208
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:35,110
you would have to have more than 50%
of the computing power of all of those

209
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,850
notes that are solving these
random mathematical problems. Now,

210
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:44,590
what if the amount of computing power
in those notes was greater than the 500

211
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:46,720
fastest supercomputers
in the world combined?

212
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:50,590
Well then you would have to have more
computing power and the 500 fastest

213
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:55,360
supercomputers in the world combined to
change this, the data in this link list.

214
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,370
What that means is no one could
change the data in this link list.

215
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,930
So if we did that,

216
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,490
we had a link list that everybody sorted
a copy of that no one could change the

217
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:07,324
data in.

218
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,040
We would call it a blockchain.
And that's what the Bitcoin blockchain is.

219
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,440
It's a glorified linked list. That's
it. It's a glorified link list.

220
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:24,010
And instead of calling them links
or notes, we call them blocks.

221
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,600
And the reason it's called a chain is
because it's not just pointing to a random

222
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:30,550
node with the word hello in it.

223
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,800
It's pointing to a random node with
transactions in it and the reason that the

224
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:40,510
transactions are stored as his
tree decision tree to be specific,

225
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,250
we can call it a Merkle Dag as well.

226
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,490
We don't have to talk about
that is because that's just
a more efficient way of

227
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,870
storing and retrieving from it.

228
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:49,810
But you can just think of it at an
abstract level as just the list of

229
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:52,630
transactions.
And that's a blockchain.

230
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,430
So this is a very new idea, right?
This, this was you know, eight nine,

231
00:13:57,431 --> 00:14:00,790
10 years ago when Satoshi
invented this, this, this concept,

232
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,530
it was the first time where we could say,

233
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,100
I'm going to store my transactions
in this data structure.

234
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,930
That's what the blockchain is.
It's a data structure.

235
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,380
I'm going to store my data and this
thing and no one's going to be able to

236
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:14,470
modify those transactions.
That's why we use banks, right?

237
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:18,760
There are only a few real banks in the
world that we trust enough to store our

238
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:20,070
money in our,
you know,

239
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,500
something very valuable because we
trust that they're not gonna modify

240
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,470
essentially the,
the list of transactions in our account.

241
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,940
They're not going to modify it.
They're going to say,

242
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,140
this is the amount you had before and
this is the amount you have now. Trust us.

243
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,520
Right? And that's it. We trust them.

244
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,850
But what if we could store our money in
a way that we didn't have to trust the

245
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:38,200
bank so there's not a third party.

246
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,550
This is the first time that we've
ever been able to do that. The,

247
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:46,450
in the advent of this data structure.
Right. That's cool. Okay. Okay.

248
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:48,070
We don't need a bank. Great. So what,

249
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:53,270
what else could we store this
thing besides transactions?

250
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,410
We don't need a trusted third
party to store our transactions.

251
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,830
We don't need to trust a
third party to store our data.

252
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,460
We don't need to trust a
third party to store our code.

253
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,930
What about our web apps?

254
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,960
What about our apps like
snapchat and Facebook and Google?

255
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,770
What if we could store code in this thing,
not just transactions.

256
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:23,050
And that is what the theory is. Blockchain
is they took bitcoin's blockchain,

257
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,670
the added a bunch of other data
like logs, difficulty, timestamps,

258
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,470
mixes. But really what
matters is this, the code,

259
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,660
you don't just the store transactions in
the ethereum blockchain, you store code.

260
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,080
What that means is every computer,
every note,

261
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,030
remember it's a glorified link clicks.

262
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:48,130
Every node in the network is storing
coat instead of pushing code to a single

263
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:51,370
server like Heroku, right? That's
how we usually build web apps.

264
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,360
We store it on a single node
that everybody has to agree upon.

265
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,460
So in order to modify that code,

266
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,180
you would have to have more computing
power than the 500 fastest supercomputers

267
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,223
in the world combined.

268
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,860
So this is a trustless way to build web
apps and that's how we're going to get

269
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:12,130
to web 3.0 so what does code
on a theory I'm look like?

270
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,833
Go back

271
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,723
this,

272
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,820
this 17 line of code snippet is what
you would call an initial coin offering.

273
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,740
17 lines of code is responsible
for raising more money.

274
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:36,770
And the past two years that I've been
raised by every IPO in the past 10 we're

275
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:40,350
talking about more than a hundred
billion US dollars worth of,

276
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,590
of investments from the public,
the public,

277
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,000
every ICO that you're seeing
these days is a result of this.

278
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,350
Someone takes this as a variable
that says how many, you know,

279
00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:57,351
shares or coins or tokens do I want and
how much do I want to sell those tokens

280
00:16:57,811 --> 00:17:02,250
for? They take this code and they push
it to the ethereum blockchain via a push

281
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:06,870
command in terminal or they can do it
via a web app and then they have this

282
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:10,350
public address, you know, 25
characters or core more and they say,

283
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,730
here's the address, ICO time invest.
And then people just, you know,

284
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,130
30 million in a single day.
This is kind of stuff happens.

285
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,600
This is very powerful and
no one controls this, right?

286
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:25,380
This is the advent of a new structure,
similar to a corporation,

287
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:28,140
a new type of institution that no one,
no one controls.

288
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,320
And we can do this with the
ethereum blockchain because
we don't have to trust a

289
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:36,090
third party, not just a bank, but
even the government legal documents,

290
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,570
things like that. We can build these
with smart contracts things every,

291
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,720
every time. We'd had to require
to trust the third party.

292
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,920
We can remove that and push that
instead in the form of contracts to the

293
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:47,754
ethereum blockchain.

294
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,280
There's a problem though,
so

295
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,480
if you think about, okay, well I'm going
to make a web app and it's going to,

296
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,500
it's going to pull from the weather.com
Api and it's just going to tell you the

297
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:04,040
weather. That's it. Okay, so
it's called my weather app,

298
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,660
decentralized.com and all of
this places a single text.

299
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,550
The weather today in Singapore,

300
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,710
and it pulls that data from weather.com
is Api with the parameter of Singapore.

301
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,690
Now it returns the result and a displays
that, right, whatever degrees Celsius.

302
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,550
If we were to do that on the ethereum
blockchain, it wouldn't work. Why?

303
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,850
Because every single node in the network
has to pull back that data at the same

304
00:18:30,981 --> 00:18:34,430
time, right? Because they're all
executing that code at the same time.

305
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,730
But what the weather changes over time,
right?

306
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,690
So they would all have to agree upon
the time. How do you do that? You can't,

307
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,440
right?

308
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,440
So the solution to this is to have what's
called an oracle and the oracle is a

309
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:52,901
trusted third party source that speaks
to the web that the ethereum blockchain

310
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:55,520
can pull from. So you might be
thinking, wait a second, okay,

311
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:58,370
I thought this was trustless. What does,
what does it deal with this oracle thing?

312
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,990
There are networks of Oracle's out there,
you know,

313
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,920
delegations four or five of them and
they can all agree, a crew agree on,

314
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,050
they can have consensus on some data,

315
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,970
but this is a solution to pulling data
from the, from the web 2.0 in the,

316
00:19:12,971 --> 00:19:15,650
in the form of API APIs until
we have a better solution.

317
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:17,570
But that's how it works right now.

318
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,360
So you might be thinking,
okay,

319
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,250
we can have our application level
constructs on the ethereum blockchain,

320
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,490
we can pull data in the form
of oracles from the web.

321
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,650
But then how do we store like huge
databases onto the blockchain?

322
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,520
Could we do that? I mean you could
technically, but then every minor,

323
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,450
everyone who's downloading a copy of this
blockchain within have to store all of

324
00:19:43,451 --> 00:19:47,500
that data on their personal computer.
Facebook has a lot of data.

325
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,590
If we were in a decentralized Facebook
and say this is the authority on version

326
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:51,424
of Facebook,

327
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,690
everybody would have to store a copy
of Facebook that's just infeasible.

328
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,280
So what we need, it's not just a, an
application level construct that says,

329
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,630
here are usernames here, your
tweets here, you know, et cetera.

330
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,080
We needed to point to some kind
of decentralized data store,

331
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,490
a storage for data that is
not owned by anyone. Now,

332
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,130
the best solution for this that I've
found is called the interplanetary file

333
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:19,480
system. So high PFS is big. There's a,
there's a lot to go into about IPFS.

334
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,920
Um, it's, it's, it's, it's a
beautiful system the way it works,

335
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,730
but essentially it's a group of
computers that all agree on some data.

336
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,440
So if I want to push some data
to Google cloud or AWS right now,

337
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,350
right? The services owned that data,
right? So I would say, you know,

338
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:39,220
I've got some huge video,
let me push it to Google cloud or AWS,

339
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:43,810
and they would store it.
How do we be centralized that with IPFS,

340
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,080
it's a network of computers who are
saying, I'm an IPFS snowed, right?

341
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,090
When you pushed that video to IPFS,

342
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,830
they not everybody's stores a copy of
that video. One person will for our copy,

343
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,760
that video will be split up into several
parts and replicated across the network.

344
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,200
So then you might be thinking, well,
what if someone deletes their node? Well,

345
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,130
there's already replications everywhere.
How are these nodes incentivized? Well,

346
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:09,970
there's this idea of file coin where
these nodes or pay to store this data.

347
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,920
So it's how to incentivize these notes.

348
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,220
So that's kind of our complete list of
solutions for this web 3.0 we can have a

349
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:19,810
data store called IPFS.

350
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:25,020
We can have etherium to store code and
application level constructs and Oracle's

351
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:28,600
to pull data from the web. This
is, this is how web 3.0 works.

352
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,040
This is the new stack.

353
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,210
So this is how it works, right? If
you're a young references content,

354
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,680
big data that's stored on IPFS,
it gets that static content.

355
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,420
That distributed application gets that
content from IPFS and it gets the global

356
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:58,150
state or theory. It's, it's
a global state machine,

357
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,700
so if we combine IPFS and Ethereum,

358
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:04,840
we can build these distributed
decentralized applications. Right,

359
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,120
but what's a talk?
What is,

360
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:11,050
what is really a talk without
talking about deep learning, right?

361
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,270
Deep learning is where it's at.

362
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,360
We've got this thing called a
neuron in our brain theirselves.

363
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,200
Billions of these cells in our
brain and they make us intelligence.

364
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,380
They give us consciousness and
love and emotion, all these things.

365
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,260
We feel it because of this thing.
It's a collection of them.

366
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,290
I don't know how they work.
You go to do you either.

367
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,920
There's nobody needs is the most
renowned neuroscientists in the world.

368
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,030
No one knows how this thing works,
but in the 50s some guy was like,

369
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,060
I mean I get the basic idea. There is some
data that's being fed into this thing.

370
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:48,190
Something's happening here and then
it sends it out and then very roughly,

371
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,110
very, very roughly. He
created a mathematical model
for this thing. He says,

372
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,560
he said, we have these inputs. Let
me just take this, these inputs,

373
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,820
these are a set of numbers. Let me
apply some kind of summation to this.

374
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,440
And then some kind of
nonlinear entity as in, um,

375
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,990
let me take this data
and make sure that it,

376
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,790
it can learn a function that
can learn any type of function,

377
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,700
both the linear and a nonlinear function
that means any type of function.

378
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,950
And then I'll put a result, right? So it
takes some data, it does something to it.

379
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,150
And then it outputs that data.

380
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,990
And what happens here has been the topic
of debate amongst many researchers,

381
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:27,880
like what do we do to
it? But the, but the,

382
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,100
but the idea is the same as
when we take some input data,

383
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,600
apply some kind of function to it,

384
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:34,790
and then we have an output and then we
change these things together. So we got,

385
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,230
we have a lot of [inaudible]. And what
happened is the deep learning revolution,

386
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:42,110
right? All of these things that humans
are good at. Image recognition, uh,

387
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,590
driving cars, et Cetera, all
these things. For some reason,

388
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:51,350
this model that resembles
the human brain works well,

389
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:56,000
sometimes even better than we do. So
this is kind of, this is mind boggling,

390
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,800
right? On silicon, these chips,
we roughly estimated the,

391
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,950
the rules that are happening here and
it's doing something that even humans

392
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:04,784
can't even do.

393
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,900
Could there be some universal law of
intelligence out there that we're just

394
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,740
slowly approximating, that we're
just slowly coming close to probably.

395
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,640
And this is our first step there.
Deep Learning, incredible technology.

396
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,340
Okay, so how do we combine
all three of these things?

397
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,120
How do we combine IPFS if
theory in department? Well,

398
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:28,720
there's one really great example that
I know of called the open mind that a

399
00:24:28,721 --> 00:24:32,740
friend of mine has built with his
community. But the idea is this.

400
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,500
If I'm a data scientist
and you have some data,

401
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,950
if I want to train my deep
learning model on your data,

402
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,780
how do I do that in a way that involves
no third party where you don't have to

403
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:46,360
trust me that I'm going to look at
your data. Say it's very sensitive,

404
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:48,370
like patient data,
like for hospital records.

405
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,800
How do I train my model
to learn from your data?

406
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,370
So I can make predictions about say cancer
or some other disease without looking

407
00:24:54,371 --> 00:24:55,540
at your personal information.

408
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,710
So this is a perfect example of how
you can put these three technologies

409
00:24:59,711 --> 00:25:03,900
together. You can have IPFS store
that data. You can have a theory,

410
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,990
build an application level construct
for smart contracts so that the data

411
00:25:07,991 --> 00:25:09,700
doesn't have to be stored
on a central server.

412
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,010
And you could use deep learning
to learn from that data.

413
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,450
So if you want to know how all three of
these can work together and look up open

414
00:25:16,451 --> 00:25:20,220
minds, the website is open mind
dot. Uh, but it's, uh, it's a,

415
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,970
it's a great example of how
to combine all these three,

416
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,380
these three things together.

417
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,903
Yeah.

418
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,750
So where does this lead
us? Eventually? This is a,

419
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:39,790
this is a graph of emergent,
higher level complexity,

420
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:44,530
simple AI agents that are answered,
but complex warm behavior emerges.

421
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,910
Right now we have AI and they live
on servers. They live in our phones,

422
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:49,870
they live on laptops,

423
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:53,740
but if we could free these AI's from
the confines of servers and let and let

424
00:25:53,741 --> 00:25:56,650
them live in a decentralized space,
they could speak to each other,

425
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,180
they could learn from each other,

426
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,980
and perhaps the real solution to higher
level intelligence is to let that

427
00:26:02,981 --> 00:26:06,250
complexity emerge rather
than trying to coat it in.

428
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:11,110
Why don't we just let it emerge, right?
We don't know how consciousness works,

429
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,690
but we have this basic
rough idea of how it works.

430
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,830
What if we just need to give it
enough complexity and what that real

431
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:20,620
intelligence emerge,
we just can't even understand it.

432
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,590
That is very likely the case. And if we
use blockchains and we use it theory, I'm,

433
00:26:24,591 --> 00:26:29,290
when we use IPFS and all
of these decentralized
technologies we can create real

434
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,490
artificial intelligence is that are
as smart if not hundred thousand times

435
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:36,100
smarter than all of us.
Lastly,

436
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:42,090
you might be thinking, why would we want
to do that? Why do I care about that?

437
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:46,770
Right? Water crisis sees the
spread of infectious diseases,

438
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,440
weapons of mass destruction,
North Korea,

439
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,990
Donald from interstate conflict, failure
of climate change, adaption, energy,

440
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:59,220
price shock, fiscal crisis is
unemployment. Biodiversity,

441
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,820
Watson ecosystem collapse would say,
well,

442
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:06,240
it's too late for us to solve
climate change. It's too
late. No matter what we do,

443
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,910
we're not going to solve it. We
are. We are headed for destruction.

444
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:12,990
We are headed for complete Libyan. There
is nothing we can do. We're screwed.

445
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:18,350
I don't think so because those people
don't know about the power of Ai,

446
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,080
right? If we solve Ai,
let's just say we solve it,

447
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,740
we create an intelligence that's as smart,
if not smarter than all of us.

448
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,040
We can give it an objective,
a goal, a function,

449
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,460
and that objective could
be solve climate change.

450
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,450
It would look at data in a way no human
ever could in a way that 10,000 plus

451
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:39,450
scientists put together in a room
for a hundred years couldn't solve.

452
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,660
It could fall all of
these things immediately.

453
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:47,310
It could move us towards this utopia that
we didn't think even possible before.

454
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:51,990
If we do it the right way and if all of
us together are thinking about ways to

455
00:27:51,991 --> 00:27:56,130
do this, we all have to be thinking about
how these technologies work together.

456
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,010
If you even barely understand
how this technology works,

457
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,000
it is your responsibility to do something
about it because there are millions of

458
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:03,834
people across the world.

459
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:07,740
We don't even have food and water
rights efficient [inaudible] in Maslow's

460
00:28:07,741 --> 00:28:09,390
hierarchy of these,
they don't have any of these things.

461
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:13,560
How can they come to these
kinds of insights? They
cant everybody in this room.

462
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:18,000
It's your responsibility to
do, to, to work on this, to,
to help make this happen.

463
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:21,360
How do you do that? You, you
learned from the Internet.

464
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:25,560
You use this new inner university that
we have is collective university to teach

465
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:29,970
yourself to educate yourself on how these
technologies work and how you can best

466
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,600
influence the problems in our
world using these technologies.

467
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,450
So I want to leave you
with a single remark,

468
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,660
solve AI or die trying.
That's my motto.

469
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:46,020
That's what I live by and if you want to
learn more, there's my youtube channel.

470
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,700
Subscribe.
Thank you very much.

471
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:59,400
Okay. Yes. Uh, we have in this community,

472
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,080
so anybody have any questions?

473
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,493
Okay.

474
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,560
The example that you follow,
right? That we can have,

475
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,640
it became a peculiar dot back to fund
that the Algorithm be why not the act?

476
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:28,740
The thing that I can be a
little holiday [inaudible] yeah.

477
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:32,230
Security is definitely an issue we have
to solve when it comes to decentralized

478
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,083
applications.

479
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,390
One of the reasons that we centralized
stuff was because one person could just

480
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:39,810
secure everything, right? It's much more
secure to have data on a central server.

481
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,280
So to is one

482
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:42,731
really,

483
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:47,260
really great area to focus on if you're
looking on something to work on as one

484
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:48,550
of those looping fields.

485
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,470
There was so much a startup could
do their distributed security,

486
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,250
the centralized security in terms of
a solution right now for security in

487
00:29:57,251 --> 00:30:00,050
general for decentralized applications,
uh,

488
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:05,100
one thing could be better ways of
storing data that's involved replication.

489
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,420
So replication is one example,
right?

490
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,620
A lot of times data is just lost and
IPFS or something like it's just lost

491
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,710
because there's not enough replication.
So looking at different ways,

492
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,220
different algorithm for
replicating data that our edition,

493
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,330
that would be a great
way to solve security

494
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,570
that could have taught the update.
They do know ain't nobody can modify it,

495
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,550
but if you want to provide that,
they would be on me that they

496
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,083
were due by

497
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,430
Dave or David.

498
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:40,460
But if I want to pick your of the lead
actor that twill or other eye maybe gated

499
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,440
or that day,
that cannot really act as the

500
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,790
medium ones any for why are we have,

501
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:54,040
we definitely have to build an extra
security layer layer on top of it,

502
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,421
like their,

503
00:30:54,421 --> 00:30:58,450
their ideas within these communities
for ipms sanitarium for security layers.

504
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,170
But we would need a different protocol
and entire loan. Like one of these issues,

505
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:05,410
one of the ways that this
springs up his identity, right?

506
00:31:05,411 --> 00:31:06,280
We don't know who you are.

507
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:10,210
We don't know how to authenticate you
identity protocols as a layer on top of

508
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:13,570
these data and application
level protocols.

509
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,240
That would be something that's very
necessary. People have tried this.

510
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:19,390
Microsoft even tried this with one ID.
It didn't work,

511
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,430
but the problem was they weren't
thinking about it the right way.

512
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:23,900
So you've got to think about it from
a decentralized way. How do I make,

513
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:28,090
how do we make an identity protocol
that can speak to these other protocols,

514
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,720
it seamlessly. And there's this
idea of cross chain transfers,

515
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:34,170
atomic swaps from the bitcoin community.
Um,

516
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,560
I think that would be a good
place to look for inspiration.

517
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,820
Uh, hi. I was wondering, will
let us do with skating full, uh,

518
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,490
the full homomorphic encryption
because if I'm not mistaken,

519
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,010
it's lush.
And I'll tell that deep learning,

520
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,740
the deep learning models tends to
view computational halts. Yeah. Yeah.

521
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:05,200
So, okay, so two questions there. One, uh,

522
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,950
how do we scale homomorphic encryption?
And two,

523
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,380
how do we solve the
problem of deep learning,

524
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:16,130
being very computationally expensive
that together just the mold

525
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,650
and stuff. Yeah, definitely.
Yeah. You know what it is.

526
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:28,120
So, uh, so there's this idea of one shot
learning where we learned from one or two

527
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:31,150
examples. Like if we look at how
humans learn, you give me your,

528
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,660
give me an image of something that I've
never seen before and in two or three

529
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,240
examples I'll be able to classify it.
Whereas with deep learning,

530
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,730
it requires hundreds of thousands if not
millions of images. This is a problem.

531
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,320
This is not even close to how we learn.

532
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,420
I think the best example
of a very data efficient,

533
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:52,450
deep learning algorithm is it actually
came out of Facebook and he was called

534
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,030
the memory augmented neural network.

535
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,800
So right now we intertwine the processor
with the memory in the neural network.

536
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,380
That's the weight values,
right? Those matrix wait values.

537
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,860
But what if we could separate that memory
into a separate module and it can say,

538
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,620
here's the memory module.
It's just a glorified matrix.

539
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,880
And then we have the wait values.

540
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,000
Well what happened when they train
this thing was it was able to recognize

541
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:18,650
handwritten digits with only 15 examples.
This was like two years ago.

542
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,740
And then that, that project
didn't get that much attention.

543
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,640
It should have because that
was amazing. I would say, uh,

544
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,340
look at that, that project
as an example, Facebook,

545
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:32,930
Ai Research Omnia Blot Dataset,
it's going to be the first link on Google,

546
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,690
but more efficient people, any models
is another open field of research.

547
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,413
Okay.

548
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,730
What was willing to drink.

549
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,100
So it was us

550
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:01,330
to the changes in those of
a different perspective.

551
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,340
So currently for example,

552
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:09,020
using some of the typical Asian
functions which met them at ease.

553
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:13,900
If you are, you know, like
see more more. So these guys,

554
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:17,650
any mathematical evolution such that,
you know,

555
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,820
future perhaps it could be
one just as you do really get,

556
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:28,860
there'll be a shift in terms
of how we will get a new roof

557
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,760
space.
And then the second questions,

558
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:40,090
I'm just curious as to, um, you know, I,

559
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:45,091
these days they have robots that can
jog and he truly like the tone we need.

560
00:34:45,101 --> 00:34:48,490
The,
so in terms of cyber security,

561
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,740
I'm not sure how well it is,

562
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:55,950
but what if one day it happens to be at
the hands of maybe someone who was extra

563
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:02,190
monies or terrorists see what example
where we all we do because the weapons,

564
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:07,860
everything can be don't come to,
and this school was just go,

565
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,880
you know, is my goal blogging
two years, some of the robots,

566
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,660
uh, talking about, um,

567
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:19,810
humans in a very negative way.

568
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:24,380
If we see some like the one that has,

569
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:29,020
I can't remember her name, the lady
who has these others. Yeah. Yeah.

570
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,370
So there was something negative
about the regime, things about human.

571
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:34,510
So I mean,

572
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:39,540
what if one day robots like this and
they learn how to manufacture the mass

573
00:35:40,211 --> 00:35:45,211
wrapping of destruction or whichever
way that they can behave by terminates,

574
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,450
for example. I don't know, how would
it be if you come off? You know,

575
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:55,440
these are good questions.
Good questions.

576
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:59,910
The first question about different ways
of looking at ads and neural network in

577
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:00,744
the future

578
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,100
model that we have right now,

579
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,540
this is one of the most exciting areas
of research and all of computer science

580
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:10,770
right now. How do we evolve the
neural network architecture?
There's this idea of,

581
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:14,490
well, let me just act more more
layers. Let me change the weights.

582
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,210
Let me add a new type of layer, right?
And these are, these are okay, this works.

583
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,490
But what if we change the entire hardware?
What if we said,

584
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,550
instead of running it on silicon,
let's run it on a quantum processor?

585
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:26,430
What happens then? There's the, there's
a brand new use, quantum processing.

586
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:30,300
We don't know. There's this idea in
neuroscience of quantum nano tubules,

587
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,200
that that's the seat of consciousness that
actually lives in multiple dimensions.

588
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,890
Who knows? But there's a lot of
great research in hardware as well.

589
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:39,420
So if you want to look at really,
really,

590
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:42,300
really different radical
breakthroughs and neural networks,

591
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,790
I would actually look at the hardware,
the hardware level,

592
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,280
not the algorithmic level.
Onto your second question
about Terminator Ai. So, uh,

593
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:56,010
some people say that the
Bitcoin blockchain is, uh, some,

594
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,430
some people will say that bitcoin is
one of those systems where you can sell

595
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:04,230
drugs easily and you can, but it's one of
those systems that is very untraceable,

596
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:09,000
right? This is not true. Bitcoin is
the most traceable system in the world.

597
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,730
Key examples, Silk Road, right?
The founder of Silk Road,

598
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,960
every single transaction is stored
in a public way that everyone can,

599
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,990
can view, right? They can
view it, they can validate it,

600
00:37:18,991 --> 00:37:22,650
they can see exactly the trail of
transactions. Now, what happened?

601
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,860
What happens if we take these transactions
and instead we abstract them to two

602
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,570
actions in a network.
This person likes this tweet.

603
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,400
This person did this with this money,
this person launched this nuke,

604
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:40,680
right? If we put everything onto this
public ledger that everyone can view,

605
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:44,490
that's a way to democratize,
read access to actions by everyone.

606
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,130
So if there was some kind of
governments ride, for example,

607
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,510
probably the Singaporean government,

608
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:53,160
we would do something like this cause
they're awesome. Where are they said,

609
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:57,420
let me just make everything public
and viewable by people right?

610
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,250
Then every politician would have to
record all their transactions on a

611
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:05,080
blockchain, right? There would
be no more, uh, there were,

612
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:08,760
there would be much less corruption.
There would be much less. Right.

613
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,050
Because this thing,
this would,

614
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:13,560
this would be validated by everybody
when it comes to nuclear weapons,

615
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:14,850
weapons of mass destruction.

616
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,210
If we are able to create these systems
in a way that everyone can verify,

617
00:38:18,211 --> 00:38:21,540
there's more transparency, there would be
less likely of a risk like that. Right.

618
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:24,690
Because these people would have to be
held accountable and that's really where

619
00:38:24,691 --> 00:38:27,480
this whole blockchain stuff plays in.
It's all about accountability.

620
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,123
Okay.

621
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,540
Do you do that with all the work be done
on that group of stake in blockchain

622
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,700
2.0 there may be a better
technology than in theory coming?

623
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:54,230
Yeah, I do. I do. I do. There are
some promising blockchains out there.

624
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:58,080
I think one is, one is
car Dano, right. Um,

625
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,810
Charles Hoskinson was one of the
former founders of etherium and uh,

626
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,450
he's work he's been working on with
that, with, with a really great team.

627
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:10,670
They're working on KYC compliance as
a way to merge that with the existing

628
00:39:10,671 --> 00:39:12,710
financial infrastructure is great.

629
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,530
I think the idea is that
they have our grades and yes,

630
00:39:15,531 --> 00:39:17,930
there could be something better
than proof of work for sure. I mean,

631
00:39:17,931 --> 00:39:22,250
proof of work is one of those really
computationally expensive processes that

632
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:26,420
wastes a lot of electricity across the
world that we could put that could be put

633
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:30,050
to better use. Why have these computers
off random mathematical problems?

634
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,170
Why not instead have them solve protein
folding or some prompts, some, you know,

635
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:37,190
real problem that matters. So yes, there's
a lot of potential right now. However,

636
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:40,010
in terms of building something
that affects the population,

637
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:44,530
that affects consciousness,
that affects culture. If
theory mean, you know, bitcoin,

638
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,750
these are ways of doing that very fast
and then we can update those systems

639
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:48,584
later on.

640
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,310
We being possible

641
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,363
right now,

642
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,880
he sold me on the Games chess.

643
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:18,330
You think you would have more practical
problems like four times the other

644
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:23,300
pacifier one is half deck. You was on
pain in the real world other than yes.

645
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,980
Yeah,
right.

646
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,180
I do. Well, the idea behind reinforcement,

647
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,470
so reinforcement learning has been
around since the 60s it's not new.

648
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:36,970
All of those concepts that Alphago
used last year, Alphago was a beat.

649
00:40:36,971 --> 00:40:40,510
The best go player in the world will
refresh her and which was a huge deal

650
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:44,860
because AI experts predicted that it
would take 10 20 years for that to happen.

651
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,000
We did it in a decade less.
All of the components of Alphago,

652
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:53,140
Monte Carlo tree search,
right, value networks,

653
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,930
policy networks,
neural networks,

654
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:01,030
these all had all been around for decades.
What was the different steps?

655
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:01,781
Well,

656
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:05,200
they just synthesize some ideas that
hadn't been put together and fed it more

657
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:07,540
computing power than we'd ever
been able to get it before.

658
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,940
And then it gave us this result.
No one thought possible.

659
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,060
So the real breakthrough there was
just giving you a computing power.

660
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,230
There was no difference in
terms of the algorithms,

661
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,420
just a synthesis of old ideas
into one bigger new idea,

662
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,460
which is how most of
research works to be real.

663
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,390
But do I think that we could
do better? For sure, for sure.

664
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,720
I don't see why we aren't thinking of
new ideas for reinforcement learning.

665
00:41:28,721 --> 00:41:28,901
Right?

666
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:32,200
There's so much we could do in terms
of search strategies for reinforcement

667
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:32,990
learning.

668
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,140
There's so much we could do when we
combine deep learning and reinforcement

669
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:36,974
learning together.

670
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:41,060
Games have been a test bed for AI
because if we can generalize to different

671
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:44,210
games, maybe we could
generalize to task step matter.

672
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,330
That's why these big institutions
that have been focused on games,

673
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:50,810
what they're really trying to do is
apply it to real world applications.

674
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,290
Some examples would be
a cooling data centers.

675
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:57,290
That's what Google did with the same
reinforcement learning algorithm they use

676
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:58,010
on a game.

677
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:02,600
They used to reduce the F or increase
the efficiency of cooling their data

678
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:05,510
centers, but I think it was
40 or 50% which is huge.

679
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,990
That's one example and that's just
because Google did it. Guess what?

680
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,670
Google open source that out rhythm.

681
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,850
If we look on get hub and we see these
reinforcement learning algorithms,

682
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,360
we ourselves can take them and
apply them to some use case, right?

683
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:21,650
All these researchers at the top
institutions are working on games because

684
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:24,860
they're trying to improve the
generalization ability. We can, uh,

685
00:42:24,861 --> 00:42:28,820
use it to solve problems today, right?
So we can take those algorithms,

686
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,440
we can use it to solve real problems.

687
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,860
Some avenues like maybe three that I
can think of for reinforcement learning

688
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:38,540
specifically would be, for
example, traffic control. Uh,

689
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:42,000
that's a, that's a reinforcement
learning problem, right? Reward, uh,

690
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:46,040
using an agent to taking a reward and
then cycling that back into the system.

691
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,880
Another one would be,
um,

692
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,860
increasing the efficiency of
bandwidth between applications,

693
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,470
like peer to peer applications. That's
another one for reinforcement learning.

694
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,550
And a third one can just making these up
as I go. A third one would probably be,

695
00:42:58,630 --> 00:42:59,463
uh,

696
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,840
you know how Google did
this with the data center.

697
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:06,930
We can do that with just lights in
general, right? Energy efficiency.

698
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,930
That would be another one
for reinforcement learning.
All these ideas were,

699
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:13,020
we were talking about some
event, some timeline, right?

700
00:43:13,021 --> 00:43:15,960
What we are trying to increase
the efficiency of something
that's happening over

701
00:43:15,961 --> 00:43:18,630
time. That's the reinforcement
learning problem, right?

702
00:43:18,631 --> 00:43:21,870
Because it's interacting with a new
environment. It's not an input, output,

703
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,320
static data set. It's a
dynamic environment. So
think about an environment,

704
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,281
thinking about time,

705
00:43:26,281 --> 00:43:28,890
think about sequences and apply
reinforcement learning there.

706
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,000
Yeah, the big one. Last one.

707
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:38,463
Yes.

708
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:47,210
Well you mentioned any about how you
get head individual simple on blockchain

709
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,510
and I'll call [inaudible]

710
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:56,070
and that's the next step.
What have you don't like the emerging,

711
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:00,850
can't control this one. You didn't write
like entered the column individually.

712
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:03,370
You know what you do, but you don't
know how to behave in the system.

713
00:44:03,371 --> 00:44:08,140
So what then? That's a great
question. So I met someone,

714
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,370
work on the ethics team.

715
00:44:09,371 --> 00:44:13,210
I did mine and she was telling me that
she was kind of going through this game

716
00:44:13,211 --> 00:44:16,600
with me. Or if she was saying, oh, why
should we release this course card?

717
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,490
Why should we do this?
Why should we do this?

718
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,220
But the conclusion that she
made me come up come up with,

719
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,390
which is what the conclusion is.

720
00:44:22,391 --> 00:44:27,100
He had already come to the thought process
was that deep mind wanting to be the

721
00:44:27,101 --> 00:44:29,710
first to come up with
the real intelligence.

722
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:34,711
They wanted to be the first to AI because
they knew that they themselves would

723
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:38,340
be benevolent with it.
They didn't trust that other people would.

724
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,130
So that's why they didn't open
source it at the time. However,

725
00:44:41,131 --> 00:44:42,180
that's not good for us,
right?

726
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:45,330
Because if someone at deep mind is
not benevolent for whatever reason,

727
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,660
they could use that AI for evil
by whatever your means of evil.

728
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,670
It's how do we prevent that? The best
way to prevent any kind of malpractice,

729
00:44:53,671 --> 00:44:54,930
any kind of malintent.

730
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,680
It's a democratizes technology to
give it to as many people as possible.

731
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,430
There's a famous quote by,
um, this English playwrights,

732
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,990
Lord acton also by Elon Musk,
but the quote is the best way,

733
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:10,890
and I'm paraphrasing, the best way
to prevent the rise of a desperate,

734
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:11,780
someone who is a,

735
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:16,780
on how all powerful dictator is
to democratize access to power.

736
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:19,620
If the easiest way is to
centralize that power.

737
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,590
So if we decentralize this power to AI,
to blockchain,

738
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,740
to all this technology
to data specifically,

739
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:31,020
then we can better increase
the probability or likelihood
that we reach a good

740
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:31,920
state in the future.

741
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:35,460
Is there a possibility that someone who
is a bad actor will use this technology?

742
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,930
For sure. I mean, life is full of
existential risks, right? But doing this,

743
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:41,420
democratizing these,

744
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,970
these technologies further increases
the probability that that won't happen

745
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:48,780
because we'll come up with some sort of
security system or fail safe or check

746
00:45:48,781 --> 00:45:50,970
system that would prevent
that from happening.

747
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,790
Maybe there's a decentralize
AI that goes rogue. Well,

748
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,960
there might be a decentralized
security system that prevents that,

749
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,030
that someone created beforehand.

750
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,310
We just all have to be thinking about
these things. It's good. It's a good dog.

751
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:08,900
That's all. Yeah. I'm always very fearful.

752
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:13,540
Those beavers that shed at times
for three, this time around,

753
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:18,490
she knocks was coming here. If any
intention, let's put our heads together.

754
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,433
Thanks

755
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:31,840
Lucas.
Okay.

756
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:38,370
Be here a while for networking
and stuff like that.

757
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,980
So thank you very much with them.
