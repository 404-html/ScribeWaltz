00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,100
Hello World Suraj here.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,270
Big comp is a currency just like
the US dollar or the Japanese,

3
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:10,380
yet accept bitcoin doesn't
belong to anyone. No one owns it,

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,870
no government bank company or person.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,860
It's just open source software
that anyone can download in brows.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,050
It's an invention that no one owns,
but anyone can use kind of like email.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,670
It was created in 2007 by a mysterious
person into Toshi neca mode.

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,490
The search was to,
Toshi isn't going on for years,

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,270
but no one has ever found him before
and since then the total value of the

10
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:37,440
bitcoin network has grown from
nothing to over 5 billion US dollars.

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,080
Once you joined the bitcoin
network by opening a wallet,

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,730
it will generate your way 25 character,

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,220
long public and private
key using cryptography.

14
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,020
Hence my big point is called
a cryptocurrency. This
is your bitcoin address.

15
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,180
Think of it kind of like
your bank account number.

16
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,130
You can give your public key to anyone.
It's what the, we use the send money team,

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,340
but your private key
is for your eyes only.

18
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,820
Anyone who has a private key
can access all of your funds.

19
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,030
So keep it safely hit every time
someone sends bitcoin to another person.

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,240
The bitcoin network is responsible
for processing the transaction.

21
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,670
The bitcoin network has maintained by
a bunch of computers that verify all

22
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:20,490
transactions to ensure
that they are valid.

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,820
This process is called mine and anyone
can set up their computer to become a

24
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:28,710
miner.
Can get paid for maintaining the network.

25
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,000
All have to do is download the
bitcoin client and start mining.

26
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,960
My new requires a lot of computing power,
so you'll need a really,

27
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:41,790
really good GPU chip. An AC computer would
work best when anyone gets the client.

28
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,970
Their computer will start downloading
somebody called the blockchain.

29
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:50,330
The blockchain is a huge list of every
single bitcoin transaction that has ever

30
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,540
happened in the network.

31
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,650
These transactions are bundled
into units called blocks.

32
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,040
These blocks are all chained
together in order of timestamps,

33
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,870
a chain of blocks.

34
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,070
Blockchain get it when
anyone makes a transaction.

35
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,050
Each mine checked to see
if the transaction was ever
made before and it's copy

36
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,070
of the blockchain.

37
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,480
If it was never made before and we'll
recognize it as a valid transaction.

38
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,560
If at least 51% of the network
agrees that a transaction was valid,

39
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,110
it clears and it's
added to the blockchain.

40
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,870
The blockchain is sort on
every miner's computer.

41
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,370
There is no central computer whatsoever.
It's completely decentralized.

42
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,610
That means no one can shut down big,

43
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,800
but what if a bad guy decides he wants
to try to generate fake bitcoins?

44
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,180
Couldn't he just create a bunch of
mining accounts and approve his own

45
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:45,540
transactions as a new
majority? Well, yeah,

46
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:49,650
but bitcoin has incredible security system
designed to defend against that type

47
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:52,050
of attack.
Also known as a civil attack.

48
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,840
There's an extra step that
every miner has to do.

49
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,640
Once it says that a block is valid,

50
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,540
it has to solve a bunch of randomly
generated mathematical problems using its

51
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,120
computing power and
what's the solving them?

52
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,710
Other miners can verify that it
did indeed solve those problems.

53
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,600
This is called the
proof of work algorithm.

54
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,490
Minors have to prove that they've done
a certain amount of computational work

55
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,080
before their vote is valid.

56
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,130
What this means is that more for a bad
guy and spend money twice or dumped spent,

57
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,860
he has to control more computational
power than 51% of the bitcoin network.

58
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,690
The total computational power of the
bitcoin network is currently 13,000 times

59
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,790
greater than the 500 fastest
supercomputers in the
world combined has Kanye

60
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:37,624
says,

61
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,760
thanks [inaudible] no one person or
entity has that much computing power.

62
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,300
So then then work has never been broken
before and it only gets stronger cause

63
00:03:50,301 --> 00:03:55,301
more miners join like adding
their computing power to
only 21 million bitcoins

64
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:59,300
can ever be created at the
current rate of creation.

65
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,490
The Alaska Colin would be mined in
the year 21 four so when that happens,

66
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,820
the miners will then be paid with just
transaction fees instead of transaction

67
00:04:07,821 --> 00:04:10,070
fees and generate coins.

68
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,430
This makes bitcoin a deflationary currency
on might be inflationary USDOT do you

69
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,910
pushing her needs?

70
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,230
If there's a hard limit on the amount
of currency that can be created and

71
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,140
inflationary means that more
currency can be created,

72
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,130
but what isn't inherently better
or more natural than the other?

73
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,260
There is no natural state of money.

74
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,890
Its natural state is neither
inflationary nor deflationary.

75
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,870
Money is not a natural thing.

76
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,770
It's a tool we use in our society
to transfer decks amongst ourselves,

77
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,160
turning the dials on the economic models
for money in either direction for both

78
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,470
pros and cons.

79
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,220
Bitcoin can plug into the existing system
or money transfer and make it faster

80
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:51,590
and more efficient and
more widely available.

81
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,020
There's so many ways to get involved.
