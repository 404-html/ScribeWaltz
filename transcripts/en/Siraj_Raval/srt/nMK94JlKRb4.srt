00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,811
Hello world.

2
00:00:00,811 --> 00:00:04,980
It's Saroj and welcome to my new
course titled Machine Learning Journey.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,150
If you're a student or between
jobs or in a different field,

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,360
this 10 week course will help you learn
everything you need from marketing your

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:19,581
skills to learning the best tools to
building a solid mathematical foundation.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,840
Two techniques to stay up to date on the
latest breakthroughs in order to get a

7
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:27,180
job or start your own venture.

8
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:30,180
As a machine learning
engineer or data scientist,

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,860
this course will be free and publicly
available on Youtube. I do this for you.

In this video,

12
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:46,830
I'll show you how to write the perfect
resume for a machine learning or data

13
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:47,820
science position.

14
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,160
Sending in your resume is the universal
first step in landing an interview for a

15
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:55,680
position at any company.
Yes.

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,390
Eventually there will be more efficient
ways to assess candidates skills,

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,430
but for now we have to deal with the
art and science of resume writing.

18
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,050
I've gone through this process several
times for the companies I've worked for

19
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,290
as well as reviewed resumes for job
positions I've been recruiting for and the

20
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:20,451
amount of misinformation around this
resume writing process is what got me to

21
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:24,990
create this tutorial.
If we look at the data on resumes,

22
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,020
it's pretty surprising the
average interviewers spend
only six seconds scanning

23
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:35,241
a resume and usually interviewers won't
even look at your resume until you walk

24
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:40,491
into the room because the vast majority
of resumes are first screened by

25
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,360
automated systems.

26
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,750
58% of resumes have typos and 75% of all
resumes are automatically discarded by

27
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:51,000
the systems.

28
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:56,330
Clearly having a great resume is the
most important part in landing a machine

29
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:01,851
learning position and once you get that
down you can start focusing on other

30
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:07,071
more advanced tactics like
genetic modification to
help you stand out from the

31
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:07,950
masses.

32
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,950
Application tracking systems or ATS has
introduced a new gatekeeper to the job

33
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,420
search process.

34
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,720
These are automated filtering algorithms
that can rate resumes based on a few

35
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:21,654
factors.

36
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,720
So submitting a resume
that isn't optimized for an
ATS is the biggest mistake

37
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,760
you can make as a job.

38
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:34,761
Applicant also applying to Sarah knows
the reason companies use an ATS is

39
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:40,371
because an AI can scan millions of resumes
permanent and this card up to 80% of

40
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:42,000
them automatically,

41
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:47,001
which means the recruiter only has to
worry about the top 20% a massive time

42
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:51,990
saver. Historically recruiters would
have to read every single resume,

43
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,250
but AI allows them to scale in
a way they couldn't otherwise.

44
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,910
It's safe to assume any company you're
applying will very likely be using an

45
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:04,270
ATS.
When an AI has given a candidate resume,

46
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,010
its first step is to parse that
resume to find expected sections,

47
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,220
meaning it will be programmed to search
for information on your work experience,

48
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:16,570
your education, your skills, et cetera.

49
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,510
And while Ai is good at parsing,

50
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,940
it can't interpret slang just yet.

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,530
So if you title this section about
your work experience as previous gigs,

52
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:31,660
it'll likely ignore that
section completely since it
doesn't know what a Gig is.

53
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,490
What that means is you'll need to use
standard plain English resume sections,

54
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,150
the four major ones you should
list our work experience,

55
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,240
education skills and projects.

56
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,870
I've found that Novo resume.com is a
really helpful tool to generate a resume

57
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,760
template that works for you.

58
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,870
They've got a lot of options and it's
free as you're writing your resume.

59
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,900
A good thought experiment is to step
into your prospective employers shoes.

60
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,690
If you were them, what would you
be looking for in a candidate?

61
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,780
You can craft an elevator
pitch for yourself,

62
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,970
a short summary that describes your most
impressive accomplishments and use that

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,950
as a guide to help you write your resume
detailing those points even more in

64
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:19,210
just one page.

65
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:24,010
The ATS wants to match your resume with
certain keywords that are found in the

66
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:28,690
job description for that specific job.
So let's say for a given position,

67
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:32,260
we see this paragraph as
part of the job description.

68
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,300
We can pick out keywords from it that
sound important and use those in our

69
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:37,930
resume.

70
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,930
We can use the tool word clouds.com and
paste in the entire job description page

71
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,740
into the word list.

72
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,660
It'll spit out an image that showcases
every word in the job description letting

73
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:53,050
us use the most frequent ones
will come to the resistance.

74
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,450
When we start writing a resume,

75
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,340
it's beneficial to use bullet points
instead of paragraphs as those have been

76
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:05,140
shown to be beneficial for ATS
software while using a photo isn't.

77
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,510
It also might go without saying,

78
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:11,290
but definitely use the same
font throughout the resume.

79
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,310
I recommend sands,
Sarah,

80
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,320
and since employers don't have
much time to read resumes,

81
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,130
make sure to list your most
impressive accomplishments. First,

82
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,270
don't just try and list every single
thing you've done since high school like

83
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:26,470
lead hacking,
Nasa.

84
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,240
While chronological resume listings are
common when it comes to a cutting edge

85
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:36,241
field like machine learning skills and
experience matter more than history and

86
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:41,110
degrees, so that means put the
most impressive section first,

87
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:46,120
the most impressive experience first,
the most important bullet point first.

88
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,040
Each of your bullet points should be
ruthlessly concise as this reflects your

89
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,140
communication skills.
For example,

90
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:58,170
a bad bullet point would be training
and optimizing a support vector machine

91
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,250
learning model on a Dataset to predict
the quality of Avocados with an accuracy

92
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:08,471
of 98% a better bullet point would be
trained a support vector machine to

93
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:12,320
predict avocado quality with 98% quality.

94
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,910
This way we aren't reusing similar
words and we keep it simple.

95
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,530
These bullet points, it should
show, not tell numbers and metrics,

96
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,030
but you show the impact you can have
rather than relying on filler words.

97
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,540
Instead of saying you significantly
improved conversion rates,

98
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,750
say that you doubled conversion rates
from 0.5% to 1% the same rules applied for

99
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:38,090
past projects show.
Don't tell.

100
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,040
It's better to say you trained a neural
net on 10 k images to classify rubber

101
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:46,730
ducks. Then you gained extensive
experience with neural nets.

102
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:51,770
This makes you more memorable and acts
as an easy talking point during the in

103
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:56,000
person interview, and this applies
to academic coursework as well.

104
00:06:56,001 --> 00:07:00,050
Since grading and naming conventions
vary from school to school.

105
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,990
Instead of saying you got an a in NLP,

106
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,050
say you wrote a Web crawler to scrape
and Parse text data for NLP algorithms.

107
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,640
When you're done writing your resume,

108
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,780
give it to a friend with no background
in machine learning to review.

109
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,840
They ideally should still be able to
identify your key credentials even if they

110
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,400
don't understand all the terms.

111
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,480
They'll also be able to tell you
if they see any grammatical errors,

112
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,360
liberal arts majors, we
love you. After that,

113
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:34,361
you can get a free resume review from
top resume.com from a resume expert to

114
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:38,360
double check your work when you're
ready to submit your resume.

115
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,080
Don't use a pdf as,
it's not very ATS friendly.

116
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,700
Use a word file or a plain text file
because it's much easier to parse.

117
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:51,110
And because job descriptions can vary
so much between companies for the same

118
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:51,860
position,

119
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,860
it's best if we make multiple copies of
our resume and tailor each of them to

120
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:59,090
whatever company we're applying to.

121
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,540
We can keep a master version of our resume
as a base and make spin offs from it.

122
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,770
Oh and a lot of the more advanced systems
can automatically scan for your other

123
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:14,771
social media profiles and use that data
as part of its decision making process.

124
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,390
So if there's anything
you want to keep private,

125
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,260
make sure to lock it down
with maximum privacy settings.

126
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,490
Sometimes you'll be asked to send
in a cover letter with your resume.

127
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,360
For this, I like to follow a
simple two paragraph format.

128
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,710
The first paragraph should tell the
company why you want to work for them.

129
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,370
Use a single specific
reason and elaborate on it.

130
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:41,780
The second paragraph should tell the
company why they should hire you.

131
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,910
Highlight the exact things you're going
to bring to the company and back it up

132
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,380
with a specific example.

133
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,820
So having a great resume is
key to getting an interview,

134
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,170
but get hub acts in many ways
has an unofficial resume,

135
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,080
especially in this field because it
doesn't just say the work you've done,

136
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,340
it showcases it for anyone to analyze.
Since it's open source,

137
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,390
it gives employers a clearer
idea of your technical skills.

138
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,410
Have at least two projects
here that you can showcase,

139
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,910
made sure the code works.

140
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:19,500
It's well documented in the read me
with both installation and how to run

141
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:24,360
instructions. Ideally you have an image
of the demo in the read me as well,

142
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,390
and of course a link to a web app version
so anyone can try it in the browser at

143
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:30,434
themselves.

144
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:35,190
There are a few great resources that I
recommend to help you further refine your

145
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:36,990
resume and I listed them all.

146
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,520
Video description,
ready to start applying.

147
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,210
I've got so many more tips if the
subscribe button to stay up to date on my

148
