1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,110
Hello world. It's a Raj and
hold on. Hello Sir Roger.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,850
My name is Nora and I really
need your help. What do you need?

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,100
I don't have time to explain.
They're coming after me.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,240
Can you please just press the
number four. How are you? Hello.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,890
Hello. Number four. Okay,

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,230
whoa. Where am I? What is this place?

7
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,820
Put your hand where we can see though.

8
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,200
Hey, over here, getting
the car. Wait, who are you?

9
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:44,780
Just giving him the order to
perform a brain drain on you.

10
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,380
Okay.
I definitely don't want a brand.

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,500
Oh my God. Oh my God. Okay.
That was close. Wait a second.

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,340
You're just a kid.
How do you know how to drive around here?

13
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:06,210
Kids are better drivers. The novels.
I can take video games. All right,

14
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:11,160
well what is this place and why do you
need my help? This world is Cold Cola.

15
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,770
It's similar to earth,
but not really.

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,400
I asked a friend to teleport you here
because I need your help finding a

17
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:22,110
legendary device called the Luma.
Wait, so I'm on an alien planet.

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,010
Yeah. Dope. All right, so what's the Luma?

19
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,640
It's a device that can power the entire
planet with unlimited free, clean energy.

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,840
It would save our entire planet from
the destruction caused the pollution.

21
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,650
It's location is on this USB stick.

22
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,110
But I need your help finding the
relevant information inside of the stick.

23
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,490
The King of Cola,

24
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:49,260
King Nana once the stick because he wants
to use its power for himself to create

25
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,970
a giant Burger and it's only he can eat
instead of powering the entire world.

26
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,990
Oh, let that happen. We got to
find it before he does. Okay.

27
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,380
I definitely don't want you your

28
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,440
planet to be destroyed.
So let's do this. Alright,

29
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,770
so I'll just plug this USB stick
in my laptop and there we go.

30
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,010
Wait,

31
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,670
this is just a bunch of pictures of
your planet like mountains and rocks and

32
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:17,240
lakes. Exactly. I got, this
picture's from a satellite.

33
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,080
One of these pictures has the Luma on it.
It's a bright pink.

34
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,080
We've got to find which
picture has the Luma,

35
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,960
but it would take me years to find it.

36
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,070
There is 5 million pictures on this USB
stick and that's why I need your help.

37
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,470
You understand computers. So maybe you
could show me how to do this. All right,

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,220
I can help. Let me see. Do
you know what programming is?

39
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,590
I've heard about it, but I don't know
much about it. All right. Check this out.

40
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,850
So a computer is a machine and we can
use it to do literally anything we can

41
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:54,290
dream up. And the way we can do this,
he's by a process called programming.

42
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,170
You can also call it coding
or software engineering.

43
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,720
Basically it's a set of instructions
that we give a computer to do some task.

44
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,520
That task can be creating a game world
like Super Mario or playing a list of

45
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:09,010
songs or even creating a website.

46
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,620
That sounds awesome. So how
do I program something? Well,

47
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:17,690
you need to choose a programming
language first. Dakota. Okay,

48
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,220
whoa. Computers read instructions
as a set of ones and Zeros.

49
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,430
These are instructions that are
easy for a computer to read,

50
00:03:26,431 --> 00:03:28,350
but they're kind of hard for us to read.

51
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,650
So we can use programming languages like
c or Java or python that are made up of

52
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:39,330
words instead of numbers. That way we can
read them and understand how they work.

53
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,490
If we take a language like python,

54
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,730
we can write a simple program
that just says hello world.

55
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,160
All I do is type the command print.

56
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,700
Then the phrase hello world
into this python text editor.

57
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,050
Then I hit the run button and it will
say hello world and the outlook window,

58
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,120
that's the output of the program.

59
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,660
See to us the program just
said print hello world.

60
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,890
But under the hood all this text
is broken down into ones and Zeros.

61
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:08,820
So a computer can read it and
process it and that's awesome.

62
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,460
So I guess my thing is the
best programming language,

63
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,680
well it's definitely my favorite one.

64
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,910
I thought it was a really easy language
to start learning programming with.

65
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:22,200
But in the end programming is an art form.
It's something you can get better at.

66
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:25,290
With practice,
it's the art of problem solving.

67
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,070
I really like python because you don't
have to think too much about what the

68
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:33,030
right commands to use them and instead
you can just focus on solving your

69
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:36,450
problem. That's great. Cool.
I'll learn to use fights in that.

70
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,350
So how do we use fighting to find the
new nine? All this pictures? Well,

71
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:43,410
we're going to have to do some
machine learning using iPhone.

72
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,230
What's the machine learning?
Well,

73
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:49,620
the traditional way to do programming
was to tell a computer what to do.

74
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,420
Like give me the exact instructions.

75
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,660
Let's say we want to tell her that
to text the Luma in a picture.

76
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,560
Well we can write code that can detect
all the different features of what the

77
00:04:58,561 --> 00:05:01,920
Luma looks like.
Like it's color and shape and size,

78
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,490
but the Luma could be in many different
kinds of positions in one of these

79
00:05:05,491 --> 00:05:09,690
photos. There's no guarantee of
what exactly it will look like.

80
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,060
You do have some pictures of Aluma right?

81
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,390
Definitely there on the computer as well.
Okay,

82
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,270
so instead of us telling the
computer what a little looks like,

83
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,620
we can have it learn what the Luma looks
like. That's called machine learning.

84
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,730
It's when we give a computer, not a
set of instructions to complete a task,

85
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,050
but instead a set of data and the task
and have it learn from that data to

86
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:35,580
complete the task. So we can use python
to create a machine learning model.

87
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,820
Then we'll feed our model a
bunch of pictures of the Luma.

88
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,880
Our model will learn exactly
what the Lumo looks like.

89
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,550
Then once it's learned
what a Luma looks like,

90
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,300
we can give it all the satellite pictures
you have and they will tell us when it

91
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:52,710
detects the Luma. Awesome. So how
do we make a machine learning model?

92
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,250
Well, there are lots of different
machine learning models we could use,

93
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:59,840
but a really one I like to use
is called a neural network.

94
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,130
A neural network can learn anything if
we give it enough data and computing

95
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:08,480
power. Here's how it works. If we
have some data with two columns,

96
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,170
the first column is a set of picture is
a little among the second column is a

97
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,480
label that says Aluma or not.
Blooma.

98
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,470
We can feed in each row of the data
to the neural network one at a time.

99
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,000
There was some pattern here,

100
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,990
some kind of relationship between the
two columns and I neural network can

101
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:26,570
figure it out.
Once it's learned this pattern,

102
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,920
we can give it a new picture and it'll
automatically be able to tell us if there

103
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:35,160
is a luma or there isn't.
How does he do that? Well,

104
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,090
the neural network is actually
just a few math operations.

105
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,150
Our input is going to be an image,
but if you think about it,

106
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,280
an image is really just a set of numbers.

107
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,990
It's a set of pixels and each pixel has
a value that corresponds to a color.

108
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,340
A computer reads these pixels so it
can display the colors of the image,

109
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,060
so it's a table of numbers and our
neural network is this series of math

110
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:58,880
operations.
It consists of a set of layers.

111
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,930
Let's just use a simple network
with three layers on input layer,

112
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,320
a hint layer and an output
layer in a neural network.

113
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,340
Data goes from the input layer through
the hidden layer to the output layer.

114
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,490
When it reaches the output layer in how
puts a prediction of what it thinks it

115
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:18,650
seeds, what connects. Each of
these layers are a set of weights.

116
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,430
Each weight is a matrix and
since we have three layers,

117
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:27,110
we have two weights between each layer.
What's the Matrix? Please don't tell me.

118
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,880
Movie would smell emotion. What you
watch Hollywood movies on this planet.

119
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,260
All right,
nevermind.

120
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,550
A matrix is a math word for a group
of numbers that has a set of rows and

121
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:39,530
columns just like our pictures.

122
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,940
We will multiply are input by our first
weight matrix and that don't give us a

123
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:44,990
new set of numbers.

124
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,250
Then we take those numbers and feed them
to what's called an activation function.

125
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,690
The activation function will output a
new set of numbers and that's our hidden

126
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:57,200
layer. We'll take those numbers
and repeat the process again,

127
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,580
using the new numbers is inputs,
input times, weight activity,

128
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,713
just like that,

129
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,830
and it produces our output of prediction
value that says what percent the neural

130
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:10,250
network thinks it's
Aluma or not. Wait, wait,

131
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,990
what's an activation function?

132
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,610
It's a math formula that makes sure our
neural network can learn any kind of

133
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:19,730
relationship.
There are two kinds of relationships,

134
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,860
linear ones and nonlinear ones.

135
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,370
That means if we were to graph the
relationship between any two things,

136
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,750
the line would be either straight
or squiggly, an activation function.

137
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:33,920
Make sure our no network can learn
both kinds of relationships, but yeah,

138
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,160
we can add as many layers as
we want to our neural network.

139
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,450
We can also try to modify our neural
network to do all sorts of mathematical

140
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:45,650
operations.
That's a lot to take in.

141
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,220
Let's just use a simple narrow
network for now. Agreed.

142
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,090
We can code this neural network in python
really easily and just a few lines of

143
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:57,630
code. Each line represents a type of
layer that the neural network is using.

144
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,470
Each of these keywords is a different
math operation that the network is using.

145
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,420
The process of learning that it network
uses is called training. We create,

146
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,930
our neural network has just two major
seats and a number numbers that each of

147
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:12,120
these major cs starts off as random.

148
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,110
We're going to input our luma images
into the network. One at a time.

149
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,500
We'll do this 60,000 times.
It's called training.

150
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,030
We do our input times wait,
operation then activate the results.

151
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,250
We'll do that twice to hit our prediction.

152
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,230
Then you calculate how far off our
prediction was from reality and use that

153
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:35,070
change to update both of our neural
network whites ever so slightly.

154
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,100
We just keep doing that
over and over again.

155
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,390
And eventually those random numbers we
started off with in our neural network

156
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,950
started to get really useful. So when we
give our network a new image of Aluma,

157
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,490
it will know exactly whether
or not it's a luma or not.

158
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,980
I said monkeys there. Here we go to find
the PNEUMA hello to his don't training.

159
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,950
Did you just say blasted
monkeys? Yeah. All right. Uh,

160
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,700
it just finish. Okay, let me give it
the salary pictures. They found it.

161
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,150
It's in this picture. Awesome.
I've go the coordinates.

162
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,090
Let's tell it for days.

163
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,630
Yes. Thanks rob. Anytime. Good luck.

164
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,750
We need one of those on earth too.
Speaking of earth,

165
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,070
can you tell important he
back now? Sure thing. Bye.

166
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,310
See Ya. All right. It's good to be back.

167
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,100
There are three things to remember
from this video was there.

168
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:36,450
It's the traditional way of programming
is to give a computer some instructions

169
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:37,560
on what to do.

170
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,210
Machine learning is a form of programming
where instead of instructions,

171
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,330
we give a computer some data and a goal,

172
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,080
and then the computer learns how
to do the goal using the data.

173
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,450
And a neural network is a machine learning
model that can learn from data and it

174
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:59,130
consists of matrix operations,
input times. Wait, activate,

175
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,380
and there were two kinds of relationships.

176
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,220
Two data points can have
linear and nonlinear ones.

177
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,500
That means a straight
line or a squiggly line.

178
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,930
Neural networks can learn both types.

179
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,150
Please subscribe for
more programming videos,

180
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:14,580
and I hope you have a happy new year.
Thanks for watching.
