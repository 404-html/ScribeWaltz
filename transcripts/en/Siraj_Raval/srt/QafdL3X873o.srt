1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,870
This video is about free
money. Say whoa. Hello world.

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,660
It's the Raj and universal basic income.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,850
It's a centuries old idea that we might
just be able to implement on a global

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,630
scale using recent advances
in blockchain technology.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,700
I'll give a technical overview of some
projects in the space aiming to do that.

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,563
In this video,

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,730
we are increasingly moving towards an
age of abundance where AI is accelerating

8
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:28,890
progress in almost every field.

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,110
Ai agents can do jobs that humans would
normally do with far more efficiency

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,160
diagnostic apps or replacing
thousands of healthcare workers,

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,300
self driving cars and trucks
will replace 5 million drivers.

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,590
Internet sales are on the way to
replacing millions of retail workers.

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,510
It's happening staggeringly fast and
it's not just AI that tricking the job

14
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:52,230
markets.

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,030
It's the way we've structured the web
currently of BW services collect and

16
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:59,790
monetize the majority of the world's data.

17
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,780
As AI takes on more and more labor,
the data you generate,

18
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,360
your unique perspective of the world,

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,270
that's something that
no robot can ever take,

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,710
but right now we're giving it away
for free in return for a free service.

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,390
So the few who run these massive
services are earning all the money.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,900
Wealth inequality continues
to rise because of this.

23
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:26,901
And a recent study shows that almost
half of all jobs in the U S or at risk of

24
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:29,940
being automated in the next 20 years.

25
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,270
So what do we do here? Well, we, well,

26
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:35,730
we can't just stop working on technology.

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,900
It's too useful and humanity needs it
to solve some of the world's biggest

28
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:40,734
problems.

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,060
What if people could earn a set amount
of money every month just because they

30
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:48,900
exist? This idea is called
a universal basic income.

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,940
The most common proposal for how a system
like this would work is one where a

32
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:58,941
national government sends out regular
checks to every citizen regardless of

33
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:00,870
their employment status.

34
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,490
Pilots of this style of program are
already underway in Finland and Canada.

35
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:10,260
In rural Kenya, a basic income
is managed by give directly,

36
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,550
even in India with a population
of over 1 billion people.

37
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,910
It's considering establishing a basic
income in the u s y Combinator started a

38
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:24,540
basic income test last year on a
small portion of the local population.

39
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,920
And for decades,

40
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,950
residents of Alaska have each received
about two k US dollars every year from

41
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:32,820
the Alaska permanent fund.

42
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,770
So the idea has been tested and we've
seen the results instead of people just

43
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,990
becoming lazy and unproductive.

44
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,820
Studies show that it actually increased
people's productivity rather than

45
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:45,660
reducing it.

46
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,960
That's because it both improved their
mental and physical health and encourage

47
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,480
them to pursue work that
actually mattered to them,

48
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,820
not just to put bread on the table.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,860
And when you actually care about
the work that you're doing,

50
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,970
your output is going to far exceed
what you do if you didn't care.

51
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,470
You could imagine though that this would
take a long time for countries to adopt

52
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,500
and the need for this is
really on a global scale.

53
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,150
Since automation technology affects
everybody who can access the Internet and

54
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,950
allowing a few people to decide how much
money is given to a very large amount

55
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:25,150
of people. Has the potential for
corruption? Is there a better way?

56
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,110
Well,

57
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,700
we know that bitcoin's blockchain for
the first time allowed the minting and

58
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,550
distribution of money to be decentralized.

59
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,620
That is decided by rules encoded into
a network protocol instead of behind

60
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:41,650
closed doors,
and it did this on a global scale.

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,240
It created this global network of
miners and developers and users.

62
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,010
Could we create some kind
of cryptocurrency system
that we could dedicate to

63
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:55,930
distributing a basic income? It would be
pretty cool. It'd be globally accessible,

64
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,990
open source and a much faster solution
than relying on national governments,

65
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,920
but we have two major questions to
answer if we're to get there. First,

66
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,650
where does this money come from?
And second,

67
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,700
how do we prove that one
person only has one account?

68
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,080
We don't want to make it easy for one
person to create multiple accounts and

69
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:19,450
received multiple basic income streams.

70
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,310
Let's take a look at two projects in
this space to see how they're doing it.

71
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,850
The first is grant coin,
which is a fork of pure coin.

72
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,120
The founders of this cryptocurrency
created a nonprofit organization based in

73
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:34,204
the US.

74
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,250
It's already distributed the equivalent
of about 13,000 US dollars to more than

75
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:44,251
1500 participants in over a 79 countries
across the world for fruit to verify

76
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:46,870
the identity of its users.

77
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,440
It asks them to upload a
government issued photo id.

78
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,090
Although this is a centralized
identity system, it works the grant,

79
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:59,920
quite foundation staff and volunteers
manually review these applications to

80
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:02,110
ensure that each id is in fact unique.

81
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,380
The founders gave 99% of all created grand
coin to the foundation which it holds

82
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:08,764
in reserve.

83
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,920
The remaining 1% is created through the
proof of work mining process to reward

84
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:16,240
minors for maintaining the public ledger.

85
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,190
The plan is to gradually release the
coin into circulation during the next 50

86
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:24,790
years. The foundation acts
as a hub for donations.

87
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,620
These donations can be from charity
groups, other Ngos and individual donors.

88
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,490
Generally,
as is the case with most cryptocurrencies,

89
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,590
the more people that get involved,

90
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,740
the more people want to join and this
rise in interest is what causes people to

91
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:44,320
want to trade that currency for
another which has more value.

92
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,700
As far as I can tell.

93
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:50,170
This is currently the most successful
implementation of a crypto basic income.

94
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,140
Another cool project is called circles.

95
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,310
They're idea is that every person in
the system gets their own currency,

96
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,930
but this currency has no value at first.

97
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:05,170
People who know each other can agree to
set a fixed exchange rate between their

98
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,620
currencies. They would mutually
agree to each other's existence.

99
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,270
They formed a circle of two people and
within this circle both currencies can be

100
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,440
seen as equal.

101
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,080
This allows exchanges along circles
and connects people across a network

102
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,360
together also considered
a web of trust model.

103
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,480
So if person a has a relationship with B
and B has a relationship with see a can

104
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:33,890
pay c with c coined by exchanging a
coins for be coins and be bitcoins to see

105
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:36,710
coins, it's built on top
of the theory blockchain.

106
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,740
Each account constantly generates an
income of about a thousand units per week

107
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:47,140
and the rate at which the
income is generated increases
by about 5% every year.

108
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,550
Groups can also be created.

109
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:54,380
These groups can verify new accounts as
members and exclude certain accounts as

110
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:58,700
well. Members can even convert their
private money into group money.

111
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,040
This one seems complicated,
but hey,

112
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,300
the founders have the right intentions
and the get hub repository is active.

113
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,610
There are some other examples as well,

114
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:09,680
and I've linked to them
in the video description.

115
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,530
Pretty much all of these
are very new pilots.

116
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,150
No one has really figured out a
massively scalable way to do this yet,

117
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,540
but all the building blocks are there.
So to summarize,

118
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,690
automation is going to replace a lot of
humans in doing a mundane work over the

119
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,230
coming years.

120
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:32,230
We can use blockchain technology to
experiment with creating systems that

121
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:37,301
provide a universal basic income to
people globally and to projects that are

122
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:41,240
working on this. Currently,
our grants, coin and circles.

123
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,680
The coding challenge for this week is
to create your own plan for how a basic

124
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,990
income crypto currency system would work.

125
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,420
Submit your get hub links
in the comment section,

126
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,420
and I'll announce the top
two entries next Friday.

127
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,460
Please subscribe for
more programming videos.

128
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:58,820
And for now I've got to save the world,
so thanks for watching.
