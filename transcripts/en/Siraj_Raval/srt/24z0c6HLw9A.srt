1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,140
Hey, how's gun chapter in? What's
up? Not much done. Pretty good.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,080
Do you mind if I ask you 67
questions? Yeah, go for it.
Alright, let's do this. Cool.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,640
What project are you currently working on?

4
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:14,970
So we just launched the universe and
I'm working on some of the followup

5
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:16,950
releases we're going to do for that.
Awesome.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,280
How would you describe the
culture at open AI? Super Cool.

7
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:23,400
I love everyone I work with here. Uh,
very open. Lots of good mentorship.

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,280
What was it like attending MIT as an
Undergrad? Really, really great. Uh,

9
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:30,900
MIT has a lot of cool sub communities.
They're all super creative.

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,080
You went to school at Nyu,
do you Miss New York City?

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,900
I think it was my friends there.
Um, but I don't miss the weather.

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,970
Favorite internship? Uh, Amazon, if
you could repeat one experience again,

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,310
what would it be?
I'd like to go back to Japan.

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,030
Why do you think deep learning
has gotten so popular recently?

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,330
It's really well for a lot of problems.
Um,

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,790
but I think people are sort of confusing
it for like the last big innovation,

17
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:58,140
but there's more to come. What is your
favorite operating system? Who Been Too

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,040
nice? If you could spend an evening
with one famous person, who would it be?

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,870
Michelle Obama. Do you play
any sports? I do rock climbing.

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,900
What time do you go to sleep?
Like midnight.

21
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,890
Most adventurous thing you've
ever done. What? Skydiving.

22
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,160
What's one source you use to
stay up to date in ml? Uh,

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,840
so Jack Clark who does PR for us has
this newsletter called import Ai.

24
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,140
It's great programming,
language of choice for machine learning.

25
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,410
Definitely pipeline.
Favorite professor. Let's go.

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,980
Josh Tenenbaum in MIT named
one person you really admire.

27
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,650
I'm also professor Fay.
Fay Lee.

28
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:41,310
She does a lot of AI and also
outreach neuroscience stuff.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,540
How are you liking the bear? Yeah. Great.
There's a lot of cool communities here.

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,760
What drives you to be an engineer?

31
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,330
I really like building
things and especially the
things that I build can help

32
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:54,570
other people. What's the most
beautiful thing in the world?

33
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,850
Let's say it's helping out other people,

34
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:59,280
even if you don't agree with them or
if you're different from one another.

35
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,230
What's your favorite exercise?
Uh, I did Japanese Tyco drumming.

36
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,310
Favorite food? Croissants.
What's more fun?

37
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,180
Computer Science Theory or implementation?
I think implementation,

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,690
but you might think differently.
What website do you waste? Time.

39
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,500
I spent a lot of time on Facebook.
My friends read a lot of cool stuff there.

40
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,840
Last person you emailed. I emailed a
candidate in robotics that I met at nips.

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,720
You get an all expenses paid trip
to one city. Where do you go? Well,

42
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,510
never been to Africa. So maybe
Cape Town. Would you visit Mars?

43
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,610
Not unless it was cheap.
What's one thing you can't live without?

44
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,380
Um, my bicycle. What's one of
your favorite genres of music?

45
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,530
Spotify tells me that I listened
to a lot of ambient electronic.

46
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:51,960
So let's go with that. What's one
skill you wish you had better drawing.

47
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,910
What's the first thing you do when you
wake up? I hit snooze. What techs editor.

48
00:02:56,911 --> 00:03:00,490
Do you use? Emacs but not
a holy war, I promise.

49
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,350
What open source library
do you really like? Uh,

50
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,360
I think really the requests in python
recently. It makes GDP super easy.

51
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,080
What's one of your favorite
movies? Uh, the original matrix.

52
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,000
What was a hard problem you recently
solved at open AI who were dealing with

53
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:18,880
some weird bugs when the environments
we're resetting and universe.

54
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:21,340
So trying to figure out why
that was going wrong was tough.

55
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,320
What inspired you to get
into machine learning?

56
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,640
I've always been really interested in
how humans think and the existence of be

57
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,620
sort of interesting biological,
cognitive agents.

58
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:31,300
But what if you could build one yourself?

59
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,250
What was the first program you ever made?
Um,

60
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,410
first interesting program I ever made
was to figure out how to spell your name

61
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:42,820
using a chemical elements. Symbols.
Whoa. What's one book you really liked?

62
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,080
Um, man, a wizard of
Earthsea are still, go ahead.

63
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,490
What's a big misconception about,
you don't realize I was born in Australia.

64
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,590
What's one thing that excites
you? The future? I mean,

65
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:59,650
who knows how it's gonna turn out
best advice you've ever received.

66
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,810
Someone pointed out that I've already
got a lot of the things that I want,

67
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,640
so I should stop being
so stressed out about it.

68
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,620
What's the bravest thing you've ever done?
Quitting Grad school with? Super tough.

69
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:14,260
I had sort of planned the trajectory
for my life and having to change that

70
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:17,830
really hard. What's one piece of advice
you'd give yourself 10 years ago?

71
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,130
I'd say to ask for more help.
I kept trying to do things on my own.

72
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,970
You spend more time on the internet
or real life? Definitely real life,

73
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:28,210
but often in front of a screen
code. Do you have any pets? No.

74
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,550
What's something you've
learned in the past month?

75
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,350
What it's like to release a big project?
Do you like spicy food sometimes.

76
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,340
What's a movie that made you cry?
The end of the Lord of the rings.

77
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,540
If you were in the world,
what is one law?

78
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,220
I think freedom of the press is great
and there should be more of that.

79
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,070
Do you think will solve
intelligence in your lifetime?

80
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,550
I think we'll probably build
systems as capable as humans,

81
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:52,960
but we won't understand how they work yet.

82
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,590
Who is one person you looked
up to when you were in college?

83
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,750
Not to own all of us.
She was my mentor for my master's thesis.

84
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,510
She was combining computer science and
neuroscience in the way that I was really

85
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:07,750
excited by. What deep learning
library do you use the most?

86
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,990
We now use tensor flow and I've
used more theone no, in the past,

87
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,620
Andrew on one said machine learning
is like the new electricity.

88
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,570
Do you agree yet?

89
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,050
But maybe in the future if you
were to start from scratch today,

90
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:24,460
what is the learning resource you would
use to learn machine learning with a

91
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:25,900
good book like bishops book,

92
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:27,790
but then actually trying to
implement the stuff yourself.

93
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,880
Don't just read it and bring it down.
Bring in three. Really actually try it.

94
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,870
What is one career goal you
have lead a big project Sunday.

95
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,070
What's more interesting?

96
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,490
The brain or the universe or the
brain is part of the universe,

97
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:42,820
but I do think it's pretty interesting
part. If you could be a superhero,

98
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:43,654
who would it be?

99
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,500
A lot of people say that the thing about
Batman that's cool is that he doesn't

100
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:50,350
have any like super powers or magical
abilities. I kind of like that.

101
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,420
What's your spirit animal? Uh, save
that I'm, you know, I'm really friendly.

102
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:58,820
I like get along well with people.
Maybe my spirit animal head Louse.

103
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,750
Do you think one shot learning will
gain momentum? It kind of has to.

104
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,460
If we're going to really get
somewhere with intelligence,

105
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:08,390
we have to be able to learn from less
data. Would you ever go to Coachella? No.

106
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,400
Instagram or vine Graham Mac
books or Microsoft surfaces books,

107
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:16,190
but I get a surface is not
bad. Pen or pencil. Pencil.

108
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,020
Would you ever wear the Iwatch? I try
anything once. All right, Catherine,

109
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,280
that's it for my 67 questions. Thanks
so much for answering those. Awesome.

110
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,810
All right.
Have a good one.
