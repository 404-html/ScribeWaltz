1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,870
Hello world,

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,370
it's Suraj and are you ready to learn
computer science in five months?

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,340
Crazy, right. I know. Welcome to my world.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,670
Traditional universities tend to offer
a CS major that gives students a path to

5
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:18,510
go from no programming experience to
having a broad understanding of the many

6
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:22,410
disciplines at the field of
computer science encompasses.

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,390
In this video I'm going to give you my
condensed version of a computer science

8
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:30,630
major one that will take
you five months to Spanish.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,790
This is the kind of study plan I create
for myself if I wanted to not only learn

10
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:40,770
how to code but to have a
basic understanding of the
most important areas of

11
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:41,790
computer science.

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,500
All the resources I'm going to list here
are free and available on the Internet

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,610
and if you want to stay up to
date with my educational content,

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,690
don't forget to hit the
subscribe button before we start.

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,720
Remember you should speed up the time it
takes to complete the courses I list by

16
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:01,440
speeding up videos,

17
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,120
dedicating two to three hours a day to
this doing only one project per course at

18
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:10,440
the end of the week, and handwriting
notes as you go for memory retention.

19
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,161
Oh,

20
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:16,161
and remember to follow some
notable computer scientists
while you learn that all

21
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:19,680
list here so you can stay
up to date in this field.

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,820
We're going to start our journey by
learning the python programming language.

23
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,210
Python is an interpreted object oriented,

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,010
high level programming language
with dynamics semantics, WTF,

25
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:34,410
right?
I know lots of jargon to take in.

26
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,150
Let's start with a learning resource
that requires no knowledge of CS jargon.

27
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,920
There's a great free book online called
automate the boring stuff with python.

28
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,550
It's a practical guide to
programming for our total beginners.

29
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,930
It shows you how to do some basic
tasks like sending reminder emails,

30
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:55,950
moving files and formatting
data using the python language.

31
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,450
Spend the first week reading this book.
It's 18 chapters long,

32
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:03,270
so if you split it up into
three or four chapters a day,

33
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,580
you will finish it by the end of the week.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,950
This book has a bunch of exercises in
it that you can execute from terminal on

35
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:13,740
whatever kind of operating
system your using.

36
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,800
If you need help installing
python on your machine,

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,040
definitely check out python.org
for details on how to do
that in the second week

38
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:27,360
of learning python. I'd recommend taking
the Code Academy Course on Python.

39
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,100
It's got this really fun interactive
console in your web browser so you can get

40
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:35,850
instant feedback on your code and
whether it compiles correctly.

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,900
It's gotten really popular with beginners
over the years and they've got a bunch

42
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:43,830
of other cool courses you can check
out later, two weeks in total.

43
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:48,270
It should be a good amount of time to
get the basics of python down. Yes,

44
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:52,590
the applications you'll be building
in these first two weeks aren't world

45
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:57,570
changing, but understanding the
syntax of the language, the keywords,

46
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,070
how often they're used,

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,340
why they're used are crucial to
help you get to the next step.

48
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,730
Building and understanding
data structures.

49
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,720
I remember when I was a computer
science freshmen at Columbia,

50
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,580
one of the mantras that everyone would
tell me was that data structures and

51
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:20,500
algorithms are the most important subjects
you'll ever take for your major and

52
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,600
at the time it seemed ludicrous.

53
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,700
How could that be more important than
say learning something much more exciting

54
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:32,140
like robotics or computer vision?
Well, it turns out they were right.

55
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,410
Being able to build cool things for the
endless applications of computer science

56
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,310
requires you to understand how to
properly store data and manipulate it to

57
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,420
accomplish your task.

58
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,740
Ed X has a great course on data structures
talk by Uc San Diego that will show

59
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:54,241
you how all the various data structures
from binary trees to link lists work

60
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,990
with implementations in python. After
that you want to move into algorithms.

61
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:03,991
Perhaps the best course for this that
uses python as its base language is the

62
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:06,490
intro to algorithms course by Mit.

63
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,710
You can find all the lecturers associated
notes and problem sets in one place on

64
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:12,520
their website.

65
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,750
You'll notice when it comes to data
structures and algorithms that once you

66
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:20,080
start building and
understanding a couple of them,

67
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,300
everything starts to make sense.

68
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,410
You start to understand the trade off
you'll have to make when it comes to

69
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:30,400
sorting data and storing it properly
and when you start thinking of

70
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:31,480
applications,

71
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,490
you'll be able to tell what types of data
structures and algorithms you'll need

72
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,950
to accomplish the task on to the next one.

73
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,540
Whether you're building a web APP or a
mobile app or even just working with data

74
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:47,590
in general. It's important to
understand how databases work.

75
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Sequel is the most popular
standard language for
databases and Coursera has this

76
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:57,880
course called databases with python that
will help you understand that easily.

77
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,900
You can go ahead and skip the first
week of this course since you've already

78
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:06,901
covered the learning python bit and had
straight into the rest of it for the

79
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:07,420
next week.

80
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,420
We'll take a short break from python
to focus on networking before you start

81
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:17,680
building apps that use the
internet. You've got to
understand how this internet,

82
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,750
this nervous system for humanity that
actually allows us to communicate

83
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,760
instantly and globally works.

84
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,120
Coursera has got a course
that was created by Google,

85
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,690
cleverly called the bits and
bites of computer networking.

86
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,220
You'll learn how the internet protocol
suite works and finally understand what

87
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:41,221
happens under the hood when you type a
website into the URL bar and hit enter.

88
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,340
After you've done this,

89
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,850
you're ready to dive into the world
of web and mobile programming.

90
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,080
I'm a big fan of the computer science
professor David Milan at Harvard.

91
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,090
He's got a really charming enthusiasm
about him that keeps you engaged.

92
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,470
The best course for this is Harvard's
cs 50 web programming with python and

93
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,220
javascript. Yes, we've
only covered python so far,

94
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,750
but it's necessary to
understand javascript, the
language of the web as well.

95
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,610
You can find the videos in
a simple youtube playlist
and he'll show you how you

96
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:18,590
can combine some of the most important
technologies of web programming together

97
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,330
to create elegant web apps that
anybody can access from a web browser.

98
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,070
Spend the next week building a single
web app that really excites you,

99
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,420
but it's also doable in a single week.
Don't get too ambitious.

100
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,720
Elsie will be able to finish
it and you'll get discouraged.

101
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,970
There are some great examples on get hub
that can serve as inspiration and it'll

102
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:43,610
give you practice using stack overflow.

103
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,380
One of the most important
tools for programmers for
quick and easy explanations

104
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,500
for how and why to use certain
programming techniques.

105
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,220
When it comes to mobile development,
you've got two options.

106
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,310
Ios and android spend the first week
building an Ios APP and the second week

107
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,180
building an android APP.

108
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,920
That way you can see the difference
between both and realize which type of

109
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:11,921
programming environment you prefer and
build the same app in both environments

110
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:16,490
to really see where the differences
are built. Something really simple.

111
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,080
It'll be a challenge to even get a simple
app set up because you first got to

112
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:26,081
install the dependencies and learn how
their respective ids work like x code and

113
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:31,490
android studio. Now that we've got
the fundamental stuff out of the way,

114
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,170
let's move on to the funner stuff.

115
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,280
Data Science is the art of
making discoveries from data.

116
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,440
Usually this is done using statistical
analysis and machine learning methods.

117
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,150
Add X has a course called python
for data science taught by UC SD.

118
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,890
That would be a great way to jump
into this field. It's especially long,

119
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:53,930
so spread this one out to two weeks.

120
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:58,820
It'll help put your python knowledge to
immediate use and you'll get familiar

121
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:03,800
with popular python libraries for
data science like pandas and num py.

122
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,030
After this, you'll have just a bit
of knowledge of machine learning,

123
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,890
which contains so many different
disciplines in an of itself.

124
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,800
It'll take you a while to
really learn all of it,

125
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,360
but a great way to dive into this
field is to pick applied fields of ml,

126
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,260
like natural language processing
and computer vision and study.

127
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:26,750
Those dedicate a single week to each.

128
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,230
Coursera has got a great course on
NLP and you'd Udacity has a course on

129
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:32,360
computer vision taught by Georgia Tech.

130
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,280
One thing to remember is that it's not
just enough to know how to program.

131
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,250
You need to know how to program in a team.

132
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,180
That's why you should dedicate the
next week to learning the software

133
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:45,650
development process.

134
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,390
Coursera has a course called software
development processes and methodologies

135
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:55,070
that covers all the different team based
techniques for working on code with

136
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,330
other people.
If you want to work at a company,

137
00:08:57,331 --> 00:08:59,430
be at Google or the smallest startup,

138
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,540
it's essential to know this stuff
for the last week of this curriculum.

139
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Usually get a broad overview
of the cryptocurrency
blockchain space because it's

140
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:12,810
so hot right now, not because it's
the most advanced topic to tackle,

141
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:16,380
but because it's a very current
topic and a hot one at that.

142
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,970
I've got a great crypto currency playlist
for you on youtube that you should

143
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:23,880
check out.
I hope my curriculum is helpful to you.

144
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,370
You'll find all the links
necessary down below.

145
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,190
Please subscribe for more
programming videos. And for now,

146
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,070
I've got to learn how to learn.
So thanks for watching.
