Hello world it Saroj and I'm going to
give you five steps to study machine

2
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:09,930
learning as effectively
as possible in this video.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,490

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,540
The first step to studying machine
learning effectively is to live a healthy

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,560
lifestyle.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,740
That means taking care of yourself as a
biological learning machine consisting

8
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:30,210
of both mind and body.

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,570
It's important to eliminate
what Dr. Daniel Amen the
author of use your brain to

10
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:40,860
change your age called a and t's
or automatic negative thoughts.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,040
These are thoughts that everybody has
had at some point like I'm not smart

12
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:51,321
enough or I'm too old or
my GPU is AMD quality.

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,710
Your brain is a super computer
and your self talk is the program.

14
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:58,890
It will run so program your computer.
Well,

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,110
in this information age,

16
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:06,111
you have access to every machine learning
resource you need including data,

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,590
algorithms, computing,
power and education.

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,050
There's no excuse to say,

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,110
I can learn machine learning because of x.

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,680
Having a positive peer
group can help with this.

21
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,180
Find people that encourage and
support your learning journey.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,480
You are the sum of the five people you
spend the most time with and if you can't

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,640
find a supportive group locally,

24
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:37,910
find your nearest school of AI chapter
or hang out in our slack channel.

25
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,220
It can be just as fulfilling having social
interactions online as it is offline.

26
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,460
Also,
exercise is super important to learning.

27
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,110
Research shows that anything that's good
for your heart is also good for your

28
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:52,944
brain.

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,040
People who exercise regularly have better
blood flow and oxygen in their brains

30
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,690
and as an inevitable result,
perform better on mental acuity tests.

31
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,990
Find a physical activity you actually
enjoy like swimming or biking and that way

32
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:13,470
you'll stick to it despite the
pain and the phrase you are,

33
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:16,050
what you eat is very much true.

34
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,260
Try to avoid too much processed food
and sugar and drink lots of water.

35
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,210
Make this a part of your lifestyle.

36
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:29,270
I myself eat a mostly Paleo Diet and do
full body workouts using weights three

37
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:30,480
times a week.

38
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,750
Also getting a good night's rest is
essential because it's when your brain

39
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:40,440
consolidates short to long term memory.
Lastly,

40
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,470
information overload is a real thing in
today's notification driven society and

41
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:50,490
can lead to burning out.
Make sure to take time to disconnect.

42
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,900
Give yourself a break.

43
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,930
It's okay to isolate yourself from
the Internet to rejuvenate a bit.

44
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,720
I put my phone on mode at least two hours
before I sleep every night and try to

45
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:09,151
have at least one 24 hour period a week
where I'm completely disconnected in

46
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:15,280
nature. This second step is to
optimize your learning environment.

47
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,830
What is your study space look like?

48
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,040
I find I can study more efficiently when
I do so in a designated study space.

49
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,570
I'm not as productive if I'm learning
in the same room where I sleep,

50
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,880
so I go to an office.

51
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,910
It's my designated learning only zone
and it's easier to focus when you're in a

52
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:40,450
clean environment.
So don't have a cluttered desk.

53
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,440
Try to minimize distractions
like Black Mirror as well.

54
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,860
Everybody has different preferences
on what is considered a distraction.

55
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,700
I try and eliminate all sound
using noise canceling headphones.

56
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,970
Libraries are always a great place to
study since they are quiet and coffee

57
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:01,660
shops work as well.

58
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,020
The third step is to create a
personalized learning path for yourself.

59
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,630
I've now made several learning paths that
hundreds of thousands of wizards have

60
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:13,930
participated in,

61
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:19,110
whether they're related to deep learning
or machine learning or general computer

62
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:20,164
science.

63
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,380
The way I designed these curriculums was
by first thinking of the topics in AI

64
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,840
that interested me the most.

65
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,110
Then finding relevant resources using
Google helped me learn about those topics

66
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:39,010
in order of complexity,
I follow my curiosity.

67
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,010
That's the best way to
stick to any learning path.

68
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:44,650
As long as it's curiosity driven,

69
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,860
it's something that you're
actually interested in.

70
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,580
You'll have no problem putting
in the time to learn it.

71
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,330
Curiosity killed the cat,
right? Wait, scratch that.

72
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,360
Think of it like a metta curriculum.

73
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,460
Your curriculum can consist of
other full curriculums, blog posts,

74
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:08,440
research papers, podcasts, books.
It can be as diverse as possible.

75
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,620
Some people can learn best from videos
while others learn best from pure text.

76
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,350
By having a diverse set
of learning resources,

77
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,820
you'll learn what works best for
you and in your learning journey.

78
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,900
It's okay to update your
curriculum as you go.

79
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,820
Sometimes you might find something new
you'd like to focus on more deeply and

80
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:33,010
you can allow yourself to do that.

81
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,180
As long as you have a set of
small achievable learning goals,

82
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,350
you'll have the reward feedback to
complete your entire curriculum.

83
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,650
A great easy way to do this is to
participate in the 100 days of ml code

84
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:47,800
challenge.

85
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,600
It's a pledge to dedicate at least
one hour every day to studying machine

86
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:55,390
learning. Linked to details will
be in the video description.

87
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,580
The fourth step is to prioritize.

88
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,550
This is a skill that you'll
always be improving at.

89
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,720
There's a bunch of things you
could be doing at any given moment,

90
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,130
but it's important to focus
on the most important tasks.

91
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,800
Multitasking is a myth.

92
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,980
Switching between tasks is what's actually
happening and this takes more time

93
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,420
and it's less productive.
Also,

94
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:25,421
it causes more errors every
time you switch tasks you've
got to regain focus and

95
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:30,050
flow,
which takes between five and 20 minutes.

96
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,700
I create a to do list of
tasks for each day, week,

97
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,510
month and year and try to
stick to it as best as I can.

98
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,550
It's worked pretty well so far.

99
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,800
Evaluate each item on your list as to its
importance for your learning goals and

100
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,660
eliminate the unnecessary. You can use
this framework of a two by two grid,

101
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:55,430
with four quadrants to help you
prioritize mapping out concepts.

102
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,580
It balances how useful a concept is
with how much time you have to learn it.

103
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,620
And the last step is to
be an active learner.

104
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,070
We can use the fast framework
to do this effectively.

105
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,850
It's an acronym that stands for forget,
activate state,

106
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,820
teach and we'll help you
learn anything faster.

107
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,000
Forget means that when you're
learning something new,

108
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,290
try and temporarily forget three things.
First,

109
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,860
forget what you already
know about the subject.

110
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,100
Lots of people don't learn faster because
they feel like they already know the

111
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:33,380
information,
but our minds are like parachutes.

112
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:38,060
They only work when opened. Mike
drop. It's like that Yoda saying,

113
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:40,820
you must unlearn what you have learned.
Also,

114
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,010
forget about anything that's not urgent.

115
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,390
Remember the brain can't multitask
and if you aren't fully present,

116
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,930
you won't learn as well and
forget your limitations,

117
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,960
those beliefs that your memory is bad
or you don't have the right education to

118
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:59,120
learn.
The a stands for active.

119
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:03,860
Most of us were taught in school that
learning means being lectured to.

120
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,530
The opposite is actually true.

121
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,210
We learn by creating information
and being active in the process.

122
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,430
It's not a spectator sport.

123
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,670
That means asking questions
on stack overflow,

124
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:21,800
taking notes while you consume educational
content and coding up solutions

125
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:26,150
yourself. Spend most of your
time doing not consuming.

126
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,160
The s stands for states.
All learning is state dependent.

127
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,250
If you feel bored,
you won't be able to learn as well.

128
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,870
So choose states of curiosity,
happiness and eagerness.

129
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,140
You can do this by altering your posture
or ideating about how learning AI will

130
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:45,920
help you in the long run.

131
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,920
By giving you limitless career
options and the t stands for teach,

132
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,610
you can literally cut your learning
curve in half if you will learn with the

133
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:59,430
intention of teaching it to somebody else.

134
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,770
This is what I do full time.

135
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,210
I learned to teach and that's
why I can learn so much. So fast.

136
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,910
I'm always teaching and while learning,

137
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,970
start with the simplest
explanations first.

138
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,120
That way you don't give up.
For example,

139
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,020
if you're trying to learn about
variational auto encoders,

140
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,820
start with a video or blog posts
that explains it at a high level,

141
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,410
not the paper. And as you familiarize
yourself with the concept,

142
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,450
you can progressively increase the
complexity of the educational content you

143
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:37,320
consume. Oh, and one more
thing. While you learn,

144
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,540
make sure to take frequent breaks,

145
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,980
your attention and retention
diminish after about 30 minutes.

146
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:48,450
So breaks can help reset that.
And that's pretty much it.

147
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,320
I'll have links to everything I've
talked about and a bunch of learning

148
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:56,520
resources for you in the video
description. It's learning time.

149
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:58,650
Are you excited?
If you like this video,
