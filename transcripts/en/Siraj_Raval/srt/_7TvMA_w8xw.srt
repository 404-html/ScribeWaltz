Hello world,

2
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:05,901
it's Saroj and I've now selected over
800 school of AI deans across 400 cities

3
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:09,900
globally.
In the past week.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,930
These deans have been hard at work
building infrastructure to welcome wizards

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,130
from their respective communities
to learn more about AI technology.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,900
They've been creating Facebook groups,
meetup groups, Twitter accounts.

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,570
It has been so incredible to see.

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,580
School of AI chapters are safe
spaces for wizards everywhere.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,060
They're a place to meet likeminded people,
learn,

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,790
get inspired and educate others.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,850
The deans are guardians of our core
values and mission and will help guide you

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,160
on your Ai Journey.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,480
Some deans have even held their
first local class already,

14
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,790
which makes me very happy to see.

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,890
I've attached a link to a listing
of all school of AI chapters.

16
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:02,100
It's in the video description.
Find Your City,

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,190
join your local group and
attend the first class.

18
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,000
Make sure to offer to help your
local dean in any way you can.

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,440
Some are still looking for suitable
venues and or local sponsorships.

20
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,790
It is truly an amazing time to be
alive and let's spread this AI power.
