1
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,910
We have to talk about this hello world.

2
00:00:05,911 --> 00:00:10,911
It's Saroj and Chinoiserie Chinese state
government run news organization just

3
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,530
for build the first AI news anchor.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,980
They train the model on video
data from real news anchors,

5
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:21,630
so it was able to learn relevant
features like speech patterns and facial

6
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:25,350
movements, but they didn't reveal
the type of model they used,

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,720
so I'm going to take an educated guess.

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,250
It's very likely that they use what's
called a generative adversarial network

9
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:37,230
Orgam to do this and have proven to be
able to generate all sorts of data that

10
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:40,920
looks very real, but it's
fake. The process is simple.

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,420
One neural network called the generator
is fed random data as input and

12
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:49,890
transforms it through a series of matrix
math operations and to an output image.

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,990
Another neural network called
the discriminator is fed
an image from the actual

14
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:55,860
training data,

15
00:00:55,861 --> 00:01:00,840
which in our case would be a single video
frame and through a series of again,

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,230
matrix operations outputs
a simple binary value,

17
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:08,280
classifying it as real or fake.
We also feed the discriminator,

18
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:11,790
the output of the generator and since
it's so different from the real data,

19
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,560
it will classify it as fake.

20
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,000
We can measure just how different it is
from the real image and by using this

21
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:23,001
error value we can change the numerical
values ever so slightly in both networks

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,110
such that in the next iteration the
generator will produce a more realistic

23
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:31,830
looking image. Since videos are
just a series of image frames,

24
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,950
we can use a fully trained generator to
eventually output very realistic video

25
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:37,854
data,

26
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,860
combine it with a text to speech system
and this anchor is capable of working 24

27
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:45,420
hours a day without needing any breaks,

28
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:50,070
which greatly reduces the cost of news
production and improves efficiency.

29
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,320
She also claims that it's capable of
learning from live broadcast videos.

30
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,460
China has accomplished an
incredible feat in just 30 years.

31
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,290
It's transformed itself from one of the
world's poorest countries to its second

32
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,270
largest economy in China.

33
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,010
The relationship between state and society
is profoundly different from that in

34
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:14,910
the west. And so our, its
various traditions of governance,

35
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,940
some of which date back
to 5,000 years ago,

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,440
their values reflect Confucianist
philosophy, meaning plurality,

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,920
pragmatism and collectivism,
not individualism.

38
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,480
All of this has shaped its government
and it's impossible to talk about China's

39
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:35,100
rise to AI power without talking
about its most powerful figure.

40
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,750
Xi Jinping Xi is the general secretary
of the Chinese Communist Party.

41
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,610
He's at the core of a seven member
Standing Committee of the politburo and

42
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:48,840
together they formed the inner most
circle of China's governance structures.

43
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,620
All Chinese institutions
including the government court,

44
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,370
military and crucially tech
companies report to this party.

45
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,970
She's 40 year long,
uh,

46
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,990
sent to the presidency involved 16
major promotions through county,

47
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,790
city and province levels and then numerous
other institutions with reviews at

48
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:10,090
every single state to assess
his leadership abilities.

49
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,350
And despite numerous human rights abuses,
endless press,

50
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:16,930
censorship and environmental damage,

51
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,130
this authoritarian structure has driven
China to become the second largest

52
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:24,820
economy in the world.
She has near absolute power.

53
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:28,120
The man is even enshrined
in the constitution itself.

54
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,180
This is important because a quick look
at his bookshelf during his annual New

55
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,820
Year's Day greeting shows that
he has copies of Pedro Domingos,

56
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,230
the Master Algorithm, and Brett kings
augmented life in the smart lane,

57
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,500
both of which discuss AI
technologies in detail.

58
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,460
I've read the master algorithm.
That book is technical.

59
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,450
It covers concepts like Bayesian
inference and support vector machines.

60
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,520
She understands the transformational
power of AI at a technical level,

61
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,340
arguably more than many
other world leaders,

62
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,610
and this has manifested itself in China's
ambitious AI plan by 2020 it envisions

63
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:11,671
that China's progress in AI should keep
pace with the world advanced level.

64
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,710
While it's AI industry becomes an
important economic growth point by 2025 at

65
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:17,291
once,

66
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:21,790
you have achieved a major breakthrough
in AI to reach a leading level with AI

67
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:26,380
becoming the primary driver for China's
industrial advances and economic

68
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:27,214
transformation.

69
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,170
And by 2030 in wants to become the
world's Premiere Ai Innovation Center,

70
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,090
a $1 trillion AI industry.
When it comes to the implementation of Ai.

71
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:41,470
China has one clear advantage over
other countries in that it's the most

72
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:44,920
populated country in the world,
which means more data.

73
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,270
Ai Algorithm needs lots of data
to learn from. The more data,

74
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,920
the better the result. What matters
in implementation of Ai is speed,

75
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,940
product quality, data,
government support and execution,

76
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,040
all of which China is excelling at.

77
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,550
But the U S and Canada have
an edge in AI research.

78
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,100
The top researchers in the
world still live there.

79
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,600
If the climate for researchers in China
becomes drastically better though,

80
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,210
don't expect them to
keep their allegiances.

81
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,810
The Chinese AI startup
environment is very gladiator.

82
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:20,290
Like think survival of the
fittest. Fail fast, fail early,

83
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:24,730
fail often working very long hours is
the norm as that's what's necessary to

84
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:26,830
succeed.
Take Uber for example.

85
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,100
Uber is a business that was
invented in the u s in matches,

86
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:35,101
drivers and riders together with cars
being the mode of transportation in China.

87
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,140
However, as startups started
trying to emulate Uber,

88
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,370
they try out every possible iteration,
shared mopeds, shared bikes,

89
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,930
shared concrete mixers, shared mobile
phone chargers. Many of them died,

90
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,020
but a few like mobike rose up to become
Unicorn companies reaching 20 million

91
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:56,770
rides per day and being sold for
two point $7 billion in three years.

92
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,010
This rapid prototyping and tweaking
approach is uniquely Chinese.

93
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,230
Another example is food delivery.

94
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:07,340
Postmates is a successful US
company that offers food delivery,

95
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,180
but it would never work in
China. Why? Because may Twan,

96
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,560
it's Chinese equivalent,

97
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,710
is able to deliver food to any location
within 30 minutes and under 70 cents are

98
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,750
faster and cheaper that
Postmates ever could.

99
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,830
That's because the founder learned that
people wanted to eat, take out food,

100
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,000
but it had to be delivered within 30
minutes and that the costs should be

101
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:33,920
brought down to 70 cents per delivery
in order to profitably offer free

102
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:37,430
delivery.
May Twan worked on this problem for years.

103
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,460
Eventually they hired 600 k people on
mopeds inventing an AI algorithm to find

104
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:47,360
writers willing to work during meal
hours and modifying the vehicle to be low

105
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:49,010
cost using battery power.

106
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,750
It took them billions of dollars of
losses and many years of iteration before

107
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,340
they got there,
but they did it.

108
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,500
Chinese companies are ruthless stealing
best practices from each other,

109
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,210
copying what works.

110
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,050
So what may Twan did was
build an indestructible moat.

111
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,270
It would require far too much time,

112
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,420
capital and effort for any copycat to
build the infrastructure that they did and

113
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:16,070
that's how they won.
Because of this,

114
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:21,071
it's valued at 60 billion US dollars
to compare in the u s Groupon,

115
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,700
Yelp and open table are collectively
worth less than one 10th of that.

116
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,110
Chinese apps are often more feature
rich and efficient than their American

117
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:34,430
counterparts. We chat for example,
it's like whatsapp on steroids.

118
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,290
Not only can you message people, you
can book a taxi, get food deliveries,

119
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,260
pay your bills,
book train tickets all from one act.

120
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,200
This does bring up the
question of privacy.

121
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:50,260
Giant Chinese tech companies like Tencent
and Alibaba are gathering huge amounts

122
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:51,980
of data from their users.

123
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,600
Outcries on Chinese social media show
that citizens have been concerned that

124
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:01,520
their data was being mined illegitimately
by private companies and sold on the

125
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,040
black market.
In response to this.

126
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:09,041
China issued their first data protection
standard that lays out rules around

127
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:13,820
what is consent and the conditions upon
which companies can collect personal

128
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:14,180
data.

129
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,180
The way the government responds to
public outcry is not through a democratic

130
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:20,060
process.

131
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,440
Unlike his predecessor who allowed
people to voice their opinions to the

132
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:28,250
government directly through
democratic means like town halls.

133
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,310
She uses a combination of surveillance,

134
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,490
AI and big data to monitor people's
lives and behavior in minute detail.

135
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,180
Every day he gets a briefing on public
sentiment scrapped from the web on

136
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:45,650
various issues. She is also very
interested in autonomous weapons.

137
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,730
Just this month,

138
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:51,590
31 high school children were selected
for a four year program in AI weapons

139
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:56,580
systems out of more than five k candidates
think drones that decide who to kill,

140
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,840
how to kill them and do so more
efficiently than any human ever could.

141
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,970
This kind of technology put into the wrong
hands could quickly become weapons of

142
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:07,170
mass destruction,

143
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,650
but there is hope by Du has recently
become the first Chinese company to join a

144
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:16,680
u s led alliance on AI
called the partnership on Ai.

145
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,870
This effort to include China in the
global discussion on regulating AI is one

146
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:23,520
step in the right direction.

147
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,550
She also doesn't like being
compared to Winnie the Pooh,

148
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:31,551
so all references mentioning that phrase
are classified using neural network

149
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:34,170
technology and systematically deleted.

150
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:39,630
The state government holds a tight grip
on all social network data, all voices,

151
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,970
all media,
everything is controlled.

152
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,300
The amount of surveillance and
censorship in China is truly astounding.

153
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,840
Cameras are installed across
countless street corners in stores,

154
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:56,580
in offices using computer vision
technology powered by convolutional neural

155
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:59,910
networks to detect and
identify people's faces.

156
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,290
This helps the government track people
based on their social credit score and

157
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,360
modify it based on their behavior.

158
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,660
The social credit score system
is a centralized database
that gives each citizen

159
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:14,370
a number that defines their reputation.

160
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,180
The problem is that social
trust has eroded in China.

161
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,800
Everyone has an aunt or uncle who's
been swindled or scammed by someone,

162
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,630
and the reason for that is that the
Chinese government doesn't allow for third

163
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:32,631
party social institutions to exist outside
of the scope of government influence

164
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,780
and control.

165
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,580
It's a government created problem and
they provided a government created

166
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:41,340
solution,
the social credit score system,

167
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,920
so while many Chinese are wary of it,

168
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,720
they welcome it as a way to potentially
remedy the crisis of social trust,

169
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,920
financial records, criminal
records, online social network data.

170
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,060
Whether or not you buy alcohol,
all of it informs your credit score.

171
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,260
They've used it to ban people from
traveling on trains and the government can

172
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,310
even reduce your social score
if you disagree with its policy.

173
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,040
It also uses AI to predict crimes.

174
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:12,480
Police officer's regularly visit certain
homes to collect data on things like

175
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,200
how many people live in a household,
how many times they prey,

176
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,580
what books they have,

177
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,660
and these data streams are fed
into a public security system.

178
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,670
Their algorithm aggregates all the data
from these different sources and flags

179
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:28,830
who might become a threat to authorities.

180
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,890
We don't know what the
algorithm is exactly,

181
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:36,030
but it's likely a deep learning
classifier out putting a probability of

182
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:39,570
criminality. We can thus think
of the Internet in China,

183
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:43,860
like a real time privately run
digital intelligence service.

184
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,030
The great firewall has blocked countless
American services from reaching the

185
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:52,950
Chinese population. Despite the
government using AI to exploit people,

186
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,530
censor the population,
and create autonomous weapons.

187
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,660
It's also using AI to lift people out of
poverty and increase economic stability.

188
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,370
Surveys show that while the Chinese
majority generally like their style of

189
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:07,060
government,

190
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,920
there's also a strong demand in China for
Western values like freedom of speech,

191
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,770
government transparency,
and rule of law.

192
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,570
The best thing we can do is partner
with the Chinese across industries,

193
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,930
respect their unique society
and way of doing things,

194
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:28,110
and provide uncensorable applications
using blockchain technology that allow

195
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:30,400
them to connect with
the rest of the world.

196
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,680
Because as long as we all have a voice,

197
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,950
it makes it much harder to
violate basic human rights.

198
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,370
It's an exciting time for China
and the rest of the world.

199
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,780
Shisha please subscribe for more
programming videos and for now,

200
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,380
I've got to visit China sometime,
so thanks for watching.
