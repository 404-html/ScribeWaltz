1
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,820
Hey Allen, how's it going? That's
great. How are you? Pretty good.

2
00:00:07,821 --> 00:00:10,310
Can I ask you six or seven
questions? Yeah, sure. Go for it.

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,700
What's one application of
plots of computing that
you're most excited about so

4
00:00:13,701 --> 00:00:16,920
it could fall diagnosis.
Do you miss MIT? Uh,

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,610
sometimes I need to be
politically correct here.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,570
Favorite part of the
software stack? Oh, I love,

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,510
so first of all, I love the tools, right?

8
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:31,790
And making it easy for developers to be
able to rate code in the quantum system.

9
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,270
I love that. What's one thing
you really like about Vancouver?

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,390
How the view from my apartment,
this is amazing.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,140
Overlooking Coal Harbor in the mountains.
Where did the name D Wade come from?

12
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,140
I have no clue.
What do you do to relax?

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,280
I fly.
I'm a pilot.

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,260
Will quantum computing replace
classical computing? Uh,

15
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,010
it will probably always
work synergistically with
classic computer classical

16
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:00,740
computing through hybrid
algorithms and applications.

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,050
Last thing you made with your hands.

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,610
Uh, some gesture I'm sure. Next.
Probably while I was driving.

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,630
Next problem you want to solve?
Uh,

20
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,390
um, you know, I am really impressed
how next problem I want to solve.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,880
Oh,
delivering our next generation processor.

22
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,300
What advice would you give
yourself 10 years ago?

23
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,540
Uh,

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,490
do exactly what you ended up doing
over the 10 years that followed.

25
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,800
What website you waste time on.

26
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,780
Don't waste a lot of time on websites.
I uh,

27
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,710
right now I'm spending all my time looking
at the monitoring system for the new

28
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:52,580
leap service and I love being there.
Last person you've emailed

29
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,650
it was, uh, somebody
who reports to me about,

30
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,020
um,
doing some planning work.

31
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,400
You get an all expenses paid trip to
one city. Where do you go? Bora Bora.

32
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,520
Would you visit Mars?
Uh,

33
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,120
know what to take too long to get there.
I love my family.

34
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,350
What is one thing you can't
live without? Diet, Dr Pepper.

35
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,030
What's one thing people often
misunderstand about computers?

36
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,270
Anyway,
this is our lab a he wave systems.

37
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:34,120
I've been trying to avoid your question.
Um,

38
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,920
but people often misunderstand
about quantum computers. Um,

39
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:40,930
uh,

40
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,850
I believe quantum computers are going
to solve real commercial problems or at

41
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:49,330
least pieces of real commercial
problems sooner than most people think,

42
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:54,570
but they're not gonna do it by solving
problems that are intractable classically

43
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,140
by being able to solve existing problems
that can be solved through existing

44
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,840
classical computers,
but just more efficiently.

45
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,230
What text editor do you use?
Word

46
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,380
Open source library that
you really like? Uh, yeah,

47
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,120
the uh, ocean tool suite from Dui.
What's one of your favorite movies?

48
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,390
Uh, I always liked air force one
and my, now I'm giving away my age.

49
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,150
What is something you do to come
up with project ideas? Yeah,

50
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,310
just think about the marketplace and what
customers are telling us they want or

51
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:40,310
need. Can we take some steps inside?
Yeah, please. Your hobbies outside of

52
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:46,580
flying,
that's flying an airplane.

53
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,340
Not any other form of light.

54
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,270
What is the first program
you've ever made? Um,

55
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,630
it was a synthetic aperture radar
program when I was back in college.

56
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,250
Professor, uh, that was a while ago.

57
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,470
My thesis advisor run revisted am I take

58
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,580
ideal culture in one word?

59
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,813
Yeah.

60
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,750
An ideal culture team,
team oriented culture,

61
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,880
best advice you've ever received.

62
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,260
Um,
go for it.

63
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,280
Okay.

64
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,280
You think you need a phd to do quantum
developing now will the singularity,

65
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:37,270
I don't think you need a master's degree
if you're a good python program program

66
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:42,040
or you can program the d system.
What's your spirit animal?

67
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,380
Okay.

68
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,230
I don't know.
Favorite Linux?

69
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,240
Uh,
whichever one we're using with Dua.

70
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,500
What's something you've
learned in the past?

71
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,700
Okay.

72
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,720
MMM.

73
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,090
So we just had our customer conference
and there were 20 new applications that

74
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:06,270
our customers have developed.

75
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,690
Everyone of those applications
was interesting and
something new that I learned

76
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,170
and are sorry. Ah, okay.

77
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,010
I was a Nerd,
any rd nerd and I was proud of it.

78
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,050
What resource do you use the most to
learn about the latest breakthroughs?

79
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,500
Uh,
I mean the web.

80
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,360
What's something that excites you
about the future? Quantum computing.

81
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,880
If you were to start from scratch today,

82
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,290
what is a learning resource
you would use alert.

83
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,290
Okay.

84
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:43,501
Oh,

85
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:47,910
I would go to leap the new cloud service
from Dua of the new quantum application

86
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:48,481
environment,

87
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,990
which has all the training materials you
need to learn about quantum computing.

88
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,450
What's the bravest thing you've ever done?
Wow.

89
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,420
Uh, I don't really feel like
I've done anything brave.

90
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,340
What is the meaning of life?

91
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,300
Okay.

92
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,590
Uh, you know what a family,
uh, you know, just my wife,

93
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,550
my kids family. Look, it's the
last thing that frustrated you.

94
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,343
Okay.

95
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,203
MMM.

96
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,220
When we pushed an update to the leap
service prior to lines and there was some

97
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:29,020
changes in it that I wasn't
made aware of it ahead of time.

98
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,160
You've got frustrated me.
Name one person you really admire.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,220
Um,
my wife,

100
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,150
what's the most beautiful
thing in the world? My wife.

101
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,340
What are the people you've met
at Bonton conferences? Like,

102
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,053
okay.

103
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,170
It depends on the conference. Um, you
know, sometimes their investors, uh,

104
00:06:52,171 --> 00:06:55,500
sometimes there are
physicists and mathematicians.

105
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,730
Sometimes there are hardcore engineers,
sometimes it's developers.

106
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:04,290
It depends on the conference. What's
a music genre you're currently into?

107
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,180
I mean for me it's the 60s in the 70s.
Again,

108
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,750
my age cause that we have to keep
coming back to that. Oh No, no. In fact,

109
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:19,680
that was the last question.
Great. Awesome. Well thank
you so much. My pleasure.

110
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,840
It was great. It's a fun, fun thing.
