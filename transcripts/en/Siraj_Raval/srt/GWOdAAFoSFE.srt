1
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,450
Hello slush. Good to be
here. How's everybody doing?

2
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,530
My name is Saraj revolver and hello world.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,180
That's my intro on youtube where I
inspire and educate lots of developers to

4
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:22,014
build AI.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,740
Today my talk is going to be about
decentralize artificial intelligence,

6
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,000
Aka what happens when we take the
two hottest technologies of today,

7
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,670
AI and blockchain and put them together,
right?

8
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:36,180
It's just sprinkle everything
on top of each other. Right?

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,280
So let's get right on into this. We've got
a lot to cover. So machine learning, AI,

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,190
this has been around since the 50s
it's not a new technology, it's,

11
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:48,720
it's a pretty old technology.
But basically the idea
has always been the same.

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,620
We have some data sets, right? Some input
Dataset, and we have some objective.

13
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:56,640
We have something that we want
the Ai to do. In this case,

14
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,520
classify a car.
Is it a car or is it not a car?

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,200
So what we do is we feed this
AI a bunch of images of cars.

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,220
So think of it like an excel spreadsheet
with two columns and column one you

17
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:11,880
just have pictures of cars. And column
two you just have labels. Karch,

18
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:13,570
our cargo hook, cocoa car, right?

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,410
And so the idea is that
the AI learns the mapping,

20
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,490
the relationship between the
input data and the output labels.

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,320
There is some relationship
between everything.

22
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:26,430
There is a function in life
for everything, but that's,
that's a bit of a tangent.

23
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:30,180
The idea though is that the human would
have to extract all the features of what

24
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:33,180
it means to be a car, right? This
is kind of what a car looks like.

25
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,540
This is the shape of the car,
this is what the exhaust pipe looks like.

26
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,930
And this was a very tiring process,
but this is what humans had to do.

27
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,960
We extract features by hand and so what
happened is once we've extracted those

28
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:45,750
features,

29
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,870
we would feed it to some kind of machine
learning model and there's a lot out

30
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:49,320
there.

31
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,980
Eventually it would learn the mapping
and then give it a new car picture and it

32
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:57,450
would know, hey, this is a car. But a few
years ago there was a scientist who said,

33
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,520
let me take one specific machine learning
model called a neural network and tre,

34
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,870
drop the beat, right?
Drop the mic and feed it.

35
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,180
Lots of data and lots of computing power
and add a lot of layers. Deep Layers,

36
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,320
Aka deep learning. That's what we call
it. What happened is when we did this,

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,320
it started outperforming every
other machine learning model.

38
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,250
And now deep learning is the
hottest topic in machine learning.

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,120
It is outperforming everything else.
Self driving cars, drug discovery,

40
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,480
everything hot that you're hearing about.
Hey, AI is coming from deep learning.

41
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,950
Okay,
so that was my one slide overview of AI.

42
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,780
So now blockchain,
right?

43
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,570
So a couple of years ago there
was a programmer who no one knows,

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,350
named Satoshi Nakamoto, who released
a paper on cryptography mailing list,

45
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,390
the killing US system called bitcoin.

46
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:47,391
That allows two people to transmit value
online without needing a third party,

47
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,170
namely a bank. So what happens is
instead of a bank being the third party,

48
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:55,920
there are a group of people called
miners and anybody can become a minor.

49
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:58,830
You just need a laptop, right?
Anybody can become a miner.

50
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,340
And the idea is that when I
transmit value to you from me,

51
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,640
these miners have to approve this
transaction there to say, okay,

52
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,950
let me check this list of transactions.

53
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,300
So every miner has a copy
of every transaction that
has occurred in the network

54
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,990
and they have to approve whether or not
this transaction is valid or not, right?

55
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,010
Cause they have the list. So you
might be thinking, wait a second,

56
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:25,030
couldn't someone just fake, just create a
bunch of accounts and say, Hey, I'm the,

57
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:26,110
I'm the majority of the minors.

58
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:29,500
Cause the majority of the miners have
to approve a transaction for it to be

59
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,580
added to this list of transactions.
Well know because the Toshi,

60
00:03:32,581 --> 00:03:36,120
she said every single
minor has to prove that,

61
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,890
that they have solved some
random mathematical problem.

62
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,930
It's called the proof of work algorithm.

63
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,950
And that means that you have to have
more computing power and the 500 fastest

64
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:49,600
supercomputers in the world combined to
have the majority of the computing power

65
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:53,050
in the bitcoin network. And because
no one has that much computing power,

66
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,940
no one's been able to hack bitcoin.

67
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,080
And that's why it has a over 100
billion market cap as of yesterday,

68
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,560
more than the GDP of some countries
and no one's been able to hack it.

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,350
It's been around for a decade.
So really powerful technology.

70
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,420
Let's keep going here.
But the really,

71
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:11,560
really interesting part about bitcoin
is not the actual application but the

72
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,510
underlying data structure of bitcoin.

73
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,810
So this is kind of a rough diagram of
what it looks like. Very simplified.

74
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,600
But the idea is that we have
some list of transactions, right?

75
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:23,530
I'm talking about this list
of transactions that all
of the miners are holding

76
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,160
and we grew up these transactions
together into little groups that we call

77
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:31,690
blocks and each block points to the
next block. So one block is like, okay,

78
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,630
I'm Melissa transactions, here's the next
block. And that's why I was like, oh,

79
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,300
thanks for that. Okay, here's an
listen on the next block, right?

80
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,740
And it becomes this kind of chain
of blocks. Okay, blockchain, right?

81
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:44,170
So at the blockchain,
that's what we call this data structure.

82
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,950
And because of the proof of work
algorithm, no one can modify it.

83
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,220
It's an unalterable immutable
and computer science terms.

84
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:52,600
Shout out to all the
programmers out there.

85
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,630
It's an immutable data
structure that no one owns.

86
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:57,580
And this saved very powerful idea.

87
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,320
So I like to call this the Yin and
the Yang of Ai and blockchain, right?

88
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:04,810
These two technologies
go really well together,

89
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:08,140
but no one's really put them together yet.
So this is a very futuristic thing.

90
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,530
So the Yin is AI.
Ai Is probabilistic.

91
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,060
It's all about computing the
likelihood that something will happen,

92
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,480
the prediction of the future using what
it's learned. And Ai is always changing.

93
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:22,120
It's updating it's weights,
it's learning about the future.

94
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:27,220
And an AI is a set of algorithms that
guests at reality, the Yang part,

95
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,420
our blockchains, blockchains are not
probabilistic. They are deterministic.

96
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:34,630
You know exactly what's going to
happen, right? They are permanent,

97
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,890
they are unchangeable and they are
algorithms and cryptography to record

98
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,753
reality.

99
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,440
So these two things can go really well
together if you break them down into what

100
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,700
they're really good at.

101
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,380
So we live in a world where we are
all using these services, right?

102
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,950
And these services collect and monetize
our data. That's the business model.

103
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,150
But this is a problem because our data
is the most valuable thing we have and it

104
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,060
will become more valuable as
everything is slowly automated.

105
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,030
Your data will be the
only agency that you have.

106
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,300
It will be your most valuable asset,
so you need to own it.

107
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,570
But right now we're giving it away
for free in return for a free service.

108
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,680
Ideally, these services would be
paying us for our data, right?

109
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,240
But that's just not the case right now.

110
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,270
We need to Redo all of these apps that
we have in web 2.0 everything from Ebay

111
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,050
to Uber, to Lyft, all of it.
Facebook, right? Morally speaking,

112
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:30,560
this is a terrible idea til let
some humans control our data.

113
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,700
In the case of Facebook,

114
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,850
they modified the newsfeed to affect
large swaths of the populace and the 2016

115
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:40,460
political elections, for example, in the
u s it's just, it's just very corrupt.

116
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:44,060
It's just not a good system and not
even talking about it. Morally speaking,

117
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,020
let's talk about it. Technically speaking,
centralized systems are not good.

118
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,420
Take the case of a self
driving car network.

119
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,080
Let's say we've got three self
driving cars at an intersection. Okay.

120
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:58,070
Three of them at an intersection and
there to kind of decide who has the right

121
00:06:58,071 --> 00:06:58,904
of way.

122
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,750
But if there was one central server that
they all had to talk to a million miles

123
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:06,290
or kilometers away, then it would
take forever. And there would be,

124
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,580
there would probably be an accident.

125
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:12,610
Ideally these cars could talk to each
other without needing a third party or a

126
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:14,240
central service or a server.

127
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,410
So both technically speaking
and morally speaking,

128
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:23,060
creating what are called decentralized
applications is a really good idea.

129
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,890
And it's what we call as developers web
3.0 and that's what's happening now.

130
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,820
If you're looking for something to
disrupt, you take blockchain, you take AI,

131
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:32,840
you combine it together,

132
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,200
and you create apps that have
never before been possible.

133
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,150
And that's the most exciting thing these
days. So this leads us to this idea.

134
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,710
It's a very abstract idea,

135
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:47,000
but it's starting to happen of what
are called decentralized autonomous

136
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:49,250
organizations or dowels for short.

137
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:51,950
You can also call them
dapps decentralized apps,

138
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,240
but the idea is that these are apps that
are run and maintained by the community

139
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:59,060
that uses them, right? So
think of Uber for example.

140
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,720
When I am a writer and I'm trying to find
a driver, I have to use a third party,

141
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,120
namely Uber to find that driver.

142
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,540
And so Uber takes a cut of this and
they have a bunch of malpractice as well

143
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,370
that we all know of through
all of their scandals.

144
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,700
But ideally I wouldn't have to trust Uber.
I could just find my driver.

145
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,450
He would get paid more. I would have to
pay less because there's no third party.

146
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,550
So it'd be better for both of us,
right?

147
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,760
We would all earn some equity because
we are all a part of the network.

148
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,870
It's not just about earning money.

149
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:28,871
We'd also earn equity and we would be
able to decide on the features of the APP.

150
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:32,240
So it would be a more democratic
process, right? It's, it's,

151
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:35,360
it's kind of like a community
owned grocery store, for example.

152
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:37,520
Instead of one century
central person owning it,

153
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,760
everybody who is a part of the network
would also be a participant in the

154
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,440
infrastructure of that network as well.

155
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,920
So there's a lot of good
that can come from this.

156
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:51,770
There's a lot of good that can come
from this and that's what we're going to

157
00:08:51,771 --> 00:08:56,520
start to see as we move towards web 3.0
if you're looking for a really hot idea,

158
00:08:56,521 --> 00:09:01,500
something really cool to do this is it.
Blockchain AI combined them together,

159
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,550
use this immutable ledger and
have an AI live on the blockchain,

160
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,430
or at least speak to the blockchain
and data is being pointed to.

161
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,390
There's some distributed hash table or
some kind of centralized storage stores.

162
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,910
And then there's a whole,
there's a whole token model.

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,280
We've only got two and a half minutes,
so I can't explain everything here,

164
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,590
but there's, there's so much,
there's so much. That's it.

165
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:24,360
That's what I'm trying to say. But
it's not all good. There's also bad.

166
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,260
I can't talk about the good
without talking about the
bad. Right. So imagine this,

167
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,670
what you're seeing here is a picture of
art that was completely generated by AI.

168
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,930
There is no human in the loop.

169
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,760
So imagine an AI that lives
on a blockchain and its job
is to just generate art.

170
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,970
So what it does, it does
this, it generates some art,

171
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,970
it then sells it on some marketplace.
It earns some money.

172
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,910
It uses that money to feed
itself more computing power.

173
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,270
It used that computing power to
then to then generate more art.

174
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,980
It just keeps amassing wealth and no one
can shut it down because it lives on a

175
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:57,870
blockchain, right? No
one can shut it down.

176
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,290
You'd have to have more computing power
than the 500 fastest supercomputers in

177
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,520
the world combined to shut it down.

178
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,110
Eventually it becomes the wealthiest
entity on the planet, right?

179
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:10,680
So that's kind of scary if you think about
it. It's an [inaudible], killable AI,

180
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,640
and it lives on a blockchain.
So how do we stop this?

181
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,490
It's our responsibility as developers,
as people,

182
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,330
people who don't even program to educate
ourselves on how this intelligence

183
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:26,310
works and only then will be, will be be
able to stop any kind of malpractice,

184
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:28,110
any kind of bad scenario,
right.

185
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:30,840
The will of the collective will
override any one bad actor.

186
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,990
So we have to educate ourselves,
be more aware. One resource for,

187
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:35,070
this is my youtube channel,

188
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,310
but the Internet is your university
so it's your responsibility to use it.

189
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:41,850
I stopped you. I'm going to end this
talk with a rap about decentralize AI.

190
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,490
So I want everybody to stand up
cause I know you guys are sleeping.

191
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:48,090
I know there's been some sleepy speakers
so please stand up everybody. All right,

192
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,900
everybody stand up. It's a, it's a wrap.
It's called smarter. It's a play on words.

193
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,360
It's,
it's a parody of Kanya west stronger.

194
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:58,230
So I want you to put your hands up in
the air as well. So, but let's just go,

195
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,453
let's go.

196
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,830
I got to read papers to
try and make me smarter.

197
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,330
I train my models in the cloud now
cause mile laptop takes longer.

198
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,620
I'll parse through day to like a boss.
Now, back then my code was wrong.

199
00:11:17,621 --> 00:11:22,540
Wronger subscribe if you want to learn.
Now let's spread this AI power.

200
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,160
Let's pray to right now.

201
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,240
Let's train it right.

202
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:36,241
Let's make bucks tonight and make music
like Mozart tonight and pain our work on

203
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:39,520
a cross tonight. I've waited
for this software hall, my life.

204
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,410
Just give it some data and
watch it explore step back,
clap and keep an encore.

205
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,690
He trained on 40 cores. It's race or
make GP use anymore. I came bought,

206
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:53,320
started off aimless,
but now it's like God in the Matrix.

207
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:57,850
My Chat Bot speaks once I train it.
How it works with damn hard to make this.

208
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,380
It'll generate words that it predicts
and ally said, submit and tested.

209
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,470
This death is the shit to invest in new
data. Where's her trained it then tested.

210
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,913
Come in.

211
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:13,450
I got to read papers to
try and make me smarter.

212
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,040
How train mom models in the cloud now,
because my laptop takes longer.

213
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,590
I parse through data like a
bus. Now back then, Marcos,

214
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:26,110
what's wronger subscribe if you want
to learn now, let's spread this.

215
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,920
All right, everybody, thanks so much.

216
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,260
Please subscribe for more programming
videos and for now I've got to go assign

217
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,280
some credit,
so thanks for watching.
