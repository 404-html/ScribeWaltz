00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,530
This model has been training for 24
hours and no luck. I've got an idea.

2
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,890
What do they call it back up again.

3
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,460
That's what every single section
dump these new papers say Gpu,

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,350
go turn it up and sell a little break.

5
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,190
Trying to minimize that loss to
let's say yo case or to bag it.

6
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:32,780
Put in active date. Do we want to do
it twice? He put out every was done.

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,780
I don't need a label.
I'll just want to do it without one.

8
00:00:35,781 --> 00:00:38,510
As long as I'm breathing,
I'll predict the outcome.

9
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,580
Try solve it or I'll just try to solve it.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,510
Tries to solve it or oh gosh,
right.

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,350
Oh by WHO's the Satoshi? Shout out
to the movement. Best notice BTC.

12
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,630
I was rocking blockchains back in
2014 before Cuban thought chips,

13
00:00:58,631 --> 00:01:03,020
men currency NTX out. Take
a block. I need up fork.

14
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,190
The chain come at once,

15
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:07,090
coming to twice started spraying
and it'll build a religion to get,

16
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,850
I did it at five and this is my life.
I call it the school of Ai.

17
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,940
Go solve it or I'll die trying solve it
or to try and solve it or I'll try to

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,580
solve it or I'll
try it.

19
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,500
Just try it,
try it,

20
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,150
solve it. Or I've done
tried, Jimmy's got a nuke.

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,990
Oh My f being g from California
to Japan on that. Foresee.

22
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,350
Will anybody stop it? How about you
or me? Cause I'm a fight to the end.

23
00:01:42,351 --> 00:01:46,100
Like a true, Oh gee, Yo
Matrix. Drop it. Error,

24
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,290
swap it. Delta hopping paper,
dropped it. Crypto, pop it,

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,040
I'll go solve it.
Try It,

26
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,093
try it,

27
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,860
salt it or I'll die trying solve it or
I'll die trying solve it or I'll die

28
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,970
trying out to all the wizards out there.

29
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,240
2018 this is our movement.
