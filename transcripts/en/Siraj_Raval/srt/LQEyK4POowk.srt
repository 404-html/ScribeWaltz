1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,790
No, I don't need help.
What's going on? Hello world,

2
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:10,680
it's Saroj and one of the most popular
services for cloud computing is

3
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:13,230
Microsoft's Azure.
It's got everything.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,090
A business needs to run all parts
of its computing operations,

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,710
virtually meaning servers,
storage, analytics, Api Apis,

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,573
all that stuff.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,170
I'll use it to predict the price of a car
using it's drag and drop interface and

8
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:28,951
if you're new here,

9
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:33,951
hit the subscribe button to keep up
with my AI content in this age of cloud

10
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:38,010
computing, it's crazy to think
that just over a decade ago,

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,580
if we wanted to serve a
website to people on the web,

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,760
we had to build and manage the physical
hardware needed for computing like

13
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:50,010
servers,
red bull and Ethernet switches.

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,080
Now it's all about renting the
hardware resources as we need it.

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,590
This pay as you go model has been
wildly successful with most major cloud

16
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:05,880
providers now offering it. If we look
at the marketplace for cloud computing,

17
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,910
it's clear that a zero is only
surpassed by AWS in quarterly revenue.

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,120
Another incredible statistic is that 85%
of fortune 500 companies from a Yoda to

19
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,330
NBC universal use Azure.

20
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,200
Clearly Microsoft dominates
in the enterprise market.

21
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:29,940
Most of their servers are running
windows anyway and Azure makes that

22
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:31,970
integration very simple.
Uh,

23
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:36,540
zero has its own version
of all the standard cloud
services available under the

24
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:40,170
categories of compute, storage, databases,

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,490
networking Api Apis, each with
a unique name, even blockchain.

26
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:49,380
What I've attached a sheet that maps out
every service name to its competitors

27
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:52,920
to help familiarize yourself
with what each tool does.

28
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,810
It'll be in the video description, but
what makes a zero unique? It's blue.

29
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:58,261
Well,

30
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:03,261
for starters it's dedication to the
hybrid cloud is definitely worth noting.

31
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,930
A private cloud is a set of computing
services that are offered either over the

32
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:14,121
internet or a private internal network
and only to select users instead of the

33
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:19,590
general public. This can also be
called an internal or corporate cloud.

34
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,980
This gives businesses the benefits of
a public cloud like elasticity and self

35
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:30,471
service with the additional customization
and control available from a dedicated

36
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:34,500
computing infrastructure
hosted on premises.

37
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,150
And don't forget the leveled up security
that a company can implement through

38
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:44,151
both company firewalls and
internal hosting to ensure
that sensitive data is not

39
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,280
accessible to third party providers.

40
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,430
The con here is that private clouds
require the same staffing management and

41
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:56,880
maintenance expenses as
traditional data center ownership.

42
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,970
A hybrid cloud allows a business to take
advantage of cloud bursting to free up

43
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:07,390
more space and scale computing
services to the public cloud.

44
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,790
When computing demands increase,

45
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,090
hybrid clouds are easier with a zero
because Microsoft for saw the need for

46
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:17,680
hybrid clouds early on,

47
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,010
we can use onsite servers
to run our applications on
the Azure stack and set our

48
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:28,501
computing resources to tap into
cloud based resources when necessary.

49
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,750
Several a zero offerings like the hybrid
CQL server and a zero store simple help

50
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:37,780
with this. Microsoft's a long
history of working on enterprise.

51
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:40,060
It gives them this edge,

52
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,230
but let's talk about its machine learning
offerings since that's what we care

53
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:45,100
about the most.

54
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,300
A [inaudible] machine learning
offering has five components,

55
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,460
a workbench and experimentation service,
a model management service,

56
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,530
a set of libraries and visual
studio tools for AI. Together.

57
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,180
A developer can use these tools to train
and deploy machine learning models in

58
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:08,830
the cloud on premise or at the edge.
It fully supports open sores,

59
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:12,490
python libraries so we can use tensorflow,
psychic learn,

60
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:17,491
Pi Torch and others to build our models
and experiments can be executed in a

61
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:22,900
managed environment like
a docker container or a
spark cluster with plenty of

62
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:26,740
gps to help accelerate execution.
It's custom.

63
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,760
M M L spark framework provides integration
with Apache spark and their cognitive

64
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,720
toolkit as well as open CV.

65
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,960
This lets developers quickly
create scalable predictive
models for large images

66
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,340
and text datasets.

67
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,200
They've got some extensive documentation
about this in their get hub repository,

68
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,410
which is pretty lit.
Spark by the way,

69
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:55,411
is a unified analytics engine for machine
learning developed at UC Berkeley a

70
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,320
decade ago.

71
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Big companies have rapidly adopted
and deployed spark at massive scale

72
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,690
collectively processing
petabytes of data on clusters,

73
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:09,691
over 8,000 nodes and in the process
helped make it one of the largest open

74
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:12,280
source communities on the web.

75
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,610
It's a framework for
efficiently processing large
amounts of data in parallel.

76
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,840
It's built in libraries for ml are well
made and it turns out to be much easier

77
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:26,770
to work with than traditional
MapReduce and with project brainwave,

78
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:30,310
you can deploy your model to be
trained on not just a CPU or GPU,

79
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,790
but if field programmable
gate array or FPGA,

80
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,630
this is a customized circuit that's
highly efficient and flexible.

81
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,900
A trained neural network can be run as
quickly as possible on an FPGA and can

82
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:47,380
you me paralyzed across multiple ones?
The scale of service,

83
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,480
it makes it possible to
achieve low latency for real
time inferencing requests.

84
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,800
Microsoft made the world's largest
cloud investment into these FPG A's and

85
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,730
although right now it's limited
to just tensorflow deployment,

86
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,800
you can try out image classification and
recognition models with it immediately.

87
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,860
The ML workbench is a desktop application
with command line tool support on

88
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:14,120
windows and Mac.

89
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,930
The entire ml pipeline is
supported including data,

90
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:22,100
preprocessing model development
and model deployment.

91
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,060
Using the built in Jupiter Notebook
and native get integration.

92
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,590
It makes it easy to get started
when it comes to execution.

93
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,420
The experimentation service supports
the workbench by providing you with the

94
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:40,421
ability to execute experiments across
a range of compute environment options,

95
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,230
local native, local docker
container, remote docker container,

96
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,490
a spark cluster.

97
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,200
This is where that focus on
hybrid computing Microsoft
has I mentioned earlier

98
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,220
comes into play,

99
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,930
but keep in mind that models need
to be updated over time on new data.

100
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,970
They need to be retrained and sometimes
different versions need to be served.

101
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,250
Two different segments of an audience.

102
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,320
The model management service allows
us to use simple cli commands to

103
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:14,321
containerize our model and deploy it to
all types of computing environments and

104
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:17,180
if you do use visual studio,

105
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,300
the tools for AI extension lets you
see a history of past training runs a

106
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:27,701
gallery of projects and an explorer view
for selecting compute targets for your

107
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:29,330
script to execute.

108
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,550
But the unique feature about Azure I
find most interesting is the machine

109
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,190
learning studio.
It's a browser based,

110
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,750
visual drag and drop environment
where code isn't even necessary.

111
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,320
It takes you from idea to
deployment in a few clicks.

112
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,910
Let's try out a demo and try to predict
the price of a car in the future.

113
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,920
Using a Dataset of car prices,

114
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,460
our first step will be to
retrieve the relevant Dataset.

115
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,640
We can use one of the sample datasets
included with the studio or import data

116
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:04,370
from our local machine
drag and drop interface.

117
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,460
Since our data set is
included in the workspace,

118
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,540
we can create a new experiment,
then name it something meaningful.

119
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,730
On the left of the experiment canvas
is a pallet of datasets and modules.

120
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,930
Once we type automobile in the search box,
we'll see our dataset.

121
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,020
We can drag it into
the experiments canvas.

122
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,120
Once there we can visualize
it by selecting the visualize
button on the output.

123
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:34,121
Port datasets and modules have input
and output ports represented by small

124
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:37,460
circles and put at the
top output at the bottom.

125
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,560
As we create a data flow,

126
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:44,240
we'll connect an output port of one
module to an input port of another.

127
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,280
In our sample Dataset,

128
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,340
each sentence of an automobile appears
as a row and the variables associated

129
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:56,010
with each appear as columns.
The price in the far right column.

130
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,580
That's our target variable
to predict given the rest.

131
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,410
Let's close out of the visualization and
prepare our data for machine learning.

132
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,540
There are some missing values present
in the columns of different rows and the

133
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:13,890
normalized losses column has a
large proportion of missing values,

134
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:17,400
so we'll exclude that column
from the model as well.

135
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,700
We'll find these select
columns in Dataset module.

136
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,200
Then drag gets into the experiments
canvas. Once we connect our ports,

137
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:28,530
we can find the column in
question and remove it swiftly.

138
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,950
Now we can drag the clean missing data
module to the canvas connected to our

139
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:38,640
select columns module.
Using the remove entire row mode,

140
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,420
we can automate removing rows
that have any missing values.

141
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,920
When that's done running,

142
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:48,180
we can define what some good
features from our data set would be.

143
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,440
For machine learning.

144
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,750
We can select features for prediction
inside of the select columns in datasets

145
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,110
module.
Now we can set some custom rules,

146
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:02,910
specifically the features we want to
include that we think are relevant to the

147
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:06,900
target price of variable when selecting
features for machine learning.

148
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,930
Usually those that we personally would
use to differentiate something are the

149
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:16,260
ones that tend to be the best features.
Once we've selected that,

150
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,700
we can choose a machine learning algorithm
to apply because we want to predict a

151
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:25,350
price which is a number, not a category.
We can consider this a regression,

152
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:27,210
not a classification problem.

153
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,050
We can first split our data into
training and testing datasets.

154
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,840
Then initialize a linear
regression module,

155
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,690
which we can find under
the regression category.

156
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,740
This will create the line of
best fit across our dataset.

157
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,730
Once we click a train model set
our target variable and features,

158
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,210
we can run the experiment.
Once our model is trained,

159
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,880
we can use it to predict new car prices.

160
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,560
We can connect the score model module
to both the train model and split data

161
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:56,394
modules,

162
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,570
run the experiment and view the
output from the score model module.

163
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,810
It shows the predicted values for price
and the known values from the test data.

164
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,021
From there,

165
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:11,340
we can iterate to try and improve the
model using different ml algorithms and

166
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:15,090
deploy it as a predictive web service.
Overall,

167
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,120
[inaudible] is definitely a useful cloud
solution for enterprises and the ML

168
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:21,871
studio.

169
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:26,460
Drag and drop interface is a unique
offering that lets entry level developers

170
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,470
intuitively and easily build ml models.
Welcome to the beginning.

171
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,370
I mean the end. Hit subscribe and
I'll love you forever. For now,

172
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:38,790
how can I try to interview Satya Nadella?
So thanks for watching.
