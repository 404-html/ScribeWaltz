00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,030
Hello world it's or Raj and school of
Ai is a nonprofit organization I've

2
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:08,130
created for our community.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,400
I am now looking for wizards to help
host regular in-person learning meetups

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,540
across the world. Link to sign up is
going to be in the video description.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,900
We have a very simple mission and that's
to offer a worldclass AI education to

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,240
anyone on earth for free.

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,570
Our doors are open to all
those who wish to learn.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,840
We are a learning community that spans
almost every country dedicated to

9
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:41,211
teaching our students how to make a
positive impact in the world using AI

10
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:46,380
technology, whether that's through
employment or entrepreneurship.

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,450
There are seven values that
we share in common. First,

12
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,280
we embrace the weird,

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,550
whether it's experiencing a new learning
style concept or idea that's completely

14
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:01,620
different than what we're used to.

15
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,010
We embrace it because we believe that
radically new approaches often result in

16
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:11,160
radical improvement.
Second,

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,260
we inspire and educate whatever
content we make, be it a blog, post,

18
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,840
video, live, talk or tweet.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,580
We aim for it to both inspire
and educate developers. Third,

20
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,920
we have Beta driven optimism.

21
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,190
So much of modern day journalism focuses
on all the things wrong with the world.

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,680
But if we look at the data,

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,740
the quality of human life across a wide
range of metrics has radically improved

24
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,250
over the past 100 years.
Fourth,

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,460
we perform rapid experimentation
and idea alone is worth nothing.

26
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,280
It's the execution of it that matters.

27
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,120
And the best way to do that is to build,
assess,

28
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,230
and reiterate until we have a
valid solution to a problem.

29
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,830
Fifth,
we practice the art of frugality.

30
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,130
We know that a determined mind with
scarce resources can achieve seemingly

31
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:14,220
impossible things.
It's not necessary to make a lavish,

32
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,840
expensive purchases to live a
life of meaning and happiness.

33
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,200
Sixth, we choose love, not fear.

34
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,820
So much negativity in our lives
is caused by our own fear.

35
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,860
Dishonesty with ourselves and
with others on inability to learn,

36
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,850
missing out on great opportunities
when making decisions,

37
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,260
we make them out of love for
ourselves and for other humans.

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,730
And lastly, I'm inheriting this
one from my last workplace.

39
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,460
Twillio we draw the owl.

40
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,780
There's this meme that drawing an hour.
It takes a lot of instructions,

41
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,860
but we don't always have those
instructions available to us,

42
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:01,010
so we have to make them ourselves from
step draw a circle to the last step.

43
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,900
Draw the owl.
We figured the steps out as we need to.

44
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,650
I have a lot planned for
us in the coming months,

45
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:13,651
but a good first step to get the community
connected is to start school of Ai

46
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,240
meetups across the globe.

47
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,770
I'm looking for deans to help
me with this. Traditionally,

48
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,800
a dean is the head of a
department at a university.

49
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,280
Our deans will be the heads of their
cities school of Ai Chapter from Boston to

50
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,660
Berlin to Bombay.

51
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,020
They're responsible for hosting school
of Ai meetups in their respective city.

52
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,490
That means finding a suitable venue,

53
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,560
helping me promote the event locally
and helping other students in their

54
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:45,400
learning journey.

55
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,880
These meetups will also be an opportunity
for students to teach and share what

56
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:52,720
they've learned.

57
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:58,050
I will have a personal
line of communication with
all deans for support and

58
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,550
updates. Each meetup will consist
of either an educational lecture,

59
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,130
a hands on coding workshop,

60
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,580
or an AI research paper study session.

61
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,020
It's up to the dean to decide
what type of meetup it will be.

62
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,870
If you're selected to be a dean,

63
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,030
I'll provide you with a meetup page to
use and some resources to help you get

64
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:26,380
started hosting your first
school of Ai meetup. Get hype.

65
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,950
Please subscribe for more
programming videos. And for now,

66
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,650
I've got a school to build,
so thanks for watching.
