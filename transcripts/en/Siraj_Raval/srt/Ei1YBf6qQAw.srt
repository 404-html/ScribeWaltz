00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,180
Deep blue,
the IBM computer beat Garry Kasparov,

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,370
I'm getting weirdly has resigned is a
whole new team of humans going up against

3
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:11,490
opening I five is defining vision for AI.

4
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:16,491
Research has always been to eventually
create an algorithm that can solve any

5
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:21,690
problem. It's Cs and given the
recent rapid advances in Ai,

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,340
we are getting closer.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,820
Reinforcement learning is a subfield of
machine learning in which the goal is to

8
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:34,221
learn how to act in an environment
to maximize our reward signal.

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,720
There have been lots of different
algorithms proposed to help this goal,

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,960
many of which involve learning a
way to represent all or part of the

11
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:45,990
environment,

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,380
but learning a general representation
of diverse data was shown to be a hard

13
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:56,820
problem and the promises of reinforcement
learning in large part were left

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,750
unfulfilled.

15
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:03,110
But in recent years hope emerged when
deep learning proved to be able to learn a

16
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:08,070
robust representation of whatever
type of data it was given.

17
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,490
The combination of these two approaches
called deep reinforcement learning is

18
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:17,400
what's behind the latest advances in Ai.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Deep RL is now making its way
into industrial applications
created by companies

20
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:26,490
both big and small pit dot.

21
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:31,491
Ai is now using it to outperform
traditional hedge funds by applying it to

22
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,120
algorithmic trading.

23
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,480
The Vu is using it to address the
challenges of managing complex enterprise

24
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:39,960
supply chains.

25
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,320
Uber has applied it at massive scale to
be able to more efficiently match riders

26
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:50,760
and drivers together and Oh sorrows
using it to create some of the smartest

27
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,830
factory robots ever made.

28
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,390
Helloworld it Saroj and
join me as I teach it.

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,640
This free 10 week
reinforcement learning course.

30
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,820
I've called move 37 I'll take you on a
journey through the basics up to modern

31
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:07,020
day techniques.

32
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,290
Every week we'll build apps together
that will cover both toy and industry

33
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:13,284
problems.

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,280
You'll be able to measure your progress
along the way by chatting with your

35
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:17,641
peers,

36
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:22,641
both online and offline at
school of AI chapters globally,

37
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,210
taking quizzes, coding challenges,
and two graded projects.

38
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,340
I'll have weekly coding live streams
to help answer any questions and my

39
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:36,960
assistant instructors will be available
to help in our community slack channel.
