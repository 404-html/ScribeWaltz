1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,220
Ai In 2041 big cybernetic luck.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,330
Hello world.
It's Saroj.

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:10,770
And what does Ai Look like in 2040 it's
really hard to make predictions about

4
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:12,360
the field five years from now,

5
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:16,980
let alone 20 years from now because
there are so many unknown variables.

6
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:21,030
But amidst all the current fear
around automation, technology,

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,920
taking away jobs from humans,

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,990
manipulating our attention via social
networks and someday even destroying us.

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,540
Yo Ilan,
please make rockets not fear.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,350
I thought it would be important for
me to give an optimistic vision of the

11
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:39,210
future of AI backed by my knowledge
of various current research efforts.

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,800
The predictions I'll make in this
episode are split into three parts. Ai,

13
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:47,910
hardware, AI, software, and
Ai's effects on society.

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,830
So let's start with AI hardware.

15
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:54,450
Pretty much every conventional computer
and smart device available today is

16
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:57,870
based on some variation of what's
called a von Neumann architecture,

17
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,880
which was first proposed in 1945 by the
original gangsters slash mathematician

18
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:03,803
John von Neumann.

19
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,640
It divides the hardware of a computer
into three main components, memory,

20
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:12,750
a central processing unit or
CPU and input output devices.

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,890
So the input could be say a mouse or
keyboard while the output could be a

22
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:21,600
monitor. The CPU is in charge of fetching
instructions and data from memory,

23
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,730
executing those instructions. Then storing
the resulting values back in memory.

24
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,180
And the great thing about the
CPU is that it's flexible.

25
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,860
We can use it for any kind of software
from word processing to automatically

26
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,100
blocking all videos of
metallic rapid make it stop.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,900
But despite its flexibility,

28
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:44,610
CPS execute operations sequentially and
have to access memory every time they

29
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:46,740
do,
which limits data throughput.

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,180
And this is called the von Neumann
bottleneck to gain higher data throughput.

31
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:55,050
And many computers use a
graphics processing unit or GPU.

32
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:00,240
Modern Gpu usually have thousands of
arithmetic logic unit in a processor,

33
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,420
which means they can execute thousands
of operations in parallel AI algorithms

34
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:09,780
like neural networks demand massive
parallelism to execute millions of

35
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:14,400
operations. So the GPU has been the
primary driver of their recent successes.

36
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,720
There's also the recently introduced
TPU use that Google designed that aren't

37
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:22,470
general purpose there. Instead
designed to do one task really well,

38
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,650
parallel matrix operations.
And because of that,

39
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:29,730
they're able to reduce the von
Neumann bottleneck even more than gps.

40
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,750
Notice the trend here. Of course you do.
Eugenia, you're so smart. I love you.

41
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,960
We are building computers
that are increasingly parallel
and require less energy

42
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,800
and they're currently exists.

43
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,010
Another processor that uses much
less energy and has a throughput,

44
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,590
no TPU can match and it exists in
our heads. It's the human brain.

45
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,580
The field of neuromorphic computing
currently being researched by several tech

46
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:58,500
companies like Intel aims to emulate
this natural processing architecture of

47
00:02:58,501 --> 00:02:59,334
ours.

48
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,760
Neuromorphic chips are inspired by
biological neural networks where logic and

49
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:07,060
memory are closely integrated
in the same basic device,

50
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,040
the neurons and their connections.

51
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,870
The problem with current
system architectures is
that data and processing are

52
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:18,871
physically separated and
continuous signals are
represented using binary states.

53
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,990
How are we supposed to make sex
robots if that's the case? Jeez.

54
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,440
The solution is to use
components called memory stirs,

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,090
which like normal resistors regulate
the flow of electricity that can

56
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:35,890
additionally remember a particular charge
allowing them to act like synapses in

57
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:36,724
the brain.

58
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,470
They can process and store multiple or
even continuous signal states orders of

59
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,010
magnitudes faster and with much
less power than current systems.

60
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,420
There are various different ideas on what
to use as a memory stir from graphing

61
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:51,850
nanostructures to opto electronics,

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
but eventually prediction time or you
single celled organisms as living memory

63
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,960
stirs.
A few years ago,

64
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:02,830
a team of bio engineers from Stanford
announced that they created a fully

65
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:05,350
functional computer from living material.

66
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,330
They used protein to store bits and
molecular motors called Maslan to move

67
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:14,080
protein filaments along artificial
paths to eventually solve a simple

68
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:16,870
mathematical problem.
Based on the optimal path,

69
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,300
our computers will eventually be made up
a fully organic living material that's

70
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,310
been engineered to replicate
our biological neural
network will use DNA to store

71
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:26,831
data.

72
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:31,540
A single gram of DNA is capable
of storing 215 petabytes of data,

73
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,950
which could store every bit of data ever
recorded by humans in a container the

74
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:40,540
size and weight of one room and scientists
have already started storing digital

75
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:45,541
data in Dna since 2012 sic a fortune
500 company is already developing neural

76
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:51,250
networks from living nerve cell tissue.
The future of computing is biological.

77
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,090
We'll eventually build a fully
integrated living biological computer,

78
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,920
which functions independently of its
creators and replicates on its own like I

79
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,783
prop eight

80
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,660
and the primary way we'll
use this technology is by
incorporating it into a mind

81
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:08,260
body machine interface.

82
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,820
Very similar to the noninvasive device I
designed in a previous video called the

83
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:17,500
link, the Mbmi. We'll replace all of
our other devices including smartphones.

84
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,490
It will be able to read and write to
the brain which will allow us to know

85
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:25,420
everything, be everywhere and do
practically anything we'd like.

86
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,220
But before I shock you by explaining
the mechanism it will use to communicate

87
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:31,060
with the Internet,

88
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,590
I need to give you a short primer
on quantum mechanics for context.

89
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,870
Last year,
D-Wave,

90
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,170
the quantum computing company invited me
to their facility to see their quantum

91
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:42,790
computer and meet their team.

92
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,740
The discussions I had with those quantum
scientists inspired me to learn a lot

93
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,230
more about quantum mechanics of field.

94
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:54,400
I didn't pay too much attention to
before and the more I learn about quantum

95
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:55,001
mechanics,

96
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:59,510
the more skeptical I am about our
current understanding of the nature of

97
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:01,280
reality.
There is no spoon.

98
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,260
Currently we have two
major theories of physics,

99
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,670
quantum mechanics and general relativity
at the smallest scales of reality.

100
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:14,450
Quantum mechanics helps explain
a lot and at the largest scales,

101
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,610
general relativity explains a lot,

102
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,290
but we don't have a theory of everything
and equation or set of equations that

103
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:24,440
would connect quantum mechanics
to general relativity.

104
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,180
It could in fact be the case that all
living things are connected through

105
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,380
quantum entanglement.

106
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,510
That consciousness not
matter is fundamental to the
universe and that the brain

107
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:39,800
performs at some form of quantum
computation. Nobody knows.

108
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,760
As such.

109
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,710
In 2040 we'll leverage some mechanism
of quantum mechanics that we haven't yet

110
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,690
fully understood like quantum entanglement
to connect with other people and the

111
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:54,860
Internet of things.
And this will form a new quantum internet.

112
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,660
Wild quantum entanglement hasn't yet
proven to allow for faster than light data

113
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:00,494
transfer.

114
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,210
I predict that our understanding of the
nature of reality will gradually evolve

115
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,950
and we'll find a way that means
zero latency communication
with other humans via

116
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:11,120
quantum entanglement.

117
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,010
Forget about Bluetooth and Wifi and in
a similar vein to how Tesla envision a

118
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:20,570
world where electricity was transmitted
via wireless towers all around the earth

119
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,830
will transmit energy wirelessly
through quantum energy teleportation.

120
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,040
A concept a Japanese physicist
demonstrated a few years ago now onto AI

121
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:30,950
software.

122
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,120
It's currently 2019 and the deep learning
revolution has made a massive impact

123
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,300
on the field. There are three
core properties to deep learning.

124
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,510
Then make it so powerful.
The first is generality.

125
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:45,860
We have a small number of deep learning
tools and they solve a huge array of

126
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:48,650
problems.
The second piece is competence.

127
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,260
If you want to solve some
image related problem,

128
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,150
just throw out 30 years of computer
vision research and replace it with a deep

129
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,450
neural network.
And the third piece is scalability.

130
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,630
If you have a neural network and
feed it more data and compute,

131
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,460
it will get better and better.

132
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,290
These three properties feel like
essential parts of building a general

133
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,124
intelligence.

134
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,270
There are clearly missing pieces though
we need an answer for causal reasoning,

135
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,530
but for the first time we have a
paradigm that gives us hope that general

136
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,450
intelligence can be achievable.

137
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,720
So the question is how
will we improve on it?

138
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,980
Sprinkled quantum audits in a new nature
paper titled supervised learning with

139
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:32,870
Quantum enhanced features spaces the
authors describe developing a quantum

140
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:35,420
algorithm that could
perform feature mapping,

141
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,130
a key component in machine learning on
high dimensional data at a scale far

142
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:43,730
beyond the reach of even the most
powerful classical computers,

143
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,410
quantum computing techniques and more
powerful processors hold the key to

144
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:53,270
enabling machines to have causal reasoning
and we'll add these capabilities to

145
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:56,070
future organic neuromorphic computers,

146
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,440
future neural optimization strategies.

147
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:03,360
We'll leverage quantum mechanics and
organic material to solve problems and

148
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:08,010
evolutionary computing techniques will
finally start to work well also will

149
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:09,330
program with our mind.

150
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,110
We won't have to write code anymore
and thankfully that includes PHP.

151
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,790
We'll use these optimization algorithms
to create more software like incredibly

152
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:22,740
sophisticated encryption schemes and
different types of internet architectures.

153
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,450
The Internet will be like a grid, a
self organizing, intelligent network,

154
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,740
distributed ledger technology
currently enables a primitive form of

155
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,260
decentralized decision making right now.

156
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,400
It allows payments to be made across
the Internet without middlemen,

157
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,120
but in 20 years that
technology will have evolved.

158
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,760
Eventually all apps we know of like Uber,

159
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,820
airbnb and porn hub will be run at the
protocol level in a fully automated way

160
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,890
with AI at the center
and humans at the edges.

161
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,930
These will be autonomous self improving
services that interconnect and connect

162
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,260
to other services as per
their objective functions.

163
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,790
And the question as to where you host
your files or what service you use to book

164
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:10,020
a self driving car will be irrelevant.
You'll use the internet to do so.

165
00:10:10,021 --> 00:10:12,000
Names of service has become irrelevant.

166
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,470
The Internet will truly become
a collective consciousness
and each of us will

167
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:21,471
store a personal AI assistant locally in
our MBM eyes that will act in our best

168
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:26,220
interest. Helping us parse data and
communicate fake news won't be an issue.

169
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,750
We'll be smart enough through our MBM
eyes to be able to perform quantum proofs

170
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:33,390
of reality to detect what's real.

171
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,630
And what's fake now onto how
this will affect society.

172
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,350
Our Ai's will be conscious.
There'll be able to love, feel pain,

173
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:44,580
and experience the world in the same ways
that we do just without a natural body.

174
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,350
We will coexist in this world with these
engineered minds flowing into and out

175
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:53,250
of states of unified consciousness
with them falling in love with them,

176
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,420
having debates with them and
enjoying life together. Ultimately,

177
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,700
this world of super intelligent beings,

178
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:04,560
both human born and machine born will
result in a new renaissance for humanity.

179
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,750
Unlike anything we've ever seen before.

180
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,350
These digital beings will be
able to do anything we can do,

181
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,810
including creativity and discovery.

182
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,890
That means we'll automate away
almost every job that exists today,

183
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,140
not just truck drivers and retail workers,

184
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:23,190
which are currently being automated
away, but lawyers, doctors,

185
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,490
and even science vikings.
So what do we do? Well,

186
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:30,210
first we'll all receive a universal basic
income that comes from the Internet,

187
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,650
a machine generated dividend that rewards
us for the gains in efficiency from

188
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:36,090
automating manual labor.

189
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,810
This will remove the necessity
to work to live on top of that.

190
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,710
All sorts of meaningful jobs will
exist that never existed today.

191
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,250
Things we wouldn't even
think of as jobs like gaming,

192
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,780
matchmaking for Ais and humans
evangelizing newly engineered flavors,

193
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,910
tasting and writing, different
types of foods, traveling the world,

194
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,660
collecting data, learning
and volunteering, and
because we'll have MBM eyes,

195
00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:00,970
our ability to learn,

196
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:05,740
make discoveries and perform artistic
expressions will be just as scalable as

197
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:08,470
any AI and because of basic income,

198
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,350
self driving cars and full
immersion virtual reality,

199
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,940
we'll see a reverse migration of people
from cities to newly formed villages

200
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:17,830
that live in harmony with the land.

201
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,430
No one will have a nine to five job
they need to commute to anymore.

202
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,600
The world will become one big village
with people constantly traveling between

203
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:30,160
what we now consider countries since MBM
eyes will let us speak and understand

204
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:34,720
every language and in a world of abundance
where all of our basic needs are met

205
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:38,350
through basic income,
where technology makes us smarter,

206
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,340
more aware and better able to
communicate with other humans.

207
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,140
I believe that we'll all as a result
become kinder than ever before,

208
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,720
and I think that's a future
worth looking forward to.

209
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,330
And what do you think AI
will look like in 20 years?

210
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,690
Let me know in the comment section and
please subscribe for more technology

meditate, so thanks for watching.
