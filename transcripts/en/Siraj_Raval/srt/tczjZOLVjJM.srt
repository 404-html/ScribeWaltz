00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,560
Ready to go behind the scenes.
Hello world,

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,570
it's Saroj and let me show you how to
teach people artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,370
I'll go over three crucial concepts
in order, how to design a curriculum,

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,350
how to teach in real life, and how to
make an educational AI youtube video.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,910
If you're new, click subscribe to
keep up with my latest AI content.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,360
I've now been teaching people AI for
about two years full time on Youtube.

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,960
Every week I create as much
AI content as I possibly can.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,850
Read me placed feedback and improve
it to be even better the next week.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,760
Before you start writing curriculums,

10
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:45,210
you've got to start with the
most important first step.

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,310
Believe you can do this.

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,110
It's estimated that the human brain
has about 70,000 thoughts per day,

13
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,470
that 70 k opportunities to
program positive beliefs
about yourself or it could

14
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:02,910
be 70 k opportunities to reinforce
your same old self doubts.

15
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,420
If you believe you can't teach AI because
you don't have a degree or you're too

16
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:13,800
old or you're bad at math,
that will become your reality.

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,610
The mind responds to its
programming like a machine,

18
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,940
but the difference is that you have the
consciousness to choose what source code

19
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,140
you want to input.

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,650
Neither of my parents went to college,

21
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,920
they struggled financially
when I was growing up,

22
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,370
and I don't have any
graduate level degrees.

23
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,710
The reason I've been able to do
this is because I believed I could.

24
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,930
The Internet is your university. It's
your responsibility to use it. As such,

25
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,320
anyone can become an expert in this field
if they'd put in the time to study and

26
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:54,510
are motivated to push past the difficulty.

27
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,480
So onto designing an AI curriculum,

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,560
start by asking yourself four questions.
What's your topic?

29
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,970
Who are your students?

30
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,240
What do you want them to be able to do
and how will you measure their ability?

31
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,120
Teaching a curriculum
takes a lot of endurance,

32
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,150
so the best way to prevent burnout is
to pick a topic you're really passionate

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,073
about.

34
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,550
The topic you pick will also
depend on what stage you're in,

35
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:26,520
in your AI journey.
If you're just starting out,

36
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,550
it might be learning basic python for
machine learning or linear Algebra,

37
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:35,670
basics for machine learning.
If you're more advanced,

38
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,530
it could be modern day neural
architectures or reinforcement learning.

39
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,570
Spend some time alone to browse
the web and just brainstorm.

40
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,550
Find some cool AI demos. Read some
blog posts, watched some videos,

41
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:52,350
listen to some podcasts,

42
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,920
see what researchers are
talking about on Twitter.

43
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,220
Eventually you'll find a couple
of topics that excite you.

44
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,460
Pick the one that excites you the most
and don't worry if you don't understand

45
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,300
that topic completely.

46
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,960
Teaching is the best
way to learn anything.

47
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,110
Learn and teach as you go.
Now,

48
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,080
depending on the difficulty
level of your curriculum,

49
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,010
certain student populations
will be best suited for it.

50
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,520
Try to learn as much as you
can about your students.

51
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,810
Are they in university?
When was their last dental appointment?

52
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,590
What should you expect them to
know before the first lecture?

53
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,760
What problems do students
typically have with this material?

54
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,960
At this level,

55
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,670
there's very likely already
been curriculums created
that are somewhat similar

56
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:43,720
to your topic.

57
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,060
Find them on Google and see what kind
of prerequisites they ask of students.

58
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,910
What are students concerns and questions.

59
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,150
Usually forums and social media groups
are a treasure trove to learn about them.

60
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,320
The next question is what do you
want your students to be able to do?

61
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,590
It's supremely important to have goals
in mind when both studying and teaching

62
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:11,170
Ai.
This can be application specific,

63
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:16,171
like the ability to create a classifier
for health care or more broad like the

64
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:20,410
ability to read and understand
the math for deep learning.

65
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:25,420
It could also be the ability to take a
more advanced course or even get a job in

66
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:26,254
the field.

67
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,300
Try to answer these questions as
specifically as you can as it will give

68
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:34,090
structure to everything else.
Next,

69
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,180
how are you going to
measure students' abilities?

70
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,310
While some learning goals can be
achieved through listening to a lecture,

71
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,150
some might require active experimentation,

72
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,400
practice and discussion.

73
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,900
You might want to create quizzes
or group project assignments,

74
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,890
a midterm, a final, a
hackathon, a cage match.

75
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,930
There's a lot of possibilities.

76
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,150
I found several free learning management
system tools you can use to help you

77
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:05,620
create these easily.

78
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,420
There'll be in the video description
when it comes to designing the curriculum

79
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:11,254
itself.

80
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,500
You want to synthesize existing
curriculums and add in your own touch.

81
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,943
For example,

82
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,980
if we want to create a
curriculum on convolutional
neural networks will see that

83
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:27,160
both Coursera and Stanford
have courses on this topic.

84
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,170
They both have their merits.

85
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:34,171
The Coursera course seems more real world
application oriented while Stanford's

86
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,760
is more based on theory.

87
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,240
Coursera dives straight into CNN theory
while Stanford starts with feed forward

88
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,870
neural network theory then
moves on to comp nets.

89
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:51,210
Stanford also moves on to talk about newer
libraries like Pi Torch near the end.

90
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:52,900
While Coursera doesn't,

91
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,260
but neither of these courses mentioned
using convolutional networks on text

92
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,330
data,

93
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:04,330
which they've been shown to surprisingly
perform well on specifically regarding

94
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:09,440
sequence classification and while these
presenters are clearly credentialed,

95
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,390
their lectures are not as dense and
attention grabbing as they could be.

96
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,190
Just ask Carrie k.

97
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:21,190
H perhaps we could even add
our own section on ethics
applied to computer vision

98
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,800
or you have a more comprehensive history
of previous techniques in computer

99
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:27,470
vision.

100
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,210
It's important to develop some intuition
around the order of complexity of these

101
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,170
subtopics.

102
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,470
It looks like CNNs require
an understanding of several
topics including matrix

103
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:42,380
multiplication,
gradient based optimization,

104
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,220
and feed forward neural network theory,
different courses.

105
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,070
We'll tackle these
prerequisites in different ways.

106
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,050
Some will attempt to teach them all within
the course including programming and

107
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:56,930
some will require preexisting knowledge.

108
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:02,060
I've found it's the most fun to teach
all or almost all of the necessary

109
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:06,950
Prereq's within the confines of a
course and it's not over promising.

110
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:10,250
If you can actually deliver,
it will be more challenging,

111
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:13,130
but that's what makes this process so fun,
right?

112
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,660
There are tons of different ways
of ordering topics by complexity.

113
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,930
Maybe you want a deep learning library
first approach or a math first or an

114
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,110
application first approach,
whatever works for you.

115
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:32,470
I've also found hosting my curriculum on
get hub is a simple and easy way to get

116
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:34,430
developers on board.

117
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Plus get hub allows endless edits and
collaborations on things you might've

118
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,610
missed out on, which students
have definitely helped me with.

119
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,290
Curriculums longer than 12 weeks are
really hard for me to stick to as my

120
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,670
interest wanes near the very end
and I want to start working on other

121
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:57,410
curriculums that might be a good upper
threshold and have a diverse set of

122
00:07:57,411 --> 00:08:00,890
learning resources.
If you have too much broad content,

123
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,900
students may complain that it's not
detailed enough. If it's too deep,

124
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,640
students may complain that there's not
enough high level overview and real world

125
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:15,140
applicability. That's why having
both is the best path forward.

126
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,270
Now with your newly formed curriculum,
you're ready to start teaching AI.

127
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,970
If you're hosting a weekly meetup,

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,980
a university class of public school
class or an after school club,

129
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,450
you'll be teaching in person.
From what I've learned,

130
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,460
teaching at various venues in real life,
you need to be very engaging.

131
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,560
It's 2018 and people,

132
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,180
especially AI enthusiasts have no
patience for a boring lecturer.

133
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:49,390
What with all the engaging educational
creators popping up every week on social

134
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:50,264
media,

135
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,710
they also have their cell phones in their
pockets full of interesting things to

136
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:55,544
do.

137
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:00,300
What you can do in person that you can't
do in a video though is engage in real

138
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:04,800
time. Don't think of it like a
lecture, but more like a conversation.

139
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,300
Encourage your audience to interrupt you,
to ask questions,

140
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:12,060
to debate a point amongst themselves.

141
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,420
You can get feedback in real time
and give them a unique experience and

142
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,290
depending on your locale,

143
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,180
the audience will likely have a
shared set of cultural and or societal

144
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:25,260
experiences.

145
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:30,210
Leverage that relate your topics to things
your audience can relate to if you're

146
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:32,550
teaching AI and Carola,
for example,

147
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,710
mentioned ways AI can be used to help
with the flooding people are experiencing.

148
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,200
I love watching charisma on command.

149
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,230
There are some great techniques to learn
how to capture and keep an audience's

150
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:49,860
attention. You want to be strong
but humble, fun, but educational.

151
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,600
This doesn't come easy,

152
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,100
just like all things worth doing
and practice makes perfect. Now,

153
00:09:56,101 --> 00:10:00,570
if you're like me and want to make
educational videos for your curriculum,

154
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,020
let me give you some
insights into my process.

155
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,700
I first choose a topic for a
video that I find interesting.

156
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,260
Then I spend time learning,
synthesizing blog posts,

157
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,490
videos, research papers, anything
I can find on that topic.

158
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,380
Once I feel prepared, I'll write a
script. I first introduced the topic,

159
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,550
give the history of it,
showed some real world applications,

160
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,750
discuss the mathematical theory,
then dive into the code,

161
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,320
followed by a discussion of
the demo and a conclusion.

162
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,940
I'll revise it once to correct
any spelling and ordering errors.

163
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,480
Then I'll add in some
humor on this second pass.

164
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,420
That's to keep it engaging
and give it my voice.

165
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,060
I'll then read my script
off a teleprompter.

166
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:52,320
You can find several online links,
will be in the video description.

167
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,560
I read my words from a teleprompter with
the green screen behind me and some led

168
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:02,640
lights on either side. I use a
sign Heizer globally or microphone,

169
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,900
a Canon DSLR camera.
Then once I have footage,

170
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,440
I'll transfer it over from
my SD card to my computer.

171
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,970
While I used to edit my videos myself
for a little over a year and a half,

172
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,240
I now have an editor helped me with this
final cut pro is what we use to edit

173
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:25,260
the footage. You'll first one to key
out yourself. Then add in a background,

174
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,980
add an images that help explain
what you're talking about.

175
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,960
I tend to look for memes
that are technical as they
are the best intersection of

176
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,240
engaging and educational.

177
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,450
If you want to take your
video to the next level,

178
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,480
you can use Adobe after effects to create
animations linked to a course on that

179
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,200
in the video description.

180
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,970
Then just export and upload to your
favorite social media platforms.

181
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,180
Share to your friends and relevant to
spread the AI power as far as you can.

182
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,940
It's okay to learn AI
by teaching it and yes,

183
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,970
creating a learning path for other people
and then following through with it is

184
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:07,294
hard work.

185
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,650
But if you believe in the power of AI
to solve some of the world's hardest

186
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:16,180
problems, it's worth every ounce
of effort. And that's Iraq.

187
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,200
It subscribed.

188
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,800
And I'll grant you three wishes and
make sure to connect with me on Twitter,

189
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,720
Instagram, and Facebook for more AI
content. For now, I've got to teach,

190
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,100
so thanks for watching.
