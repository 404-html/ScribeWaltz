1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello world,
it's Saroj and ripple.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,080
It's a digital currency designed
for banks. That's right.

3
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:11,250
I said for banks, not to
replace banks, but for bex,

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,600
and it's controversial,

5
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:16,380
but it's one of the highest market cap
current currencies out there in the space

6
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:17,940
right now.
So in this video,

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,990
I'm going to build a minimal ripple
client that acts as a wallet.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,490
Here's an example.
Okay.

9
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:27,570
So what we can do with this client is we
can generate an identity just like this.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,980
And uh, first I got to yet. So there's
our identity, it's 25 characters.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,630
And then what we can do is we can connect
to the ripple network and then it's

12
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:38,940
going to say, okay, it connected
with the results success,

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,460
and then we can send payments,
uh,

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,870
by using the token Xrp to another address.
And that's it.

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,670
That's the only three
things we're going to,

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,810
we're going to code out to get a feel for
how the ripple API works in javascript.

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,640
So it's going to be a
simple web app like that.

18
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:57,240
But first we've got to talk about this
thing, right? How does this thing worked?

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,070
Is a decentralized, is it centralize?
What's the deal with ripple? Right?

20
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:06,240
So we're going to go into his history,
some of its features,

21
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,990
it's consensus protocol,
the Xrp token versus the Iou.

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,710
And then we're going to build this thing.
So first of all, Tldr, there's a lot,

23
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,300
there's a lot here. So all
the ripple tokens, the XRP
Tokens, they've been issued.

24
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:22,140
So you can't, uh, they can't meant
any more. They're not doing that.

25
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:26,040
There's no rewards for minors. All the
tokens have already been issued. Okay.

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,210
They'd been pre mind. And
it's not a blockchain. That's,
that's a very key point.

27
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:33,210
It's very similar to a blockchain,
but it's not a blockchain in that,

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,590
that transactions in the network aren't
grouped into these blocks and inside of

29
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:41,280
the blocks or the transactions in the
form of a Merkle Dag. No, no, no, no.

30
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,280
It's just one giant list.
Okay.

31
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,430
And every node in the network
maintains a copy of that list,

32
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,330
but it's not in the form of blocks that
are pointing to other blocks just to,

33
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:52,130
you know,

34
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,230
it's just a nit picky distinction that
I want to make before people say, oh,

35
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:58,470
it's a decentralized blockchain.
It's not a blockchain,

36
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,660
it's just a digital currency.

37
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:05,661
You could say it's a digital currency
made for banks and there are a group of

38
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:09,300
validater nodes and that's how
the network agrees upon, uh,

39
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,460
whether or not a transaction is valid.

40
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,320
So nodes will vote on a
set of validater nodes.

41
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,400
Like these are kind of like
senators in the U S Senate, right?

42
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,990
It's not like the u s is a
direct democracy where every
participant can vote on

43
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:26,550
every single law. No, we
elect in the u s we elect, uh,

44
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:29,820
what are called senators and then they
make all the decisions for us and we

45
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:33,680
trust them. So it's not
decentralized. It's not completely,

46
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,900
it's not completely centralized.
It's somewhere in the middle,

47
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,430
nearing towards centralized. But I'm
going to talk more about that. So, um,

48
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,020
and, and these validators aren't
earning any rewards for validating these

49
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:49,740
transactions. They're just doing this
because a out of goodwill and be,

50
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:53,090
because only that validater
nodes can make, uh,

51
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,870
can vote on changes to the protocol.

52
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:59,390
So they get voting rights in
that way to the protocol. Oh,

53
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,650
there's also this idea of a gateway and,
uh,

54
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,370
basically any business can register as
a gateway and then you can create your

55
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:10,450
own issuances. So if I'm a business and
I have like, let's say I'm an airline,

56
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:13,870
I can register as a gateway and the
ripple network, and then I have some,

57
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,290
you know, miles or bonus points
or something, people can pay me,

58
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,760
say a thousand US dollars and then I can
send them a thousand bonus points and

59
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,410
ripple will facilitate that transaction,
that exchange between currencies.

60
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,790
And a lot of banks are using
this right now. But, uh,

61
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,120
the main use of Xrp as a,
as a token is to pay for transaction fees.

62
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:36,640
That that's why it exists.
And when you pay the fee,

63
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,070
the XRP is our burnt and then destroyed.

64
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,780
So the total number of XRP
existing become smaller every day.

65
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,960
That was just the Tldr. Before I go into
all of this, okay, so back to the history.

66
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,450
So, uh, payments online. So http,

67
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,870
http as a protocol basically made a
communicating with people online globally,

68
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,080
instantly, right? So globally you could
communicate with anyone online instantly,

69
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,460
but the same kind of innovation did not
apply to the payment space because we

70
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:08,461
had already created this kind of network
of pre internet protocols like Ach,

71
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,720
swift,
et cetera.

72
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,650
And banks had different relationships
with each other and this was kind of

73
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:18,760
tacked onto the http web,
but it was still slow, right?

74
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,730
Certain banks had to have
relationships with other banks.

75
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,410
Here's a little bit of
discrete math for you.

76
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,670
If you think about the common editorial
complexity of a problem where I'm a bank

77
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,430
and I want to send you money
and you're a bank, however,

78
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,080
we don't have any direct relationship.

79
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,440
So what we're going to have to do is
we're going to have to go through this

80
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,070
chain of banks, right? And each bank
has a relationship with another bank,

81
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,930
common editorial laid.
This could be,

82
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,170
this could be an explosion in terms of
the complexity of how many different hops

83
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,810
the transaction has to go
through, right? But with ripple,

84
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:53,920
the idea was let's create a protocol for
these banks so they can transfer money

85
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:58,570
from one to the other directly.
Ripple really solves two main problems.

86
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,400
One instant transfers between
banks, right? So right now,

87
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:06,100
if I send money internationally
from bank a to Bank B,

88
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,480
that takes between three to five days.
But with ripple, if a bank uses this,

89
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,950
then you could send money instantly
and to the second problem is lower

90
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:16,180
transaction fees,
right?

91
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:21,181
So how can we make this transaction
happen with the lowest costs and for these

92
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:24,340
two problems?
Ripple actually does this very well.

93
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:28,810
I know ripple actually solve this
problem very well for banks. Okay?

94
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,050
There are some downsides in
terms of decentralization,

95
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:34,210
which I'm going to go into.
But you know,

96
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:37,420
bitcoin tried to solve this
problem of removing a bank, right?

97
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:41,350
So it's not like ripple and
bitcoin or competing in any way.

98
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:45,790
They're completely different
protocols. Bitcoin is, is, uh,

99
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:50,110
speculatory currency, right?
It's, it's made for speculation.
Really. It's it, yes,

100
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:54,220
it's a digital currency, but
no one's using bitcoin as
a currency. Let's be real.

101
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:58,670
Like bitcoin is a tool for speculation.
It's an asset class.

102
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,470
And we can use the blockchain as this
kind of global distributed ledger where we

103
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:08,090
can add all sorts of digitized
assets and timestamped things for,

104
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,270
you know, just proving that something
exists without needing a third party.

105
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,200
Smart contracts. There's a
bunch of functionality, but
we can't just say, you know,

106
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:17,810
no one's using bitcoin for it.
You know, day to day transactions.

107
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,930
It's too volatile. But it was
made for consumers, right?

108
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:24,680
From person a to person B send a
transaction without needing a bank.

109
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,050
Ripple is not like that to ripple is for,

110
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,060
for banks to send money
between each other.

111
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,400
And it was designed to eliminate bitcoins,

112
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:34,550
reliance on centralized
exchanges as decentral,

113
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,400
as decentralized as Bitcoin is,
you still,

114
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:40,310
if you want to exchange that
bitcoin into any other currency,

115
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,260
you got to go through one of
these centralized exchanges
like Coinbase or bits

116
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:47,180
stamp, et cetera. So with ripple,

117
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,930
it supports payment in any type of
currency, whether that's cryptocurrency,

118
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,520
Fiat currency or any kind of, you know,
tokens that are not even currency,

119
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:59,660
like bonus points or miles or whatever
ripple is being adopted by a lot of banks.

120
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,690
It's being adopted by a lot of
governments, Bank of America,

121
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,200
HSBC bank in over 65 countries.

122
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,100
Japan is a major player in
ripple. Um, it's, it's like,

123
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,100
I think I read somewhere like
up to 40% of transactions in Ge,

124
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,000
in Japan in five years are going to be
using the ripple protocol in some way

125
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,810
because the banks in Japan are
adopting ripples so fast. But, uh,

126
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,130
I hear that. Here's this other image
of, you know, the ACH transfer process,

127
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,140
you know, US bank to Ubank,
whop, whop, whop, whop, whop,
whop. And then bitcoin is,

128
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:33,050
you know, direct to direct, however,
seven to 45 minutes for a transaction.

129
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:37,280
And then ripple is six seconds.
Okay, six seconds. Instant transfer.

130
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,170
So let's see here. Where are
we with ripple, right? Let's,

131
00:07:40,171 --> 00:07:41,990
let's look at the coin
market capitalist here.

132
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,400
Ripple is for all time, right? This,

133
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:47,900
this thing has been around for four years.

134
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,740
It's just been kind of
chilling until recently. And
Boom, look at this explosion.

135
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,980
It is hot. It is hot right
now. The currency is hot.

136
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,900
And what drives the,
the prices of these cryptocurrencies?

137
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:03,440
Remember, it's speculation.
It's news and a lot of banks,

138
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,580
a lot of institutions are adopting ripple,
which is what, what, what, you know,

139
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,620
accounts for this, right? In the future.

140
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:12,410
More and more it's going to be
utility instead of speculation.

141
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:16,220
But right now it's mostly speculation.
Arguably ripple has a lot of utility.

142
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:19,160
That's why these banks are using
this right now in production.

143
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:23,430
Like real banks are using this protocol.
Uh,

144
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,510
but you know, it's not perfect.
Obviously it's not perfect.

145
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,520
It's a proof of concept.
And there are problems with,

146
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:33,080
they like one problem is when
it was founded, it, there
was a huge pre mine, right?

147
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:38,081
So 80 billion tokens were allocated
to the company and the Ripple Labs

148
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,430
Foundation and then 20 billion were
given to the three founders. Right? Um,

149
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,160
so today glow globally, banks are
connected through proprietary networks.

150
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:50,120
There's no open standard
for communication. Hence all
the hops between networks,

151
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:55,230
but ripple enables any bank to access any
bank on the network, uh, directly, right?

152
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,430
It costs about 0.04 a sense and
takes three to five seconds to send.

153
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,110
Whereas bitcoin take cost over 25 US
dollars sometimes and takes up to an hour.

154
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,520
So here at three features that I thought
were really useful for were really cool

155
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:12,510
about ripple. So the first feature are
the gateways feature. So for gateways,

156
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,900
the idea is this, so anyone can
register to become a gateway.

157
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:19,770
These are businesses that provide a way
for money and other forms of value to

158
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:24,390
move in and out of the Xrp Ledger,
right? So if I'm a, you know, a bank,

159
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:26,250
a bank can apply,
obviously it to be a gateway,

160
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:28,890
but a person can apply
to be a gateway as well.

161
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,890
So if I'm a person and
I've got to say USD,

162
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,370
and this dude is only going to
accept euro's, he's like, you know,

163
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:39,750
I worked for you and I deserve 500 euros.
And I'm like, okay, I've got, you know,

164
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,070
600 USD and I'm going to, but I don't
have heroes. I want to pay you. Right?

165
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:46,260
So I've got my bank,
you've got your bank in Europe,

166
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:50,220
I've got my bank in the u s and I'm
going to pay ripple will facilitate this

167
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:54,210
transaction by the use of water called
gateways. So the gateway is going to say,

168
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,500
I've got USD and I've got euro and you're
going to send money to me and then I'm

169
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:02,670
going to send money to him. Okay. And
so in the, in the middle of all of this,

170
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,300
we've got Xrp as a bridge
between all of these currencies,

171
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:10,170
right from USD to euro XRP
acts as that bridge currency.

172
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,200
And so what happens is the network
is going to work like this.

173
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,560
You propose a payment by
specifying the source,

174
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,440
you and the destination
accounts and the currencies.

175
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,650
The system gives you a quote
based on public offers.

176
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,980
There are these entities
called market makers,

177
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,440
and these are basically
anybody can be a market maker.

178
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,090
They'll do things like arbitrage,

179
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:35,091
but basically they'll profit off of
making buy and sell orders in the network

180
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,790
and they're basically making the market
by making these buy and sell orders.

181
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,511
So you'll say,

182
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:43,080
I want to make a transfer and here's the
maximum amount I'm willing to pay for

183
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:43,860
that transfer.

184
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,310
The market makers will have all these
buy and sell orders for all of these

185
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:51,540
different conversions and the network
will match you up with the best for your

186
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,130
threshold for what you're willing to pay.

187
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,120
Then the gateway will then facilitate
that transaction between you and the

188
00:10:57,121 --> 00:11:00,600
destination using that buy or
sell order from the market maker.

189
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,680
The market maker will make
that transaction fee and
Xrp and the pain will go

190
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:07,290
through the gateway. It can go
through several gateways actually,

191
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,090
but it will get to the destination within
three to five seconds, six seconds,

192
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:15,270
seven seconds under 10 seconds for sure.
But it's a really fast,

193
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,230
a way to send money between banks,
right.

194
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:20,910
So there are different ways that gay,

195
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,830
there are different models
that gateways can follow.

196
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,710
You can have an issue in gateway,
a private exchange,

197
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,490
and merchants can accept the payments
in exchange for goods and services with

198
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:33,240
the outside world. So there's a lot of
different ways that you can be a gateway.

199
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,660
There's other feature I thought
was really cool, was not cool,

200
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:39,930
but just interesting. Uh, not
necessarily cool but interesting. That's,

201
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:44,730
that's a better word for this. But
the freezing balances feature. So, uh,

202
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,150
this was actually a very controversial
feature, but, and you know,

203
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,680
there's a lot of negative hype around
this that ripple gateways can freeze users

204
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:56,760
funds any time. This is true,
but there has to be some corn,

205
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,240
some kind of reason for that,
right?

206
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:01,390
So if you think about compliance
between all these different governments,

207
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:01,601
you know,

208
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:06,601
KYC compliance about it at a ripple was
made to facilitate transactions between

209
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,640
banks. And if you really want
to do something for banks,

210
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,550
banks are all about government compliance.

211
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:17,230
So any protocol they use
has to be compliant with
these, you know, governments,

212
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:21,760
right? So if a government needs
to, you know, freeze a transaction,

213
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,880
they see something illegal happening,
they need to reverse funds. They need to,

214
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,730
you know, whatever. There has to
be some way for them to do that.

215
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,860
So ripple allows for governments to then
freeze funds by seizing the whatever's

216
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:37,150
in the gateway, that intermediary to
prevent any kind of illegal transactions.

217
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,670
Now this is controversial and
a decentralized space, right?

218
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:44,110
Because this allows control
from governments and third
parties, right? So, but um,

219
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,080
that's, that's how it is.
And because it is compliant,

220
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,510
that's why its market
cap is rising so fast.

221
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,760
That's why that's why all these banks
are adopting it so fast because it's,

222
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,030
it is government compliance.
So yes,

223
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:58,660
the negative is that governments can
seize those funds if there is some illegal

224
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:01,630
transaction.
So there is some trust involved there.

225
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,930
Uh, but they can't seize XRP. So
that's the really key difference.

226
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:10,300
They can seize any currency
that the gateway is holding,

227
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:15,130
except for Xrp because that is a digital
currency. It is not a Fiat currency.

228
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,370
So these market makers,
anybody can be a market maker.

229
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:20,500
They can make a living off
of being a market maker.

230
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:23,260
But what they do full time
as they look for, you know,

231
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:28,261
buy and sell options and they
will hedge the on those options.

232
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:32,320
So they'll make some profit by saying,
you know, I've got x amount of currencies,

233
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,370
I've got y amount of this currency and
then I see this order, I'm going to,

234
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,100
you know, say I've got that and
then I'll get the transaction fee.

235
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,390
And it's just continually do that.
And this will be facilitated,

236
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,260
facilitated through the gateway.
So when it comes to consensus,

237
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:50,020
we can think of the network like
this. We've got two banks, right?

238
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:55,021
Bank a and Bank B and someone will send
money from bank a to bank B and it's

239
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,560
going to go through the ripple network.

240
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,010
These are the validator knows they're
going to validate all those transactions.

241
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,570
Market makers are going to,

242
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,670
are going to make buy and sell orders
to facilitate the exchange between these

243
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:10,810
currencies. It's a decentralized
exchange. Once it is approved,

244
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,070
it's going to go through a gateway and
then end up at the receiving end of the

245
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:19,900
bank. So, like I said, there is not a
blockchain. There's just a giant ledger.

246
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:23,890
Just think of it as an a giant excel
spreadsheets. And inside of this,

247
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:27,730
it's got the ledger number, account
settings, balances, transactions,

248
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,230
whether or not a transaction
was validated, all this
stuff. And every few seconds,

249
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,290
this giant list of transactions is updated
over time by the validater nodes as

250
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,720
new transactions are coming in,
right?

251
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:44,230
So ripple runs a network of servers.
Anybody can become a client's, right?

252
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,390
And at the heart of the network is this
ledger, it's a distributed database. Uh,

253
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,670
and so any server can introduce
a transaction to them network.

254
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,600
These transactions go out to all
active ripple servers and the servers

255
00:14:56,601 --> 00:15:00,560
automatically come to consensus about a
set of transactions to apply it to the

256
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:04,610
ledger creating a new
closed ledger. So, but how,

257
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:06,020
how is it doing this?
Right?

258
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:09,530
So this is where the trust and the
kind of centralization comes in.

259
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:12,680
It's not completely decentralized.
Remember I said that from the start,

260
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,330
but the goal of consensus in ripple is
for each server to apply the same set of

261
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:20,510
transactions to the current ledger.
So every server is going to,

262
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:25,400
basically it's going to say how many
other a validater nodes have approved this

263
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:26,234
transaction.

264
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:31,310
So every or node is going to agree
whether on whether or not a transaction is

265
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:35,660
valid based on if other validater
nodes say it's a valid transaction.

266
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,550
So the validater nodes are trusting
their, the other validater notes, right?

267
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:41,900
So they are all trusting each other.

268
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:46,070
So there is some trust there and the
servers are continually receiving

269
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,230
transactions from other
servers in the network.

270
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,820
And basically every validator node is
polling the other validater nodes to see

271
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:57,080
if they have accepted a certain
transaction. And so it's, uh, it's,

272
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,360
it's going editor iteratively, right? So,

273
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,020
and so a server is going to receive
proposals from the other servers and the

274
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:06,950
network. A proposal is a set
of transactions to consider
applying to the ledger.

275
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:09,440
So they're going to propose, you
know, x amount of transactions.

276
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:12,680
These are all valid. Let me propose
that to all the other validater notes.

277
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,850
And the server only pays attention to
incoming proposals from the server set.

278
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,510
They're matched with the candidate
set. And if there is a, uh,

279
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,230
it at the server,

280
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,200
a server is going to take transactions
that have received at least a 50%

281
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:31,250
approval rating and package them into a
new proposal. And this goes iteratively,

282
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:34,580
that proposal goes out to other servers
in the network, the process repeats,

283
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,770
but this time it looks for a 60% approval.

284
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,560
The process repeats this
time a 70% approval.

285
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,140
And at that point the network
has reached consensus.

286
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,220
So there is trust involved amongst the
validater nodes with each other who in

287
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:49,520
turn are trusted by the network.
They are voted on by the network.

288
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,100
So there are two types
of payment methods here.

289
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:55,310
One is Xrp and then the other is an Iou.

290
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:57,920
So XRP is the native currency of ripple.

291
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,760
And anyone can accept Xrp,
they can send Xrp.

292
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,070
It takes care of cross
border transactions.

293
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,280
But there's also this concept of the Iou.

294
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,480
So IOUs are issued on the platform and
they are redeemable for a fungible asset

295
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:17,780
like USC or gold or whatever.
Anyone can issue these IOUs.

296
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,700
But in order for someone
to accept a payment,

297
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:24,320
they must trust that person who issued
them to be able to redeem the Iou for the

298
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:25,300
underlying assets.

299
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:30,140
So there is some trust involved and
mostly banks are using this IOU concept to

300
00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:32,480
say, okay, you know, I
don't have the fun here,

301
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:35,510
but I'm going to promise that I'm
going to give this phone to you.

302
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,290
They'll accept that payment and then
hopefully the bank then sends that money.

303
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:43,100
So this is, there is this trust
involved, but it's faster. Okay,

304
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:46,140
so let's get to to building
this thing, right? So, uh,

305
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,010
let me open this up. Okay. So
in the index dot, html, uh,

306
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,080
I've got this basic html and all we're
going to do is we're in a code up the

307
00:17:57,081 --> 00:17:59,430
Java script for, uh, showing, uh,

308
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:03,390
generating an identity in the network
and then connecting to the network and

309
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:07,530
then sending a payment. Three different
things, right? What each of these html,

310
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:11,010
these dom elements are doing are there,
they're using an on click,

311
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:15,630
an event listener to call these three
javascript functions that are using the

312
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:17,310
ripple, uh, Api, right?

313
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:21,600
So we've got press to generate an identity
press to connect to ripple and then

314
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:25,260
press to send a payment, right? So if
we go down here, here's the ripple,

315
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,460
a js library. Just, you know,

316
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,890
I'm just putting it in time
inside of this script, html tag.

317
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,230
We're just going to scroll down,
scroll down, scroll down, scroll down,

318
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,170
and then we'll get to the, to the part
where we can, you know, code this,

319
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,430
this part up the, the, the part
that matters here. Okay. So, um,

320
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,900
first to open in the opening set up,
I'm going to say,

321
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,190
here's my address. Uh, and
then I want the remote server,

322
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,360
which I'm going to initialize
using the ripple, uh,

323
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:00,330
object and instance of
the ripple a server.

324
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,200
And then in the servers I'm going to
use are these default servers right here

325
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:08,160
that, uh, I could have my own
server, I could use another server,

326
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,430
but luckily there's this
client, a globally that I'm
using, is using right here,

327
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,200
that ripple provides that I can use as a,

328
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:16,800
as a server to just connect to
directly. And then I can say, okay,

329
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:19,710
let me generates a, an identity.
So this is what's called,

330
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:21,630
whenever we say generate an identity.

331
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:26,631
So in this function I'll say take
the result of generate address,

332
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,190
which is a part of the ripple Api.

333
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,580
And then set the identity in the html
to whatever the result of that is.

334
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,420
And then set the secret,

335
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,850
my remote

336
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,630
server to the resulting
address. That's it. Okay.

337
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,050
Just like that. And now I'm going
to have the connect function.

338
00:19:52,051 --> 00:19:56,280
So for the connect function, I'm going to
say connect, uh, connect to ripple. Okay?

339
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:59,220
So this is going to connect to the
ripple network, right? This is our very,

340
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:02,340
very simple minimalist client
that we're building here.

341
00:20:02,341 --> 00:20:05,580
And we're going to use a remote
that we initialize before to say,

342
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:10,910
here is a callback function that's going
to return an error and the response,

343
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,330
and we're going to say
either the result,

344
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,400
their response,

345
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,310
or it's going to be successful,

346
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,790
whether or not it's successful,
do the following, get the outcome,

347
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,730
uh, and then, well,
we're going to say, okay,

348
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,210
connected to ripple so we can display
that in html, connect to ripple.

349
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,490
And then alert outcome,
right? Just like that.

350
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,600
And then lastly,
we're going to say,

351
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,070
send Xrp, right? So whenever we hit,
you know, sin, we're going to have,

352
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,360
we're going to specify an amount,
right? The amount of Xrp to destination.

353
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:03,100
And then we're gonna say,
okay, so take the transaction.

354
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,210
There's going to be,

355
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,450
we're going to use that same remote
object to create a transaction,

356
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,460
or it's going to ask for some,
it's going to ask for some, uh,

357
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,940
parameters. So we'll say, my address,
here's my address, the source,

358
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,800
here's the destination that I've
specified, destination. And then lastly,

359
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,820
we'll say, here's the amount, the
amount is whatever I specify it

360
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,670
right now I can say
transaction dot summit.

361
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,300
Here's my transaction. I've
initialized it as an, as an object.

362
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,310
And now I can submit that transaction.

363
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:39,640
It's going to be in the form
of a callback. Did it, was
it successful? Was it not?

364
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,020
This will tell us,

365
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,550
notify the outcome,
error response.

366
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,570
And that's just going to take the
result of that. Okay? So yeah,

367
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,060
those are three basic functions.
And then we can go back.

368
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,760
We can see the results here.
Uh, we can connect to ripple,

369
00:21:58,761 --> 00:22:00,670
we can generate an identity,
we can send the payment.

370
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:03,460
I don't have any XRP in this wallet,
but it's very simple.

371
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:07,240
All the code for this is in the get
hub repo in the video description.

372
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:08,260
So definitely check it out.

373
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,960
I've got more detailed documentation
and instructions there,

374
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:14,470
so I hope you found this useful. Please
subscribe for more programming videos.

375
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:18,250
And for now I'm going to work on a
music video, so thanks for watching.
