1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,620
Yeah. Oh, I think I'm live.

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,120
I think I'm alive.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,620
Hello world. It's Raj. I'm alive.

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,440
Okay.
Um,

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,880
all right.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,580
Is there anybody in here? Oh, there's
some people in here. Hi Guys. Hi Guys.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,120
I'm doing my live two and a,
a live Q and a.

8
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:33,960
I'm to saying that from Twitter right
now. I'm going and I'm back. Okay.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,820
It's a shared it and now I'm going
to be here with you guys engaged.

10
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:42,750
We're going to start talking it. Hi
everybody. Hi. Hi. Hi. Welcome. Hello.

11
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,950
I'm going to name off some names.

12
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:47,940
I'm just doing this live Q and a for you
guys because I want to engage you guys.

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,920
Um, I'm going to name off
some names to start off with.

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,200
Niton Albert's Henry biggish Rafael,
both Don Tyshawn,

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,870
Alex Grazia, one Cortez. I'm preaching.

16
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,180
We've got a lot of cool
people in the room right now.

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,530
This week I'm going to do a live Q and
a. Okay. This is just a simple Q and a.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,780
Next week, what I'm working on
is a setup for a, a more um, uh,

19
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:12,660
better live stream with the green
screen and you know, the code,

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,290
it's going to be much, much
better. Okay. So, but this
week, you know, we were trying,

21
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:20,280
I had a friend from upload VR come over
and help me try to set up the studio for

22
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,250
that, but we just couldn't do it right
now. So we have to buy a few things.

23
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,360
But next week we're going to do a full on,
you know,

24
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,230
we're going to start doing like
a full on weekly live streams.

25
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:31,560
The live streams are coming back
as you can see right now. Okay. So,

26
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,640
okay. So what I want
to do is do a Q and. A.

27
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:38,820
So any questions you have about deep
learning about blockchain, about me,

28
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:41,550
about anything. Uh, you can
talk about, this is my place,

29
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:44,400
just to be completely open
with you. I just moved in. Uh,

30
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:48,330
this is my place in San Francisco.
That's my studio back there.

31
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:50,970
If you want to take a look back
there. Uh, but yeah, this is me.

32
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:52,770
This is where I live.
I don't want to get too personal.

33
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,630
Tell everybody the address and stuff,
but it's where I am. What is, okay.

34
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,750
Are you going to visit pie con
ball can be this November. No.

35
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,360
How does start with machine
learning with minimal coding?

36
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,580
I have a great video on this.
Search on Youtube.

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,540
SAROJ learn machine learning three months.
Xavier asks,

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,560
when should I apply for fall internships
starting from August and ending in

39
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,453
December.

40
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,970
The best time to apply for
full internships is the
beginning of the summer.

41
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:22,740
So I would say Jew. What are
opportunities after learning blockchain?

42
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,650
So once you start,
once you've learned blockchain,

43
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:28,530
there's no way to say you've learned
a blockchain because it's actually a

44
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:33,090
continuously changing field. This is a
field that has heavy researched. Okay.

45
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:36,450
People are constantly researching
how to improve blockchain.

46
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,240
What are things that are
working with blockchain?

47
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,430
So once you feel like you have
a good grasp of what it is,

48
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,490
then the best thing would be to start
working on business use cases, provenance,

49
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:51,120
um, uh, working on anytime there's a
third party that is very expensive,

50
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:53,910
you can remove that middleman. And you
could say businesses, a lot of money.

51
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,430
So insurance, um, security.

52
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,710
I'm a great trailer that talks about
the 20 different use cases for this.

53
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:02,580
Literally 20 of them.
Search blockchains to Raj,

54
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,260
what hair product you use. I don't use
any hair products. It's all natural.

55
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:10,900
I swear to you. I don't use
any, I mean I use shampoo. Okay.

56
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:13,660
But like I don't use anything to like
make it stick out. That's just my life.

57
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,290
This hair is alive.
Mark 10 asks,

58
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:21,640
how do I improve my
coding skills? Um, you,

59
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,030
the best way to improve your coding
skills is to continuously code.

60
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:25,990
So there's this challenge,

61
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:28,450
it's called a hundred days of code
and a lot of my friends have done this

62
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:29,284
challenge.

63
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,340
What that means is every single day you
add a pull request to a repository up

64
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:35,410
your own or some other project on get hub.

65
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,220
So what I want you to do is every single
day and make a pull request on Github.

66
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:40,720
Guys,
speaking of get up,

67
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,020
I had some amazing get up content
coming out this week starting tomorrow.

68
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,440
I'm so excited to show you guys and
stuff. It's some hits, amazing stuff. Um,

69
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,080
Tyler Berry asks,

70
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,850
is there any benefit to
doing image recognition tasks
with color spaces outside

71
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,900
of RGB?

72
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,950
I Dunno if there's a benefit,
but if the data set is not RGB based,

73
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,310
then that would be the best thing to do.
I have a great video on this.

74
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,630
It's called, it's, it's actually called
Yolo. So search yellow object detection.

75
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:14,580
And in the beginning of the video
I go through all the different, um,

76
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,300
all the different strategies for
computer vision that came before yellow.

77
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,720
And in there you're going to find what
you're talking about. Martin asks,

78
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,640
what is 100 days of code exactly.
Just,

79
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,870
it's a Hashtag just search for a hundred
days of code on Google. But it's, it's,

80
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,290
it's, it's a, it's a, it's like a
challenge that developers are ebbing,

81
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,690
giving themselves to get
better at programming by
coding every day for a hundred

82
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,410
days.
Honeoye asks,

83
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,120
do a phd and ml without a CS degree.
It's possible. It's very hard.

84
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,470
But it's possible to get accepted to a
school to do a phd without having a CS

85
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:48,100
degree.

86
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,040
You're going to have to have published
something in the field or done something

87
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,880
that is very useful for them
to accept you. Right. And uh,

88
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,470
and a great way to do this, to be
real with you guys because of course,

89
00:04:56,471 --> 00:05:00,450
and we're real, is to find one of
these professors at a school, you know,

90
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,570
just like shoot, you know, like get
along with them, you know, like, uh,

91
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,050
meet them for dinner. Yeah, you've
got to, you got to keynote escalate.

92
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:12,040
Not Keno escalate, but
like social escalates, that
physical relationship. Listen,

93
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,050
some of the people who I know,
I'm going to just,

94
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:16,150
I'm going to name a name right
here at Taryn southern. Okay.

95
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:19,750
So Karen southern is a youtube
creator who dropped an AI music video.

96
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,420
Now if I dropped an AI music video,
it would do well.

97
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,330
But when Tara and dropped it,
the New York Times covered it.

98
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,330
A bunch of these famous
outlets covered it.

99
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:32,920
And the reason is because she's so good
at making these connections with people.

100
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,740
And really when it comes down to
whether it's selling yourself,

101
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:37,420
selling your code,
selling your product,

102
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,290
if you know how to build these
relationships with powerful people,

103
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,690
that is what really matters in the end.
So when I meet with the,

104
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:47,710
the reason I even went on that tangent
is because if you meet one of the

105
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:50,950
professors at these schools, um, and
you don't have a cs degree, if they,

106
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:54,030
if they like you, then they can
open doors for you. So, you know,

107
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,160
email them directly, cold email, trying
to meet up with them for dinner, just,

108
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:00,520
you know, escalate the relationship
and then it can you, you'll,

109
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,610
you'll be more likely to get in.
Okay.

110
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,770
Uh, cool. Asks,

111
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,970
can teenagers who haven't taken
calculus or statistics yet,

112
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:15,680
learn and machine learning and how,
listen, um, machine learning, okay.

113
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:17,120
I'm just going to say it as deep learning.

114
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,840
Deep learning is creating models
using linear, how's your bro?

115
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,750
And then optimizing those
models with calculus.

116
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,400
So his calculus necessary
for machine learning, 100%.

117
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,110
It is very necessary.

118
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,270
Do you need to take an entire calculus
course before, uh, doing machine learning?

119
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,270
The answer is no. You know
why? Because Michelle,

120
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,160
it only takes small parts of calculus.
It takes, you have to use a derivative,

121
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,100
you have to use the partial derivatives.

122
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,590
Now these are very crucial
concepts in calculus. However,

123
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,820
do you need to use the integral, another
part of Calculus? It's very crucial. No,

124
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,610
right?
So you don't have to use all of calculus.

125
00:06:55,611 --> 00:07:00,470
You only have to use certain part of
Calculus and what I would say is learn

126
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,350
calculus as you need to while
you're learning machine learning.

127
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,350
Don't just sit there and say
by a calculus textbook and say,

128
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,060
one day I wanted learn machine learning,

129
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:12,440
but first I'm going to try learning
calculus. No. Learn machine learning.

130
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,191
Do something.

131
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:17,150
Find a project that excites you can
along the way you will learn the calculus

132
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,940
and what we're talking about.
Calculus. Let's just say this.

133
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:25,210
The most important technique that is
calculus base that you need to know is

134
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,130
gradient descent.
And Luckily for you,

135
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:32,870
I have a great video on this search
gradient descent Saroj on Youtube.

136
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,700
The best video you will
find on backpropagation and
gradients is sent on Youtube

137
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:41,420
and everything will start making
sense in terms of calculus. Ray Asks,

138
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,290
I am 13 years old and I finished my
artificial intelligence standard degree.

139
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,330
That wasn't actually a question.
I just read that out.

140
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:53,210
PMM pinned the asks, can you make money
predicting stocks with machine learning?

141
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,900
Listen to me,
God's not a lot of people,

142
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,630
you know when it comes to making money
with machine learning using stock price

143
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:02,270
prediction,
a lot of people are very interested in it,

144
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,900
but notice you won't find a
lot of tutorials on this. Why?

145
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,740
Because the people who have figured this
out are not going to tell people there

146
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:12,770
are secrets, right? If you
have, if you work at Blackstone,

147
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:15,920
if you work with her black rock,
if you work at JP Morgan,

148
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,950
if you work at ing,
any of these big banks,

149
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,780
you are being paid as a quantitative
analyst to create predictive models.

150
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:27,260
That is their job. That is
in their job description. I,

151
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,340
it is without a doubt in my mind that
a lot of these traders and hedge fund

152
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:32,000
people,

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,410
they have models that are greater than
50% in their accuracy for predicting the

154
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:40,880
next stock price,
but they're not gonna share it.

155
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,140
So what you need to do is reverse
engineer what they're doing by taking into

156
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:48,260
account sentiment analysis,
what's happening in the news,

157
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,630
what people are talking
about on social media,

158
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:54,470
and then combine all of those
data points into a single model.

159
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,490
A Mariah is a great place to find, uh,
models that are current in his space.

160
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,940
Real Patel asks, how can we get best
results in real time? Deep fakes.

161
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,743
Okay,

162
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,140
so the best result for real time d fakes.
Uh,

163
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:14,880
I don't know what you mean by best.
You have to be very specific, right?

164
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:17,980
So you have to be very specific in your
questions with me with machine learning

165
00:09:17,981 --> 00:09:19,690
engineers,
with people in the field.

166
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:23,560
Because anytime you are ambiguous and
this is just a good practice to have,

167
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,470
you're going to get the wrong answer.
But I'm going to assume I best.

168
00:09:26,471 --> 00:09:27,430
You mean fastest.

169
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,870
So right now there is not a
real time solution to defects.

170
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,660
Would this be an amazing technology?
Yext,

171
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,170
could you make a lot of money if you made
an app that did this in the cloud? Yes.

172
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,230
Has anyone done this before? No. Is
this a possibility for moneymaking? Yes.

173
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:43,510
Uh,

174
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,800
deep face by the way is taking a video
and it takes a lot of processing power,

175
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:51,370
but taking the video and then adding in
the face of someone else in real time to

176
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:52,900
this video.
So like Nicholas Cage,

177
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,680
the Internet has day having
a lot of fun doing this. Uh,

178
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,810
report it from the Hollywood reporter
came and interviewed me about this.

179
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,950
But this is very,

180
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,230
this is a very hot thing right now and
not just in machine learning but in the

181
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:07,510
world right now.
Uh,

182
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,753
okay.

183
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,000
I did too. Asks, do you recommend
getting a postdoc Postgrad degree,

184
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,240
four ml masters or phd or
he's an Undergrad degree
in cs and math can now I do

185
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:29,920
not recommend getting a phd in machine
learning. I'm going to say that right now.

186
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,880
I do not recommend it unless you're
going to like a top by school.

187
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:37,780
Like if you're wanting to Stanford,
yes. Do not forsake that opportunity.

188
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,900
If you're going into like University
of Phoenix or like, you know,

189
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:42,550
not like a really good college,

190
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,090
don't even do it because you can get a
lot of those resources. Thinking about,

191
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,940
just like, think of, you
know, how Elon Musk says,

192
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,980
think of things from first principles.

193
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,840
What are like those sub
modules of a university degree
that are useful? You know,

194
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,170
you want the advisement in advisory roles,
you need an advisor,

195
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,880
you need resources, you
need, um, a learning path.

196
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,660
All of those things you can find online.
You can find an advisor online.

197
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,810
You can find resources, might,
you could channel online,

198
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,240
you can find a learning path online
through via these courses. You can do,

199
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,330
look at my courses.
You can make your own course.

200
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,020
So as long as you have those three
things, you don't necessarily need to, uh,

201
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,220
you know, to commit to a phd
because it is quite a commitment.

202
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:28,960
I five to seven year commitment.
Uh, and a lot of advisors,

203
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:32,800
they're not really good. You know, they've
been coasting. They got it, got this. Um,

204
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,810
what, how do I say it? They
have this, um, um, you know,

205
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:41,480
these metals and these like
award.

206
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:42,920
So they've gotten into it feel like good.

207
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:46,690
So you need like a really hungry adviser.
Um,

208
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,420
corporate sinks says hello.
Emiliano says,

209
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,550
are you into some personal AI project?
Emilio?

210
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:58,900
Right now there are 15
businesses that you know,

211
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,100
are possible from this community.
Um, you know, there's Q and a,

212
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:06,910
there's consulting, there's hiring
opportunities, there's a school of Ai,

213
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:07,744
there's a lot.

214
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,700
And I just want to focus on building or
making my videos and teaching you guys

215
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:15,100
how to Code and teaching you guys
machine learning and blockchain.

216
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,050
So that's what I'm focused on.
However,

217
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:19,510
I do have a business partner
that's focused on, you know,

218
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:22,090
making these things happen.
And it's essentially,

219
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:26,710
this is becoming a very large empire
and it's paying for all of this. So,

220
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,610
you know, we've got a
good space here, but, uh,

221
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,490
I'm focused on the videos on youtube. You
guys are my focus. I want to, you know,

222
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,780
help you guys become amazing at machine
learning at life, at everything.

223
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,460
Soft skills, hard skills. So that's,
that's my goal is, is helping you guys.

224
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:46,150
That's my number one goal in
life right now. Go Ku has,

225
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,100
how good is Google Colab?
So go cool.

226
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,930
I have an amazing Goku thank you
for saving the world from uh,

227
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,500
the Chevron Dragon by the way,
back in the day.

228
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:56,860
And thank you for dying for all of our
sins, you know, thank you. Go. I love you,

229
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,630
but I'm dragonball z forever. Well,
what was even the question? Damn,

230
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:03,820
I should've like there's,
you guys should see this.

231
00:13:03,821 --> 00:13:06,610
There is so much text happening right now.

232
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,670
Uh, thank you ru tool. Marco,

233
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,030
ask where and what do you do right now?
I live in San Francisco, California.

234
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:20,050
I am focused on creating technical
content for the world for you guys.

235
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,730
And that is my number one goal. So that
just creating technical videos and then,

236
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:27,770
um, there's, there's
more out, more at there.

237
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,390
Bob, Don asks, can you talk about how
to find incubators for your startup?

238
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,460
You know, there are, um,

239
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,410
how to find incubators is a good question.

240
00:13:43,411 --> 00:13:46,240
So I'd been a part of a
couple of incubators. Um,

241
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:51,650
what I am very hesitant to do is to ever
give equity to an incubator unless it's

242
00:13:51,841 --> 00:13:55,650
like y Combinator. Okay. So
because I'm actually in general,

243
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:59,180
very picky about giving
away equity. So, uh,

244
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,170
so yeah,

245
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,500
I mean you want to look for a deal where
they are giving you more than you are

246
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:08,920
giving them. Um, ideally, and now what I
would do is just like pay the, you know,

247
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,360
the rent, you know, pay some
liquid cash to the incubator,

248
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:17,190
not give away equity and
um, you know, also the,

249
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,480
the quality of the incubator, your
independence on the city you're in, right?

250
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:27,481
So if you're in some western country
or China or actually even in Bombay,

251
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:32,290
there, there's likely like at least two
or three really good incubators. Um,

252
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,790
Deli, not so much, sorry, Delhi.
Uh, but um, and also in south India,

253
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:40,210
in Bangalore as well.
It depends on the city you're in,

254
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,830
but all that is to say if you have a
team of, if you're more than yourself,

255
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:48,070
definitely join an incubator. If it's
just you, she's trying to coworking space,

256
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,680
find people.
Um,

257
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,390
Edgar masks. Do you know something
about, oh, the questions already gone.

258
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:02,780
There's so many questions coming in
right now. Hello from Kenya. Hi Kenya.

259
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:05,600
I love you.
How do you know mega mega sell asks,

260
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,060
how do you know when
you're ready for freelance?

261
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,240
How do you know when you're ready
for freelance? Let me ask you this.

262
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:16,330
Are you making money? If the answer is
yes, do you keep doing what you're doing?

263
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,000
If the answer is no, you're
ready for freelance. Okay.

264
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,070
When I started doing freelance work,

265
00:15:21,071 --> 00:15:24,280
I was living in a hacker house
with 12 guys in one room. Okay?

266
00:15:24,281 --> 00:15:27,460
So that was in one room with 12 bunk beds.

267
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:32,980
I W I had like three k USD and my bank
account, I needed some money. Okay.

268
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:34,180
I needed to hustle.

269
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,530
So the way to do freelance is to
just start doing freelance. Okay.

270
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,760
Learn what you need to along
the way. Don't listen to
anybody else that you know,

271
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,670
all of your ability is in your head.

272
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,980
You know what you tell yourself
you can and you cannot do.

273
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,660
I got into the robotics lab at Columbia
because I applied for a position as a

274
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:56,070
Gpu, um, intern. Essentially. I don't,

275
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,760
I didn't know anything about Gpu,

276
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,310
but you can bet that once I
got there and I had the job,

277
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:05,310
I stayed in late every night to learn
how the GPU works and learn how Kuda

278
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,690
programming worked.
And then eventually,

279
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:09,843
uh,

280
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,590
eventually we, I did it. I spent up,

281
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:16,460
they've feature classification for
the Da Vinci surgical robot by 800%.

282
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,220
So you will,
you will move mountains if you,

283
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,390
if you just put yourself in
an uncomfortable position
where you have to do well,

284
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,400
you will move mountains, I promise
you. All right. So, um, Christian.

285
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,750
Hey Christian,
I recognize your name.

286
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,870
I feel like I'm getting nowhere
trying to get data science, jobs,

287
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,450
advice Christian. I have
three, not just one,

288
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,680
three amazing videos on this exact
thing coming out for you this weekend.

289
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,270
But all that is to say in one sentence,
if you're getting nowhere,

290
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,670
I would s I would start with the people
you know and the people that they know

291
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:52,880
because clearly they're not giving you
some jobs because they don't trust you.

292
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,860
You haven't built your brand enough.

293
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,250
Like you want to get to the point where
you are constantly saying no to people.

294
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,340
Okay. That's where I'm at. I am
constantly saying no to brands.

295
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:05,180
There's so many brands in the
pipeline into it and video, Google,

296
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,330
every single tech company you
could think about is reaching out.

297
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,000
There's too many for me to
be thinking about, right?

298
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:14,630
I just want to make videos and that's
why I'm building essentially an empire of

299
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:17,390
people who are helping me out
with this stuff. But that's how,

300
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:20,990
where you want to be. So I was
focused on building your brand, right?

301
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:24,760
Through technical tutorials,
through creating, um,

302
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,760
code on get hub that other developers
want to be a part of. And you know,

303
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:30,650
just working on your marketing.
Again,

304
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:34,340
I have some great videos on that this
weekend. So that's what I would say.

305
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:39,170
If you're, if you're not getting any
leads, we'll ml replaced programmers.

306
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:43,130
That's the most hilarious question
ever. No, of course. Listen,

307
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,440
if machine learning replaces programmers,

308
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,530
you can bet it will replace
everybody else. Okay.

309
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,610
Machine learning is not
going to replace programmers.

310
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,420
We're going to go on a little walk
together because I need to get a, uh,

311
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,340
a charger for my laptop.

312
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,520
No machine machine learning is
never going to replace programmers.

313
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:04,020
This is my studio, by the
way. I'll go into my studio
studio. We're setting it up,

314
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,160
you know,
got a lot of stuff.

315
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,820
We as in me and my friend who I'm
doing contract work, you know, he's,

316
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,710
he's doing production for me by the way.
Product,

317
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:15,060
contract work is the future guys, by the
way, don't just trying to think of like,

318
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,710
oh, I need a guy and he's going to be
full time. And you know, that's it.

319
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,020
You know, the contract
work is a future. You know,

320
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:26,370
we all went options as millennials,
as people who are in the 21st century.

321
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,260
No one wants to commit to anything.

322
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:33,000
So don't be afraid to build an entire
company based off of contract work alone.

323
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,700
Okay? So you're going to need
help. And here's the other thing.

324
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,390
I started this youtube channel. I
didn't even think like, you know,

325
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,570
I didn't think like, oh, I want to
build a company. I want to be a manager.

326
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:45,810
I want to be in charge. No, I just,
I didn't even know what I was doing.

327
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,000
I just knew I wanted to
add value to the world.

328
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,140
And if you try to add value to the world
yourself, people will come to LP. Okay.

329
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,800
What do we got here? Oh man,
there's so many good questions.

330
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:02,870
I wish you guys could see this.
You will. Thanks to youtube.

331
00:19:02,871 --> 00:19:06,740
Thank you youtube for adding the, uh,
comments and in the post, you know,

332
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:10,190
once I post this video,
uh, Danny had, it's gone.

333
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,780
She vom asks his master's
necessary for a good ml job. No.

334
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:21,370
Uh,
six bay asks,

335
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,800
Does Your University
matter or your degree?

336
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,480
Now I'm going to tell you the real answer.

337
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:28,000
And not a lot of people will say this
because they want to make you feel good.

338
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:33,190
Yes, your university matters.
Okay. Because it's a brand,

339
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:33,580
right?

340
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:38,290
Every brand you associate yourself
with with matters for your brain.

341
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,560
Right? So whether it's a university,
whether it's an employer,

342
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:43,120
whether it's a person,
you know,

343
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:46,900
people can be brands to think about
things in terms of brands and who you

344
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:51,160
associate yourself with. Right? I
associated myself with a lot of brands,

345
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,430
but I only talk about a few. Right?
Because I talked about those top brands,

346
00:19:54,431 --> 00:19:57,160
that people that are most recognizable,
that have the most respect,

347
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:04,570
surely how tool asks, how, how do you
manage your time? That's a great question.

348
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,290
Um,

349
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:10,290
so I manage my time by waking up everyday
at 8:00 AM and going to my coworking

350
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:14,560
space and drinking some coffee
and just making videos, right?

351
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:18,040
So working on scripts, working on code,
working on editing, working on lighting,

352
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:22,090
working on, so I focused on the videos.
There's business development, you know,

353
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:24,790
all the pipeline of people coming in.
There's marketing and Seo.

354
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,210
That's stuff I've had to do. But I'm,
you know, hiring people to work on that.

355
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,800
And so I just focused on the video content
and I work until maybe six or 7:00 PM

356
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,400
every day.
Um,

357
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,900
and then I kind of just shut off because
I'm in this for the long run. Okay.

358
00:20:37,901 --> 00:20:41,800
So people like Elon Musk and you know,
a lot of very successful people will say,

359
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:45,400
you gotta be working a hundred hour
weeks. And you know what? I don't agree.

360
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,870
I don't agree with that because listen,
we're, we're hearing this life, right?

361
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:53,950
And it's a very short life and we don't
know what the point of everything is.

362
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,600
And there's more to life and
solving problems. Right? You got to,

363
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,140
I'm in this for the long run.
I don't want to burn out.

364
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,370
That's why I'm not working nights and days
every single day. Right. I'm trying to,

365
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,330
so what I do actually, um, um, is
I've been turning off my phone,

366
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:08,830
like on airplane mode at night.

367
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,370
So like at like 9:00 PM I'll just turn
it off and upset up until midnight when I

368
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:16,610
go to sleep, I'll just have my phone on
airplane mode. And then that way, um,

369
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,830
I'm just, you know, in my bubble in
my zone and I found that, that, that,

370
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:25,060
that was healthy for me. Um, and
also it's good for sleep as well. So,

371
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,380
and I actually,

372
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,500
I don't turn my phone off of airplane
mode until I get back to the spy coworking

373
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:34,390
space. I don't turn it so, so, so that's
like a, uh, a work flow. So yeah, exactly.

374
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:37,600
Work Smarter, not harder and
that, that definitely has helped.

375
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,053
Uh,

376
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,290
let's see what else we got.

377
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,170
I'm going to do this for nine more
minutes. I want a 30 minute live,

378
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,240
live stream Q and a.

379
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,323
Uh,

380
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,010
I don't have another phone that my
mom can call me on. No, no. So, so,

381
00:21:57,011 --> 00:22:00,530
so there is some cons so there
could be an emergency. Um,

382
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,490
but uh, yeah, I might have to
work on something like that.

383
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,370
What is better for Mohammed asks,

384
00:22:07,371 --> 00:22:12,230
what is better for a better future
ml or block chain machine learning?

385
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:16,250
Listen, guys, blockchains grit.
It's an amazing technology. Um,

386
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,890
I talk about it a lot. I wrote a book
on it. I'd go to events about it,

387
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,990
but really it's just a tool.

388
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:23,810
It's like the skeleton of the brain
and the brain is machine learning.

389
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,280
Ai Is the truth and the light
is the answer. It is the,

390
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:31,910
it is the end goal and everything
else is a distraction. Okay.

391
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,610
Everything else is a distraction.
And you might be thinking, well,

392
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:36,650
you know blockchain's hot
and yes it is and yet,

393
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:39,890
well I can make a lot more money doing
block chain. It's actually about the same.

394
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,300
But let me tell you this,

395
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:48,620
AI is not going to die anytime soon.
Okay. Because think about it, you know,

396
00:22:48,621 --> 00:22:51,110
a lot of people are saying, oh
well the, the hype might be dying.

397
00:22:51,111 --> 00:22:53,870
It might be going up. You know, who
knows? It's just a bubble we're in.

398
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,680
There are so many industries that these
people had not even begun to think about

399
00:23:00,471 --> 00:23:03,650
how AI can be applied to their
business use cases. Okay.

400
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,600
Agriculture supply chain, every
single industry, entertainment,

401
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:12,320
anything. So the, the problem
right now is a, is a, is a,

402
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:17,120
is a problem of application. The
technology exists. Not Enough people are,

403
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,460
have the technical knowhow to apply it
to these business use cases. So that's,

404
00:23:22,461 --> 00:23:27,280
that's a real problem. Uh, next new asks,

405
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:31,030
are you Muslim? No, I
am not religious at all.

406
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,960
Although the closest thing to religion
would be, Hey, I, I'm also not Hindu,

407
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,830
although my parents are. Um,
Anthony, I love you too. A moron.

408
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:44,410
Husks. You're white hair is real.
No, it's not. I dyed it, uh, it,

409
00:23:44,411 --> 00:23:49,010
but it is definitely a part of my logo.
G Magliochetti a beautiful Italian name.

410
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:52,670
I've actually been reading the Godfather
and by the way, amazing book. I mean,

411
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,110
I saw the movie like a decade ago,

412
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:57,370
but I've been reading it and cooking a
lot of Italian. I was recently in, um,

413
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,310
near Italy. I was near Halloween. I love
the Mediterranean. Such a beautiful,

414
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,720
beautiful culture, a beautiful
food. Um, and uh, yeah.

415
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:07,710
Okay.

416
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:12,510
Uh, all the Indians are going crazy. No,
it's all good guys. Listen, um, you know,

417
00:24:12,511 --> 00:24:14,670
I'm American. I'm Indian. I'm both,

418
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,910
most of the kind of European guy lived
in Europe for your, I'm, I'm global.

419
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,590
I'm beyond that. I'm beyond all
that. Anyway. What was I saying? Um,

420
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,200
I will come back to India
though, by the way. You know,
I, I'm coming back, not back,

421
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:33,940
but like I visited, um, I was born in
the states anyway. World Baby. Exactly.

422
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:38,730
It's all, it's all good.
You know, White, black,

423
00:24:38,731 --> 00:24:43,050
Brown, Puerto Rican or Asian. It don't
matter who you are. We want AI nation.

424
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,970
You hear what I said? Wasn't that a sick
rap? I just made that right now. Um,

425
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,980
can sensitive data. So city
casks, can sensitive data

426
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,700
be secure on the blockchain?
Um, yes. Well No. Okay, well,

427
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,270
yes you can put data
encrypted on the blockchain,

428
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,110
but the better thing to do would be 2.2.
It's on the blockchain.

429
00:25:06,111 --> 00:25:11,111
So story in an encrypted
way in some decentralized
stories like IPFS store j Sia

430
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,540
and it points to that Hash in blockchain.

431
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:19,220
So well he would actually push to
the blockchain is your, um, is the,

432
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,610
is the content address. Um, Marco asks,

433
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,790
how important are social
skills for programmers,

434
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,360
social skills for programmers who are
employed at a company they can be useful

435
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,240
for dealing with the bureaucracy
and getting your ideas out there.

436
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:39,830
Social skills for freelance
programmers are supremely useful.

437
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:43,220
You guys have no idea. You are
constantly doing business development,

438
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,190
getting clients,
convincing them to let you work for them,

439
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:50,480
convincing them to let you have access
to their sensitive data that you want to

440
00:25:50,481 --> 00:25:52,820
train their models on.
You have to build a brand.

441
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:55,010
Social skills are so
important in this week.

442
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:59,480
I had three videos coming out on this so
I know how much you guys need this and

443
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:02,930
want this and I've been listening. I had
been listening, okay, I am listening.

444
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:06,710
I am yours. Okay? I belong
to you guys. I am your slave.

445
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,730
I will do whatever you guys need me
to do. You know, but no one else,

446
00:26:10,731 --> 00:26:15,650
you guys know company owns me, but
my community does own me. Google TPU.

447
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:19,250
What do you think? Amazing technology.
They actually go with Google cloud.

448
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:21,920
They made this democratize
and accessible to everybody.

449
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,820
So I would definitely check out tps.

450
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:26,830
Okay.

451
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:31,150
Um, is tendermint production
ready? COSMO's production ready?

452
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:35,320
It is production ready. Let me, let me
be clear. Is it production ready? Yes.

453
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:40,180
Is it ready to scale to
Facebook level ready? No. Okay.
So it's like halfway there,

454
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:44,970
but I know engineers working on the
team and they say by the end of the year

455
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,900
that it will be something that is like
that. Should you start building? Yes.

456
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,300
Should you wait for it to
be production ready? No.

457
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,400
Does this apply to every technology?
Yes.

458
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,540
You shouldn't be waiting for anything in
the blockchain or AI space to be ready

459
00:26:57,541 --> 00:27:02,010
in terms of, let's just be real ready in
terms of blockchain meets scalable. Okay.

460
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,240
Ready? In terms of blockchain means scale.
This is a beef jerky by the way. Oh,

461
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:08,010
it's some good stuff.
I love beef Jerky,

462
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,850
which is okay as k husks
say something in Hindi. MMM.

463
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,553
MMM.

464
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,163
Okay.

465
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,520
Um, what's it like a Bollywood
Song? A through j day. God,

466
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,480
I know. It's very cliche. So that's
doesn't mean be for you guys.

467
00:27:23,481 --> 00:27:26,440
I can also speak other languages
as well. Right? This is not how,

468
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,630
I don't have to just show love to Indians,
which I love too,

469
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:34,260
but there's other people out there, right?
So say something in Dutch. Um, uh, so

470
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,130
pull hot debt, uh, and
uh, of course ls and uh,

471
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,360
okay.

472
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,840
Yeah, real common in
natal. Okay. That's it.

473
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,110
I really didn't have a hard time
learning Dutch by the way when I lived in

474
00:27:48,111 --> 00:27:50,360
Amsterdam,
but I'm back in San Francisco.

475
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,330
How does start with movidius
guys have a great video.

476
00:27:53,331 --> 00:27:56,540
Obviously you know about this. Um, but
they have some great documentation.

477
00:27:56,541 --> 00:28:00,020
So check out their website,
search to developer.mobidius.com

478
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,940
Depok says, please say Depok. So I'll
say, do you park three times for you?

479
00:28:04,941 --> 00:28:05,950
Deep Party Party,
party?

480
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,790
What Texas universities you
considered excellent rep, reputable.

481
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:13,820
So my sister actually goes to
University of Texas, Austin.

482
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,420
She's actually getting a lot of people
talking to, are asking to come to me,

483
00:28:17,421 --> 00:28:18,530
which is crazy because,

484
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,933
mmm.

485
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:25,160
Yeah. The things about being influential
people will reach out to your family.

486
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,590
Um, I say UTS. Cool. You know,

487
00:28:27,591 --> 00:28:30,950
I never want it to go there because I
preferred Columbia and I needed to get out

488
00:28:30,951 --> 00:28:35,720
of Texas asap. But um, in
terms of the best school in
Texas, it would be ut Austin.

489
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,310
If I had to go,
I'd go to ut Austin.

490
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,140
Best Linux distro is bound to the best.
Um,

491
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,310
winning sister was going to be the one
with the most developer activity and that

492
00:28:46,311 --> 00:28:48,890
actually applies to a lot of technologies.
Like for example,

493
00:28:48,891 --> 00:28:52,340
machine learning frameworks. What is the
one with the most developer activity?

494
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,243
Tensorflow,

495
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,420
what's the second most Pi torch and
what are the two best in that order?

496
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:00,380
Not Coincidentally tensorflow
and Pi Torch. Two minutes
left in this livestream.

497
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,140
Okay.

498
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,570
Alvaro Asks Best University in Florida.

499
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,070
Okay.

500
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,903
USF

501
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,700
[inaudible] what did you do in high school
to pursue AI? I'll tell you right now,

502
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,920
zero what did I do in terms of technology?

503
00:29:17,921 --> 00:29:20,380
In high school I was kind
of a black hat hacker.

504
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,340
I was like a 16 year old kid who got a
desktop PC and thought all those hackers

505
00:29:24,341 --> 00:29:28,120
were cool or like breaking into systems
and like, you know, defacing forums.

506
00:29:28,121 --> 00:29:32,050
It's very embarrassing for me to admit
now as an adult and you know more than a

507
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:34,960
decade later. But as a kid I would
like, I was a city script kitty.

508
00:29:34,961 --> 00:29:37,000
I was just like find perl
scripts and like run them.

509
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,680
But that was like my first foray
into the old technology space space.

510
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,480
I would also mod halo two.

511
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:46,870
So I would like to hack into halo two and
like online games in general were very

512
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:49,360
fun for me to act.
So I would say gaming is a good,

513
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:53,770
I wouldn't say do anything bad, but
just kind of like gaming is a good way.

514
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:58,180
Fortnights is apparently very popular
these days. One Love was mine. Um,

515
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,440
so I would recommend looking to combining
fortnight and machine learning in some

516
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:04,540
way. And if you don't do it, I
definitely went with the video.

517
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,670
I might be talking very fast,

518
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:09,670
but that's because I'm just very
excited to see all the Marcos.

519
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:14,140
It's good to see you, man, love you. And
a lot of cool people in here. Wow. It did.

520
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:17,350
She has any error for touche. I'm
gonna say five. I'm going to, okay,

521
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:20,410
I'm going to answer one more question
and say five more names and then with the

522
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:24,700
wrap and amount. Okay. So the question is,

523
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,613
yeah.

524
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:27,743
Oh,
great question.

525
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,000
How long should I take to
learn reinforcement learning
given one is comfortable

526
00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:34,840
with deep learning.
So got,

527
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:39,750
so reinforcement learning is actually
to me horror than deep learning.

528
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,100
Reinforcement learning is very hard.
Um,

529
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,580
and I did a course on this and
you search reinforcement learning,

530
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,620
Raj with innovations.
It's a great course.

531
00:30:46,621 --> 00:30:48,900
It's on youtube in the form of a playlist.

532
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,860
But I would say that the hottest field
right now in machine learning and deep

533
00:30:52,861 --> 00:30:57,440
learning is reinforcement learning.
Alphago, um, you know, the open AI five,

534
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,180
all the hottest advancements are
coming out from reinforcement learning.

535
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:05,190
How much time should you
spend on it should you spend
on it? I would say if you,

536
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,470
if you're familiar with deep learning,
that two months,

537
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,290
two months is a good amount of time.
Lastly,

538
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:15,270
a five names I'm going to mention just
randomly Mario, uh, with zeal Paul,

539
00:31:15,271 --> 00:31:18,420
Call Hoon Chan, Wu Park, Sean Hansen,

540
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:22,620
and of course rich Paul Riddick
part. Okay, so, and lastly,

541
00:31:22,621 --> 00:31:25,740
I'm going to wrap a little bit to
say it. Just say a, a freestyle rap.

542
00:31:25,741 --> 00:31:28,110
So just stay a topic. I'll
pick one and go at it. Okay.

543
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:29,540
Okay.

544
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:34,490
Just say a topic, one word, one word
topic, and that freestyle rap comes out.

545
00:31:34,491 --> 00:31:37,940
Hopefully it's machine
learning or AI related. Ready?

546
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,323
Uh,

547
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,443
okay.

548
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:51,650
Hey, I like to use a GPU. I do
it every day. I don't use a TPU.

549
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,600
I do it cause I see you in the
thought in my digit, in my destiny.

550
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:01,640
I see you in my mind. Can't you see I'm
back. I'm in San Francisco. I got it all.

551
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,070
I'm like a Frisco.
I'm frisky.

552
00:32:04,071 --> 00:32:08,180
I do things this way and that do
livestreams and go back to probabilistic

553
00:32:08,181 --> 00:32:08,751
programming,

554
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:13,730
stochastic models and other things
like backpropagation. All right.

555
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:18,670
That's it. All right. Dank.
Right. All right guys, uh,
thanks for showing up. I'm, I,

556
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:23,120
I'm going to start the live streams better
quality next week. Starting next week,

557
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:27,380
every single week. Um,
uh, love you guys. Uh,

558
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:30,380
you are the reason that I do this.
And by the way,

559
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:33,980
if there is some way you want to repay
me for all the work that I've been doing

560
00:32:33,981 --> 00:32:36,170
with the videos, there's
only one thing. Okay?

561
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:41,030
I want you to teach other AI,
teach your friends AI,

562
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:45,620
make a blog post about AI. Speak
at a conference. Um, teach ar.

563
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,461
Don't just learn a,

564
