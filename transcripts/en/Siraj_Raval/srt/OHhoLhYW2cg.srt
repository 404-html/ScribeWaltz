00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,690
Hello world,

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,310
it's Saroj and I'm going to show you
how to ace any data science interview in

3
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:08,100
five steps. If you're new here, welcome,

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,790
subscribe to stay updated on
my latest technology videos,

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,510
I've now been on both ends
of the hiring pipeline.

6
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:17,520
I've gotten lots of rejections,

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,670
I've gotten offers and I've hired people
that data science interviewing game is

8
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:23,970
not easy.

9
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:28,740
You sit across the table from someone
who has the power to grant you income and

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,160
a measure of security.
You have to make them like you,

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,450
trust you and think you're smart.
That can be kind of scary,

12
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:41,451
but luckily it's been proven that with
dedicated practice you can master this

13
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:45,750
field. The top data scientists
in the world are made not born.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,440
So let's start with the first step.
Figure out what you want.

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,680
Getting a data science
job is a huge life change,

16
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:56,760
so it's important to ask yourself
why you want to be in this field.

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,860
Take some time to be
introspective, meaning deeply
reflect on your own thoughts,

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,550
feelings,
and sensations in order to gain insights.

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,310
It's a rare quality in
our fast paced society,

20
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:12,690
but it allows you to keep focused on
the bigger picture and clearly define

21
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:14,850
happiness on your own terms.

22
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:20,290
Happiness is a warm GPU also followed
popular investors to gain insights on

23
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:24,210
industry trends.

24
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,130
It's literally their job to figure out
how technology is transforming different

25
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,560
industries and the opportunities in them.

26
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,780
Venture capital firms like Andreessen
Horowitz have their own podcasts where

27
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:40,050
they talk about the future
in terms of economic trends.

28
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,010
Find top angel investors and
vcs on Twitter and follow them.

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,360
Their insights can inspire you and I've
got a curated list for you that I'll

30
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:53,010
link to in the video description along
with any other resources I'll mention

31
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:53,844
later on.

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,290
There are so many different
data science roles out there.

33
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,700
Every company seems to have their own
requirements and definitions for the

34
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:04,140
positions they're hiring for,

35
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:08,670
so it's hard to get a
general understanding of how
they're different and have

36
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,140
the skills they require.

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Use Google's job search feature to read
through the various job descriptions in

38
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:20,070
each field to get more familiar with the
type of role you'd find most rewarding.

39
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,690
Listen to day in the life interviews with
data scientists on podcasts like data

40
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:25,524
stories.

41
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,270
You can use all of these data points to
help you build a five year career plan.

42
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,740
Having a longer term plan will help
you feel more confident, motivated,

43
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:38,340
and give you insight into what
skills you'll need to learn,

44
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,870
which brings us to step two,
create and execute a study plan.

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,970
Once you know what you want to do with
data science and why you need to ensure

46
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:52,971
your skill set is up to date data science
professionals need a wide range of

47
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:58,050
skills including knowledge of statistics,
the linear Algebra,

48
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,110
programming, databases and
communication. Luckily for you,

49
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:06,820
I just released a video that details a
free three month curriculum meant to help

50
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:11,821
you go from absolute beginner
to proficient in data
science in three months.

51
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,720
I also want to give a special
shoutout to Chromebook data science.

52
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,490
It's a collection of 12 courses offered
by John Hopkins University at you can

53
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:26,491
take for free to help people
with no background and
limited resources transition

54
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,780
into data science and one more open
source society university has a detailed

55
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:36,760
path to a free self taught education in
data science that's listed in the form

56
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:40,270
of a good hub. Read me that you
should definitely check out as well.

57
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:44,230
It's very comprehensive.
Once you've consumed these free resources,

58
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:49,231
you'll want to practice actual technical
interviews using interviewing.io.

59
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,930
Anyone can practice a technical interview
anonymously with real hiring managers

60
00:03:55,841 --> 00:04:00,841
at places like Google and Microsoft for
free practice makes perfect and you even

61
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:02,680
get feedback as well.

62
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,850
Flashcards are another great
tool to help you learn faster.

63
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:11,530
It's important to retain all of the
technical terms like classification and

64
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,150
principal component analysis as you'll be
asked about them during your interview.

65
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,500
Brainscape has several existing free
flashcards for a wide variety of data

66
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:23,770
science subjects.
Make reciting these definitions.

67
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,090
Second nature to you like riding
a bike or skipping you to me ads.

68
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:33,100
You want to get into the mind of an
interviewer. Put yourself in their shoes.

69
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,250
What kind of questions
would you ask candidates?

70
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,380
Write down those questions.

71
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,910
This thought experiment will help you
better relate to your interviewers and

72
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:46,180
become a better interviewee as well.
In total,

73
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:51,181
this entire study plan should take between
three to five months and learning all

74
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:53,680
of this on your own.
We'll do a lot for you,

75
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:58,390
but having an experienced mentor to help
guide you during this journey would be

76
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:00,430
incredibly valuable as well.

77
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,930
Look through your existing social
network and see if you know anyone who's

78
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,090
worked in a data science role.

79
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,560
Reach out to them and see if they
would be willing to help you along your

80
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,230
journey with any questions you might have.

81
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,950
If you frame it as a two way
learning session meeting,

82
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:22,600
you're offering them something as well,
you'll have much better results. Also,

83
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,790
sharpest minds is a dope resource.

84
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:29,350
They'll provide you with a data science
mentor that's free upfront and the way

85
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:34,351
you pay them back is by giving them
five to 10% of your first year's income.

86
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,290
If you land a job companies,
especially in Silicon Valley,

87
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:43,090
we'll post a job online and get 500 to
a thousand applications in the first

88
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:46,660
couple of days. It's hard to
get prioritized in this queue.

89
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:51,661
So ideally you want them to reach out
to you and the best way to do that is to

90
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:53,710
build your portfolio.

91
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:58,340
That means first having an amazing resume
and I've got a great video on that for

92
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,090
you.

93
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,620
It's important to have not one but at
least three different types of resumes

94
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,490
each tailored to the different
types of positions you like.

95
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,780
Perhaps one is more suited for a
data science position in finance,

96
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,540
showcasing finance
keywords like time series,

97
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,940
forecasting and sentiment analysis,

98
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,360
while another is more suited
for a position in medicine,

99
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:24,170
highlighting your image
classification skills. Additionally,

100
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:29,171
have a well crafted personal website
that showcases your past projects and any

101
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,940
relevant education or work history.

102
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,230
Think of your personal website like a
more visually appealing version of your

103
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:39,050
resume.
Link to all of your social channels,

104
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:44,170
aggregate everything about you onto it
and of course keep your get hub profile,

105
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,900
the new resume up to date
with at least three projects.

106
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,240
All of them should be well documented,

107
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,510
have at least one project
with a web presence.

108
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,930
You want this project to be
easily accessible to anyone.

109
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,460
If they can try out your Twitter
sentiment classifier themselves,

110
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,710
there'll be much more likely to hire you.

111
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,280
Create educational content
around data science as well,

112
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:09,890
be at blogs or even get up to [inaudible].

113
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,550
This will build your following
and bring you more opportunities.

114
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,940
Once you've studied and
position your brand well,

115
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,620
it's time to start pitching for
potential jobs. Use Angel List.

116
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,530
Ask Your friends on
social media who's hiring.

117
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,210
Connect with venture capital firms to
see if any of their newer portfolio

118
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:33,260
members are hiring.
A packer news has a hiring thread.

119
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,730
Find interesting industries that don't
have as much of a data science presence

120
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:42,380
like agriculture or manufacturing
and find jobs in that sector.

121
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,210
Put in the hard creative work to find
positions other candidates aren't thinking

122
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:51,230
about. Add all of these companies
to an excel spreadsheet.

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,740
It's important to keep track
of where you're applying to.

124
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,450
You need to stay organized.
If you're talking to 30 or 40 companies,

125
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,210
you shouldn't keep track
of them using MS paint.

126
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,730
It should be in a spreadsheet rate.

127
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,840
Each of these companies based on your
interest level, take any notes on them,

128
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,300
their URL and their job posting.

129
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,540
Keep track of your progress at each stage
of the interview process including the

130
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:21,830
pitch, the phone screen, the coding
challenge, and the onsite interviews.

131
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,750
Each of these companies have a gatekeeper,

132
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:28,751
usually the technical recruiter you need
to win over the recruiter to get to the

133
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:33,950
phone screen. The best way to source
these technical recruiters is linkedin.

134
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,900
You can easily find recruiters on
linkedin for a specific position using a

135
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:40,880
little bit of Google keyword magic,

136
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,560
contacting technical recruiters directly
rather than cold emailing a company's

137
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,310
default job's email. We'll give
you a much better response rate.

138
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,280
You want to stand out
so when you pitch them,

139
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,470
they'll probably give your
email 10 seconds of attention.

140
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,640
So make sure to have a quick intro that
sells yourself impressively in a few

141
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:02,820
sentences. Name, background,

142
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,390
easily digestible project and
an interest to learn more.

143
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,980
Make it easy for them.

144
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,150
I use Calendly to let people schedule
meetings with me at a given time.

145
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:16,260
I found it cuts down the logistics
to schedule things by a lot,

146
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,110
so include that in your pitch.
Also,

147
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,200
one way to really stand out is to do a
data science project for a company that

148
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:28,530
solves a problem for them without
even being asked to do so.

149
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,120
It is of course a risky time investment,

150
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:35,550
so I'd recommend only doing this for the
three positions that interest you the

151
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:39,210
most. Once you've got your
first phone screen scheduled,

152
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,160
it's time for the last step,

153
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,200
the interview process you can find and
practice company specific interview

154
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:51,201
questions on glass store before your
interviews to brush up on their specific

155
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,000
hiring process.
Generally,

156
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:58,830
the data science job interview
involves three different steps. First,

157
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,660
the phone screen with a recruiter or
someone from HR or a hiring manager.

158
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,930
This is a way for them to get to know you,
your background,

159
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:09,090
and it's a way for you
to get to know them,

160
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,420
their culture and why they'd
be a good fit for you.

161
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,760
Next is the coding challenge.

162
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:19,290
It could be either take home or a live
coding challenge where an interviewer

163
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,550
watches you code either on a
whiteboard or on a computer screen.

164
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,130
The language is usually your choice,

165
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:30,840
but expect to code in python or
SQL or both. If it's in Mat lab,

166
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:31,950
just walk out.
Just kidding.

167
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:36,870
A company will sometimes
give you a version of their
Dataset to solve a problem,

168
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,850
meaning they could ask you to find out
features that led to increased viewership

169
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,910
and show them the code for
how you made those insights.

170
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,800
Live coding challenges can last up to
two hours while take home assignments can

171
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:53,640
last up to 48 hours.
Once you've passed both of these,

172
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:55,890
it's time for the onsite interview.

173
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,540
Usually this is with the team lead and
it consists of a mix of technical and

174
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,980
behavioral questions.

175
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,790
Expect questions that range the full
stack from the difference between

176
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,130
supervised and unsupervised learning.

177
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:13,310
Two types of sequel queries to use to
business scenario problems to logic based

178
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:18,591
questions and expect several rounds
with a wide variety of people including

179
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:22,290
people from sales,
marketing and product development.

180
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,270
This could take a full day.

181
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,480
If you get a question that
you don't know the answer to,

182
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,020
you can still get points for
knowing the nature of the problem.

183
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,010
You can say something like,
I'm not sure the best way to solve this,

184
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:40,011
but let me write out some ideas that
I have and ways I could go about doing

185
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:40,890
this.

186
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:45,870
This way they can watch your thought
process if you've seen the problem before,

187
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,040
you can just say, I seen it before and
they'll pass on to the next problem.

188
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,190
Companies are looking to hire
talented data scientists,

189
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,930
also people they enjoy working with.

190
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,700
They want to see that you have
legitimate curiosity around data science,

191
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,440
that you're passionate about,

192
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:07,120
the problem they are trying to solve
and that you're able to communicate your

193
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:11,080
thought process. Even though data
science uses statistics and coding,

194
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,100
it's more than that.

195
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,510
You have to get people to buy into what
you're doing and why you're doing it.

196
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:21,070
By communicating to both technical
and nontechnical audiences.

197
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,060
That's a crucial skill to have.
They are investing in you financially,

198
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,540
emotionally, and psychologically.
If you want an edge,

199
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,140
research your interviewer beforehand,
find out their interests,

200
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,000
understand their background,

201
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:38,770
then mention something that's a genuine
mutual interest for both of you during

202
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:39,500
the interview.

203
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,030
It'll increase their sentiment
towards you and after each interview,

204
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:45,940
definitely follow up with
a thank you note. Remember,

205
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:49,420
make everyone's job easier.
One last point.

206
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,670
It's okay to get rejections.

207
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,570
It's easy to internalize your performance
in these interviews as an overall

208
00:12:55,571 --> 00:13:00,190
reflection in your abilities as a data
scientist and even as your worth as a

209
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:03,670
human.
Don't take any rejection personally,

210
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:06,310
but instead as feedback
along your journey,

211
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,160
if you keep the larger
picture in perspective,

212
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,990
by having a longterm plan and being
dedicated to mastering this craft,

213
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,560
you'll eventually find your place.
I'm here for you.

214
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:21,490
We are here for you.
Your success is our success.

215
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,070
So keep your head up and
if you do land a job,

216
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,690
share it with me on social media using
these school of Ai Careers Hashtag so I

217
