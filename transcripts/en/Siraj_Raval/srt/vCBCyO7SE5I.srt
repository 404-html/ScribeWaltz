00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,940
Hello world at Saroj.
Let's go through three dots.

2
00:00:02,941 --> 00:00:06,880
You have to see the first example is
an Israeli startup called the zoos.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,390
Zoos Zuzu,
the decentralized version of Uber.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,340
Uber is a centralized right sharing it.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,660
That means all data requests and decisions
go through a central server owned by

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,350
Uber.

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,800
Uber decides how much drivers get paid
and can see where your writing is going

8
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:20,940
whenever they want to.

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,810
Let's do this decentralized because it's
owned by the community instead of a few

10
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:26,640
people who own a giant server,

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,060
the APP uses its own internal
currency called Zeus Tokens.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,310
These tokens are
cryptocurrency like Bitcoin,

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,970
except there are no minors maintaining
the network with computing power,

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,030
so no proof of work algorithm.
Instead,

15
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,760
the miners are drivers who maintain a
network with the amount of miles they

16
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,710
driven. They get rewarded with zoos
tokens based on how much they drive.

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,380
It's an algorithm called
proof of movement.

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,530
Writers pay the drivers with
the same tokens for rods.

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,270
So how does everyone get tokens?

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,620
Will Zeus has something
called the crowdsale a crowd
sale and adapt this kind of

21
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:00,270
like an IPO on day one.

22
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,260
The creators of the DAP decide how many
tokens they want to create and then sell

23
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:06,210
them at some initially decided price.

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,960
These tokens act as both currency
in the APP as well as equity.

25
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,760
Since you are an early adopter,

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,690
you should be rewarded for being
one of the first to use the deck.

27
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,630
The more valuable that that becomes,
the more valuable the tokens becomes.

28
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,140
So you can trade tokens for Fiat currency
to spend on other things if you'd like.

29
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,840
Since the APP is peer to peer,

30
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,160
that means data moves from phone to
phone with no server intermediary and the

31
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:30,420
APP is open source.

32
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,720
So if you want to develop for it or set
up a team of developers and contribute,

33
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,703
you can do that.

34
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,590
You can post it proposal for how
much you'd like to get paid as well.

35
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,030
Same for designers or marketers. The
community decides on fund to allocation.

36
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,240
There are different ways to reach
consensus and these are being experimented

37
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:46,074
with currently,

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,800
but overall it's a more democratic system
where the people who use the APP get

39
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:53,220
to participate in how
the APP itself is run.

40
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,330
The founders created a legal corporation
and the bylaws require that the obey

41
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:00,480
the will of the community's books so it
looks like it's already off to a good

42
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:03,620
start.
The second example is called open bazaar.

43
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,420
Open bazaar is a decentralized Ebay.
Ebay decide what you can.

44
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:11,550
Account cell takes a half d cut of all
transactions and you have to be in a

45
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:13,770
country that allows Ebay to use bit.

46
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,640
Openbazaar has a platform that lets buyers
and sellers connects directly to the

47
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:21,390
seller of goods without involving with
third party to hope to data and charge a

48
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,224
transaction fee.

49
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,830
The craters really wanted to build on
the idea of creating a truly free trade

50
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:27,000
platform.
I mean,

51
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:30,090
they're never really has been anything
like the bizarre is the pass on the

52
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:30,740
Internet.

53
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,350
Bizarre is where peer to peer marketplaces
where buyers and sellers could

54
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,430
interact directly with one another
without any middlemen in between gable to

55
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:41,700
observe the transaction.
Openbazaar doesn't have its own token,

56
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,560
but it doesn't use bitcoin for payments.

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,000
They've got some dope algorithms to solve
some interesting problems. For example,

58
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,830
when it comes to the issue of identity,

59
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,740
they use an algorithm called proof of
burn to ensure that a seller can create a

60
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:56,340
million stores to avoid bad reputation.

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,130
Proof of burn means that every
time a user opens a store,

62
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,870
they have to spend some
bitcoins that disappear or burn,

63
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,210
so it's really expensive
to make multiple stores.

64
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,390
The APP is also open source
so anyone can contribute,

65
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,830
but if they want to get a team of
people to continually maintain the apple

66
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,570
quality, unlike a lot of
other open source projects,

67
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,600
they should issue an internal
Tolkien eventually pretend.

68
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,400
The third example is scenario scenario.
He's a decentralized social networks.

69
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,420
This has been tried a few times before
and failed. I'm looking at you diaspora.

70
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,080
It always fails because the technology
was never there and it's been a security

71
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:31,300
nightmare to keep user data secure,

72
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,230
but I think scenario has a good shot
at making us valuable social networks.

73
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,630
It uses its own currency called the amp.

74
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,390
In traditional social networks
like Facebook and Twitter.

75
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,660
The middlemen gets all the money
for your data from advertisers,

76
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,930
but since there is no middleman,
since the APP is peer to peer,

77
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,150
if someone wants to pay
for your data or attention,

78
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,070
they'll pay you directly with amps.

79
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,730
All users get a reputation score based
on how many people like the content they

80
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:58,690
post. The higher the reputation,
the more valuable your content is.

81
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,430
The 10th and network is pure appear.

82
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,360
No one can shut it down like the Chinese
government did to Facebook and you own

83
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:08,140
your data. No one had Facebook can peer
into your private messages to friends.

84
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,960
Since your data is stored locally
instead of Fanta a service,

85
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:13,510
those are the few I could find
that I thought were pretty cool.

86
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,270
That's where the future
of software open source,

87
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,300
democratic and fair
compensation for all users.

88
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,750
There are more out there and many,
many more to be created in the future.
