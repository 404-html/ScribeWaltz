1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,230
Hey Joe, what's up? Hey, how
are you doing sir? Pretty good.

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:07,620
How are you doing all right. Are you
down to answer a couple of questions?

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,660
You want to walk the talk?
Yeah, let's do it. Cool.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,670
What project are you currently working on?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,070
Working on image compression
using neural nets.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,100
Why do you think deep learning
has gotten so popular recently?

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,610
Other than it obviously doing
really well in a lot of problems.

8
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:24,000
I think it also gives people
with a technical skill set
a chance to think about

9
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:28,130
like big questions, like consciousness
or things like that. Hey Joe,

10
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:30,460
what's your favorite operating [inaudible]

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,550
favorite thing about working at Google?
Um,

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,840
I would say all the smart
people and it's pretty flexible.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,450
How would you describe your
experience at Princeton?

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,850
A hard and formative. If you could
spend an evening with one famous person,

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,300
who would it be? I feel like John Stewart
would be hilarious to hang out with.

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,510
Do you play any sports? Uh, I
used to do a lot of rock climbing,

17
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:56,100
but not so much since I
moved to the bay area.

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,510
What time do you go to sleep at night?
What's your favorite car?

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,030
My motorcycle Honda to 50
CVR. What machine learning
model would you never use?

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,970
That is a trick question. I would
use any model that gets the job done.

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,660
Programming language of choice
for machine learning. Tensor flow.

22
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:17,190
So c plus plus and python. Favorite
professor, Robert Chaperia,

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,880
name one person you really admire?
Uh,

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,920
I would say any of my friends who moved
to a foreign country without speaking

25
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:25,440
the language. How are you
liking the bay area? I love it.

26
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:28,290
Favorite place I've lived by far.
What drives you to do research?

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,420
I think it's in that golden sweet spot
for me of hard enough so that I feel like

28
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:35,910
I'm growing but not so hard that I
cried myself to sleep every night.

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,720
Was there ever a class in college
you really didn't like? Um,

30
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,630
I would say, uh, yeah. I'm not sure.

31
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,080
What's the most beautiful thing in the
world? Uh, your smile of course. Ash. Uh,

32
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,530
what's your favorite exercise?

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,460
I've been working on the clean and jerk
these days. Favorite food? Who? Dawn.

34
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,910
Definitely. Do you miss the east
coast? Not, not really at all.

35
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,140
What website do you waste time on? I
like the only person I know that doesn't,

36
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,180
I don't really waste that
much time on websites.

37
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:08,370
I think the last person you emailed,
uh,

38
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:10,980
I just emailed my team about
setting up a reading group.

39
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,790
You get an all expenses paid trip
to one city. Where do you go?

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,590
I really want to go to one of the mega
cities in Brazil. That would be great.

41
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,290
Would you visit Mars? Uh,
yeah, if they have wifi.

42
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,270
What is one thing you can't live without?
I guess I just learned it's Wifi.

43
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,780
What is the first thing you do when
you wake up? Hit the snooze button.

44
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,220
What texts editor do you use? Uh, I wish
I could say something like them or Emacs,

45
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:38,250
but I uh,
am using a Google internal tool.

46
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,050
What open source library do you really
like? I, again, I'm kind of biased,

47
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:46,110
but I would probably have
to say tensorflow. What's
one of your favorite movies?

48
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,070
The Matrix.
I don't watch that many movies.

49
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,560
What did something you do to
come up with research ideas?

50
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,530
I love talking to anybody and
everybody that will listen to me. Ah,

51
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,680
that's been pretty good for me. What
inspired you to get into machine learning?

52
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,840
It kinda just happened I think,
uh,

53
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:05,320
I moved out here and I guess a lot of the
problems that were in machine learning,

54
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:06,160
some really interesting to me.

55
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,430
What was the first program you ever made?

56
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,350
Probably either hello world or one of
those like four loop things that a certain

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,530
number of asterix.
What is one book you really like?

58
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,390
I really like Perdido street station.
What is one thing you are afraid of?

59
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,890
Um, not having a positive impact, I guess.

60
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,960
What is a big misconception about you?

61
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,980
I think I simulate an extrovert pretty
well, but I'm actually pretty introverted.

62
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,750
What is one thing that
excites you? Um, I really,

63
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:44,770
really love to travel and meet New People.
That's advice you've ever received?

64
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,730
Uh, it wasn't directly like
this, but it was something like,

65
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,940
even if somebody looks like they have
their shit together on the outside,

66
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,570
they probably have a lot of stuff going
on that you don't necessarily see.

67
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,940
What's the bravest thing you've ever done?

68
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,780
Probably moved to California
without having a job.

69
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,710
What is one piece of advice you'd
give yourself 10 years ago? Uh,

70
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,400
take care of yourself better. If you
were a rapper, which rapper would you be?

71
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,980
Probably Snoop Dogg because
of the physical resemblance.
Do you have any pets?

72
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,250
Um, I used to live with a dog,
but sadly I don't anymore.

73
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,970
What's something you've
learned in the past month? Um,

74
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,080
I just learned something about
generative adversarial networks.

75
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,920
What is a topic and machine
learning you like to explore more?

76
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,500
I really like to get into sequence
to sequence modeling a bit more.

77
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,640
Do you think will solve intelligence in
your lifetime? I don't think so actually.

78
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,700
So anytime somebody says it's something
can't be done, they're usually wrong.

79
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,520
But if somebody says that it's going
to take a certain amount of time,

80
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:49,790
usually it's like 10 x that if you are
in the world, what is one law unit? Uh,

81
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,680
I don't know. NAP time for everybody.
What is something you do to relax?

82
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,590
I read a lot of fiction.

83
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,340
I exercise and a wash Rukh Khan videos.

84
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,260
What is the risk that comes from
deep learning? I would say, uh,

85
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,540
maybe forgetting about all of the kinds
of machine learning that came before

86
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,360
that, uh, aren't necessarily
related to deep learning nowadays.

87
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:12,640
People want to just throw your own that
stuff and that's not always the right

88
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:16,700
answer. Who is one person you looked
up to when you were in college? Ooh,

89
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,900
I'm not sure. What were you
like as a kid in grade school?

90
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,760
I think I was kind of a jerk. What deep
learning library do you use the most? Uh,

91
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,030
not, not unbiased here,
but probably tensorflow.

92
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,440
Andrew on one said machine learning is
like the new electricity. Agree. Yeah,

93
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:34,450
I think that that sounds
pretty good. Uh, it's just,

94
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:38,230
it's amazing the way people are able
to use machine learning to do a large

95
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:40,360
number of different things.
If you were to start from scratch today,

96
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:43,000
what is one learning resource you
would use to learn machine learning?

97
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,420
If you're not afraid of doing math
and maybe Kevin Murphy's textbook, uh,

98
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,520
what is it a machine learning, a
probabilistic approach? If not, again,

99
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:52,420
I'm probably pretty biased,

100
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:54,580
but I think the tutorials on the
tensorflow website are pretty good.

101
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,740
What is one major unsolved research
problem you'd love to tackle?

102
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,850
I really want to figure out like a
generally better way of sampling the data

103
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:03,500
during training.
Then uniformly random.

104
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,040
What is the most surprising result
you've ever gotten from your research?

105
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,780
So my team published a paper a while ago
on our image compression work and it's

106
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:14,840
pretty amazing that we're able to
basically compete with state of the art

107
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:19,841
without doing anything like entropy
coding or a variable bit rate per patch.

108
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,120
What's more interesting? The brain or
the universe? Definitely the brand.

109
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,970
If you could be an x men character,
who would it be?

110
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,570
A wolverine so I could get the cool like
facial hair. What's your spirit animal?

111
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,050
A squirrel does p equal NP.

112
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,330
I don't have very strong
feelings on the matter.

113
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:37,190
I'll leave it to the suits
and Washington to decide.

114
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,630
Would you ever go to burning man?

115
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,600
I have gone to burning man
snapchat or Facebook, Facebook,

116
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,790
android or iPhone right now.
Android could go either way or go.

117
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,900
I use Google way more than I use duck,
duck go Linux distro of a two.

118
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,230
All right, Joel, that's
different. My 67 questions.

119
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:56,900
Thanks so much for answering those.
Absolutely. It's a pleasure. All right.

120
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:57,860
Have a good one.
See you around.
