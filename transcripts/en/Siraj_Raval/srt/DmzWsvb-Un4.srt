1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,920
Sir. How do we solve
this? Unleashed a quantum

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,730
hello world.
It's so Raj and quantum machine learning.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,620
It sounds like the final class in a
phd program doesn't it? In this video,

4
00:00:14,621 --> 00:00:19,210
I'll demonstrate a few examples of
how both quantum computing and machine

5
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:23,470
learning can be used together to
solve some really hard problems,

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,120
but before we go there,

7
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:29,560
we need to get more familiarized
with the field of quantum mechanics.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,540
This is the collection of scientific
laws that describe the behavior of

9
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:39,541
subatomic particles on
endlessly fascinating subject
that's been notoriously

10
00:00:39,611 --> 00:00:43,960
difficult to master and somewhat
controversial even for physicists.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,030
It all started in the 17th century when
scientists were trying to figure out the

12
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:53,020
properties of light and rocking
crazy facial hair. At first,

13
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:57,520
Isaac Newton thought that light
only consisted of tiny particles.

14
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,030
Christian Huygens thought
it was made up of waves,

15
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,920
but Newton became puzzled by the wave
like phenomena of light interference.

16
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:11,290
Interference is when two waves super
posed to form a resulting wave of greater,

17
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,240
lower or the same amplitude.

18
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,490
It turned out they were both right and
this resulted in the wave theory of light,

19
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,760
which states that light is both made up
of tiny particles and made up of waves

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,570
vibrating up and down perpendicular
to the direction that it travels.

21
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,670
I'm signed later discovered that these
tiny particles called photons consist of

22
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:38,530
energy inspired by this Niels Bohr
came up with a new model for an Adam,

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,290
the basic unit of all
matter in the universe.

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,450
His model stated that an atom contains
a small positively charged nucleus

25
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,520
surrounded by electrons that travel in
circular orbits around each other like a

26
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:52,420
solar system.

27
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,530
Each orbit has its own energy
level and changes to that energy,

28
00:01:56,531 --> 00:02:00,430
like the transition of an electron
from one orbit to another.

29
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,450
Around the nucleus of an atom
happens in discreet Quanta.

30
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,810
The phrase quantum leap refers to the
movement from one discrete energy level to

31
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:13,690
another. With no transition.
It's abrupt bore.

32
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:17,410
Realize that because the movement
of an electron was not progressive,

33
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,640
it just disappeared from one orbit
and appeared in the next orbit.

34
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,770
With no intermediary state,

35
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,480
the amount of energy at that level
couldn't be further subdivided.

36
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,580
That's why he called it Quanta, a
minimum quantity of energy. Clearly,

37
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:34,271
scientists,

38
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:38,890
we're beginning to figure out that the
rules of classical mechanics did not

39
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:43,150
apply at the subatomic level,
but it gets even more interesting.

40
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,940
Simulation confirmed.
Consider the question,

41
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:52,270
why does it an electron
have an intermediate state
physicist Lewis to Brawley

42
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,620
answered that question when he explained
that matter can exhibit both particle

43
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,250
and wave like nature,
just like light.

44
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,050
This wave like nature of
electrons requires them to
obtain certain wavelengths

45
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,910
which are allowed for them to fit in an
orbit and within that orbit electrons

46
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:11,320
can exist throughout,

47
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,070
not just in a single spot
because of its wavelike nature.

48
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,490
Other physicists were paying attention
to this and contributed more discoveries.

49
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,650
Heisenberg,
not the breaking bad one for example,

50
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,680
later proposed his uncertainty principle
which stated that the position and

51
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:33,760
velocity of a particle cannot both
be measured exactly at the same time,

52
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,893
even in theory.

53
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,350
He later helped develop the Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum mechanics,

54
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,460
which stated that a quantum particle
doesn't exist in one state or another.

55
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,540
Instead, it's an all of its
possible states simultaneously.

56
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,670
It's only when we observe this state that
a quantum particle is forced to choose

57
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:58,410
one probability and that's the
state we observe. That's right.

58
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,950
It stating that reality exists in
a certain way until we measure it.

59
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,750
It's reactive to conscious observation.
Pretty incredible stuff.

60
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,860
This states,

61
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,860
by the way of existing in all possible
states simultaneously is called

62
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,803
superposition.

63
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,310
The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
mechanics was theoretically proven by a

64
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,470
famous thought experiment
called Schrodinger's cat.

65
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,780
In this thought experiment of physicists
puts a cat in a box along with some

66
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:32,530
radioactive material and a
device for detecting radiation.

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,000
The is designed so that when it
senses the decay of the material,

68
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,110
it triggers a hammer which will
break a flask containing acid,

69
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,360
which will kill the cat evil Aaf,

70
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:48,361
but to eliminate any certainty about the
cat Speight the experiment takes place

71
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:53,380
within an hour long enough so some of
the radioactive material could decay,

72
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,220
but short enough so that it's
also possible none could.

73
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,440
While the cat is sealed in the box,
it comes to exist in an unknowable state.

74
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,880
It can't be observed,

75
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,110
so it instead exists in a super
imposed state of both life and death.

76
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,810
Until we open the box
and observed the cat,

77
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,430
it has half a probability of being dead
and half a probability of being alive.

78
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,230
The state of the cat is tied to its
situation and can be considered a form of

79
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:21,820
quantum entanglement.

80
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,240
This is a phenomenon by which the quantum
states of two or more objects can be

81
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:29,650
described in reference to each other.

82
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,460
You can't describe the state of
one without referencing the other,

83
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,830
and that same property applies even when
these particles are separated by any

84
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:40,060
amount of space.

85
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,960
Einstein called this spooky
action at a distance.

86
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,030
Clearly quantum mechanics is awesome
and there are a lot of different

87
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:50,620
interpretations of it.

88
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,750
Even though the Copenhagen
interpretation is the most popular Tldr,

89
00:05:55,751 --> 00:06:00,751
the laws of nature at the sub atomic level
or different than at any other level.

90
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,630
So how can we leverage this to
possibly solve some hard problems?

91
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,310
About 40 years ago.

92
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:11,930
The popular physicist Richard Fineman
propose that in order to be able to

93
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,870
simulate physics on a machine properly,

94
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,010
that includes the laws of both
classical and quantum mechanics,

95
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,320
we'd need to create a kind of quantum
computer, classical computers,

96
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:28,670
the ones we all use,
perform operations using classical bits,

97
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,570
which are represented as binary data.
Either a zero or a one,

98
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,400
but what if we could have a bit represent
both one and zero at the same time?

99
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,150
What happens then?
Well,

100
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:43,820
quantum mechanics tells us that this
kind of super position of both states is

101
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:46,460
indeed possible.
At the subatomic level.

102
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,450
The basic unit of a quantum
computer is called a cubit.

103
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:55,750
These cubits can be physically represented
by quantum particles that can occupy

104
00:06:56,151 --> 00:07:00,830
two states simultaneously.
We could use a photon or an electron,

105
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,510
and rather than having these cubits
interact, how classical bits do,

106
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,610
we can leverage the idea of quantum
entanglement to allow these cubits to

107
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:15,170
interact with each other in all
new interesting ways. Nowadays,

108
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:17,630
big technology companies like IBM,

109
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,550
Google and Microsoft as well as well
funded startups like we're dedi computing

110
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,700
are all racing to build these exotic
machines to see how we can use the quantum

111
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:31,280
concepts of super
position and entanglement,

112
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,410
the both speed up existing algorithms
and create entirely new classes of

113
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:37,244
algorithms.

114
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,240
This involves a lot of computer science
theory across a lot of different

115
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:45,950
subfields, but let's specifically talk
about its effect on machine learning.

116
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,020
Firstly, quantum devices can be
used to accelerate machine learning.

117
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,350
Current quantum technologies resemble
special purpose hardware like a six rather

118
00:07:56,871 --> 00:07:58,850
than the general purpose CPU.

119
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,500
There are hardwired to implement a
limited class of quantum algorithms.

120
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,770
More advanced quantum devices can be
programmed to run simple quantum circuits

121
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,470
just like FPGA.
Yes,

122
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,850
we know that both a six and f pgas offer
benefits in machine learning as well as

123
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,790
Gpu, CPU and tps. Therefore,

124
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:24,791
a quantum processor could theoretically
be added to this mix of specialized AI

125
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:30,011
hardware to help us advance towards Agi
by creating an entirely new field of

126
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:31,940
machine learning.

127
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,710
Similar to how GPU is contributed to the
deep learning renaissance that started

128
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:38,750
a couple years ago.
Interestingly,

129
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,780
it turns out that mathematical
optimization is an
important task in quantum

130
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:47,240
mechanics just like it
is in machine learning.

131
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,280
Physicists are interested in finding
the point of lowest energy in a high

132
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,170
dimensional energy landscape.
In fact,

133
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,200
one of the first tasks for
quantum computers orchestrated
by the company D-Wave

134
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,460
involved optimization.

135
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,870
There are quantum annealer was
used to solve classification tasks.

136
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,980
More recently,

137
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:12,981
the hybrid quantum classical technique
of variational circuits has been proposed

138
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,740
where a quantum device is used to evaluate
a hard to compute cost function while

139
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:24,120
a classical device performs an
optimization based on this information.

140
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,310
And what about those
massively parallelized matrix
multiplication operations

141
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:34,080
that neural networks required Gpu
for? Well, in quantum computing,

142
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,020
the bottleneck to doing
this is data in coding.

143
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,720
In order to use them for linear Algebra,

144
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,740
we have to first load the large
matrix onto the quantum device,

145
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,090
which is nontrivial,

146
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:50,330
but a quantum gate does execute a
multiplication of an exponentially large

147
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:53,130
matrix with a similarly large vector.

148
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,840
We could even think of a quantum gate
as a linear layer of a giant neural net

149
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,830
and exciting insight that could
lead to novel neural architectures.

150
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,990
There's also the idea of sampling.

151
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,820
We can think of quantum computers
as samplers that prepare a class of

152
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:13,821
distributions called quantum states
and sample from them with measurements.

153
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,550
We could explore how samples from quantum
devices can be used to train machine

154
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:24,480
learning models. Sample based training
for Bolton machines is one example.

155
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,870
Another idea is colonel evaluation kernel
methods use machine learning models

156
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:34,260
based on a distance measure between
data points call the kernel.

157
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,250
Quantum devices can be used
to estimate certain kernels,

158
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:42,060
including the ones hard to
compute classically by estimating.

159
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:45,900
The inner products have two
high dimensional quantum states.

160
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,640
So the estimates from a quantum device
can be fed into a standard colonel

161
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:52,980
method,
like a support vector machine.

162
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,100
Although inference and
training are done classically,

163
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,190
they can be augmented
with the quantum device.

164
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,780
So we can think of the first generation
of quantum computers as partially

165
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:08,781
programmable special purpose devices
that can accelerate certain tasks in

166
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:12,060
machine learning,
just like gps did for deep learning,

167
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,540
quantum computers can help speed up some
existing machine learning models allow

168
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:22,620
for the creation of never before
possible models. And likewise,

169
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:27,710
machine learning can help quantum devices
learn new quantum algorithms rather

170
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:31,500
than having researchers try
to figure them out themselves.

171
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,700
Lots of work is happening right
now in this field, and if you want,

172
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:40,701
you can try out your own quantum algorithm
on both real and simulated quantum

173
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:43,800
devices.
