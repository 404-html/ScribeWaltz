1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,760
Hello world,
it's a Raj and supply chains.

2
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:07,230
I know it doesn't sound like the
sexiest word ever, but it is a very,

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,490
very important industry that AI can
be applied to an improved greatly.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,900
There's a huge potential there.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,970
In this video we're going to improve the
revenue streams for a simulated company

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,590
using this logistics wizard that
IBM has provided. What this is,

7
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:27,591
is it's an example of how AI can be used
to optimize the supply chain for some

8
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:31,620
distribution company.
So for those of you who don't know,

9
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:34,200
a supply chain is the process of taking,

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,430
of taking an item from raw
materials into a finished product.

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,350
And there's a lot of
middlemen along the way.

12
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:43,740
So anything you order on
Amazon prime for it to go from,

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,100
from where it is to you,
all of that is the supply chain.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,880
And there are distributors,
there are, uh, you know, drivers,

15
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:55,320
all sorts of different middlemen in the
middle and the weather affects the price

16
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:59,180
of the shipment. There's all of these
variables and this is imperfect,

17
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,220
perfect example of how AI can be used to,

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,410
to make a process more efficient.

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,920
And so what this is is it's a simulated
demo of a global logistics company.

20
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:13,410
And what they do is they ship products,
they've got three distribution centers,

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,550
five active shipments, one has been
completed, and for retail centers,

22
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:20,160
this is where the product is
actually sold to consumers.

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,880
And what we can do is we can
simulate a storm using this button.

24
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,410
So hits simulate storm.

25
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,890
And what's going to happen is it's going
to simulate a storm. It's a snow storm,

26
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:33,150
it's a moderately severe snow storm.
And what happened because of the storm,

27
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,640
because of the storm,
we have uh,

28
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,730
had supply shortages in these two cities
from salt lake to Raleigh and from Salt

29
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,190
Lake to Boston. And I can either
approve these Aurukun deny these,

30
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:46,860
I'll say approved for the first
one and reject the second one.

31
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,610
And what this is going to do to my bottom
line as let's say I'm the CEO of this

32
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,390
company, is it's going to either
increase my revenue or lose it. Okay.

33
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:57,390
So that's the demo and we're
going to look at that at the end.

34
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,560
I'm also going to explain the like the
technical details of what's happening

35
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:04,260
behind the hood here, how
it's doing that, but you know,

36
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:09,210
high level if you just want to try it out
without like having to code or looking

37
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:10,080
at the technical details,

38
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:13,890
this IBM demo link in the description
is perfect for you anyway, so,

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,691
right,
so like I said,

40
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:19,800
the supply chain is that network between
a company and its suppliers to produce

41
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:23,820
and distribute a specific product and
the supply chain represents the steps it

42
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:25,560
takes to get that product to the consumer.

43
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:28,770
So we can see this nice little
infographic we have to start,

44
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:33,660
which is a factory and this person
or robot. Then the forecasts,

45
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,870
ideally using AI right now
it's done mostly using humans.

46
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,310
It forecasts the demand.

47
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,360
How many people are going to want this
product and based on that forecast,

48
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,750
they will create enough product from raw
material to meet that demand and then

49
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:50,700
they're going to allocate all
of that onto these trucks.

50
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,540
They're going to optimize the routes
without these trucks take to get to the

51
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,493
consumer.

52
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,470
They're going to assort all of those
finished products in those boxes in the

53
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:02,320
distribution factory and then send them
to the retail center and hopefully,

54
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,580
hopefully more customers buy the
product. There is actually profit, right?

55
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,260
Hopefully there is profit after this
giant process and it's a very long and

56
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:13,600
complicated process to go
through, right? I mean there's,

57
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,770
there's so many middlemen here,

58
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,790
but the problem is that what if the
consumer doesn't like it? Right?

59
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:23,290
Ideally you want to cut your losses as a
business and right now there are people,

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,460
consulting firms, agencies that companies
hire to do this and they're very,

61
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:28,420
very expensive.

62
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,040
Companies lose a lot of money due to
the supply chain and if you as a small

63
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,020
startup can save any company,

64
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:40,021
even 5% on their transportation costs
because you're using AI to optimize the

65
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,330
ideal time that they
should send this shipment.

66
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,260
Factoring in the weather conditions,
factoring in consumer demand,

67
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:50,980
can factoring in whatever it is, if you
can show to them that you can do that,

68
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,880
not only is that a big deal,
you will get paid so much money.

69
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:59,530
There is so much money to be made
into supply chain. Okay. I've been,

70
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,900
I've been researching this. There's,
so there's a lot of money. Seriously.

71
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,480
This AI for business series
me basically being like,

72
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,680
how can have you applies to this whole, my
God, this, what am I doing with my life?

73
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,950
I need to know. But anyway, I
want you guys to make money.

74
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,230
You know what I'm saying? Like we're,
we're a crew, we're homies, you know,

75
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,780
you guys make money, I get
happy. That's just how it works.

76
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:22,240
And I've got my paid course in book
sales and ad revenue and Patriot and,

77
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,220
um, speaking deals and other things that
I do for revenue. So with that, I'm good.

78
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,960
Uh,
someone said in the last video,

79
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:30,640
like show a little glimpse
of the real survived.

80
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:33,280
So I'm showing you that also
one more guns to the real Saroj.

81
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:36,310
I'm in New York right now in
my makeshift studio and uh,

82
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,430
I'm here for this Crypto, a award
thing, which I thought like,

83
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:42,790
should I even go to that? But, um,
I'm here because like, it's cool.

84
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,860
I went to this cosmos,
a party last night.

85
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:48,230
Cosmos is a really cool
a blockchain network.

86
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,930
They're one of the few
that I actually like. Um,

87
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,210
they helped me make Suraj coined back
in a few days ago, which not a few days,

88
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,620
a few weeks ago,
months even,

89
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,960
which I don't think it worked out
because people took it the wrong way.

90
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,890
But the point is that they're, they're
pretty cool and um, anyway, so yeah,

91
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:06,850
it's good to be in New York anyway.
So the supply chain,

92
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,300
there's a lot of components there, right?
There's requirements, planning, sourcing,

93
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:13,960
manufacturing, all of these requirements.
And right now this, in this,

94
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:16,480
in this infographic here,
you're seeing artificial intelligence,

95
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,930
all of that is done by
humans. I mean, seriously,

96
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,120
this is a very old industry,
right?

97
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:26,470
This is like as old as products themselves
have been and no one has even thought

98
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,160
about applying AI to it until the
past five or six years ago. Right?

99
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:33,400
Because that's when deep learning
really started like two to come into the

100
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,230
mainstream. The other reason
is because there's so much
data, right? The suppliers,

101
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:41,140
manufacturers, distributors,
they have so much data.

102
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,050
I have a sample data set for you
right here to take a look at. Okay.

103
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,730
This is just a very small example that
I found from what was a key data.com and

104
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:51,730
its supply chain shipping pricing data.
Okay.

105
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:56,030
So they have some project code and this
is like real world data. Like it's,

106
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,110
it's not pretty, it looks ugly. You're
like what is this? What am I looking at?

107
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:01,970
What am I even trying to do here?
If you're,

108
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:05,840
if that's the case then you're looking
at some really real, real world data.

109
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:06,674
Cause that's how it looks.

110
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,300
It's our job as data scientists to find
the needle in the haystack to find the,

111
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,260
the three keys in the,
the simulation as a ready player.

112
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:19,340
One was in that movie. That's
how it was. So, um, anyway,

113
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,730
so we've got country, these are
all features and w okay, so let's,

114
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,940
let's think through this for a second.
Let's say this is our data set, right?

115
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,590
Like scheduled delivery date
clients. Okay. Wow. Okay.

116
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,980
Sub Classification. Okay.
There's a, there's a label
that we could potentially use,

117
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,090
you know, all of these
different things. Okay?

118
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,300
So there's,
there's quite a lot of features here.

119
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:45,890
But remember if this can
easily be a supervised learning
problem where we have a

120
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:47,840
label and then we had the input data,
right?

121
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,830
So all we have to do is we have to decide
what that label is going to be, right?

122
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,140
It could be, you know, what is the,

123
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,450
we want to predict what
the weight is going to be.

124
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,750
We want to predict what the fright cost
is going to be given all of these other

125
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:00,350
conditions.

126
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,730
Let's say it's that we want to predict
what the cost is going to be given all of

127
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:07,850
these other features, okay?
So we can easily do that
with psych. It learn, right?

128
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,240
We split the training data and two,
this is the x and here's the why.

129
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:14,120
The why is the cost.
The X is everything else.

130
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,460
And what this is going to amount to is a
giant matrix, right? We're all of these

131
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,860
values right here are going to
constitute a single data point,

132
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,060
which is a single matrix,
right?

133
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,030
Value one comma value to comma
bio about you three comma.

134
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,540
But notice how some of these are dates.
Some of these are strings,

135
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,640
some of these are numbers.

136
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,090
What we want to do first is to
regularize all of this data.

137
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:42,140
So it's all numerical, right? And we'll
just, once it's all numbers, right,

138
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,780
then we can feed it to the
neural network or whatever,

139
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,840
whatever we're going to use probably a
neural network because that's the best

140
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,980
for sure. So once we do that and
we, so we have the input data,

141
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,200
we have the labels and we're
predicting the mapping.

142
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,420
Remember it's all about
predicting that mapping.

143
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,690
And once we predicted that mapping after
a sufficient number of data points,

144
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,290
then we'll say,
you know what?

145
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,950
Let's say I'm going to deliver it on.
And you say some date in the future,

146
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,340
you say, okay, on this day and
with this kind of client with this,

147
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,870
what's the price going to be?

148
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:14,270
And it's going to tell you
based on everything else,

149
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,210
here's the likely costs and
it's going to cost you. Okay,

150
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,410
so but I think a good way to do this,
that's one way.

151
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:24,470
I mean notice there's so many
things we could predict, right?

152
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:27,710
We could predict the the, the, the
class label that is going to be,

153
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:30,320
it's going to be an HIV test
is going to be pediatric.

154
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,410
That won't necessarily be good for us,
but we could do that.

155
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,650
But what I think would be
the most efficient would
be time series forecasting,

156
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,090
right?

157
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:46,090
On what date should I send
out this shipment such that
the price is going to be

158
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:47,534
the lowest.

159
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,850
So that is considered time series
forecasting and notice how,

160
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,980
how many features there are.
We could not draft this alone,

161
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:57,030
this data set just like this.

162
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,600
We would have to reduce the
dimensionality of this Dataset, right?

163
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,680
Using a technique like Tsne or PCA,
right?

164
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:07,800
Which is principle component analysis.
Both of those, those techniques.

165
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:12,510
I have videos on search to Raj,
PCA, Saroj, t dash, s, n, e.

166
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,310
And then once we do that,

167
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,660
then it's going to be a two dimensional
graph where it's going to be one

168
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:21,600
dimension is going to be everything,
all the features.

169
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,320
And the other dimension is
going to be the time, right?

170
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,730
Every single day of
the month and the year.

171
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,380
And it's going to plot out
what that looks like. Okay.

172
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,680
And so what we wanna do is we
want to find that lowest point.

173
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,960
And what we can do is
once we grab that out,

174
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:39,000
we could see what that lowest
point is and then we can say, well,

175
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:42,360
this is the optimal point right here.
So that's another way we can do this.

176
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,610
But if we're trying to figure out the
best date to ship something based on the

177
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:51,750
weather pattern, that's easily a
time series forecasting problem,

178
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,320
which we can do with chaos, which I'll
show you at the end of this video. Um,

179
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,020
but anyway, so that's, that's
a, that's a little bit of a,

180
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,820
a Dataset Speil for you anyway.
But the problem with supply chains,

181
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:07,290
and there is a big problem, is that
there are, there are these silos, right?

182
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,140
There are silos. It's,
it's not easy to just say,

183
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,900
I'm going to make an AI startup
gimme your supply chain.

184
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,060
Like it's like one big Dataset.
It's not always, you know, they're,

185
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,890
they're different companies that deal
with all of these things that require

186
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:24,891
armies of expensive planners and they
usually run complex engines at each step

187
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:28,170
of the process and at each
node in the supply network.

188
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,490
So they are missing out on these huge
opportunities because there locally

189
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:35,610
optimized for their own, you
know, their own little silo.

190
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,150
But if someone could get an
overhead view of all of the data,

191
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,260
you could optimize the f out of
everything, which is awesome, right?

192
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,400
So that's what we want to do.

193
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:49,401
We want to get that huge end to end
data set of the entire supply chain.

194
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,930
And so if we look at, you know, people
were surveyed, companies were surveyed,

195
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:59,760
what the most costly outcomes were
for, uh, for their supply chains.

196
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:04,140
And most people said margin erosion. And
the second one was sudden demand change,

197
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:05,460
which is also a big one,
right?

198
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:08,760
So suddenly people don't want the product
or suddenly you know the margin is the

199
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:10,530
margin has eroded or whatever it is,

200
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,640
which I assume is like the product margin.

201
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:18,120
Like let's say the cost of the raw
materials went up for some reason like oil

202
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:21,360
for example, because of political
reasons or whatever, what have you.

203
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,900
But that that's a huge deal as well.
And you can predict all of these things.

204
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,030
You can predict that a
product is going to fail.

205
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:30,060
You can predict that there's going to be
a disruption in the product, full flow,

206
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:33,170
all of this, if you pass efficient
data, you can predict these sticks.

207
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,450
This is a super power and think about it.
Most of these companies,

208
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,170
they don't know. They don't know
that anything about this, you know,

209
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:44,010
you are literally watching a video
on supply chain applied to AI.

210
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,440
So there's a lot of
opportunity in this space.

211
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,040
So supply chains have a lot of
data and it's all sorts of data.

212
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:54,910
It's transactional data, it's time
based data, it's gps, mapping numbers,

213
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,210
strings, texts, dates. There's a lot,

214
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,950
and we have to regularize all this data
so it's in the same numerical format and

215
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:04,660
then we can feed it to a
machine learning model,

216
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,040
but they've got so much data and the
AI should not be a black box, right?

217
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,130
Whenever you have a client
accompany a distributor distributor,

218
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,190
you've got to be able to explain to
them why you made a certain decision.

219
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,360
And the best way to do that is to
visualize that data, right? To show them,

220
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:22,480
here is why. Here are, here's
the point, here's the, you know,

221
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:26,080
here's the the minimum minimum that
I found. Here's a gradient. You know,

222
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:27,970
things like that.
You don't have to say the word gradient,

223
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:30,700
but you have to show them visually
how you came to your conclusion.

224
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:32,950
That's one way. Another way is, I mean,

225
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:34,840
depending on the type of
neural network you have,

226
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:38,410
if it's a convolutional network,
you can show them the features inside.

227
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:40,750
You could say like, well, here's
the abstractions that it's built.

228
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,010
There's a lot of different ways,

229
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,830
but the point is that you should
be able to explain your findings.

230
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,370
So, uh, what are the different ways
that AI can solve this problem? Right?

231
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,790
So I mean there's so many different ways
that AI could potentially solve this

232
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:59,590
problem. And if you think about it, what's
really exciting is 13% of companies,

233
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:01,030
only 13% that were served,

234
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:06,090
that were surveyed by forester said that
the supply chain was where the focus of

235
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,510
AI was in internally, which is huge,
right? And it's going everywhere else,

236
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:14,000
marketing, sales, other
areas. But it's such a, it's,

237
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,340
there's so much data there in that
field and there's so much potential for

238
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,210
increasing revenue, right? By
streamlining and optimizing the whole,

239
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,330
the whole process.
So it's a huge opportunity for startups.

240
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,550
And so if you think about it,
the supply chain,

241
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,430
all the people who are planning it,
the drivers for the cars,

242
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,110
the people who are unpacking boxes,
who are checking for quality,

243
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:39,460
all these things, every single part of
that can be optimized, can be automated.

244
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,450
And if you think about the Internet
of things and Mike Drop blockchain,

245
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,800
we can create a fully, fully,
fully autonomous system
here and to end autonomous,

246
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:52,630
no humans needed, um, that
can be self aware, self
governing and self determining.

247
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,760
And I'll add to that self optimizing,
right?

248
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:57,040
It just gets better and better over time.
So,

249
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,570
and the reason I say blockchain is
because right now we trust middlemen with

250
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:04,780
saying that a package was sent from point
a to point B and we have to pay those

251
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:05,260
middlemen.

252
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:10,000
But ideally we could use some kind of
immutable ledger blockchain that nobody

253
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:11,350
controls and say.

254
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,260
And every time a shipment is sent it's
timestamped on to that blockchain.

255
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,580
And then we can say, hey, oh it was
there. Right? This is when it happened.

256
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:20,980
It's on this blockchain, its
immutable, nobody modified it.

257
00:14:20,981 --> 00:14:23,920
I don't have to trust anybody. So that's
how blockchain can be used here as well.

258
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:29,020
Timestamping shipments and when they
happen and when different actions occur,

259
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,260
it's a publicly verifiable way.
So what are,

260
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:35,380
what are startups that have
actually done this? So one idea.

261
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,650
So what are ways that AI can be
applied to this industry? Right?

262
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:42,790
And I'll talk about startups inside of
this. So one is chatbots for procurement,

263
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,670
right? So whenever you have someone
who is running some kind of company,

264
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,330
they can say, hey, I want to be
able to access, you know, this,

265
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:52,370
this could be like some data that they
need for the supply chain or whatever.

266
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,560
And the,
the Chat Bot can give them that data.

267
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,770
It can pull it from the Dataset and
say, here it is. They can also say,

268
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,880
you can also ask it like if I were to do
this, what would be the likely outcome?

269
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,730
It can make predictions using a
pretrained model in the background.

270
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:07,460
So one company that is
doing this is chime box.

271
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:12,461
So with Chime Bot is doing is they are
acting as a chat bot interface for these

272
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:16,250
suppliers, right? So, um,
basically, you know, they're,

273
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,110
they're making the chatbot
for different industries,

274
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:20,810
but procurement is one of them.
And they can ask these questions,

275
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:24,170
which is super useful because a chat
Bot is 24, seven, it doesn't need sleep.

276
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,730
You don't need to pay it, you know a
lot like it as much as a human and it's,

277
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:31,160
it's, it's a very optimized um, idea.

278
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:34,070
So another one is supply chain planning,
which is what we're going to do, right?

279
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:37,730
So how could an AI be used to
help forecast the inventory?

280
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:41,360
How much you need planning a
demand supply, these things,
these kinds of things.

281
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,220
Ai is perfectly suited for that.

282
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,890
Clear metal is one startup that
is doing that right now, right?

283
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,300
Supply chain visibility, making predictive
alerting and collaboration possible.

284
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,530
Check them out.
And by the way,

285
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:54,290
I want to say that none of these
startups should dissuade you from doing

286
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,950
something in this field. There's a
huge opportunity. There's a huge space,

287
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,080
there's a lot to share.
And these are just,

288
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:02,300
this is just an example for
you to look at it and say,

289
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:05,630
this is possible machine learning
for warehouse management, right?

290
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,850
If we think about who is in
control of the warehouse,

291
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:10,750
it's a human need to make sure that the
robots are in order, that the, you know,

292
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,320
this person is getting paid,
et cetera.

293
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,020
And there's a lots for a human
to keep in mind. This is a,

294
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:19,280
this is a huge job and AI can definitely
help that human or even replace that

295
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:22,880
human in that job. Rubik cloud is a
good example of intelligent decision.

296
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,670
Autumn is automation. Definitely check
that one out. Autonomous Vehicles,

297
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,250
that one sounds like an obvious one, but
Google Waymo, Uber drive dot. Ai Comma.

298
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:33,570
Dot. Ai. There's a bunch of, uh,

299
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:38,710
potential in this space to
create self-driving transports
that can automate the,

300
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,380
the driving process portion
of the supply chain.

301
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:46,560
And also you don't have to make a
capital intensive car or truck to, to,

302
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,530
to make a self driving, um,
startup. You can make software
for them. You can make a,

303
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:53,990
you can, you can collect
data, aggregate data,

304
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,330
you can create better mapping software,
et cetera.

305
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:57,620
There's a lot of potential there as well.

306
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,260
Natural language processing
is another one, right?

307
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:04,130
So the data that we're looking at is very,
uh, you know, it's hard to read, right?

308
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:07,320
There's so many different features,
item description delivered to client date,

309
00:17:07,321 --> 00:17:08,154
et cetera.

310
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,830
Ideally we could use natural language
processing to interpret all of this data

311
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,920
and then create a simple Q and a
system where we could just ask this,

312
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,260
ask our Dataset,
what is this?

313
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:21,620
And it would just find it exactly what
we need and just tell us that exact day.

314
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:26,480
Like what was the vendor I IMCO
term on the 5th of November, right?

315
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:27,051
Something like that.

316
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:31,150
Like an NLP natural language interface
where we can use plain English to ask it

317
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:35,050
questions and things like that.
Data log. Dot. Io is doing that. Um,

318
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,680
death taxes and data preparation.
You're on your own for death and taxes.

319
00:17:39,681 --> 00:17:42,500
But we've got you covered for data
preparation. I love that. Great.

320
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:44,490
A great little slogan. So, uh,

321
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,380
last one is a predictive analytics for
supplier selection, right? As you can see,

322
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:49,500
it's very complicated.

323
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,350
There's a lot of potential decisions
that a human has to make. Your,

324
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:56,660
anytime you can offload a very hard
decision to a machine, you are, you've,

325
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,050
you've done something very
good for society, right?
So, uh, supplier selection,

326
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:03,610
who's the best supplier? Who's
going to be the, you know, um,

327
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:08,010
optimal choice for different actions that
you would perform in the supply chain.

328
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,300
Great example of Ai.

329
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,540
So to get to this logistics wizard
that I was talking about earlier,

330
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,240
so IBM has this service called bloomix.

331
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,960
Bloomix is using their Ai Watson
to do a bunch of different tasks.

332
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,380
So in this case, a task we're looking
at is called the logistics wizard.

333
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,710
And what that does is it's using an AI
to create the simulated environments for

334
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:33,201
this global retail distribution
company and simulate bad weather.

335
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,530
And so what we can do is we can track
that bad weather, we can trap cars,

336
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,360
our shipments, we could see what's
going wrong, what's going right,

337
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,310
and it will tell us those things.
And it's using an AI to make predictions.

338
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:46,310
So what we can get into the details of,
you know,

339
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,610
all the different things this can do,
but this is like, uh, you know, ready,

340
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,790
ready to go solution.

341
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,540
And what you can do is you can actually
use this and your tool set for another

342
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:58,620
company, right? Because there is an
overhead to even having to look at this.

343
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:01,350
Well you can say,
is it like a plain English direction?

344
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:04,860
Like here's the best thing to do
based on my data, my analytics.

345
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:07,140
So you can actually use
this for our company.

346
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,100
You can use this in unison with other
models, care os, tensorflow, Pi Torch,

347
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:12,150
build your own models,

348
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,170
try out different models for different
use cases and just have all of those in

349
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:20,370
your tool set, um, to, to, to use
as predicted power for your client.

350
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:26,190
Now there are different ways to build
a model. Um, if we look at this,

351
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:28,350
right? It depends on what
we're trying to predict, right?

352
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:31,710
If we're trying to predict the
label or if the shipment mode,

353
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,460
the fulfillment dates, the
scheduled date, the price,

354
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,290
what are we trying to predict here?
Right?

355
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,390
And that column is going to be our label.

356
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,970
Everything else is going to
be our input data, right?

357
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:44,400
Which usually in my videos
is just one single column,

358
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:48,000
but sometimes it can be multiple columns,
right? And that's a little harder, uh, to,

359
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:50,550
to think about.
But really it's just one giant matrix.

360
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,120
We don't actually have to think about
like how the mapping is working.

361
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,120
We just know that it's going to learn
that mapping. That's really the key.

362
00:19:57,121 --> 00:20:01,530
It's went to learn the mapping between
one or more columns x, you know,

363
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:06,120
x values and the label, which is whatever
we're trying to predict, the price,

364
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,300
the time,
et cetera.

365
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,020
And so what I want to do right now is I
want to do a little bit of pseudo code

366
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:13,380
just so you could get an idea of what
I'm talking about here. So let's, let's,

367
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:17,980
let's see. What we want to do
is we want to predict the, um,

368
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,160
let's say the price.

369
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:24,960
We want to predict the price of a
shipment given all the other variables.

370
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:28,860
And what we've done is we have our data
set here, we have our price as well. See,

371
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,770
here's the freight costs and USD
and let's assume where we're,

372
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,740
we've gathered whether data
we've gathered, even stock data,

373
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:35,580
whatever kind of data.

374
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,150
And we put them all into columns in our
giant Dataset and we want to predict the

375
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:43,050
price. And so, because time is involved
here, there are dates involved.

376
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,320
What we could consider this as
is a time series problem, right?

377
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,620
We're trying to forecast in a time series
problem. So what I can do is I can say,

378
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,760
okay, this is going to
be my supply chain. Uh,

379
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,280
and I'm going to import the libraries
that I need. That's going to be care os,

380
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,760
that's going to be pan does
for data preprocessing,

381
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,430
that's going to be psychic,

382
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,550
learn for data regularization and um,

383
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,060
it's a pseudo code by the way.
And we'll get to the real code.

384
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,910
I just want to show you how I think and
you know, just think through it with you.

385
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:13,930
So what are we going to do?
Well,

386
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:16,480
we're going to create a
function called prediction.

387
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,070
And inside of the prediction function,

388
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:22,930
we're going to say we've
got our input data.

389
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:27,931
So is there input data is going to
be a part of a pandas data frame.

390
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:28,901
Okay.
So this is,

391
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:33,901
we're pulling this into memory and this
is going to be a input dot CSV file that

392
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:37,730
we saw and we're going to split
it on let's say the 19th column.

393
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,140
So everything before the 19 column, all
those data points are going to be the x,

394
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:42,280
right?
The input data.

395
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:45,340
And the last one is going to be the price
and that's going to be the the label.

396
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:48,740
And that's all we did. We split the
data into training and testing data. Uh,

397
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,330
well we, we can actually do that
with at Lawrence we can say x, Y,

398
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,980
x test,
why test?

399
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,120
Now we can take that input data,
which is just split and we could say,

400
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:08,590
we could say sy Kit,
learn dot split,

401
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,020
let,
let's just say it's already split,

402
00:22:11,021 --> 00:22:15,070
but this just kind of format to
into four different variables. Okay.

403
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,210
And so they're, um, important data.

404
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,200
That was our first step.

405
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,640
Then we split data into
training and testing data.

406
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,400
Now we'll build a model build model

407
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,900
using Cara Ross of course,

408
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,890
off subsequential and now we're
going to build our network. Okay.

409
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:38,590
So we're trying to predict
what that price is going to be.

410
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,020
So what we can do is we could look at
Ken Ross and we could take some of those

411
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:47,770
snippets here. Let's just say it's
going to be a two layer model.

412
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,900
Everything is fully connected. Uh,
ideally we would want an LSTM network,

413
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:56,110
which I'm about to show you.
But for the sake of this pseudo code demo,

414
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:00,910
I'm just trying to show you
like how this goes. Um, lastly,

415
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:03,970
we're going to fit the model on the
data. We built it, we've compiled it,

416
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:07,570
we defined it's lost function,
and then at the very end,

417
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:11,620
we can make our prediction just like that.
And this is going to be x,

418
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,910
and this is gonna be y. And now once
we're done, we'll predict our classes.

419
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:20,860
And what it's going to do is going to
print out a giant matrix of all of those

420
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:23,740
features and all the values
given this price, right?

421
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,800
So we're going to make a prediction
about what the features would be given a

422
00:23:26,801 --> 00:23:30,340
price, and then we could give it
some price that we want ideally.

423
00:23:30,341 --> 00:23:31,870
And then we'll say, well,
here's what you should have.

424
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,120
Here are the optimal levels
for all of those features.

425
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,450
And we could just kind of tune it there,
give it more data,

426
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,130
get more accurate results,
et cetera. So, uh,

427
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,240
but what we would want in this case
if we have a lot of data, is an Lstm,

428
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,261
a neural network,

429
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:47,630
a long short term memory network as a
type of recurrent network. And everyone,

430
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:49,400
whenever we're dealing
with sequences of data,

431
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:52,940
we want to use a recurrent network
because the past matters, right?

432
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:56,090
It's not just learning the mapping the
past matters as well because you can't

433
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:57,140
just say,
you know,

434
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,110
predict the next word in a sentence
without knowing the words that came before

435
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:01,250
it because the past matters.

436
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,120
So LSTM networks are a type of recurrent
network that could predict longterm

437
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:08,540
sequences, which is what we
likely have. And we can, you know,

438
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,750
have some data preprocessing up here to
make sure it's all in the same format.

439
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,020
And then we could just run our
training loop on DLC. I'm network,

440
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,320
very simple stuff. Uh, but yeah, I just
wanted to show you that you can use this,

441
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:21,050
you can use carrots to build it on
your own. You can find the data set.

442
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:22,580
I have a link to that in the description.

443
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,310
You can use IBM's blue mix if
you don't want to have to code,

444
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:26,780
and one a very easy to use solution,

445
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,600
but there's a lot of potential in this
space and I hope you found this video

446
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:33,800
useful. Also, if you have any
comments, any feedback suggestions,

447
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,920
definitely post them in the comment
section. I always read my comments.

448
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,490
I might not reply to all of them, but I
read all of them. So thanks for watching.

449
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,760
Please subscribe for more programming
videos and for now I've got to attend a

450
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:45,920
crypto award,
so thanks for watching.
