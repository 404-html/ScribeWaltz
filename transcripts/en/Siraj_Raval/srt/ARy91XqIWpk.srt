1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,560
There is no way on earth to prevent the
rise of the intelligent machines about

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:12,130
this case at Facebook and this idea
that perhaps these robots where somehow

3
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:14,220
developing an independent language,

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,900
much smarter than a person,
what does that,

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,320
what job do we have?

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:25,660
Yeah,

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,060
so enough about the evil Ai.
Let's talk about the good stuff,

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,490
and then no one talks about
the good stuff and they should,

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,500
because in the worst case,
it creates a Dystopia, right?
It, it kills us. All, right?

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,320
That's in the worst case,
but in the best case,

11
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,590
it solves literally every single problem
that we could ever imagine if global

12
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:47,450
warming disease, famine, poverty,

13
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,040
any huge intractable problem
and he multivariant problem,

14
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,760
it could solve.
