1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,330
Nobody really is in a position to
guess how big a computer you need,

2
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:05,941
or a bigger,

3
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:09,480
faster computers and you need to do
the highest levels of human thought.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,020
And I suspect it's rather small and
that each bit of what a computer does

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,850
probably needs thousands of neurons.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,330
And so most of the brain is
because neurons are rather
unreliable and noisy and

7
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:28,440
flaky. We need a lot of them, but
they're not computing very much.

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,520
Interesting. So, so, uh,
Alpha go played this move,

9
00:00:34,521 --> 00:00:38,960
which I want to hear more about in a
second, but, uh, Lee has left the room.

10
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,360
He left the room after room
after that move. Huh? I mean,

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,510
I'm not even going to ask me. It's a
very surprising, it's a surprising move.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,920
I wasn't expecting that.
