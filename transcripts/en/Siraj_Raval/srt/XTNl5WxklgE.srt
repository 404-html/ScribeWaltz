00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,520
Train constantly.
My Foster Snyder,

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,320
ah, got to repay. It Burns
the triad is make me smarter.

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,940
I train my models in the cloud now
because my laptop takes longer.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,060
I parse through data like
a boss now back then,

5
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:20,870
mock code was wronger subscribe
if you want to learn now,

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,030
let's spread this AI power

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,770
pretty there right now.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,720
Great.

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,720
Let's make pots to nine and make music
like Mozart tonight and pay artwork on a

10
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:40,090
cross tonight.
I'm waiting for this software all my life.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,980
Just give it some data and
watch it. Explore a step
back. Clap and give an encore.

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,480
She is trained on 40 cores.
Does race or make GP use anymore?

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,890
My game but started off [inaudible] list,
but now it's like God in the Matrix.

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,420
It's my chat Bot speaks. Once I train
it, I worked damn hard to make page.

15
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,010
It'll generate words that he appreciates.
Analyze sits a bit that tested.

16
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,000
This is the shit to invest in.
New Data was there training and tested.

17
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,930
Got to read papers to
try and make me smarter.

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,550
I train my models in the cloud now
because my laptop takes longer.

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,110
I'll parse through data like a bottle.
Now. Back then, my code was stronger.

20
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,630
