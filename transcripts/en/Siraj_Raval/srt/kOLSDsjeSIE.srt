1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,740
Hello world, it's arrived and
everybody fails at some point.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,860
The question is how do
you overcome this failure?

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:13,070
I'm going to recall five times in my life
where I failed big time and talk about

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,700
how I later recovered.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,880
To give you some insight into ways
of overcoming failure in general.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,220
One of my first big fails was fitting
into the modern American narrative.

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,250
What I mean is I was born in
Houston, Texas. Shout out to h town,

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,510
two parents from India and I
spent my formative years there.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,720
I was born with the name Saroj and in
middle and high school I got made fun of a

10
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:41,010
lot in a racist way.

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,170
I also never saw any character in
American TV or movies that looked like me

12
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,180
doing cool stuff and it makes sense.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,070
Indians had only started to migrate to
the states in the past couple of decades,

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,330
but I didn't feel like I fit in
with the Indian culture either.

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,800
I was never Indian enough for that
group. My family, of course loved me,

16
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:06,801
but I wanted that love and acceptance
from the kids at school and the ladies of

17
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:11,400
course. And I just never felt
it. I want it to be white.

18
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,110
I didn't want to be racialized,

19
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:16,980
Aka put into a box as that Indian
kid who did some great thing,

20
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:20,070
but instead I wanted to be that
kid who did some great thing,

21
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,030
so I legally changed my
name to Jason Scott Revelle.

22
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,990
The year before I went to College at
Columbia University in New York City,

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,120
I lightened my skin, changed my
style, tried to be a whole new person,

24
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,280
a fresh restart on life, but what I later
found was that nothing really changed.

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,520
I still didn't feel fully accepted and
introducing myself to Indian people

26
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:46,500
became awkward. Alf, as the years passed,

27
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,190
I learned to fully accept
myself for who I was.

28
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:55,310
I stopped trying to be what I thought
other people would like and instead

29
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,190
focused more on being the
best version of me. Sure.

30
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,050
I don't know anyone out there who's both
a wrapper and really into artificial

31
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:08,460
intelligence. Sure. It's not a normal
thing, but I'm not a normal person.

32
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,670
I'm a new breed and I'm going to bring
my abnormal reality into the mainstream

33
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:15,480
narrative and change culture.

34
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,230
I'll make a place for
myself and not as Jason.

35
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,430
I legally changed my name back
to Siraj and it was liberating.

36
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,190
When I focus on being true to myself.

37
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,570
I started to attract the right kind of
friends and finally felt that sense of

38
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:32,730
belonging that I always wanted.

39
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,090
My second big fail I had was my first
startup lucid robotics that I started as a

40
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:39,870
student at Columbia.

41
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,970
I was so manically obsessed with
building a robot to help the elderly with

42
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:45,540
chores.

43
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,430
I woke up every day really excited and
spent long nights in the robotics lab

44
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,870
planning next steps.
I managed to find a team of great people.

45
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,550
After countless interviews,

46
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,730
I managed to raise a seed round after
rejected by 30 or 40 venture capital firms

47
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,880
in New York and we managed
to build a working prototype,

48
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,580
but the market didn't want our product.

49
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,830
The team got disillusioned with the
idea and our investor lost hope.

50
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,190
Nine months of hard work and
I had nothing to show for it.

51
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,260
The worst part was that failing at the
startup made me slowly lose my passion

52
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:27,100
for robotics in a big way,
and I didn't know if it would come back.

53
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,840
I felt really lost and afraid.
I didn't know what I should do next,

54
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,020
but I did know that I didn't
want to dwell on this.

55
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:39,490
Failure to long San Francisco was a
place I'd always wanted to live in,

56
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:44,350
so I packed my things and moved to
a hacker house, 20 beds in one room.

57
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,360
It was gritty,
it was uncomfortable,

58
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,480
but it was me moving forward from failure
into a new environment of possibility

59
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,180
and as I met starry eyed
entrepreneurs there,

60
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,240
my passion for AI returned and I began
to search for new ways to have impact.

61
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,400
The third fail I had was getting
rejected from so many different jobs.

62
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,310
During my first fulltime job hunt in SF,

63
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,410
I made sure my resume looked
well formatted and impressive
and I use a bunch of

64
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,940
recruiting agencies to help me get
interviews for different startups in the

65
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:19,690
area.

66
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,690
But one by one I got rejection after
rejection and every time I would lose a

67
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:26,890
little bit of hope.
Meanwhile,

68
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,540
I had friends who seemingly easily
got jobs that really cool companies.

69
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,360
I didn't know what I was doing wrong.

70
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,140
Maybe I wasn't enthusiastic
enough during the interview.

71
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,330
Maybe I needed to study more,

72
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,630
maybe I needed to apply
for a different position.

73
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,820
It was really stressful,

74
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,230
but I found that since I ensured my body
and mind were healthy and that I kept a

75
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:51,820
positive attitude on life,

76
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,410
I preserved through all the
rejection until I got my first offer.

77
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,590
It's never easy rising
up the career ladder,

78
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,040
whether you go through a corporate
route or a startup route,

79
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,390
you continually build trust in
your own name brand by the brands,

80
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,130
Aka companies you've worked with
and things get easier as you go,

81
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,030
but you've got to put in that
initial effort to get your first gig.

82
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,880
No matter how many rejections you get.
At first.

83
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:23,881
My fourth fail was getting fired from
Twilio and this is the first time I'm

84
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,130
publicly admitting that when I first
landed the job as a developer educator at

85
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:30,940
Twilio,
I was delighted.

86
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,330
I learned so much in such
a short period of time.

87
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,710
Technical Writing wasn't some
chore that Developers had to do.

88
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,400
It was a craft,
a skill that can be honed over time.

89
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,640
A mix of math and programming and prose.

90
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,770
It was the perfect job for me.

91
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:52,890
I was writing Api docs in
multiple programming languages
for multiple products

92
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,290
that affected over a million developers.

93
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,050
I loved my team and what I did,
but near the end,

94
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,030
my performance started to drop.

95
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,210
I had the idea to make videos for
developers and my team at the time didn't

96
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:11,060
really think it was a good
idea to focus on that.

97
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,350
So I started my own youtube channel
to experiment with the idea.

98
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,090
I started dedicating more and more of
my time to that and my performance at my

99
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:23,660
job suffered as a result,
so I was eventually let go.

100
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,930
I gave myself a single week
to feel sorry for myself.

101
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,640
I felt like I'd let down so many people
who believed in me, but in that failure,

102
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:36,470
I found the opportunity to finally be
able to work on my youtube channel full

103
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,880
time. I was able to turn
that sorrow into excitement.

104
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,980
It was risky,
it was fun,

105
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:46,310
it was liberating and I
don't regret it one bit.

106
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,530
My fifth failure was actually multiple
little failures all the times I received

107
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,420
mostly negative comments when I
first started making youtube videos.

108
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,550
Some of my initial videos were really
low budget and I definitely got a lot of

109
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:02,384
criticism.

110
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:07,570
My close friends at the time sat me down
and told me it wasn't a good idea that

111
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:13,031
I should instead get a job at a cool
company or think of some B to B product

112
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:14,090
idea,

113
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:19,090
but I was so motivated by a mixture of
wanting to educate people and wanting my

114
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:22,940
own independence that
I kept at it defiantly.

115
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,900
I learned to take each negative
comment as crucial feedback.

116
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,140
I let the critics helped me mold and shape
the content so that it got better and

117
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:33,530
better every time.

118
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,770
I watched lots of youtube videos of people
who inspired me and made sure to stay

119
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:42,320
inspired.
Even during my darkest hours,

120
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,890
I didn't really know what it was
that I was doing. Was it a startup?

121
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,940
Was it a hobby?

122
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,060
All I knew is that I had a mission to
inspire and educate developers to build

123
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:53,120
AI,

124
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,800
and that's what kept me going no
matter how silly I looked on camera and

125
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:00,620
eventually the channel
grew to what it is today.

126
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,840
It's been just over two years since I
started this youtube channel because of

127
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:10,550
it. I've had the opportunity to
speak at the United Nations cern,

128
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,190
a bunch of conferences all over the world.

129
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,220
I taught a deep learning
course at u Udacity.

130
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,470
I made a video for Elan Musk.

131
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,740
So many awesome things have happened and
I've just started what's turning out to

132
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:27,230
be a very successful company,
the school of Ai,

133
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,630
if I can do great things. So can you,
so get to it wizard. I'm here for you.

134
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,160
The winner of last week's coding challenge
is how much shake Ahmad used a really

135
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:41,060
cool data set to predict whether or not
students would get probation in their

136
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:44,960
second year, and he use logistic
regression to do this great work.

137
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,940
And the runner up is blahdy.

138
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,830
Blahdy also used a logistic regression
model built in num Pi to predict whether

139
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,280
or not there was breast cancer
in some patients. Amazing work.

140
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,920
Please subscribe for more
programming videos. And for now,

141
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,830
I've got to explore Lisbon,
so thanks for watching.
