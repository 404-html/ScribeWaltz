1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,780
Hello world,

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,700
it's Serrano and I'm the director of a
nonprofit organization called school of

3
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:10,701
AI dedicated to offering a worldclass AI
education to anyone on earth for free.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,650
I'm now looking for an entirely new
class of school of AI staff called

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:21,651
residential advisers to help provide
quality low cost housing for school of Ai

6
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:26,640
students across the world. Link to sign
up. We'll be in the video description.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,200
In just four months.

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:33,290
We built a highly engaged network
of deans across 400 cities globally.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,670
These deans are hosting regular in person
classes that teach a wide variety of

10
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:43,671
topics in technology to students and have
been very successful in creating fast

11
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:46,800
growing connected communities.

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,460
Because of their association
with school of Ai.

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,310
There are personal brands
have grown as well.

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,260
We're seeing them get invited to
public speaking events, interviews.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,340
They're generally becoming thought
leaders in this space. Additionally,

16
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:07,341
we have multiple online
offerings including full
courses and curriculums that

17
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:11,820
detail various learning paths for
students. We've given our students,

18
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:15,900
which we endearingly call wizards,
educational opportunities,

19
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,030
both online and offline,

20
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,160
but we're committed to providing a full
stack learning experience globally.

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,240
That means we're looking
to provide housing as well.

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,540
Residential advisors provide quality
coal living housing for school of Ai

23
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,920
Wizards in their respective cities.

24
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,160
We're looking for people who either own
or lease rent or in some way manage a co

25
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:43,050
living property with at least five beds,

26
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:46,170
but the more the better the
type of property can be.

27
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:48,540
A big house on apartment complex,

28
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,690
a hostel or even an existing college dorm.

29
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,940
Co-Living living is a growing trend in
the sharing economy that allows residents

30
00:01:56,941 --> 00:02:01,941
an opportunity to share their living
space with others who share similar values

31
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,960
and interests.

32
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,240
I used to manage a 20 bedroom coal
living community in San Francisco for two

33
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:12,690
years and can vouch for
the benefits of co living.

34
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,870
I made lifelong friends there and learn
a lot from my roommates across a wide

35
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:19,860
variety of technical topics.

36
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,210
Kol living is an evolution of the
dormitory model that colleges have

37
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,560
traditionally offered,

38
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,740
but education is no longer a four year
endeavor that will fulfill all skill set

39
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:34,470
requirements for a job for
the rest of your lifetime.

40
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,770
Technology is rapidly changing every
aspect of society and in order to remain

41
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:41,820
relevant in this field,

42
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,620
we have to move to a model of
continuous lifetime education.

43
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,810
Ai Is the new electricity.

44
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:53,811
It is fast becoming a crucial elements
to every business across every industry

45
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,650
to help make better data driven decisions,
products and services.

46
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,840
That's where school of
AI campuses come in.

47
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,110
Our residents will come
from all walks of life,

48
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,550
all backgrounds and all ages.
It's not just for millennials.

49
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,820
We've already partnered with our first
residential advisor in San Francisco

50
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,820
named James [inaudible] naira.

51
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,980
James manages an existing
52 bedroom community,

52
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,070
has his own brand and an existing
applicant pipeline associated with it.

53
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,920
What we're doing is acting as a global
realtor that will bring him high quality

54
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,430
housing candidates with an
interest in AI technology for free.

55
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,810
If you have an existing brand and
landing page, that's totally fine.

56
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,700
We'll build an application form for
new residents that will fit into your

57
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:50,701
existing applicant's pipeline and work
with you to ensure all the details fit

58
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:52,420
your needs.

59
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,660
I understand that maintaining occupancy
levels at 100% can be a challenge,

60
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:02,821
so having school of Ai Wizards occupied
a portion of your property is fine.

61
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,580
You don't have to reserve every
room for school of AI applicants,

62
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,320
but they should get preferential access.
As our community grows,

63
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,150
so will the pool of applicants and we
believe that eventually we'll be able to

64
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:20,710
provide more than enough applicants
to occupy the entire property.

65
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,770
We take no profit from this.

66
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:28,750
We just want to provide a safe living
space to our community that helps them

67
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:31,240
grow and connect with their peers.

68
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,650
If you manage any type of Co living
property, be it urban, rural,

69
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,420
and network of multiple properties.

70
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:42,400
A remote island apply using the Google
form in the video description to join our

71
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:47,050
team. We are open to all forms
of living arrangements. Ideally,

72
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:48,700
there are multiple options,

73
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:53,440
meaning both shared rooms and
private rooms. Once accepted,

74
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:58,441
we'll add your name and campus to our
global directory and promote it every

75
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,020
week.

76
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,760
That means a consistent pipeline of
technology focused applicants that share a

77
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,110
set of values.

78
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,180
Residential advisers get access to a
private slack channel that I'll personally

79
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,800
be engaging with daily, just like I
currently do in the Dean's channel.

80
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,140
First access to any school of AI
announcements via our newsletter and a

81
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:23,140
collection of resources to
help grow their community.

82
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,410
Each of our residential advisers will
receive a poster with our seven values and

83
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:32,290
mission that they can hang somewhere
on the wall on the property.

84
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:37,410
They are expected to help organize weekly
study sessions amongst residents and

85
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,420
provide a basic set of amenities.

86
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,780
That means that residents
will pay one monthly fee,

87
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,670
decided by the residential advisors
that will include the rent, utilities,

88
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,700
Wifi, basic supplies, cleaning services,

89
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:56,701
and easy access to a washer and dryer
school of AI campuses are meant to offer

90
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:02,170
each resident wizard academic support
in the form of weekly study sessions.

91
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:07,340
The ability to live with peers and a
resident advisor that supports their

92
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,210
learning journey.

93
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,480
They'll also have their basic amenities
taken care of so they can focus more of

94
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:16,130
their time and energy on learning.

95
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,460
And of course a vibrant built in social
life in the form of roommates and access

96
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:23,990
to local school of AI events.

97
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,210
We are keeping applications open for
only two weeks. So if you are interested,

98
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:30,170
apply now.

99
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,210
We'll start promoting each of our campuses
to the larger community so they can

100
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:38,570
apply to be residents shortly after that.
Wizards,

101
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,560
if you don't manage a big
property, but no, someone who does,

102
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,860
please refer them to this
video so they can apply.

103
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,490
I need your help on this one.
Let's upgrade education together.

104
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,640
Please subscribe for more
programming videos. And for now,

105
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,250
I've got to serve my wizards,
so thanks for watching.
