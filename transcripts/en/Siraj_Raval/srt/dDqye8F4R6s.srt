1
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,023
Yeah.

2
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,620
Keep fighting the good fight. Don't
be afraid of the fence. Actually.

3
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,610
A healthy bit of caution is
good, but a, yeah. Anyway,

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,480
check my temperature.
Jama got a fever.

5
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,900
It's spelled BTC. Yeah. I'm a believer.

6
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,880
The revolution started back in
2008 to Toshi. Put Pen to paper,

7
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:43,100
said it ain't too late. The
future is now, but money exchange.

8
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:44,100
It's so behind.

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,340
Let's make currency and cryptography
align money and cryptography of Judah for

10
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,200
Matt. Send a mill in the
ministry to Kenya and back.

11
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,340
No middle men, no limits, no charge
backs. Make them digital stacks.

12
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,320
No wasting time on green backs.

13
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,930
Who ruptured the zen to me
or power centrally. Cajun us.

14
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:10,230
We ain't Bree. Oh, so many fearful
leaf network is done by many.

15
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,300
Not just the view. If you want to join
open, no wallet and we'll include you.

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,770
That's right. I'm the big
coin. Barron. Just follow me.

17
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:21,870
I'll take you the big coin habit.

18
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,730
Jeez.

19
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,040
Our rock block chains play
in all them stock gain.

20
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,490
It's a public record with
no central effort. Ah,

21
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,470
open source protocol. A straight
up fact. Minors carry. Yes. Hr Two,

five, six on they backs. They'd be
gender written. 21 million coins.

23
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,670
Make it rain. Big Coin every
day. Free to join banking.

24
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,140
Millions of peeps from China to Brazil.

25
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,440
Every one wants a piece
of Dat digital shill.

26
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,440
They say absolute power
corrupts absolutely. Well,

27
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,580
big coin trucks that
very same power rudely.

28
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,790
I'm looking at you politicians who lie
you'd be running but ain't no where to

29
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:33,270
hide. It's a network that
proves it's fair. Red.

30
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:37,200
Just we don't need a God in encryption.
We trust.

31
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:42,201
I have bitcoin dreams of a world that
is free of fantasy of BTC creativity.

32
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,340
If you were big coin bore year,
stand up.

33
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,880
We the chosen ones who never give up.

34
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,740
We'll throw this piece from the west
to the east federal. Try to stop us.

35
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:25,240
We can't be policed.

36
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,860
It started with one and now with millions,
but just way,

37
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,480
pretty soon it's Billy
is. Yeah, that's right.

Think about it.
