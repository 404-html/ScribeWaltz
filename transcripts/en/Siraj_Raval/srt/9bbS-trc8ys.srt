1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,841
Hello world,

2
00:00:00,841 --> 00:00:05,100
it's Saroj and how are you
supposed to start an AI startup?

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,300
I'm going to go over the steps
you need to take to do this.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,310
Using a combination of my own startup
experience and analyzing some best

5
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:18,870
practices that some recently successful
AI startups have implemented.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,670
The public's interest in AI will continue
to rise in the coming years and we're

7
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:26,760
just at the start of a
larger AI revolution.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,620
Innovative startups continue to pop up
every single week. Tetra, for example,

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,710
uses recent advances in speech recognition
to generate detailed notes from your

10
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:37,614
phone calls.

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,770
Hyper science extracts data from
forms easily using optical character

12
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:47,841
recognition and jet lore uses consumer
behavior as input to a model able to

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,610
output structured data. So it's
2018 and you want to get in on this.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,130
Your first step is to study AI.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,780
You can't create an AI solution if
you yourself don't understand how this

16
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:02,640
amazing technology works,
right?

17
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,020
I've got some great free playlists for
you to help you get started with this.

18
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,590
If you're just getting started,
watch them in this order.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,430
Learn Python for data science,
then intro to tensorflow,

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,990
then intro to deep learning and lastly
the math of intelligence. Additionally,

21
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:23,991
Andrew Ng's newer deep learning that
AI course is a must have and Jeremy

22
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,120
Howard's fast on AI course
is excellent as well.

23
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,390
My favorite book on deep learning is the
deep learning book by Ian Goodfellow.

24
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,790
It's free online and where it really
excels is in helping you get to terms with

25
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:39,540
the math of deep learning.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Deep learning has proven to outperform
every other ml model almost every time on

27
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:49,050
a wide range of tasks so the
hype is justified. However,

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,000
you should really know how the other
machine learning models work because there

29
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:59,001
are use cases where you don't have access
to a lot of data and you just need to

30
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:02,580
make a simple prediction.
In those cases,

31
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,610
support vector machines or even a simple
decision tree would be a more useful

32
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:10,110
approach than a deep neural network.

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,320
The only way to know what model to use
and when to use it is to develop an

34
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:20,430
intuition and that comes after studying
using a wide variety of sources.

35
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,070
All the ones I've talked about
will be in the description.

36
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,660
Once you've got a grasp of the
landscape of algorithms that make up AI,

37
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,680
you've got to find a problem
that you feel passionate about.

38
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,660
Some of the most successful companies
in the world were started because the

39
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:41,310
founders were trying to solve a
problem that they themselves faced.

40
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,670
Write down a list of problems that
you or your friends have faced in your

41
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:49,050
personal lives that you would like solved.

42
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,520
These will very likely be good candidates
for problems that you are passionate

43
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:58,521
about solving since those affected are
people that you very much care about.

44
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,310
If you can't think of any good ones,

45
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,200
you could also use social media to search
proactively for people looking for a

46
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:06,034
solution.

47
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,870
Search in quotes for words and phrases
that indicate that the poster is

48
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:15,871
frustrated by something or looking to
solve a problem like how do I or can't

49
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:18,580
seem to this.
We'll work on Reddit,

50
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,440
Twitter just about any community where
a target market might congregate on,

51
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,740
but perhaps the best way that I've found
to find problems is to travel and meet

52
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:30,070
people.

53
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,330
I couch surfed around Europe for three
months a few years ago and happened to

54
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:36,790
stay with Alex Maccaw in London.

55
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,060
He gave me the inspiration necessary to
change my trajectory in my early years

56
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:45,040
of university from economics
to computer science,

57
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,370
one of the most impactful
changes I'd made in my life.

58
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,870
It's what got me to eventually start
a robotics startup, lucid robotics.

59
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,790
While I was a third year
student at Columbia and more
recently traveling through

60
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:02,770
South and South East Asia for four months
helped put things into perspective for

61
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:03,250
me.

62
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,020
I left the bubble of Silicon Valley and
got to see problems firsthand that real

63
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:12,280
people faced in their day to day lives,
problems related to infrastructure,

64
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,850
banking, communication,
and of course education.

65
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,040
That was the one that really affected me.

66
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,160
Simple conversations I had with locals
compounded into later experiences that

67
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:28,030
resulted in a larger plan to educate
the world on AI by making my content the

68
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,130
product as you,
Elon Musk says,

69
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:34,810
being an entrepreneur is like eating
glass and staring into the abyss of death.

70
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,390
If you don't have the
passion to solve a problem,

71
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,360
you're not going to stick around.
When the going gets tough.

72
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,180
No matter how many negative
comments I've gotten,

73
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,540
I've always persevered
because it's not about me.

74
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,290
It's about solving AI.
Once you have a problem to solve,

75
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,490
it's time to do some market research.
Who are you selling to?

76
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,300
Where are they going to buy it?
How much would they pay?

77
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,960
What are the competing products
or services in this space?

78
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,340
What's the cost to deploy? What does
the history of this market look like?

79
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,390
Usually.
Dot.

80
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:11,890
Gov's and big data analytics firms have
publicly available reports on this.

81
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,580
Generally AI startups,
our class into two varieties.

82
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,920
There are the horizontal AI startups.

83
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,840
These are working on one fundamental
problem that would serve many different

84
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,620
industries like say,
general natural language processing.

85
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,340
Then there's the vertical AI startups.

86
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,490
These are solving problems for a very
specific type of customer belonging to one

87
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,600
specific industry.

88
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,880
Just about every major tech company
is working really actively on AI.

89
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,930
They're able to hire all the Ai Rock
stars from Hinton [inaudible], Macoun.

90
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,010
They've got the talent,

91
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,330
they've got the massive amounts of data
they've collected from users over the

92
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:57,040
years, which remains closed only
to their teams. These tech giants,

93
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,520
a huge advantage when it comes
to building horizontal products.

94
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,700
That can apply to many industries like
image recognition or language translation

95
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,300
or infrastructure.

96
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,510
But the advantage of that you have is
that you can move fast on a single problem

97
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:18,200
vertically. They don't have the time
to tackle every single niche problem,

98
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,450
but you do.
And as a whole,

99
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,860
they're focused on the consumer more
than they're focused on the enterprise.

100
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,330
So a niche solution that would help
companies would be a great choice.

101
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,810
Create a landing page that describes your
product with a simple email signup to

102
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:39,050
get notified of release and
share it on social media.

103
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,970
One way to raise awareness of your
product is to raise your own personal

104
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:47,630
profile,
establish herself as an AI thought leader,

105
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,370
create blog posts or other content that
answers fundamental questions about Ai.

106
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,880
Build an audience, see if you
get any signups. If you do,

107
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,720
especially after you've stated what
the price of your product will be,

108
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,580
it means there's a demand for what you
could be offering. This is crucial.

109
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,520
I went through the whole
process of raising money,

110
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,650
building a product and the team,

111
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,680
my last startup only to find that the
elder care market didn't want a $5,000

112
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:18,260
robot to help pick
things up off the floor.

113
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,620
People with als would much
prefer a simpler tool.

114
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,920
I was too obsessed with the solution.
Not The problem.

115
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,840
If you remove AI from the company,
but it still has a valuable product,

116
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,410
you're on the right track,
but if AI is your only thing,

117
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,400
then neither the customer nor
investors will be excited about it.

118
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,970
Once you've done your market research,
it's time to build a product,

119
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,480
but before you build a model,
you've got to collect, organize,

120
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:47,000
and label your data as much as you can.

121
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,980
The quality of the data is usually
the most important part of the machine

122
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:56,240
learning pipeline, even more so
than the architecture of your model.

123
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,420
The phrase garbage in,
garbage out to comes to mind.

124
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,590
The easy way to get data is
to search for public datasets.

125
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,890
There's an awesome list
of datasets on get hub.

126
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,930
The University of California.

127
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:13,950
Earvin has a giant ml repository of
data sets and of course Kaggle has some

128
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:17,780
great ones as well.
If those don't work.

129
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,430
Another way is to create data
yourself using an existing data set,

130
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,790
like if you're trying to
classify handwritten characters,

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,890
you could generate new data points from
existing ones by adding some noise via a

132
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:33,560
distribution.
If you've got unlabeled data,

133
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,340
crowd sourcing via Amazon's
Mechanical Turk is a great option.

134
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,770
You could pay people to label it for you.

135
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,600
There are also data marketplaces out there
like data circle where you can buy or

136
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:48,800
exchange data sets directly
from other people. Lastly,

137
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,060
if you're feeling creative,

138
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,240
you can scrape the data yourself using
python in a library like scrap high or a

139
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,820
web service that does this for you,
like dig or not.com.

140
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,990
When it comes to building models,
tensor flow is still the best,

141
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:09,000
most battle tested machine
learning framework out there
and there's a whole host

142
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:13,080
of tools in the tensorflow ecosystem
like tensorflow serving that,

143
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,610
make it production ready,

144
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,800
build a model and train it on
your data via a service like AWS,

145
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,460
Google cloud or Floyd hub.

146
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,000
Use Your model to make a prediction
and this is your product.

147
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,170
More data means smarter
algorithms means better products,

148
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,830
means more users,
means better data and the cycle repeats.

149
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,030
Raising money is a way to
accelerate the scaling process.

150
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,610
The ICO route may be hot right now,

151
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:42,720
but if you're in it for the longterm
and don't want to mess around with

152
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,970
legalities,
I'd avoid this for now.

153
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:50,090
A friend of mine who was the first
designer for Atherium didn't do an ICO for

154
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:51,600
his company balance.

155
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,870
He instead raised money using a crowd
funding tool called the we funder.

156
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,810
He's reasons were really inspiring
and I've got an article on it in the

157
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:04,140
description. Venture capital
is of course another option,

158
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:08,040
and while it's easy to convince some
vcs that your product is cool by just

159
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,900
repeating a bunch of buzz words,

160
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,200
the best ones will understand
the technology well,

161
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,280
so be prepared to explain the
technicalities of it to them.

162
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,570
You're always in a better position to
talk to vcs when you've already got to

163
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,340
cashflow than if you don't.

164
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,600
That's why I got rejected
by so many vcs in New York.

165
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,850
I hadn't proven my robot would sell.

166
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,320
Now I've got a few offers to invest
in what I'm doing since I've built an

167
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:36,510
audience so I can afford to be picky,

168
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:40,620
but I'm not focused on raising money
right now. When it comes to hiring,

169
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:44,010
there's a limited supply of talent
and it's distributed globally,

170
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,570
so it makes sense to hire globally.
Look at the leaderboard on Kaggle.

171
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,660
The first hires you make
are the most important.

172
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,850
I worked really hard to find the right
fit to help me with editing my videos.

173
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:01,260
If you really love something,
it's hard to ever let go control of it,

174
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,010
but if you find the right person,
it becomes much easier.

175
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,570
As Steve Jobs said,

176
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,630
the newest thing that happens is when
you get a core group of, uh, you know,

177
00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:15,490
10 great people that it becomes self
policing as to who they let into that

178
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:16,120
group.

179
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,310
At some point,
you'll be able to exit,

180
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:23,200
whether that be through an aqua hire or
buy one of the big tech companies or an

181
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:27,280
IPO. And if all else fails, there's
always the consulting route.

182
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:32,470
It's not as sexy as building a product,
but hey, it puts bread on the table.

183
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,680
Find a couple of friends
and start a consulting firm.

184
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:40,630
Get some initial clients and slowly
get more impressive brands on board.

185
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,330
As you prove yourself,
I hope my tips help.

186
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,030
Please subscribe for more
programming videos. And for now,

187
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,730
I've got to start up to grow.
So thanks for watching.
