1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,800
Introvert or extrovert. With social
media, you can be both. Hello world,

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,830
it's Siraj and not many developers
realize how important the role of social

3
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:13,710
media is in their careers.
In this video,

4
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:18,711
I'll show you how you can use different
social media platforms to help you learn

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,420
cutting edge technologies,
network and promote your own brand.

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,560
When I was working at Twillio
on the developer education team,

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,430
we had to learn the art of
marketing to developers.

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,220
Developers are a smart bunch.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,370
Normal marketing methods
don't work on them.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,480
They know bs when they
see it like certain ICO.

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,270
So it's best to be upfront,
honest,

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,990
and crystal clear about whatever
your message to them is.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,500
That means you can just
spam them with generic ads.

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,880
It has to happen organically.
Your message has to be targeted.

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,910
You have to be able to relate to them
and what better way to interact with

16
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:05,820
developers then the social
media platforms they live on.

17
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,260
So let's start with Twitter.
Twitter is my favorite social network.

18
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:12,180
I use it like an RSS feed.

19
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,160
I followed all the people I really admire
and when I spend my time scrolling on

20
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:19,680
Twitter,
unlike every other social network,

21
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,650
I'm actually learning
and improving myself.

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,690
Whether it's through book recommendations,
Techno Philosophical Tweet,

23
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:29,910
storms, board, young Macoun,

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,680
or staying up to date with the latest
research from the AI or blockchain

25
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:38,700
industries. I could start listing
a bunch of smart people to follow,

26
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:43,410
but instead I'll just say go to my
Twitter profile and see the couple hundred

27
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:47,190
people I'm following. Follow
them one by one. Also,

28
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,720
if you go to lists and see the lists
I'm a member of that other Twitter users

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,770
have created,

30
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,960
you'll very fast start seeing people who
are influential in computer science and

31
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:59,580
you can follow them easily.

32
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,990
You want to be ruthlessly
precise about who you follow.

33
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,020
These are the people you
are letting influence you,

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,220
but Twitter's best use case is networking.

35
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:16,140
I've used Twitter to directly engage
with brands and people I care about.

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,610
I've coordinated collaboration's through
Twitter's direct messaging feature.

37
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,620
Many opportunities have emerged.

38
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,440
It's a much more accessible and
faster way to interact. Then email,

39
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:32,370
so if there's someone you want to reach
out to before sending them an email,

40
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,830
see if they have an
active Twitter profile.

41
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,010
Chances are you'll get
a reply much faster.

42
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,520
I'm also always promoting
my videos on Twitter.

43
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,150
I even start generating hype
for my videos beforehand.

44
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:48,540
Sometimes weeks in advance,
which results in more views.

45
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,080
You can do the same for any
project you are working on,

46
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:54,750
whether it's code or a technical content.

47
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,350
The Twitter community is
technical and collaborative,

48
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:01,120
so if tweet out quality content,

49
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,800
it will be retweeted
endlessly so on to read it.

50
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,520
I've talked a lot about using the
machine learning sub reddit as a primary

51
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:14,020
resource of mine to stay up to date
with the latest news in artificial

52
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:17,260
intelligence and it still is.
However,

53
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,710
it's not the only surprise that
that's relevant to this field.

54
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,800
I've compiled a list
of other ones I visit.

55
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,820
Everything I talk about in this video,
we'll be in the video description.

56
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,060
My second favorite is data is beautiful.

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,270
There are some really
inspiring visualizations there.

58
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:37,480
If you're ever feeling
disillusioned with the field,

59
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,900
it's not a great platform for networking,

60
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,080
but it will definitely keep you updated
if you visit often and don't go on too

61
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:47,890
many sub reddit tangents.

62
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,280
I've also found out the hard way that
reddit is really strict about posting your

63
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:57,340
content too much without
contributing to discussions,

64
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,250
so if you have something
valuable to share,

65
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:05,110
make sure to balance it by engaging
with other posts just as much.

66
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,550
Speaking of engagement,

67
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,770
Facebook gets a lot of hate these days
for profiting off of user data and it

68
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:14,440
should,
but regardless,

69
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:17,980
it's still a great platform
to find career opportunities.

70
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,370
There are a few Facebook groups I've found
that are full of helpful and creative

71
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:26,470
technologists in both AI and blockchain.

72
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:31,390
The great thing about Facebook is that
everyone is using their real identity,

73
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,890
so if you actively engage with
people in a specific Facebook group,

74
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,560
you will become known in that group.

75
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,820
It's a fast track to close
relationships with others in the field.

76
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,300
Also posting code and content in these
groups will give you feedback fast and

77
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:52,840
you can post it in a bunch of
groups all at once with no limits.

78
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,840
Prepare yourself for a
notification storm though,

79
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,760
but notifications aren't just limited
to Facebook. What's up youtube?

80
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,480
Youtube is a great platform for education,

81
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,510
although it didn't use to be so many
amazing creators have been sharing high

82
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:14,560
quality free content on here.
When it comes to technical content,

83
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,450
there's of course sent
decks who's indepth?

84
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,980
Python tutorials are very helpful.
Three blue,

85
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:25,660
one brown who makes some of the best
math animations in the world and you'll

86
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:30,661
shift men who teaches creative coding
via javascript and a young 10 may box

87
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:35,110
sheet who is like a younger version of
me and will probably take over the world

88
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:38,410
one day.
As for nontechnical channels,

89
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,260
definitely check out charisma on command.

90
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,550
I want you guys to be confident
and good communicators.

91
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,350
This dude has all the secrets. If you
ever present your project at a conference,

92
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,860
you're going to need these
skills and as always,

93
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:58,861
remember to download a chrome extension
to watch these videos at two x or three

94
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:00,074
x speed.

95
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:05,180
You will save so much time that you can
instead dedicate to other things like

96
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:07,040
spending it on hacker news,

97
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,250
a very technical social network run
by the popular startup accelerator y

98
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:16,340
Combinator. I find that it's
a great learning resource,

99
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:18,980
but more so than the links being shared.

100
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,690
The comments never failed to educate
me thanks to the voting system.

101
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,560
The best,

102
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,560
most thoughtful comments percolate
up to the top and make no mistake.

103
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,660
The developers here are
viciously skeptical of claims
that are not thoroughly

104
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:36,020
backed by evidence,

105
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:41,050
so rest assured the top comment on any
link here is likely high quality hacker

106
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:46,580
news has a very sophisticated
algorithm to prevent a boat spamming.

107
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:50,450
So don't just share your content link
with your friend and directly to up vote.

108
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,300
If it is quality,
it will rise itself.

109
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,540
I found linkedin to be a great tool to
find quality business relationships.

110
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,940
I've made a fair number of deals through
the direct messaging system and sharing

111
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:08,840
my content on linkedin has proven
to get it out in front of some very

112
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:10,100
influential people.

113
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,910
Hashtags seemed to make a
big difference on Linkedin,

114
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:18,860
so be sure to add those to your posts
when you can just don't overdo it like

115
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,783
this guy.

116
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,620
I will say though that I don't find the
Linkedin newsfeed to be particularly

117
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:28,460
interesting, especially since
there is an ad every few posts,

118
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,330
but linkedin ranks very
highly on Google search,

119
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:36,200
so make sure to sell yourself
well here in your profile.

120
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,310
It may be the first thing people see
about you when they search your brand on

121
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:44,600
Google. Quora is another social
network for professionals.

122
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,030
You can learn a lot from Quora,

123
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:52,090
especially if you find similar questions
and cross check the top answers for

124
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:57,311
similarity that what you can find the
answer you're looking for and minimize the

125
00:07:57,321 --> 00:08:01,610
bias of the poster.
Quora is also great for promotion.

126
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,640
If you're answering questions left and
right on Quora and your answers are high

127
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:10,790
quality, people will start
reaching out to you. Anecdotally,

128
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:15,560
I met a guy at a recent conference in
New York City who was invited to speak

129
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,860
just because of the quality
of his Quora answers.

130
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,170
The same goes for stack
overflow developers get
poached all the time from this

131
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,300
social network for top answers.

132
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,490
It shows just how much you know about a
particular topic and perhaps the fastest

133
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:36,491
way to feel a part of a community is
to use chat platforms like slack or get

134
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:39,500
her.
Since the communication is so instant.

135
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,530
Slack chat rooms by
default are invite only,

136
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:47,270
but you can easily set up a web app
that you can send to other people to

137
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,910
automatically give them
access to your slack.

138
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:54,140
Community hours is now
approaching 20,000 developers,

139
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:59,141
which is pretty insane and you can find
an awesome list of slack communities for

140
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:05,391
all sorts of technical subcategories
on slow file.com lastly,

141
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,680
get hub is indeed a social network
and it's best as a learning resource.

142
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,970
If you have a question about some
concept or theory and computer science,

143
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:20,330
chances are someone has some working well
documented readable example code that

144
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:24,300
will give you a better
idea of how it works.

145
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,900
The key is to be able to search for it.
It's the right way.

146
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,990
You are ideally looking for code and it's
100 lines or less like this repo that

147
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:37,980
demos a blockchain and just a few lines
of python searching for keywords like

148
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,980
lines or example and your topic.
