00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,930
Hello world.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,930
It's Saroj and I'm excited to announce
that school of Ai is launching a research

3
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:09,750
lab thanks to Google cloud.
We're going to offer 10 wizards,

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,780
1000 US dollars in cloud credits to
pursue some exciting research directions.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,690
There'll be our fall 2018 fellows.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,830
Each of them will receive personalized
mentoring ship from one of our

7
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:26,520
experienced advisers to help
them along their journey.

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,970
We'd like to grow the amateur research
community that means wizards from around

9
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:37,290
the world who aren't necessarily
a part of academia or industry.

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,600
We believe that by enabling them to do
research with a complete pipeline of

11
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:43,500
resources,

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,710
from funding to mentorship to helping
them submit their work to relevant

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,760
outlets, the entire AI community
will benefit. So here's the plan.

14
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,680
We've got some research directions that
we think are particularly exciting,

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,890
including metal learning or learning
to learn quantum machine learning,

16
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,350
one shot learning or learning from
small datasets and deep reinforcement

17
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:12,390
learning.
But these are all suggestions.

18
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,040
All 10 selected applicants will be able
to choose the research direction of

19
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,410
their choice.
With one caveat,

20
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,680
it has to be applied to
one of the United Nations,

21
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,440
17 sustainable development goals.

22
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,650
Current AI technology accessible to
anyone with an internet connection allows

23
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,810
ordinary people to create solutions to
accelerate the progress of each of these

24
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,950
school of AI research is applied research.

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,040
We make scientific discoveries
with specific real world
use cases in mind and we

26
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:51,450
need a new standard for how these
papers are presented. To that end,

27
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,050
I've assisted to deep
reinforcement learning engineers,

28
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,350
Laura Gracer and Kang while Lune and
helping build out a framework for deep

29
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:05,160
reinforcement learning
research called SLM lab.

30
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,320
It's design was guided by four
principles, modularity, simplicity,

31
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,740
analytical clarity,
and crucially reproducibility.

32
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,450
We've got several baseline reinforcement
learning algorithms implemented and

33
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:19,284
more to come.

34
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:24,510
SLM lab is an easy way to get started
with deep reinforcement learning research.

35
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,970
You can just build on top of an existing
algorithm and benchmark the results.

36
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,210
All the algorithms relevant environments
and testing tools are included in a

37
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:37,230
single repository.

38
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,430
We have both a static and
dynamic version of our paper.

39
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,820
The static version is a pdf,
like all papers are,

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,970
but the dynamic version
is a Jupiter notebook.

41
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,220
We've hosted it on Google Colab,

42
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:55,221
which means that anyone who reads the
paper can also view the results and a demo

43
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,130
of SLM lab by running code
themselves in their browser.

44
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,780
No dependencies necessary.
We want this to serve as an example,

45
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,870
school of AI researchers should create
both a static and a dynamic version of

46
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:13,000
their research paper.
So I hope you're hyped.

47
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,930
You'll find a link to the
application in the video description.

48
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,040
We'll take one week to choose
applications and announced them publicly.

49
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,100
So if you're interested,
hurry up and sign up now.
