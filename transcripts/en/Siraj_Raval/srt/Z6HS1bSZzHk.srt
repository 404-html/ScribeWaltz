1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,710
Hello world,
it's a Raj.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:06,240
And today I want to talk about
blockchain for supply chain management.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,140
In this video I'll talk about
the market for supply chain,

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,580
how blockchain can affect it.
Uh,

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,370
I'll demo this APP that I've compiled
and I've run locally called asset tracker

6
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:21,150
that uses solidity, uh, to create
an asset on the blockchain.

7
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:25,770
This is on the test rink be
etherium network and I'll
talk about how that works.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,240
I'll go over the only legit blockchain
supply company that I could find called

9
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:31,800
Sync Fab,
how they work,

10
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:35,520
what they're doing with their
version of an ERC 20 token.

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,350
And then I'll cut it out.

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,380
I'll code out in solidity and asset
tracker that runs on the theory and

13
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:46,800
blockchain. Okay, so that's what
we're going to do in this video.

14
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:50,520
We're going to create a decentralized
supply chain app for asset tracking. Okay.

15
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:55,521
So the supply chain industry is huge
and it's only going to grow over time.

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,070
So the Americas, Asia, Africa, right?

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,810
These are all markets that are big and
the developing countries in particular,

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,560
um,

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,880
particularly on the coast of Africa are
going to grow exponentially over time.

20
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,620
And parts of Asia as well.

21
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:14,190
So the supply chain industry
is not going anywhere.

22
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:16,740
It's been around for a
while and it will be,

23
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,310
it's here right now and it
will be here in the future. Uh,

24
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:22,680
and so this is a very big industry.

25
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:25,380
And for those of you who don't
know what the supply chain is,

26
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:30,030
whenever you are the, the path that
any product you have in your home,

27
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:33,360
your shirt, your desk, your
computer, you know, whatever,

28
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,570
it follows a path of intermediaries to
get from the factory where it was created

29
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:43,930
to you. And that chain, uh, includes
distributors. It includes, um,

30
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,040
uh,
procurement officers,

31
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,630
people who are quality
inspection officers. It goes
through different channels,

32
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:55,620
right? It's not just like direct
from manufacturer to the end user.

33
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:58,920
The consumer rights, there's like four
or five, six, sometimes, you know,

34
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:03,000
a dozen intermediaries in between there.
And that process,

35
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:05,880
a lot of data can get lost
in that process, right?

36
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,100
Some quality assurance person could say,
well,

37
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:10,470
I thought that it was going to
come yesterday, but it didn't.

38
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,870
And someone delayed a shipment from this
city, this city. And so that kind of, uh,

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,230
that kind of error just
trickles throughout the entire
supply chain and can ruin

40
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:22,390
everything, right? So, uh, there,

41
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,270
there are big problems
with the supply chain.

42
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:26,520
But what I found very
interesting is, you know, in a,

43
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:31,230
in a survey that a bunch of professionals,
a sea level professionals were asked,

44
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:33,420
what is the aspect of digitization?

45
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:37,710
Hilarious word that you believe will
drive the most value in the future.

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,010
Most of them said supply chain visibility,
right?

47
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:44,880
So usually you don't hear that
much about the supply chain.

48
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:47,870
When you're thinking about
applications of blockchain, you're,

49
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:50,760
you're thinking about banking,
you're thinking about, you know,

50
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:54,540
perhaps real estate or
betting or gambling.

51
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,410
But I believe that the supply chain is,
as of now,

52
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,380
the biggest industry for blockchain,
like this is where the, the,

53
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,680
the most immediate real world use case
comes from, right? And the reason is,

54
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:13,210
is because there's so many problems
with the supply chain as of now that

55
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:16,320
blockchain could help fix a,

56
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,870
so let's think about all the ways
that the supply chain is wrong, right?

57
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,900
The supply chain is a sub optimal.

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,630
So one would be ocean frights for example.

59
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,890
They account for 90% of goods
traded globally as a huge number.

60
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:34,420
90% of goods traded globally.
Enter the ocean fright,

61
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,510
enter an ocean freight at some point.
Now the,

62
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,710
the problem with ocean freights
is shipping information
usually traveled through

63
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:43,600
numerous companies and contractors.

64
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,710
And this can cause a delay and remember
a delight anywhere in the supply chain,

65
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,650
not just costs time. It
costs real money, right?

66
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:55,570
Because these intermediaries are all
right now trying to predict what day

67
00:03:55,571 --> 00:03:57,100
something will come to them,
the product,

68
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:59,530
and when they can then
inspect it or whatever,

69
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:03,700
their job is a and then they can send
it on throughout the rest of the chain.

70
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,740
So there's a lot of problems here when
it comes to planning and forecasting,

71
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,630
asset management, visibility, procurement,
manufacturing, financials, right? There's,

72
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,320
there's a lot to keep track of, right?
For APP, at least for one company.

73
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,360
But the problem is when
it comes to supply chain,

74
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:23,740
there's not just one company
involved, right? Ideally,
you know, if I wanted a desk,

75
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,970
I would just go directly to the factory
or I would ping the factory and say I

76
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:28,804
want a desk.

77
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,160
And that desk could just like be drone
shipped over to me and that's it.

78
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,770
But that's unfortunately
not the way the world works.

79
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:38,980
There's a lot of intermediaries there,
right?

80
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,660
How much are you supposed to pay a driver?

81
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,360
When are they supposed to know when
a certain product has been shipped?

82
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,680
How can all of them trust each
other to have done their job? Right?

83
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:51,580
How can the driver trust that the
package was delivered at this point?

84
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,800
How can the consumer,
the end consumer,

85
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:58,720
no trust that the product that they're
using is an actual quality product, right?

86
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,070
Because if all this data is
stored in a database on a website,

87
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,300
any of the intermediaries could
easily modify that data. Right. To,

88
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,970
to fit their best interest.
Right? Because remember,

89
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:13,150
there's not one company in the supply
chain, there are multiple companies.

90
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,470
So the problem is that they all
have competing interests. So it,

91
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,540
you have to trust all of them.
And this is a problem, right?

92
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,940
Because any of them can just
modify something and say, Oh,

93
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:25,510
you know what the date for this
product was meant for this day.

94
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,630
And then the other person will say,
no, we had a deal. And they'll say, oh,

95
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:32,530
well look at the database.
And they changed it. And you
just have to go with that,

96
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,550
right? Because you can't, you, you
just have to trust them as of now. Uh,

97
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,430
and this is a problem. Right? And that's
just, that's just based on trust alone,

98
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,550
right? So trust is a big problem
when it comes to supply chain.

99
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,910
All of these intermediaries
with competing interests,

100
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,680
these businesses have to trust each
other to create this cohesive chain of

101
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:57,560
operations to get a product from
the factory to the consumer.

102
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,200
So there has to be a better way. And
that's just one problem, right? There's,

103
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,310
there are other problems.

104
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:07,250
It's difficult for small businesses
to get into the game, right?

105
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,780
Like if you're a small business,

106
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,860
usually manufacturers only want to
deal with big companies. Why? Again,

107
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:14,710
it comes down to trust.
There.

108
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,560
There has to be some reputation because
these big companies have been ripped off

109
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:19,400
so many times.

110
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,210
They want to trust a larger company
with a huge history of clientele because

111
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:26,960
they have to, or else they would
lose money. But as a small business,

112
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:28,490
you don't have that reputation.

113
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,440
Number two is that there's an
opaque procurement process.

114
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:38,390
31% of buyers site finding
the right manufacturing
suppliers is a standard issue

115
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,710
in the production process. Okay? That's
another one. Outdated technology, right?

116
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:45,830
We're talking about decades old system.

117
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:50,150
Some of these supply chain services
are running on Ms dos. Yes.

118
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,130
Really little to no Ip protection. That's
a, that's a whole nother can of worms,

119
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:58,700
right? Ip, intellectual
property. Who owns what,

120
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,380
when was something created?

121
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,460
Who's putting a timestamp and a
creation stamp on what these are?

122
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,270
These are stamps that should be immutable
and right now they are totally mutable,

123
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,160
mutable,
or modifiable.

124
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,330
So the solution to this is the blockchain.
Okay?

125
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:18,440
And I'm surprised that there aren't more
companies that are using the blockchain

126
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,730
to make the supply chain
process more efficient, right?

127
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:27,620
This is a huge opportunity
to, to make, uh, a business,

128
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:28,160
right?
This is,

129
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,750
this is an opportunity to create a
sustainable business using blockchain

130
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:35,690
technology, supply chain.
There it is. Now there's,

131
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,710
because there are so many different sub
applications within the supply chain

132
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:41,810
industry, right? Digital ownership.

133
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,840
Who owns what proof of origin did this
crop come at that was this crop organic?

134
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,180
What that did? Was it
handled properly? Um,

135
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,510
who handled it wa how many
intermediaries did it go through?

136
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,520
Trusted maintenance tracking.

137
00:07:55,521 --> 00:08:00,521
Did this product go through these specific
intermediaries that we wanted it to?

138
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,920
Did it go through this quality
assurance process we wanted it to,

139
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,180
did they water it? Did they peel it of
any thing that it didn't need? You know,

140
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:11,690
if it's a vegetable,
there's a lot of things that you know,

141
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,830
that there's a lot of issues regarding
trust that all these intermediaries have

142
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:20,060
to deal with.
So what blockchain can do is,

143
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:23,090
if we think about a blockchain,
it is an immutable ledger. Okay.

144
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:27,170
So it's just think of it as like a
huge column of transactions, right?

145
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:28,760
Like an excel spreadsheet.

146
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,410
The best part about a blockchain is
that nobody can modify it, right?

147
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:36,140
Once it's been created,
no one can modify it.

148
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:39,740
It's read only access as a
read only data structure.

149
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,270
Now this is perfect for the supply chain.
Once one intermediary does their job,

150
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,680
they can, they can send as a
transaction that data to the blockchain.

151
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,330
Then the second part, the second
intermediary intermediary knows that this,

152
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,630
this person timestamped on the, now I
know, you know, whatever this person did,

153
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,210
and then they'll do the same.
And then that just keeps going.

154
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,340
And when it gets to the end consumer,
the end consumer can say, where did,

155
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,200
where,
where is my product from?

156
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,290
And rather than having to
trust the label on the product,

157
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,760
they can literally look at the blockchain
and it will show the history of where

158
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:15,680
that product has been.

159
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,413
Okay.

160
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,960
But that's just for the consumer,
right? We can think about the retailer.

161
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,180
We can think about the store,

162
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:24,760
we can think about the third
party logistics companies.

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,950
All of these intermediaries can
benefit, uh, from, from the blockchain,

164
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:33,390
like using the blockchain. In
this case right there, the,

165
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,300
the logistics companies are
notified of the origin of a product.

166
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,170
The retailer gets to, um,
add updates to its data,

167
00:09:41,171 --> 00:09:44,620
rector records automatically because
it's listening to the blockchain.

168
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,390
A store has full transparency on
every single delivery order. Uh,

169
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,680
there's a lot there,
you know,

170
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:55,681
because consumers can just scan a QR
code on some product and immediately know

171
00:09:56,381 --> 00:09:59,350
where, where it came from,
which is a perfect use case.

172
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,013
Okay.

173
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,670
But the problem is that like not many
companies have done this well by the way.

174
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,000
Like there's so many companies that say
we are supply chain for blockchain and

175
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:11,840
they don't actually have any,
uh, customers or clients,

176
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,340
but I found s sync fab and sync.
That seems pretty cool if we go to,

177
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,840
let's see,
blockchain documents.

178
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,070
Yeah.

179
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:26,860
And then in the presentation,
see some of their clients,

180
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,200
which I think is very,
very cool.

181
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:30,620
Okay.

182
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,800
They've got some governments here,
which is very cool. They're there.

183
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,770
They've been working with some
governments, uh, city of San Leandro,

184
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,210
a city of San Francisco, uh,
and some other ones. But yeah,

185
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:44,660
these are real clients of this
company has been tracking for years.

186
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:49,490
They'd been working with these
clients for years. And yeah,

187
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:52,340
I think that's pretty cool. So if you
want to look at a real world use case,

188
00:10:52,341 --> 00:10:56,270
it's sync fab manufacturing,
supply chain, blockchain.

189
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,740
Very cool stuff. But uh, right. So,

190
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,800
so instead of having multiple
versions of truth, right,

191
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:08,000
remember these companies are all
silos with their own databases.

192
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:12,140
What if there was one single force of
truth that they all had to listen to?

193
00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:16,110
Right? This is the source of truth
immutable. It will never change it.

194
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:16,761
Records cords,

195
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:21,200
everything that happens across the supply
chain and you can read it and you can

196
00:11:21,201 --> 00:11:23,690
look at it and it's,
it will never change and you can trust it.

197
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,770
Why I've gone into that in other videos,

198
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:32,420
why the blockchain is immutable,
just a youtube search,

199
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,430
Saroj blockchain

200
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,800
decentralized applications that that will
get you the, the first link. So, so how,

201
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,460
so how has a real world application
like sync fab actually doing this? Like,

202
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:46,880
what are they doing that makes,
uh,

203
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,540
that that gives them the ability to have
clients and build an actual business

204
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:56,050
around this? Right? So we think about
the manufacturer and the buyer rights.

205
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,140
So you have a manufacturer and they create
these products and then you have the

206
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:00,760
buyer.
They're buying these products.

207
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,990
What incentive does each of
these parties have to, to,

208
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,440
to deal with this service? Well,
for the hardware buyer, right?

209
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:11,440
The person who wants to buy some
hardware for the manufacturer,

210
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,280
it eliminates all the intermediaries
and brokers in that process,

211
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:19,870
which saves them money and they can
go directly to the manufacturer.

212
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,860
It's kind of like Uber for manufacturing
on demand manufacturing. Now,

213
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:27,670
if you've ever tried to contact
a manufacturer or a factory,

214
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,710
if you have a hardware
startup for example,

215
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,120
it's a lot of work and it's not easy
and it's a very dated process, right?

216
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,810
Sometimes you have to fill out a form and
then you have to wait like three weeks

217
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:39,940
and then they'll get back to
you. But with this, you just,

218
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:43,510
you get a listing of them on demand, I
want this. And then it comes back to you.

219
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,860
Now on the manufacturer side,
how were they incentivized? Well,

220
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,570
it eliminates their marketing costs.
Right now they have to find buyers.

221
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:56,320
So they have to put real
money into marketing their,
their manufacturing service.

222
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,160
But this, the smart contracts
that sink that provides,

223
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:03,670
connects them directly to the
buyer and guarantees payment.

224
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:08,200
So remember how I said how
small businesses usually
can't come into this game

225
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,440
because there's a reputation system while,
because of smart contracts,

226
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,790
they can because they can trust that
even small players will do their part

227
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,780
because there's a trusted,
uh,

228
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,510
blockchain in the middle that is a
smart contract that escrows the funds.

229
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,470
So you can't just back out of it because
there's a two of three escrow signature,

230
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,240
which we'll get into and they've got
their own token. It's called Mfg. Uh,

231
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,660
but I really found their smart
contract architecture. Interesting.

232
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,200
So a person has an identity,
they'll make a purchase order.

233
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:41,530
Now a purchase order can consist of so
many different features, right from,

234
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,340
from your id to your payment terms,
whatever your inspection report,

235
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,830
and then they'll make
a payment using that.

236
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,360
And it goes from in progress
canceled to complete it. They can,

237
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,250
a buyer can make a purchase order on
a smart using a smart contract on an

238
00:13:57,251 --> 00:14:01,810
immutable blockchain. That's it. So if
you've ever worked with the supply chain,

239
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:03,710
that's a, that's a new concept. It's,

240
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,900
it's never been that easy for a buyer to
just make a poor purchase order without

241
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:11,800
having to deal with at least two or
three intermediaries when it comes to

242
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:14,830
hardware manufacturing. But
with this, they can, right.

243
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:19,831
So this provides a high quality quotes
from the source on demand purchasing for

244
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:24,460
the, for the hardware innovators and a
direct connection to the manufacturing

245
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:27,820
facility, which eliminates marketing
costs for the manufacturers,

246
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,300
which I think they even have an APP,
which is super cool and it's,

247
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:36,220
it's a pretty app, you know, et Cetera, et
cetera. Uh, but yeah, that's the PR. It's,

248
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,530
it's a,
it's a 13 step process.

249
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,380
If we look at the logic
for the smart contract. Um,

250
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,320
but I think a better way to explain this
process is to really build a very bare

251
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:50,920
bones version of an asset
tracker. Okay. So let's do,

252
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,220
we'll create a bare bones
asset tracker, um, in Remix,

253
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:57,320
which is the solidity compiler.
Now,

254
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:02,321
sink fab has built their token on if
[inaudible] if your room's blockchain and

255
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:04,190
it's an Erc 20 token,

256
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,480
they also are using the ethereum
blockchain to builders smart contracts.

257
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,970
So what we're going to try
to do is replicate a version,

258
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,750
a version of sync fabs code,
but a very simple version of that code.

259
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:18,800
And all this is going to do is it's
going to track an assets on a blockchain.

260
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,900
So where do we start?

261
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:24,560
So the first thing we want to do if we're
going to structure this smart contract

262
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,540
is to say that we're going to do the
pragma mark solidity and then, uh,

263
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,640
say what version it is. So remember, uh,

264
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,730
the pragmas are known from whom cut
from compilers like GCC, you know,

265
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:41,490
they give the compiler additional
information on how to process the,

266
00:15:41,491 --> 00:15:46,280
the giving code that even tells the
compiler to use the highest version

267
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:50,030
available using this little mark above,
above that mark.

268
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,980
Okay. So, uh, once we
have that, we can say,

269
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,890
let's assume that we
have are an asset's file.

270
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,920
Now the assets file will contain more
metadata about the assets that we have,

271
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,680
assets that solidity.
Okay.

272
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:13,090
So in our asset tracker, so this is,
this is what it does. It's a tracker.

273
00:16:13,091 --> 00:16:16,210
Now normally we would have a
database on a web app that does this,

274
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,840
but because this contract will live
on a blockchain, nobody owns this.

275
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,310
So it's an unstoppable asset
tracker, right? Nobody can modify it.

276
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:29,320
Now this asset, this asset tracker
will contain an ID for the asset,

277
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,350
which we'll call, which is a
string, which we'll call Id.

278
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,720
And we'll create a getter and a setter
for this so we can get and set this, um,

279
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,820
whenever we create it,
right?

280
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:44,821
So we want to create an ID and then we
want to get it later so we can verify

281
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,223
it.

282
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,460
So this ID is going to return a string.

283
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,330
Yeah.

284
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,640
Or it's got the string,
which is the ID. Okay.

285
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,880
So there's that part and there's a
bunch of different types we could use

286
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:09,800
whenever we're coding solidity,
there's bools, there's, you
know, there's static. Um,

287
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:12,640
I've got a list of all the different
solidity types for you in the video

288
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:14,130
description.
So when,

289
00:17:14,131 --> 00:17:17,200
when it comes to tracking the data
structure that we're going to use,

290
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,470
I'm going to say,
let's create that data structure.

291
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:23,290
That data structure has called an asset,
right?

292
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:28,060
So what is contained in an asset?
Well, an asset has a name, right?

293
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,480
And asset has a description.
It has a source,

294
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:33,910
or we can call it a
manufacturer in this case.

295
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,200
And we've have some bullying that says,
has it been initialized? We're not,

296
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,130
which will tell the rest of the smart
contract whether or not it's been

297
00:17:42,131 --> 00:17:46,450
initialized. So, so this is
just a simple example. Remember,

298
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:50,280
assets can have so many different features
as we saw before. And acid can have,

299
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:54,450
you know, virgin control version numbers,
it can have a report, you know, et cetera.

300
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:55,860
But this is just a very simple example.

301
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,290
But in order to store these assets
were we are going to create these two

302
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:01,951
mappings.

303
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:06,300
That's going to allow us to store acid
properties as well as the relation

304
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,800
between assets and wallets
based on the you, you ids,

305
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,550
which are there unique
identification strings.

306
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,660
So it's a private asset store.
So that's the first,

307
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,150
um, mapping we'll create that's going
to be used to store assets under their

308
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:25,800
respective you,
you id,

309
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,330
and then we'll have
another mapping that maps.

310
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,743
Okay.

311
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,670
The asset store from the name,
the description,

312
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,940
this is, I mean this is for
the wallet store, right? So

313
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,750
true. What else do we
want to say? Manufacturer

314
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,920
and, well, this is to store assets,

315
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:03,480
seizing their respective you UID.

316
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,950
And then we'll have one another mapping

317
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,140
and then we'll have another
mapping for the address,

318
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,413
uh,

319
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,160
to make an assignment
of an asset to a wallet.

320
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,990
So,

321
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,160
and we can say
message,

322
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,360
just send her your you id.

323
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,493
Okay.

324
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,060
Equals true.

325
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,510
Okay, so that was, okay. So that's
the first part. Now for different,

326
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,350
there could be a number of real
world events that could happen here.

327
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:06,230
Writes like asset creation,
asset transfer,

328
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,550
and we're going to define counterparts
for that in this smart contract. Right?

329
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:13,790
So what are some possible things
that could happen to an asset? Well,

330
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,490
one could be the creation of an asset,
right?

331
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:19,940
So what would be the parameters
for asset creation? Well,

332
00:20:19,941 --> 00:20:24,050
we want the address of the account,
right? We want, it's it's Id,

333
00:20:24,051 --> 00:20:26,630
it's unique identifier. We
want, what else do we want?

334
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,980
We want its manufacturer and we want,

335
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,330
I think that's it. Yeah,
those are the three. Uh,

336
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,890
what else do we want? So
let's just, we want, uh,

337
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:44,030
to be able to reject a creation.
So we'll say event reject, create.

338
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,973
Okay.

339
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:50,830
And then we want another one
that's going to be asset transfer,

340
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,980
asset transfer.
And we want one more,

341
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:56,770
which is going to be reject transfer.

342
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,700
And this is going to be addressed account.
Of course there's going to be from,

343
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,060
because the t because
these last two are from,

344
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,163
mmm.

345
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:14,380
This is going to be a message.
This is,

346
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,690
we don't need one for a transfer.

347
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:22,170
And then we have a message for
reject rejection message and,

348
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,423
hmm.

349
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,940
Okay, cool. So there's that.

350
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:34,250
Now we can create an asset.
So let me just write out,

351
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,173
um,

352
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,773
okay.

353
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,040
Okay. So now let me write out just a
simple function for asset creation. Try.

354
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,250
So if we want to create an
asset, we can say, okay,

355
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:53,140
so using what we've just created before,
let's say to create an asset,

356
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:56,080
we need snake, we needed a
description for this, for the asset,

357
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,800
and we need the manufacturer manufacturer.

358
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,990
Now once we have that,
we can

359
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,720
right this out.

360
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,160
So if the asset stores a unique identifier

361
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,190
is initialized,

362
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,240
yeah,

363
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,930
then we're going to reject
the creation step.

364
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,400
Okay.

365
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,400
Same to sender and the U U I d
are going to be as as parameters.

366
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,050
Um,

367
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:39,050
and what that means is if it's already
initialized asset with this you UID

368
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,660
already created,
it means it's already been created.

369
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,920
Now, once we have that, that's
just kind of our failure case.

370
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,530
Then once we have that,
then we can say,

371
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,360
let's store if it, if it, if
it hasn't been created before,

372
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,810
then let's create the asset,
the name description,

373
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,873
true.

374
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:09,040
And the Wallet Store, right? Cause
we're going to store the asset, uh,

375
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,640
we have,
we're going to store it in our wallet and

376
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,600
we're going to create,

377
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,980
that's
factor there.

378
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:35,880
Okay. So what, okay, so what this
is saying is that in order to,

379
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,760
let me just make sure this is all good.
Yup.

380
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:43,010
So what is the saying is that in
order to transfer an asset, uh, we're,

381
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:45,090
we're going to create a
function that takes the address,

382
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,400
the target wallet along with the Asset Id.

383
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,150
Okay.
And we check those two preconditions.

384
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:57,740
And the asset is if the
asset actually exists, uh,

385
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,200
then we don't want to recreate it.
But if it doesn't,

386
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,830
then we're going to create the
asset ourselves. Now this is,

387
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:07,160
this is the type of function that we
would call from web three dot. Js. Right?

388
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:08,800
So this is the,
okay,

389
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,320
this is the contract that we would deploy
to the blockchain and then we would

390
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:13,460
use wet three dot js.

391
00:24:13,461 --> 00:24:17,470
So then called this contract
specifically create asset using the Nate,

392
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,090
the description, the manufacturer. Okay.

393
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,440
Sing Fab has their own smart contracts
that we could look at on get hub. Um,

394
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,300
they have quite a lot
of smart contracts here,

395
00:24:26,301 --> 00:24:29,990
but if you're looking for a good source
to learn about a production ready,

396
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,430
smart contract code for supply chains,
definitely check them out. Uh, yeah.

397
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,460
So that's it for this video.
I hope you found it useful and yeah.
