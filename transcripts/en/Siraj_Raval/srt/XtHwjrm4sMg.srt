1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,030
Hey Dan, how's it going? Hey, you go, sir.
Rob's mind if I ask you a few questions.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,170
Let's do it. All right. Well, uh, how much
do you sleep every night? About six hours.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,120
Where do you live in Amsterdam. Where
did you study at Columbia University.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,990
What's your favorite book?
The road by Cormac Mccarthy.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,590
What is the coolest deep learning project
you've seen open mind by Andrew Trask?

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,070
Do you need to know very complex math at
the level of calculus or linear Algebra

7
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,530
to start on the path of
deep learning? No. In fact,

8
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,870
you just need to know programming
and if you can code with carrots,

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,660
you can do this stuff in
nine or 10 lines of code.

10
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,610
If you want to get more advanced
than you'll use some math.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,570
How long did it take you to get into
the machine learning? It took me,

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,720
I was on and off for about three years,
but to really get started,

13
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:50,100
it took me about three months.
I live in a developing country.

14
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,990
How can I make a positive change here?

15
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:55,320
Through machine learning there is always
an opportunity to use machine learning

16
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,830
in some way. Find a problem that you
want to solve, that's the first step.

17
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,140
And once you do apply
machine learning to it,

18
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:03,840
you can always do that in
order to master deep learning.

19
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:06,510
Is there any other language we
should learn other than python?

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,350
Javascript comes in at a close second,
uh,

21
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,060
and also go is a great language.

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,650
Which courses did you take it you
need that you would recommend? Uh,

23
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,200
at my university, uh,
there were, I mean it was,

24
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:23,250
it was a closed university,

25
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:26,130
but online I can say a great
course to take is that you Udacity,

26
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:30,390
deep learning Nano degree as well
as Andrew new deep learning course.

27
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,350
Can Ai be used to retouch skin
portions by removing blemishes?

28
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,580
Like with Photoshop? Oh, for
sure. Yeah, that would be a, uh,

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,200
there'll be a generative problem for,
you'd want to,

30
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,280
you'd want to use an autoencoder to
encode that image and then you would learn

31
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,640
the latent representation and then you
could generate an image without the

32
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:51,360
blemishes. Which country would
you like to visit most? Uh,

33
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,840
I'm really excited to go to India
in five days, so I will be in India.

34
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm very excited and if
you've started today,

35
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:59,490
which learning resource would
you use? Domestic, deep learning.

36
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,970
I wonder what I would
use my channel for sure.

37
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:07,650
My channel and also I would look at you,
Udacity and Coursera.

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,580
How can introverted or shy people improve
their confidence to be more like you

39
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:16,290
as these traits are helpful in tech?
It just takes a lot of practice.

40
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,070
I'm not naturally a super social person
but but just by constantly putting

41
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:23,070
myself out there in front of the world,
being vulnerable,

42
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,000
it definitely just builds
up your confidence so it's
a discipline that you build

43
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:27,834
up over time.

44
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,100
What drives you to create Youtube Khan
contents instead of working on some high

45
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:35,760
end AI or machine learning
research independently or
collaboratively with great

46
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:36,594
minds of our time.

47
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,460
I would love to do a project that is
put in the hands of millions of users,

48
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,960
but it's kind of a sacrifice, right?
Making content is my way of making impact.

49
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,410
I could do one or the other. Ideally
I could do both. We'll see. We'll,

50
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,430
we'll see where that goes.

51
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,970
Have you ever tried clarifies
cool image recognition technology,

52
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:56,700
which is a direct competitor to Google.
I have,

53
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:59,410
I think it's really easy
to use and a thumbs up.

54
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,670
What do you think about independent
startups competing with big giants and Ai

55
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,590
Tech such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon,

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,830
and why would you prefer one over the
others such as clarify versus Google?

57
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,400
There is definitely a space
for startups for sure.

58
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,520
There's so many different exit strategies
are so much different data that's

59
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:18,850
available for small startups that you
can use that Google or Amazon or the

60
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:22,450
giants haven't used yet. There's the
space is really hot. So don't be,

61
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:25,540
don't be discouraged by the fact that
Google and all these big companies exist.

62
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,430
Okay.
Well if you are an element,

63
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,920
what element would you be called
and what would your properties be?

64
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,860
I would be Saroj IOM and
my properties would be

65
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,660
dreaming big and competence and science,

66
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,960
scientific thinking. Lots of
managers lack an understanding of it.

67
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,540
And what ml is capable of.
And your experience,

68
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,510
how would you best manage the expectations
of what is possible and what is

69
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:55,870
realistic? Uh, well yeah,

70
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:59,950
I mean the standard rules rules apply
of under promising and over delivering.

71
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,000
So just you'd have to have a good
knowledge of your problem domain first.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And if you do, then be able to
say what you can and cannot do.

73
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,420
Don't just make bs promises
cause that's gonna Backfire.

74
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,870
Do you stand for net neutrality
and how is it important to you? Oh,

75
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:16,960
for sure the Internet is,
it has to be a level playing field.

76
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,400
I mean I went from zero to I think 170
k subscribers just on my own so far.

77
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,850
And uh, yeah, if, if net
neutrality didn't exist,

78
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,820
the top creators on Youtube would
just get higher and higher in terms of

79
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:31,480
subscribers and I would still be
at zero to 30 k subs. We need it.

80
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,090
How do I start my journey as
a tech speaker? Uh, somewhere,

81
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,571
right?

82
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:41,080
I mean you always have meetups near you
just do something small and work your

83
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:45,130
way up. Build a name for yourself,
your name is your brand build.

84
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:46,210
It starts somewhere.

85
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,720
Do you get sponsored by conference
organizers for your talks?

86
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,470
I have been offered and I've just
started to do the whole speaking thing in

87
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:55,900
person. I mean I could just
make videos. Uh, so yeah,

88
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:58,690
I'm going to start charging
soon cause it takes a time,

89
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,820
time sacrifice away from my other content.

90
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,080
When did you start with machine
learning? I started, I mean it's,

91
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:08,110
it's kind of ambiguous. Like I started
in college when I was a sophomore,

92
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:08,321
you know,

93
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:12,250
I dabbled in it but I only
really seriously got started
about a year and a half

94
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,270
ago when I started this channel.

95
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,290
What problems could you result with
deep learning technology in 10 years?

96
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,950
Me personally or just in general?

97
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,010
A lot of applications in healthcare,
uh,

98
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,340
taking away a lot of the grunt
work that doctors have to do.

99
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,400
And also in democratizing data,

100
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:33,970
there's a huge opportunity there because
everybody wants data but data isn't

101
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:35,200
accessible to everybody.

102
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,410
So any kind of project that does that
helps with that is that is a good

103
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:42,460
opportunity. Do you watch any TV
shows like silicon valley, Mr,

104
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:44,920
robot or Westworld and if you've
watched them, what do you think?

105
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,820
I have heard of them. I've seen the
first episode of Silicon Valley,

106
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,400
it's too much like my life,
so I'm not going to watch it.

107
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,790
I actually don't have time to
watch that much long form content.

108
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:59,750
I watch a lot of youtube, but
not really long shows. Uh,

109
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:03,070
so tell me what role do you think that
tissue there's of machine learning to

110
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,880
play weeding bias in machine
learning that any models,

111
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,610
prejudice or towards minorities?
It all comes back to the data.

112
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,130
Make sure that you have
quality diverse data, right?

113
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,310
Overfitting can result in the things we
see it in news where there is bias in

114
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:19,364
terms of race.

115
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,850
So make sure you have diverse state
and why is it machine learning called

116
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:27,770
statistical learning? It could definitely
be a, it's just, it's just brands,

117
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:28,011
right?

118
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:31,610
These are just brands and stories and
marketing and we call it different things,

119
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:35,000
but in the end it's all about
mathematical optimization.

120
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,300
What are your personal objectives
for the next five years?

121
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:44,210
I would like to build a content machine
and kind of like a Khan Academy for Ai

122
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,310
Slash Netflix for education.

123
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,900
That just gets really big and gets a lot
of people to watch and it makes a big,

124
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:55,790
big impact. Will be solve
intelligence in your lifetime. Um,

125
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,680
yes we will 100% I don't even know why
I had to think about that for a second.

126
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:01,820
Yes, we will. We will.

127
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,780
What is the best resource for learning
mathematics involved in machine learning

128
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:10,250
or deep learning? Uh, there's a great
deep learning book by Ian Goodfellow.

129
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:13,730
Definitely check that book out.
Also my channel for sure.

130
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,600
The math of intelligence series, watch
it all. Those are the two best ones.

131
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,130
In terms of the current market,

132
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:22,790
which jobs would you think would get
first affected by artificial intelligence?

133
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,790
Anything that is just people don't
like any jobs that people don't like.

134
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:32,260
So anything like call center support or a

135
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,540
cashiers as well. Cashiers. In
terms of the current market,

136
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,950
which jobs would you think would get,

137
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,910
I set that one 33 if you were
stranded on an island for life,

138
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,800
which three apps when you choose and why?

139
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,430
I would choose Twitter because
I absolutely love Twitter.

140
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,370
I would choose Facebook just because,
yeah,

141
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,950
social media and also read
it because I love reddit.

142
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,760
How important are data structures and
algorithms for machine learning will?

143
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:01,340
It leads me to be deep learning as well.
I'm a beginner.

144
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,670
Data structures and algorithms are
super important for anything you do in

145
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:07,580
computer science. Definitely. If you
have any interest in web development,

146
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:09,410
mobile ml,
blockchain,

147
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:12,320
just get your data structures
and algorithms in line
first and then move on to

148
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:15,800
the harder stuff. What's your view on
Elan's concern about the surgeon AI?

149
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,870
He's totally right.
We need to regulate it.

150
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:22,160
We need some kind of oversight in some
way to make sure that the bad actors

151
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:23,240
don't get too much power.

152
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,930
What's the project you've built that
you're most proud of? My Youtube Channel.

153
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,290
What's the one resource which helps you
get up and running quickly and machine

154
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,140
learning?
The machine learning sub reddit.

155
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,130
Do you have a circle of people you mentor
personally who claimed to grow in the

156
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:41,200
field of machine learning? If yes,
how can someone join? I don't. I,

157
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,120
I don't have enough time for
that right now. My channel.

158
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:46,940
I think of everybody as a group. Uh, yeah.

159
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,860
How do you see reinforcement learning
impacting the future in terms of practical

160
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:55,100
applications, practical
applications, reinforcement?

161
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,410
It's one of those emerging like it's,
it's going to have, it's the heyday.

162
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:01,470
It's not right now. Maybe it's, maybe
it's next year, maybe it's in five years.

163
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,770
But in terms of the first
applications, I would say it's, uh,

164
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,820
anything with cleaning robots or real
life robots that will do some kind of

165
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,840
disaster recovery or something
that humans don't want to do.

166
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,960
If you could go back in time with
the same knowledge you have now,

167
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,190
when and where would you go?

168
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,950
I would go back to New York to Columbia,

169
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,670
and I would have started
my youtube channel earlier.

170
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,450
Is it essentially needed when you prepare
for technical interviews to try to

171
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:33,790
solve problems on your own
without looking at solutions?

172
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:36,520
Yep.
Yeah,

173
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,310
for sure. Yeah. You got it. You got to
work the brain, right? It's a discipline.

174
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:42,400
You got to work the brand. The better
it gets at this algorithm stuff,

175
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,760
the better it's going to be for your
interviews. Okay. So Raj, you're awesome.

176
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,670
I want to learn about machine learning,
but I'm a complete beginner.

177
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,640
Could you outline a rough idea of what
I should look to do to learn machine

178
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:54,430
learning?
Just okay,

179
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,980
watch my learn python
for data science series.

180
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,960
Then watch my machine
learning for hackers series.

181
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,060
Then watch my intro to
deep learning series,

182
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,250
then watch my math of
intelligence series in that order.

183
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,060
What math courses have you taken?
I mean on and off,

184
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:08,340
I've taken some calculus courses,

185
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,650
linear Algebra here and there
online at university in high school.

186
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:13,160
But in the end you,

187
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,600
the best way to learn this stuff is to
just a con academy is a great resource.

188
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,230
Let me just put it very simply.
Use Khan Academy for your math essentials.

189
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,430
What do you think about the
latest achievement of open
Ai's Dota playing agent?

190
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,130
Oh my God, that was so bad
ass. That is very cool.

191
00:10:27,131 --> 00:10:31,790
I'm so glad that open AI did
that. They are back. Uh, they
are hot right now, so um,

192
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,980
yeah,
I think it's awesome.

193
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,380
Do you think that a masters degree is
required to work in big companies or is it

194
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:38,020
bachelors and being good enough?

195
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,430
Being good is enough for the right
companies of course are always going to be

196
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:44,410
companies that really care
about your credentials,

197
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:47,500
but the but the best companies
care about what you can output.

198
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,560
So make sure you have your get
hub full of great projects.

199
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,950
How many hours a week do you
work in study? Oh my God,

200
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:57,520
I work at least 80 hours a week.
I am a workaholic.

201
00:10:57,521 --> 00:11:00,990
I work Monday through Saturday.
I take Sunday off. Uh,

202
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:05,200
but sometimes they even work on Sunday.
Yep. Can you juggle three balls?

203
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,550
No.
Who is Saroj revolt?

204
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,210
The first of its kind.
What is intelligence? How
far are we in solving it?

205
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:22,330
Intelligence is the ability to
adapt and to learn. And we are,

206
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,050
I would say five to 10
years away from solving it.

207
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,500
What our gas generative adversarial
networks are a technique invented by Ian

208
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,290
Goodfellow that like you that have to
neural networks dual against each other

209
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:40,210
and the result is being able to generate
data types that have not been possible

210
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:43,210
before you were about to get into a fight.

211
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,800
What song comes on as your soundtrack?
Uh,

212
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,560
fight music by M and m.
This kind of music use it anyway.

213
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,670
What can you speak besides
programming ones? English. Good.

214
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,500
Drop the which is a dialect
from north India, Hindi,

215
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:02,740
which is the language of India. Spanish
from high school. I grew up in Houston,

216
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:03,130
Texas.

217
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,030
Shout out to Houston and I worked at a
flea market with my dad just selling cell

218
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:10,830
phone accessories, talks about and I
had to learn Spanish. So Spanish, Hindi.

219
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:13,150
We dropped the and I'm learning Dutch.
We'll see how that goes.

220
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,270
What do you ever go to Mars?
Of course I would go to Mars.

221
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,330
I am just waiting to go to Mars.
That's going to happen for sure. Ilan,

222
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:22,900
if you're watching this, you know, you
know what the deal is. So checking. Yeah.

223
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,590
How do I get into research without
a masters or a Phd? Yo. Okay.

224
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:30,220
So my thing is I am trying to
democratize research, right?

225
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:32,080
So I haven't really gone into that field,

226
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:36,310
but we're getting to a point where
anybody will be able to publish a research

227
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:38,410
online. I'm trying to grow the
amateur research community.

228
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:42,100
You don't need to have a phd
to publish valuable research.

229
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,070
We're going to get to that point in
terms of what the progress so far in that

230
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:48,610
field, I would say it's, um, distill.pub.

231
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,120
What do you do for a living?
I make youtube videos.

232
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:56,080
I make some money off of ads and Patrion
uh, and my deal with you, Udacity,

233
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:58,930
that I just did.
How do you think blockchain and AI,

234
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:01,750
it can be implemented together?
Oh my God. Great question.

235
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,530
Open mind by Andrew Trask.
Check that out. Great example.

236
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,190
File coin is another great example.
Uh,

237
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,710
anytime you want to create
a decentralized application,

238
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,540
AI can be used to make it more autonomous.
These are all tech,

239
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,970
blockchain and AI or just technologies
to make autonomous software.

240
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,980
What inspired you to get into AI?

241
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:27,130
I was traveling through India and I saw
a lot of problems that I didn't think

242
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:28,750
would be solvable in my lifetime.

243
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,470
And I just came to the realization that
the only way we're going to really solve

244
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:35,290
all these problems, the only real
chance we have is to solve Ai.

245
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,380
Your greatest inspiration. Why? Uh,

246
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,020
it's a tie between Kanye west for being
a creative who is unapologetic and uh,

247
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,020
Andrew Andrew,
what's your daily routine?

248
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,990
I wake up at 8:00 AM I drink some
coffee and I either I start writing and

249
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:01,390
programming and editing
and sometimes shooting.

250
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:06,391
If I'm shooting a video and I do that
until nine or 10:00 PM on and off.

251
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,500
Suggest some good books. You
think people should read, read.

252
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,920
Uh Oh. Okay. Some good
books people should read.

253
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,260
Read the deep learning book.
I already said that. Read, uh,

254
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,830
how to create a mind by Kurzweil and
one wore this a superintelligence by

255
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:29,860
Bostrom, Nick Bostrom. That was the
best advice you've ever been given.

256
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,000
I also sapiens by the book sapiens.

257
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,600
The best advice I've ever been given
is every time you have a decision,

258
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,150
it was actually by my hair,
my hair dresser.

259
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:43,540
He said every time you have a decision
and you think the harder choice,

260
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,000
the more risky choice is going
to be worse. It never is.

261
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,100
So just take the leap
and do the riskier thing.

262
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,640
What are the coolest libraries you use
often a tensorflow and also Pi torch and

263
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,210
I have been really getting into
decentralized applications,

264
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:01,100
so I would say truffle and
open Zeppelin and etherium.

265
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,180
How can deep learning help in solving
unanswered questions in biomedicine?

266
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,990
Yeah, I mean you could use generative
models to generate new types of medicine.

267
00:15:12,991 --> 00:15:16,530
You could use discriminator model
to detect diseases that exist.

268
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,880
So both of those things.

269
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,300
What do you think about Andrew
Higgins new course on deep learning?

270
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,630
I think it's dope by I
support anything that he does.

271
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:27,060
We were trying to democratize AI,
so definitely check it out.

272
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,240
What do you think about the future
of decentralized applications?

273
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,940
The time is now it's happening.

274
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,530
And do you think machine learning and
deep learning are just overhyped by tech

275
00:15:37,531 --> 00:15:40,680
giants? Can it really solve
general and Super Ai in the future?

276
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:45,420
Or is another AI winter coming,
uh, statistically speaking? Yes,

277
00:15:45,421 --> 00:15:48,210
another AI winter is coming.
We don't know how long it's going to be.

278
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,180
Deep learning could be the path
forward. We don't know. Personally,

279
00:15:51,181 --> 00:15:54,300
I think one shot learning
is going to be the,

280
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,420
the field that is going to be the next
step after deep learning where we need

281
00:15:57,421 --> 00:15:58,920
less data for the same results.

282
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,310
But it's a very exciting space and as long
as we have a tension and we have hard,

283
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,440
hardworking people in this space,
it's going to keep,

284
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,080
it's going to keep up
accelerating. Cool. Well,

285
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,560
thanks for answering all my questions and
showing me around. Awesome. Thanks, Dan.

286
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,200
Yeah,
yeah.
