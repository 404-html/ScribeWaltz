00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,751
Hello world,

2
00:00:00,751 --> 00:00:05,751
it's Saroj and today I'm going to share
10 strategies I personally use to learn

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,730
advanced concepts as fast as possible.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,070
Computer Science is my one true love.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,960
There are endless subtopics to explore
from basic concepts like abstraction to

6
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:18,810
more advanced concepts like
machine learning, security,

7
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:23,550
distributed systems and teledildonics
and because I find it so incredibly

8
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:26,610
exciting.
I love the process of learning it,

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,560
which brings me to my first point.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,280
Find a reason to learn before
you start your learning journey.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,030
You've got to have that motivation,
that drive to learn.

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,760
That means finding a cause.
You really believe in,

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,730
this is my first point because
it's the most important.

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,940
Giving yourself the space
to reflect on yourself,

15
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,110
your life and the state of humanity is
one of the most important things you can

16
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:54,000
do in this regard. That means
traveling, seeking out new experiences,

17
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,240
meeting new and interesting people,
connecting with them,

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,040
and really trying to understand their
motivations in life to help you formulate

19
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,600
your own.
For me,

20
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:07,830
traveling through Asia for a few months
gave me the perspective I needed to

21
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:12,030
finally realize that solving AI was
the most important thing in the world.

22
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,390
I realized that despite having
failed in so many other tasks,

23
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,270
I was a gifted communicator and I saw
an opportunity to apply my unique skill

24
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:23,340
set to help achieve this goal,
but once you're ready to learn,

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,470
how do you know where to start?

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,870
What we're all lucky in that the Internet
provides us with a huge variety of

27
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,760
learning resources that
we could potentially use.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,230
It is the new university and it is
our responsibility to use it as such.

29
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,940
The only way to know which resources work
best for you is to try out as many of

30
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:44,280
them as you can and
reinforcement learning.

31
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:47,550
This is called the exploration
versus exploitation dilemma.

32
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,320
How does a learning agent know how
much to explore possible options before

33
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,170
choosing one and utilizing
it to its full capacity?

34
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,050
Different people learn in different ways.
For example,

35
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,760
whenever I'm researching a topic,

36
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,110
I'll Google it and open up at least 10
different browser windows dedicated to

37
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:08,730
informational links on that
topic simultaneously. Some
of them will be articles,

38
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:12,660
some will be videos, some will
be papers, some will be podcasts.

39
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,070
I'll quickly skim through each of them
getting as much of the just as I can

40
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,210
before settling on one that I find
especially interesting and retains my

41
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:22,830
interest longer than the rest.

42
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,600
My personal favorite way of learning
is to watch videos at three x speed on

43
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:31,950
Youtube. I use a chrome extension to do
this link to it is in the description.

44
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,100
It feels like when neo had data
downloaded it into his brain,

45
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,080
I'm getting both auditory and visual
input into my head at three x the normal

46
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:44,160
speed. It was hard for my brain to
get used to that much of a speed up,

47
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,080
so I started off only a little faster
and over time gradually increase the

48
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:50,850
speed.
The brain will adapt.

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,140
It will learn to process input faster
and eventually normal speed will feel too

50
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:59,010
slow. This same logic can apply
to podcasts and audio books.

51
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,010
Don't discount any medium of learning.
The more diverse your inputs,

52
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,970
the better or more generalized your
understanding of a topic will be,

53
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,640
but if you have a bunch of
possible learning options,

54
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,270
you want to start off with the
absolute simplest ones first.

55
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,100
You've got to have a basic understanding
of a topic first before you move on to

56
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:19,090
the harder stuff.

57
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,390
I usually look for Eli fives on
Reddit for super tough concepts.

58
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,840
Those are really helpful.

59
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:29,410
Also short introductory explainer
videos on youtube are awesome,

60
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,550
so if I want to learn about say gradient
descent rather than first going through

61
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:38,350
the scientific paper that
introduces gradient descent
with a bunch of equations,

62
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,940
I'll first try to understand the concept
a very high level and the reasons for

63
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:46,420
it. Then once I have a basic
idea from a few sources,

64
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,980
I'll read some in depth tutorials from
people who've gone through the process of

65
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,230
learning it already.
The experts,

66
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,500
hopefully with code samples so I
can build off of their knowledge.

67
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,390
It's like a tree of abstractions.

68
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,650
If you can peer into
someone's representation of
a concept in their mind by

69
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:06,580
consuming their content,
you can grasp that concept much faster.

70
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,570
When it comes to code, I use get
hub like a Google for code samples.

71
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,650
I look for really basic code samples
that don't have too many lines of code,

72
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,700
ideally under a hundred that
programmatically implement some concept.

73
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,680
I'll analyze the architecture and then
move on to a more detailed implementation.

74
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,480
If you start with the hardest stuff first,

75
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,690
it will be way easier to
get discouraged and give up,

76
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,650
so you have to create a set of small
achievable goals in your journey.

77
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,900
Whenever we began the learning process,

78
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,640
we go through a honeymoon phase where we
experienced a release of dopamine as we

79
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:44,260
encounter novel concepts,
but there is always a dip in excitement,

80
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,710
a period when our progress
slows and we get frustrated.

81
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,960
Many people end their journey at that dip.

82
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,470
They convinced themselves that they
aren't smart enough or they've run out of

83
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:55,840
money or they'd rather
watch game of Thrones,

84
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,960
but if you can stay motivated
through the dip period,

85
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,020
then eventually you'll get
to the point of mastery,

86
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,490
a place where you can finally feel that
you've learned the topic and be proud of

87
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:10,030
that fact.
Set deadlines for each of these goals.

88
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,870
The research shows that doing this
motivates you to complete each one.

89
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,070
Breaking up your larger learning goal
into smaller ones will help keep you

90
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:18,904
motivated.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,290
You're receiving a dopamine reward every
time you've learned some small part of

92
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:28,291
a larger concept and since each goal
you've created isn't too hard or too easy,

93
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,950
it keeps you interested,
allowing you to maintain a flow state,

94
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,250
a state of maximum
concentration and focus.

95
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,940
Creating your own well-planned learning
path. It doesn't come naturally.

96
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,170
It's a skill and like all skills,
it needs to be homed learning,

97
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:47,830
which are the right questions to
ask is a really useful exercise.

98
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:49,570
When designing your learning goals,

99
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,690
what are the burning questions
you'd like to have answered?

100
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,730
Take some time to write them down.

101
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,090
It's surprisingly useful to be able
to see them outside your own head.

102
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,860
Let your curiosity drive their
learning path and it will be a lot more

103
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:07,940
enjoyable. Learning isn't just about
consuming content, it's about doing.

104
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,020
Studies show that you should spend a
third of your time researching and two

105
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:14,540
thirds of your time doing.
For example,

106
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,290
you can stare at the chain rule
all day and look at code samples,

107
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,600
but unless you implement it yourself,

108
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,620
you won't truly understand how
backpropagation works. In deep learning.

109
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,730
Doing means finding some medium of
applying what you've learned. For me,

110
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:32,690
that medium is teaching. I am constantly
writing scripts of what I've learned,

111
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,630
speaking,
reading out those scripts and editing,

112
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,800
adding relevant assets to be
displayed alongside my boys practice.

113
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:42,860
Finding the most dense
description of a topic you can.

114
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,240
How can you summarize an entire
algorithm into one sentence?

115
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,290
You can also take notes by
hand or create flashcards,

116
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,280
both proven methods for knowledge
retention. But look, let's be real.

117
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,860
Learning advanced concepts isn't easy,

118
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,040
so you've got to allow
yourself to be uncomfortable.

119
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,380
Nothing worth achieving comes easily.

120
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,500
Those experts weren't born
with the knowledge they have.

121
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,560
They put in countless hours
of study to get there.

122
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,700
That uncomfortable feeling you get when
you encounter a topic you know nothing

123
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:18,560
about is the learning process.
You got to get okay with that discomfort.

124
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,310
Just know that the more you look
at a topic, the easier it'll get.

125
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,240
Your brain behaves like a muscle.
So you've got to train it like one,

126
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,150
just like how the best
athletes train every morning,

127
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:33,320
no matter how sore they feel or
the best writers write every day,

128
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:36,920
no matter how bad it turns out,
the best students know that.

129
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:39,650
It's all about having a
disciplined study regimen.

130
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,440
There are so many potential
distractions out there.

131
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,130
You have to have the discipline to tune
out everything else and focus on your

132
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:50,180
task. Do it in intervals, every 50
minutes. Give yourself some intense,

133
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,890
highly focused learning time.

134
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:56,150
Take a 10 minute break and repeat and
because the learning process can be

135
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:59,180
difficult,
remember to seek out feedback.

136
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,810
If you have a question that you're
having a really hard time answering,

137
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,220
ask it on stack overflow or a
sub reddit or a slack channel.

138
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,113
Ask a friend,

139
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,440
find someone you really admire who excels
in that topic and ask them on Twitter

140
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:13,274
directly.

141
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,150
You'll find that most people are more
than willing to help you out if you ask a

142
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:21,950
question in a short, concise and
easily digestible way. And lastly,

143
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,790
take care of yourself. That means treat
your body like the machine that it is.

144
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,810
You've only got one.

145
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,230
That means avoid too much sugar or
remember to eat fruits and vegetables and

146
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:33,620
find a fun way to exercise,
jogging, biking, fencing,

147
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,790
anything that will improve
blood circulation to your
