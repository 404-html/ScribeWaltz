00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,060
This is what you've been waiting for.
Hello world,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,090
it's the Raj and welcome to my new
course on AI applied to business.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,370
The most valuable course I've ever made.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,610
We're going to build a simple AI app for
doctors that lets them upload a picture

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,980
of an eye and tells them whether or
not that I has diabetic retinopathy.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,390
If you're looking to build a profitable
AI startup or implement AI at your

7
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:30,930
company in some way,
this is the course for you.

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,130
All my videos will be free and
available, right? You're on Youtube,

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,230
so make sure to subscribe to stay
up to date with my latest content.

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,510
Advances in medicine over the past
few decades have improved health care

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,380
immensely,

12
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,570
allowing doctors to more efficiently
diagnose and treat diseases,

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,090
but doctors are still humans,

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,750
which means they understandably still
make mistakes on the epic. A APP,

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,690
TV show house doctor houses
genius bar exceeds his colleagues,

16
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,980
which implies that if all
doctors were as smart as him,

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,220
diagnostic mysteries and unnecessary
deaths in hospitals would drastically

18
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:14,430
decrease.

19
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,470
But the reality is that the biggest
difference between doctors is not their

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,060
level of intelligence.

21
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,270
It's how they approach patient problems
and the type of health system that

22
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,293
supports them.

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,660
This combination is what causes such
wide variations in clinical outcomes and

24
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:39,111
it's the reason why machine learning is
the best solution out there to improve

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,810
doctors capabilities. If
you can't beat them, join a,

26
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,630
there's so much potential here.
For example,

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,780
studies show that over half of all women
in the US who get regular mammograms

28
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,060
will receive at least one false positive,

29
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,090
which is a test that wrongly indicates
the possibility of cancer in a 10 year

30
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:00,504
period.

31
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Radiologists regularly disagree on their
respective interpretations of medical

32
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:10,410
images.
Ai Can do what no radiologists can.

33
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,560
It can learn from hundreds of thousands
of medical images and is estimated to be

34
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,890
up to 10% more accurate than
the average radiologist.

35
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,190
That accuracy gap will only increase as
computing power gets cheaper and can be

36
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:29,070
applied to any of the countless
subfields of medicine,

37
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,640
not just radiology,
like what the startup this dot.

38
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,800
Ai is doing for brain scans.

39
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,490
Doctors also have to interpret
patient medical records,

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,240
which can be a very complex task and LP,

41
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,390
a branch of AI that helps
computers understand and
interpret human language can

42
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:53,181
review thousands of medical records and
output the optimal steps for evaluating

43
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,050
and managing patients with many illnesses.

44
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,620
Some doctors really are gifted
at what they do like Doctor Oz.

45
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,520
Just kidding.

46
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,080
And Ai can learn from the best
by watching them do their work.

47
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:13,350
If all doctors matched the performance
of the top 20% patient deaths from a

48
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:19,120
variety of diseases would decrease by
the hundreds of thousands per year.

49
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,840
And wild doctors have natural biases.

50
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,150
Ai is more likely to produce objective
diagnoses for patients without

51
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:32,860
preconceived socioeconomic notions,
which can produce disparities in care.

52
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,890
Ml will become an essential tool for
doctors like the stethoscope has been and

53
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:40,720
as more of the profession is automated,

54
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,960
human empathy and compassion for patients
will become paramount to their success

55
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,630
in the field. Also good
looks. Let's just be real.

56
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,570
So how do we pick a problem to solve?

57
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,840
The AI in health care market is expected
to grow at an incredible 48% compound

58
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,790
annual growth rate in the next five
years according to research and markets.

59
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,120
The tech giants like Google and
Microsoft have massive amounts of data,

60
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,350
talent and computing power.

61
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,090
They have a huge advantage when it
comes to building horizontal products.

62
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,020
These are products that can
be applied to many use cases,

63
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,920
but as a startup you can
build a vertical product,

64
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,080
one that tackles a single problem very
well since they don't have the time to do

65
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:29,770
that.

66
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,240
One way to do this is to find relevant
problems in online communities where

67
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:38,530
doctors congregate. These can
be forums, slack channels,

68
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,660
sub reddits,
Grey's anatomy,

69
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:45,250
chat rooms about McDreamy and see
what kind of problems they're having.

70
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,700
Another way would be to call
up or schedule a visit to
a local practice to hear

71
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,500
firsthand about the type of problems
they're having. Listening before,

72
00:04:56,501 --> 00:05:01,210
acting is an important first step when
finding the right problem to solve.

73
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,930
Eventually we'll come across a problem
that is dealt with by multiple doctors.

74
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,310
Let's say for the case of this demo
it's diagnosing diabetic retinopathy

75
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:16,390
correctly. We can build a classifier
to help solve this problem,

76
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,570
but first we've got to
collect some quality data.

77
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,640
The foundation of all machine learning
is having lots of quality data.

78
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,440
That's how it learns.

79
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,710
Very few companies actually
generate and own medical grade data.

80
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,130
Since collecting this data from
patients is quite difficult,

81
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,740
so we're going to have
to get a little creative.

82
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,070
We can search the web by searching
public imaging data sets for diabetic

83
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,840
retinopathy.
We'll come across a few.

84
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,140
Some will require us to apply and register
before getting access so we can go

85
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:56,080
ahead and do that and hope for the best.
Alternatively,

86
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,280
if you're a student at a university,

87
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,550
you can go find the nearest
imaging research center and
ask the professor there.

88
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,950
They're always willing
to help with projects.

89
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,250
Pub Med is also a great place to
find biomedical research papers.

90
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,500
We can search for papers by the type of
scan data we're looking for and once we

91
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:22,070
find a good one, we can just
email those researchers directly,

92
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,780
explain our project and how it can
be mutual beneficial to both of us.

93
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,960
If we frame it more like
we're trying to help them,

94
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,980
then asking them for something,
they'll be more likely to help us.

95
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,590
If we can get our hands
on a quality dataset,

96
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,740
ideally with labels because labeled
datasets are always easier to learn from,

97
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,950
then we know that we have a
shot at solving this problem,

98
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,280
but before we actually invest our time
and energy into building an AI model,

99
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,850
we need to make sure that
we're able to get customers.

100
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,920
The easiest way to do this is
to create a simple landing page.

101
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:06,190
We can find a template pretty
easily online that asks
for a simple email signup.

102
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,100
We'd explain our product in detail and
the landing page and once we have it we

103
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:15,800
can send it to potential clients.
In our case,

104
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,770
that would be doctors
and medical companies.

105
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,830
We can find a directory of them online
and email them one by one posted in

106
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:27,020
Facebook groups and see
if we get any signups.

107
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,960
If we're able to get a
sufficient amount of signups,

108
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:35,170
then we know that there is indeed interest
in our product and we can go ahead

109
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:36,440
and start building.

110
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:41,470
There's an entire ecosystem of libraries
and services that help us build models.

111
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,020
Archive sanity is a great tool to help
us search for how the latest AI models

112
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,350
have been applied to medical
diagnoses and research labs.

113
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,030
Once we find a cool paper, we can use it
as a guide to help build our own model.

114
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,360
It's important to remember that there
are so many tweaks and modifications we

115
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:04,700
could potentially make to
our model to improve it,

116
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,940
but the best thing to do is to first
build a prototype that works as fast as

117
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:12,710
possible and then iterate from there.

118
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,160
Convolutional neural networks are a type
of model that have proven to outperform

119
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,310
all others.
When it comes to image classification,

120
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,230
which is our use case.

121
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:29,530
The fastest and easiest way to build a
convolutional neural network is by using

122
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:31,940
the care os machine learning library.

123
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,680
It lets us build neural networks
easily with its high level API.

124
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,120
Each line of code corresponds to a
different layer in our neural network.

125
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:46,390
We can search get hub for
an image classification
care model and use that as a

126
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:52,160
base model. Notice how the perimeters
all seem like magic numbers.

127
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,890
How are we supposed to know
which numbers are optimal?

128
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,530
This is the art of deep learning.

129
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,830
Figuring out the right parameters for
a certain type of model is the kind of

130
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:07,140
thing that research papers
focus on in this field.

131
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,150
Sometimes a simple tweak gives
rise to a breakthrough in accuracy.

132
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,180
We can use similar parameters to the
paper we chose to start and train this

133
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:22,110
model on our dataset. I have a Mac book
pro. Love you, apple. Let's Collab. Kay,

134
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:24,810
thanks, bye. And not a deep learning rig.

135
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,840
So I found that the best bet for me
is to upload my model to Floyd hub,

136
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,130
which is a platform as a service that
helps train deep learning models in the

137
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:39,630
cloud. We can do this in the command
line with just a few commands.

138
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,070
What it's doing is learning the
mapping between the input data,

139
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,700
which are the medical
images and the output data,

140
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,460
which are the diagnoses of the images.

141
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,000
Once it's learned this
pattern given a new image,

142
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,920
it can accurately predict what the
diagnosis is. Once it's done training,

143
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:03,921
we can use Floyd hub to create a basic
API call where we merely send it an image

144
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,840
and it will return the
prediction of that image.

145
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,480
With any web framework of our choice,

146
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,570
we can build a single web page that
asks the user to upload an image.

147
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,140
It will call the API and returned the
prediction for the user to see just like

that. From here, we can make programmatic
improvements, add a better design,

149
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,290
and finally start collecting some
sales. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,290
I've got three things for you
to remember from this video.

151
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,600
Ai Can help doctors better approach
patient problems and improve the health

152
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:40,560
system that supports them.
Improving diagnoses,

153
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,860
interpreting patient medical
history and drug discovery,

154
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,700
or just a few of the potential
practices that AI can improve on.

155
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,410
And we can build a simple model using
the Karrass deep learning library.

156
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,370
Then train and deploy it using Floyd hub.
