1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,030
Yes. Hello world. It's Saroj and
it might seem counterintuitive,

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,320
but machine learning can actually help
make dating more enjoyable and improve

3
00:00:14,321 --> 00:00:17,650
the quality of human relationships.
Specifically,

4
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:22,300
AI is currently being used in several
dating apps to help people spend less time

5
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:25,180
swiping and more quality time in person,

6
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:29,440
as well as helping discover optimally
compatible partners. In this video,

7
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:33,310
I'm going to explain how three Ai
Techniques, collaborative filtering,

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,230
image classification and language modeling
can automate the boring parts of the

9
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:42,580
dating pipeline to help you find
compatible matches much faster.

10
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,400
Ai Helps you get laid seriously.

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,570
It might surprise you to find out that
millennial spend about 10 hours a week on

12
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:53,980
dating apps and while the dating app
industry continually earns more revenue

13
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:54,814
every year,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,230
many users have developed a love hate
relationship with these algorithms.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,070
Dating apps have indeed made it
easier to find potential partners,

16
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,940
but they've also exposed
users to a host of new issues,

17
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,590
spending time mindlessly swiping,
dealing with texts that are superficial,

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,660
hurtful, and disappointing. Ghosting,
cat phishing, fake profiles,

19
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,490
getting matched with Matlab users put
together these negative aspects of online

20
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:25,900
dating have contributed to feelings of
anxiety and depression amongst users.

21
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,580
And the reality is that today more people
meet through online dating platforms

22
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,820
than off one technology
has already fundamentally
changed the nature of dating.

23
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,870
The question then becomes how can AI
help improve this experience? Sex robot,

24
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,730
Bro, I've got this in a way,
dating is all about data.

25
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,690
You spend time with another cumin, then
use that experience for data collection.

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,590
You then analyze that data to make
decisions like whether or not to see that

27
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:54,550
person again.

28
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,440
And we can in fact break down this
data science pipeline into three parts.

29
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,120
Discovery, first impressions and
intimacy. So let's start with discovery.

30
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,310
The popular dating app hinge found out
that only one in 500 swipes led to an

31
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:13,450
exchange of phone numbers, meaning the
time required to find a suitable match.

32
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,480
It's still quite a while.
And depending on where you live,

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,720
your potential pool of dating partners
can be anywhere from a few hundred to a

34
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,760
few million people. And if
you're picky like me, just one,

35
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,880
we need a way of automatically filtering
out all those options and presenting

36
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:32,680
users with the best one.

37
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,050
If Amazon can recommend products and
Netflix can recommend movies with machine

38
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:38,710
learning,

39
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,480
dating apps should theoretically be also
be able to harness the power of data

40
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,840
and algorithms to help
users find optimal matches.

41
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,700
One example of this is hinges recently
released feature titled Most compatible

42
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,750
that automatically sends users
one recommended match per day.

43
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,880
The way it does this is by using a
technique called content which provides

44
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,960
recommendations based on shared
preferences between users.

45
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,190
In the context of dating apps, it's
actually hard to find a paper on this.

46
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:13,480
Usually recommender system papers focus
on recommending products, not people,

47
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,840
but I did find one that details
and approach called recon.

48
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,280
The idea is that for each user we
built a distribution for every profile

49
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:23,710
attribute in order to
model their preferences.

50
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:26,590
Things like ASM or and
artists and all toast.

51
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,180
These distributions are aggregated based
on profiles that the user has indicated

52
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:35,230
interest towards via his or her
messaging and swiping behavior.

53
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,910
The point of capturing profile attribute
distributions is so that we can easily

54
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:44,911
calculate the compatibility between user
preferences and Unmet user profiles.

55
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,020
These compatibility scores will serve
as the basis for making recommendations.

56
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:55,350
The system analyzes other users that the
user has previously interacted with and

57
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:59,770
then builds a structured model in the
hope of capturing the preferences of the

58
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:00,604
user.

59
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,870
The result is a numerical score for new
users that helps predict the level of

60
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:08,500
interest I user may have in them.
So to sum it up,

61
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,730
build a preference model for each user
based on their history and profile

62
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:13,540
features.

63
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,980
Use that preference model to calculate
similarity scores with unmet users.

64
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,330
Then for each user,

65
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:24,010
create a ranked recommendation list based
on the similarity score is calculated

66
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,560
in the previous step. Yes,
it's cold and calculated,

67
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:30,430
but the guy's got a cuddle
somehow to improve accuracy,

68
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:33,040
we can consider a weighting
scheme for the attributes.

69
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,470
Attributes could be
initially weighted randomly.

70
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:37,780
Then after gathering messaging behavior,

71
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,010
these weights could be slowly
tuned towards the user's
preferences by learning,

72
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,910
say a neural network model,
optimize through gradient descent,

73
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,910
but that's just one way
to do recommendations.

74
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:52,570
There are many other ways and
the literature here is extensive.

75
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,580
We can expect more services to implement
this kind of feature as the data shows

76
00:04:57,581 --> 00:05:02,581
that people want to spend
less time swiping and more
time connecting with humans

77
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,450
in real life.
In fact,

78
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,600
human connection has become a somewhat
luxury good in 2019 in this age of screen

79
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,470
based interaction.

80
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,090
Anything that can have us spend less
time on screens and more time in person

81
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,680
with humans is beneficial for our health.
Yo, do you want to go outside for a bit?

82
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,450
Totally.
I'll meet you in fantasy forest.

83
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,780
So in the meantime while swipe culture
still exists and we haven't yet seen AI

84
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,350
that's good enough at recommendations
to be able to pick a most compatible

85
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:36,450
partner with very high accuracy,

86
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,200
we can automate the swiping
process using computer vision.

87
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,980
I found this app on get hub
called Tinder automation.

88
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,930
It's a simple script that lets you access
the Tinder API to swipe left or right

89
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,010
programmatically.

90
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,060
The first step is to create a
labeled Dataset by swiping yourself.

91
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,790
As we manually swiped
through each profile.

92
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,530
It will each image to a likes
folder or a dislikes folder.

93
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,640
After a few hours of Swiping,
we'll have collected over 10,000 images.

94
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:09,350
Perfect to train a model on this
is now a classification problem and

95
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,800
convolutional neural networks linked to
how they work in the video description

96
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,880
have proven to be supremely useful at
extracting a large enough amount of

97
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:21,200
features from images to be able to
detect the difference between two labels

98
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:24,050
automatically likes and dislikes.
In our case,

99
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,250
a simple CNN built with carrots will
do the trick and because our Dataset is

100
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:29,570
relatively small,

101
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,840
we can retrain an existing model called
Vgg 19 trained on millions of images to

102
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:40,460
leverage what it's learned previously on
our own dataset and improve our overall

103
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:42,500
predictive capability.
Once trained,

104
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:46,340
our CNN will have learned what I
find attractive and what I don't.

105
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,880
Now we will automate the process
of swiping on attractive partners.

106
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,480
We can now just let this run and after
a few hours we'll have the list of

107
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:57,650
matches setting as time in the discovery
process that we can instead use to

108
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:02,300
cause havoc in grand theft auto. We can
use AI to automate the discovery process,

109
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:07,040
but the next step is to give off a good
first impression to your matches and it

110
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:11,450
turns out AI can help us with that to
dating. APPS are somewhat superficial.

111
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,770
Users are asked to judge each other
based off of a single picture and a short

112
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:18,320
bio,
which makes it difficult to take history,

113
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,220
personality and character into account.
It's indeed a game,

114
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:26,990
so we want to play it well and the way
to do this is to approach it as a data

115
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,860
scientist.

116
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,180
We can find several studies online by
dating sites and research institutions

117
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,590
that have derived insights about what
makes an optimal profile that we can

118
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:39,080
incorporate into our own profile.

119
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,870
Things like making sure
the bio isn't too long.

120
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,010
The profile pic doesn't include
other people in it, no sunglasses,

121
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,220
avoiding using the term woke,
et Cetera, things like that.

122
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,640
Besides the generic advice.
If we want to get more detailed,

123
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:57,641
we can perform exploratory data analysis
on our own Tinder data using the Tinder

124
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,410
Api.
Looking at a heat map of messaging,

125
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,420
it seems like 9:00 PM on Sunday is the
best time to swipe for the most matches

126
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,680
and generally messages that are more
wordy are more likely to get a response.

127
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,150
Some apps are already using AI for
first impressions. Tinder, for example,

128
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:17,480
has a feature called smart photos
that alternates the images.

129
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:22,160
It shows on newer profiles and tracks
which images get the most rights swipes.

130
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,660
It builds this data over
time and gradually refines
the image order until the

131
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:30,860
highest performing images up first.
When someone views your profile,

132
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,190
it builds a data set to
learn from on the fly.

133
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,680
Another tool for this is photofeeler,

134
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,330
which uses humans to rate your photos
and AI to monitor boat quality,

135
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,200
detect fraud,
and optimize the accuracy of test results.

136
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,420
These tools will help
optimize our pictures, but in
order to optimize our bios,

137
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,550
we can find a collection
of existing Tinder.

138
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:57,551
Bio's perhaps hire humans via Amazon's
mechanical Turk service to label each

139
00:08:57,751 --> 00:08:59,730
attractive or not attractive.

140
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,650
Then train a simple text classifier on it
to judge if a bio is attractive or not.

141
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,660
When we create our own bio,

142
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:10,320
we can then classify it to see if
it's quality or not. In this way,

143
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:14,730
AI can help us make the
best first impression in any
dating app with an optimal

144
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:19,020
bio and profile pic, but when it
comes to first impressions in person,

145
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,310
we have to think of something clever to
say, right? Yes, but just for the Lols,

146
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,630
I generated some pickup lines using
Google's newly released Burt model.

147
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,640
Burt was trained on lots of existing
text data and we can retrain just the top

148
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:36,690
layer of it on our pickup lines
to have it start generating texts.

149
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,770
Detailed video on how that works in
the video description. Thanks Ai.

150
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,760
Now we've used an AI to help us with
discovering a partner and making a good

151
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:48,990
first impression. It's time for the
last part of the pipeline. Intimacy.

152
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,160
Ai Can help humans communicate their needs
and desires with their partner better.

153
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,143
For example,

154
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,740
British dating APP love flutter uses
AI to analyze chats in real time to

155
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:02,610
determine compatibility and gently
nudge users to meet if it feels they're

156
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:03,870
getting along really well.

157
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,790
The voice operated dating app called
aim helps set up a time for a phone call

158
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,200
between you and your match and even gives
you advice for your first date based

159
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:15,720
on what it knows about the other person.

160
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,490
It also reminds you to ask questions
about the things that are important to you

161
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,020
during the date as well.

162
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,850
Afterwards the APP checks in with both
parties to see how it went and recommends

163
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:29,760
whether they should continue
to see each other afterwards.

164
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,790
We can envision this as
a multi component system.

165
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,820
It first learns both user preferences
to predict points of attraction between

166
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:39,960
them using collaborative filtering.

167
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,000
Then it can output the results in a plain
English way by feeding the results to

168
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:48,300
a generative language model.
Remember the Black Mirror episode?

169
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:51,840
Hang the DJ Black Mirror is just reality.

170
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,480
Dr Khai Thu least stated
at the end of his book,

171
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:58,920
Ai Superpowers that the one thing
humans can do, that no machine can,

172
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,600
is love and be loved.

173
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,230
Ai could theoretically get to the
point where it could develop romantic

174
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,360
relationships with other humans,

175
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,400
allow her and full 5 cents virtual reality
could synthetically help us feel the

176
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:16,380
feelings of desire and pleasure that
we get from otherwise traditional human

177
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:20,520
relationships. But is that something
we want? The desire for love,

178
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,900
intimacy and trust and connection is
human machine learning tools can help make

179
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:29,340
it easier for all of us to achieve
these desires with other humans.

180
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,010
Define more loving,
more trusting,

181
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:36,780
more connected relationships with
other imperfect conscious beings.

182
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,500
And until we're able to replicate
consciousness in a machine,

183
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,480
if that turns out to be possible,

184
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,800
it's best to build tools that facilitate
human connection rather than trying to

185
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:49,440
replace it with technology.
Thus,

186
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:53,650
there are three things to remember from
this video. Ai Can help optimize time,

187
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:58,360
investment compatibility, assessment
and intimacy in human relationships.

188
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,070
Techniques like collaborative filtering
can learn how to optimally match users

189
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,220
based on compatibility and both generative
and classification models can help

190
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:12,220
with the process of discovery.
First Impressions and communication.

191
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,290
You think a machine will
be able to love some day?

192
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,530
Let me know in the comment section and
please subscribe for more programming

193
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:22,000
videos. For now, I'm going to love
myself, so thanks for watching.
