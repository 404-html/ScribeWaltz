00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,090
Hello world it Saroj and
how are you supposed to find
a meaningful job or career

2
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:06,774
in your life?

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,010
I'm going to talk about eight steps you
can take today that will help you do

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,380
just that.
Thanks to social media.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,150
You can get attention and validation for
your life choices by sharing pieces of

6
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,870
yourself online. We live in an
age of instant gratification.

7
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:25,740
Many times we do things just for
the likes they'll receive. In fact,

8
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:29,820
there are entire exhibits that have
been built just for Instagram selfies

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,260
because of this,
the expectations of how awesome our lives,

10
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:37,530
our from our friends and
family can run pretty high.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,760
So while it might be easy to say,
I love my new job at Airbnb,

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,390
it's a lot harder to say I don't
know what I want to do with my life.

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,390
Because of how people could
negatively perceived that.

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,770
It can be really hard to admit that
your last, if you let yourself,

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,060
your mind could just wander through all
the negative things people could think

16
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:57,894
of you like,

17
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,460
doesn't he have a plan or why isn't she
contributing something useful instead of

18
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:05,130
waiting around?
But the fact is this,

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,680
it is completely okay to be confused,

20
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,800
to be uncertain about what
you want to do in life.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,870
In the preindustrial period,

22
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:17,170
there were about 30 different trades a
person could do from being a blacksmith

23
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,420
to a barrel maker,

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,540
but fast forward to today and career
websites list tens of thousands of

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,760
potential jobs you could do and the result
of all of these options or that often

26
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:33,540
we get so anxious about making the wrong
choice that we end up not making any

27
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:37,260
choice at all. Psychologists
call this the paradox of choice.

28
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,150
Too many options can leave you standing
in one place like a deer caught in the

29
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:45,270
headlights and because
we can be so risk averse,

30
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,860
our minds tend to exaggerate everything
that could possibly go wrong.

31
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,940
So it's not easy to change jobs
or find an entirely new job.

32
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,320
There's bound to be a lot of confusion
you go through in order to get there and

33
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:02,010
that's okay. You've got to
recognize this confusion as natural,

34
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,690
get comfortable with it and once you do
that, you'll be able to move forward.

35
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,850
Accepting your confusion is the first
step, but clearing it up is the next.

36
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,710
In order to clear it up, you've got to
take some time to reflect on yourself.

37
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,420
Who are you? What are your unique
gifts? What matters to you the most?

38
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,910
What kind of impact do you
want to have in the world?

39
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,610
Take some time to be introspective.

40
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,080
I keep a journal where I write about
a paragraph summary of my day at least

41
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:31,914
twice a week.

42
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,780
A helpful exercise can be to write down
five traits that best describe you and

43
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,980
then ask to close friends to give you five
traits they would use to describe you.

44
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,480
You might be surprised by what they say
and you'll definitely learn more about

45
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:50,010
yourself. Think about what you
can't stop yourself from doing.

46
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,920
What are your habits?
What are your flaws?

47
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,420
You've got a unique set of skills that
you likely don't even fully realize and

48
00:02:57,421 --> 00:03:02,110
it's when you are able to combine all
those skills in a way that no one else

49
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:06,970
can, that you'll find success. Discover
your weirdness and embrace it fully.

50
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,760
The more you know yourself,
the more capable you will be.

51
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:14,320
A finding work that matters to you.
And let's face it, nobody's perfect.

52
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,260
Everybody's got some kind of imperfection.

53
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:21,550
And that's okay because everybody has
something unique to contribute to the

54
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:25,180
world. So it's important to
remember to love yourself,

55
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,890
and that's a daily practice.

56
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,610
If you love yourself and all
your beautiful imperfections,

57
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,020
you'll take better care of your health.
You'll have more confidence, more style,

58
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:39,940
more swag, and you'll be more courageous
to do what you've always wanted to do.

59
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,920
It gives you the freedom to fail,

60
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,570
to learn from that failure and
the drive to continue despite it.

61
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,550
So writing out your personal strengths
and weaknesses is a great way to learn

62
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:56,050
more about yourself. But picking a
career you've never tried before,

63
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:58,390
based on that alone is a mistake.

64
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,380
You could find that the job that perfectly
fits the profile you've created for

65
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:06,310
yourself is in reality,
not that fulfilling or exciting to you.

66
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,810
So instead of planning,

67
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,850
then implementing act first and reflect
later by switching to a model of rapid

68
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,370
experimentation. Find some
free time, whether that's in
the evenings and weekends.

69
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,910
If you currently have a day job
or if you have some savings,

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,930
even better use this time to try out a
list of things that you've always wanted

71
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:27,730
to try to think.
You might enjoy.

72
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:30,640
Developing security techniques
for the Internet of things.

73
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,020
Volunteer for an open source
project that centers around that.

74
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,890
How about product management?
Sales content creation.

75
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,130
There are online communities and projects
that will allow you to take on any

76
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:48,820
role you'd like. Give each of them a
shot. Try One out for as long as you like.

77
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,930
Trying not speculating is the only way
to really know whether or not you'd enjoy

78
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:54,764
the activity.

79
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,120
I worked as a software engineer for a
few years before randomly deciding to try

80
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:03,490
out a role as a developer
educator at Twillio.

81
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,620
That's where I realized that I preferred
teaching code to maintaining it and

82
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:09,640
while I worked there,

83
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:14,440
one of my many side projects was starting
a youtube channel and I had to start

84
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:16,420
doing it to realize that,
hey,

85
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,350
this is what I actually enjoy
more than anything else. In fact,

86
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:24,520
I would take a huge pay cut just to be
able to do this full time and that's

87
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:25,690
exactly what I did.

88
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,160
Unimportant realization for me was that
it's not about finding what you love to

89
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:33,580
do, it's about finding the
people you love to serve.

90
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,590
If you can find that almost any work
you do for them immediately becomes

91
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:42,100
fulfilling. And for me it's
been the developer community.

92
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,420
Imagine you could literally do anything
and have any kind of life you'd want.

93
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,310
What does that life look like?

94
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,060
In order to get to that life
you need to create a goal plan.

95
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,090
What I do is I have a set
of daily, weekly, monthly,

96
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:58,010
and five year goals
that I write to myself.

97
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,090
I make sure that the smaller goals are
achievable in the short term and that

98
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:04,130
gives me a positive feedback loop.

99
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,790
A set of mini victories that
encourage me to continue.

100
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,350
Goals are your dreams there. What gets
you excited to wake up in the morning?

101
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,480
They're the driving force in your life.

102
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,130
That can be anything you'd like and
meaningful work is one big way to help you

103
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:23,150
achieve them. It's important to be
really specific about your goals.

104
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,410
If they're too broad,

105
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:28,610
like teach people instead of teach
children programming in python,

106
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,790
you'll never get started and
once you have your goals,

107
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,660
you have to learn to say no to
everything else, but that goal,

108
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,660
just imagine if you had
the idea to start Google,

109
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:43,100
Amazon and Facebook 20 years ago.
If you picked one of them,

110
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:45,770
you can be worth billions
of dollars right now,

111
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,760
but if you try it out all three at once,
you'd be nowhere.

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,860
Everyone has great ideas,

113
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:56,210
but the problem is that too many
great ideas cancel each other out.

114
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,340
The most successful people in history,

115
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:03,341
everyone from Einstein to Jay z had mono
maniacal focus on a larger single goal.

116
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,200
If you feel like a goal is too boring
to dedicate all your time to it than aim

117
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:11,450
higher,
the more ambitious the goal,

118
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:16,451
the more exciting it becomes and the key
to be able to have this laser focus is

119
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:18,000
self discipline.

120
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,970
Developing real discipline is one of
the most overlooked but most important

121
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,770
things you can do for yourself
professionally and for your own happiness.

122
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:32,120
One of the questions I get the
most is how did you get so smart?

123
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,770
It's not that I'm some genius who came
out of the womb knowing AI like the back

124
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:37,604
of my hand.

125
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,800
I developed the discipline to study it
and so did every other great practitioner

126
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:43,640
in this field.

127
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,990
Discipline is the difference between
those who fail and those who succeed.

128
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,820
It's a learned skill and you can build
it just like you build any other skill

129
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,860
one step at a time. So start small. Get
yourself to say, meditate every day.

130
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,600
Then add onto it maybe a journal entry
every night or brushing your teeth twice

131
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:07,040
a day instead of once or not letting
yourself work from home or getting up at a

132
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:11,960
certain time every day. The more you
make these habits a part of your routine,

133
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,640
the more second nature they'll become to
you and thus the more discipline you'll

134
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:20,750
build. And this discipline carries
out into every aspect of your life.

135
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,870
When I was first starting my
youtube channel, it was really,

136
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:28,400
really hard to release two videos a week.
And as my audience grew,

137
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:30,260
so did the expectations they had,

138
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,590
I was under a lot of pressure
and it was very uncomfortable.

139
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,150
But because I had the discipline
to stick to my release schedule,

140
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,360
everything became easier
and more manageable.

141
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:46,361
Over time I learned to adapt and now
it all feels like second nature to do.

142
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,020
Over time,

143
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:53,050
my work has definitely improved and I
can credit that improvement in a huge way

144
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:55,890
to one thing,
being open to feedback.

145
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,890
I am constantly reading comments,
replies,

146
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,820
emails from my viewers and using

Sometimes it can sting,

148
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,940
but it's really important to let go of
your ego when it comes to constructive

149
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:12,810
feedback and use it to help you
guide your work. If you can do that,

150
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:15,630
you'll not only be able
to find meaningful work,

151
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,500
but you'll be able to excel at it
like no one ever did before you.

152
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,210
So I hope these tips were helpful and
the best time to get started on your

153
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:28,680
journey to find meaningful work is
right now. So what are you waiting for?
