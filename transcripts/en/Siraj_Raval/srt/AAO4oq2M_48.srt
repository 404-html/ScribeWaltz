1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,730
Hey, hello world it Saroj.
Welcome to my live stream.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,050
My other live stream a software
was, you know, technical issues.

3
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:17,030
So that's not heavy.
But anyway,

4
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:20,210
in this video we're going to perform
some quantum machine learning,

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,540
some very exciting stuff.
There's some people in the,

6
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:27,170
in the other life room that
need the link to this video.

7
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,620
So I'm going to go ahead and post it in
that India video description to that.

8
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:32,360
Okay. Um, so anyway,

9
00:00:32,361 --> 00:00:34,820
so we're going to talk about quantum
machine learning in this video.

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,820
I've got two great. Um, I've got some
great topics to cover. There's a lot,

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,810
actually, there's, there's so
much to cover here. Um, but uh,

12
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,040
let me just pack that in nature.

13
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:50,990
Everybody's coming into this live
stream that we have going on right now.

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,880
Everybody's in. Okay, cool. Just slight
little technical error. It happens.

15
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,690
And now we've got people in here,
right? 280 viewers in your, okay.

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,530
So let's just get right into this code.
Um, Oh, before we get into the code,

17
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:04,520
I just want to say something.

18
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:09,550
I want to say that D-Wave Wade went
ahead and invited me to their office and

19
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:12,320
then Vancouver and it was a,

20
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:16,610
it was a pretty cool experience and a
seeing is believing. So I can, I can see,

21
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,530
I can definitely say that I saw a
quantum computer myself in person.

22
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,700
I met some really cool people
there and I, I just, I'm,

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,170
I'm a believer now I'm a believer in
the power of quantum computing to help

24
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:33,370
accelerate machine
learning applications and,

25
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,880
and to help us create new
types of algorithms that we
did not think are possible.

26
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,170
So in this,

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,610
in this video I'm going to
go over quantum mechanics,

28
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,020
quantum computing,

29
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,830
including the hardware and how
cubits work in terms of the hardware.

30
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:51,080
And then we're going to demo some
machine learning applications. Okay.

31
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:52,970
So I'm going to go ahead and screen share.

32
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,660
So unfortunately we might not be able
to see each other a while we do this,

33
00:01:56,661 --> 00:02:01,050
but um, that's just how it goes. And I'll
hit, I'll be answering questions as well.

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,360
So let me go ahead and
move that out of the way.

35
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,820
And it looks like screen
sharing is working great.

36
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:09,600
So let's go right into this
a lecture we have here.

37
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,280
Okay, here's our lecture. Let me, let me

38
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,850
and make sure everybody's in this,
in this chat room. By the way,

39
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,880
we've got a lot of people who need to
be in here and I just want to make sure

40
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:28,790
that the links are working. You know,
everything's working. All right, cool.

41
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:33,060
People are listening. There's
got 500 people watching this. Uh,

42
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,450
this, this thing right now. Okay? So,

43
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:36,800
okay.

44
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,470
Okay. So you guys can hear me,
right? Right. So here's, here's,

45
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:43,210
here's what we're going to do.
This I want to see, uh, the,

46
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,000
I want to see people qualities low,
right? Let me, let me make it better.

47
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,140
Let me make the quality just a little
bit better by making this bigger. And

48
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,260
hello from Brazil, right?
Everybody's there. Okay, so
here we go. With this, let's,

49
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,180
let's get right into this. Okay. So
first of what is quantum mechanics?

50
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,190
Quantum mechanics is

51
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,780
cc me, a, uh,

52
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,690
sprint. Hey, then that's just going to be
in the corner. So I'll be in the corner.

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,670
Okay, cool. All right. So you know,
whenever it works for now, whatever works.

54
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,890
Okay. So, um, what is quantum
mechanics? Quantum mechanics is,

55
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,630
uh, at the subatomic level
things or different, okay. Tldr,

56
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,430
things are different.
At the subatomic level,

57
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:41,170
mattered is quantized energy
is [inaudible]. Momentum
is quantized meaning.

58
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,830
There are some really strange
phenomenon happening at the,

59
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:49,270
at the subatomic level, at the level of
particles of electrons, things like that.

60
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:54,271
So the official definition is quantum
mechanics is the body of scientific laws

61
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:58,240
that describe the motion and
interaction of photons, electrons,

62
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:01,660
and other subatomic particles
that make up the universe. Okay?

63
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:06,060
So very exciting stuff. So if we
were to flip a coin, okay, so here,

64
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,610
here's an example. If we were
to flip a coin, in our reality,

65
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,860
we are used to one truth,
okay?

66
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:16,060
That coin either fall on heads
or he will fall on tails, right?

67
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:19,390
It's going to be either
one or the other and um,

68
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,200
make sure that I'm over here in
the, in the corner, okay? Right?

69
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:27,180
It's either going to be heads
where it's going to be tales.

70
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,120
And so we're used to one
truth in our reality.

71
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,100
We're used to one truth in our reality

72
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,760
and but at the quantum level,
there are multiple truths.

73
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,620
A coin can be in both heads and tails
at the same time. So in our reality,

74
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,970
when we flip a coin, okay,
so I'm, I'm demonstrate. We
flip a coin, we look at it,

75
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:49,820
we know that it's going to go up.
We know that it's going to go down.

76
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,360
We know that it's going to hit land
on heads or tails. There is one truth,

77
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,260
but at the sub atomic level,
at the, at the smallest,

78
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,050
at the smallest level of the universe,

79
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,990
the laws of physics behave differently.

80
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,080
There are multiple truths and we can prove
those multiple truths mathematically.

81
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,870
What do I mean? Let's assume
that I'm going to flip a
coin as a particle, so I'm,

82
00:05:12,871 --> 00:05:16,700
I'm now Saroj at the subatomic level.
Now at the subatomic level,

83
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,400
when I flipped a coin
and I don't look at it,

84
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,030
that coin is going to eternally
just be flipping in midair.

85
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,020
It's going to be both heads
and tails at the same time.

86
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,320
It's going to be both heads
and tails at the same time.

87
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,650
These are both completely true.
At the same time,

88
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,410
a coin can be in both heads and tails.

89
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,590
A particle can be in two
different states at the same time.

90
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,150
These are both completely in 100% truth.
Okay?

91
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,450
And I don't say realities because
this is happening in our reality.

92
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,220
And so if I observed this
coin, then immediately it
will pick it heads or tails.

93
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,750
And when I say observe,

94
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,820
that doesn't mean a conscious
observer that any kind of measurement,

95
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,920
either human nonhuman machine,

96
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,570
any time that that coin is
measured by any device, anything,

97
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,350
then it will pick either heads or tails.
And while it's in the air,

98
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,120
it is going to be a probability of heads
and a probability of tails at the same

99
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:15,770
time,
say 70 and 30%.

100
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,930
So how do we describe this
kind of crazy behavior? Right?

101
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,730
This is wild. This is wild. Well,

102
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,750
it turns out we can describe this
behavior mathematically and this is what

103
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:30,920
quantum mechanics is all about. Okay? Let
me make sure everybody's following here.

104
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,750
Uh, rock. Wow, great. 737
people here. Great. So, um,

105
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,310
okay. So there was this experiment
called the double slit experiment.

106
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,650
And I'm going to answer some
questions after we get through this.

107
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:46,330
Before we start coding, I will
start coding by the way. So, uh,

108
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,250
there's this experiment called
the double slit experiments.

109
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,410
And how it works is you
take an electron beam gun,

110
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:56,440
so it's just beaming out light and it
goes through two slits and then it's going

111
00:06:56,441 --> 00:07:00,620
to land on the screen. And what's
going to happen is when we do this,

112
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,050
we're going to see this number two
that's on the right here. Let me,

113
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,100
let me make this a lot bigger.

114
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,300
We're going to see this number two
image that's on the right here. So it's,

115
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:12,320
it's to be, we're going to be able to
observe what is called interference.

116
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,960
So two different waves through the,
through.

117
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:19,130
Both of those slits will interfere with
each other. And that's kind of weird,

118
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:19,311
right?

119
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:23,960
Because we would assume that either light
is made up of particles or it's made

120
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:27,800
up of waves. Well, it turns out
that light is both, actually,

121
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,600
it's both a particle and a wave.

122
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,130
And we can describe this mathematically
using what's called Schrodinger's

123
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:38,540
equation. Okay, how do we
describe the properties of light?

124
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,530
How do we describe this particle
wave duality that light is,

125
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,930
and this is happening
at the quantum level.

126
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,110
So Schrodinger's equation helps
describe this particle wave duality.

127
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,190
And in the red that is Schrodinger's
equation and it's actually based off of a

128
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:58,200
lot of different theories in physics.
What the what,

129
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,420
how do we compute kinetic energy,
potential energy, conservation of energy.

130
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,660
So there's actually a lot of theory
behind it and we're not going to describe

131
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:07,340
that right now,
but just so you know,

132
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,520
things behave differently
at the quantum level.

133
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,450
And so the reason I talked about this
example is that quantum computing,

134
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:19,780
quantum algorithms exploit three
features from quantum mechanics.

135
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,260
And those three features are
number one super position.

136
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,770
Remember when I talked about the coin
flipping and then just being in mid air

137
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,630
and being both heads and tails?

138
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,990
That's called superposition in mid air
a coin to be in both heads and tails at

139
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:38,250
the same time. That's super position. Um,

140
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,120
and here's a great image of that. I know
it's in French, but a cyber lock on job.

141
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,610
No, I love French. But this was
the best image I could find on,

142
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,820
on the idea of super position.
Now there's a second feature.

143
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,970
It's called interference. Now, don't
worry if none of this makes sense yet,

144
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:56,930
by the way, I just really want it to
describe quantum mechanics. Okay. I,

145
00:08:56,931 --> 00:09:01,500
I just think it's so cool. It is so
cool. I don't think it is so cool.

146
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,310
So where were we?

147
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,060
So super position is the second feature,
right? So that's the first thing. You're,

148
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:10,920
the second feature is interference,
right?

149
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:13,110
So those waves and the
double split experiment,

150
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,110
when those waves collided with each other,
that's interference.

151
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:18,420
They overlapped and
canceled each other out.

152
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,860
And the third feature is entanglement.
Now this is,

153
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:27,861
this is kind of hard to even explain in
the context of classical mechanics or in

154
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:30,930
the context of anything that we know of,
right?

155
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:33,520
This is actually quite an interesting,
um,

156
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,590
this is quite an interesting phenomenon,
but Tldr,

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,330
two particles that are
entangled affect each other.

158
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,180
So if you observe a particle here,
it's going to affect the other.

159
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,970
And there is no amount
of distance that matters.

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,210
Like this could be across the universe
and to particles could be entangled

161
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:54,000
across the universe.
Okay?

162
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:58,150
So those are the features of quantum
mechanics that quantum computing, um,

163
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,670
utilizes or exploits.

164
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,200
So we know that a bit in classical
computing can either be one or zero.

165
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,010
And in quantum computing a bit
can be both at the same time.

166
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:13,010
A cubit is called a cubit. Now a lot of
us have heard the term cubits, right? We,

167
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,130
we've heard this term,

168
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:19,080
but what really is physically
what physically is a cubit, right?

169
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,490
So before we get into that,

170
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,670
a quantum computer is using humans to
supply information and communicate through

171
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:28,750
the system, okay? It can be an,

172
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,100
and so one really simple
way to demonstrate the
power of cubits is to think

173
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:38,880
about the example of me using a

174
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,090
thank you. So Liam, I appreciate that.

175
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,760
So an easy example is,
uh,

176
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,130
thinking about writing a
random x on a page, okay,

177
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:53,430
I'm just going to write an x on a page
in a book and I'm going to put it in a

178
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:57,000
library with a million other boats.
Now classically,

179
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,000
we'd have to sort through all
of those books to find the x.

180
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,740
But in a quantum computer,

181
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,950
accubid in super position
can be in multiple places
at once simultaneously so it

182
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:11,820
can analyze every page at the
same time and find x instantly.

183
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,450
Now that is a theoretical
example because why? Why?

184
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,450
Because cubits are a lot of fun.
Okay.

185
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,950
Unlike classical computers that
can be in a super imposed, a super,

186
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,260
super imposed state.

187
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,050
Now we are all used to classical,
uh, sea moss transistors.

188
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:32,700
These are silicon transistors.

189
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,710
CMOS stands for complimentary
metal oxide semiconductors.

190
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,960
And the way they encode and access
information is by using voltage, right?

191
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,260
So Zeros and ones.
What really represents zeroes and ones?

192
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,680
How do we create these states,
these binary states? Well,

193
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:53,920
the way we create them is by
using electricity, right? Voltage.

194
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,310
The voltage of a transistor
is addressed by a bus,

195
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,610
which is able to set into a
state of either zero or one.

196
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,450
That's how transistors work and taught
the computer you're using works,

197
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:10,330
but in a quantum machine, instead
of using that, they used a squid,

198
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,180
a superconducting quantum
interference device,

199
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,820
essentially a quantum transistor.

200
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:21,010
Now what does a quantum transistor
look like? Well, it's used,

201
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,750
it's instead of using silicon, it's
using a metal called neophobia. Okay.

202
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:30,350
The OPO, and this is a very, very
interesting Christine Metal, the opium,

203
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,590
I saw it myself actually at the way.
Very cool stuff.

204
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,670
But this metal is called Neovia.
And the the,

205
00:12:37,671 --> 00:12:42,671
the really interesting property of
Neovia is that when we cool it down to

206
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,230
absolute near absolute zero temperatures,

207
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,070
like really freeze freeze this day,
then it's going to,

208
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,780
it's going to be become known as,
it's going to become a superconductor.

209
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,380
It starts to exhibit quantum
mechanical effects. What do I mean?

210
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,310
So here's an example of a cubit
built with this neodymium metal.

211
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,650
And so what happens is instead of
encoding states using electricity,

212
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,900
we are encoding states using
magnetism, which is, you know,

213
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,550
still based on the electricity,
right? Electromagnetism.

214
00:13:13,551 --> 00:13:16,370
But the idea is that when we,

215
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,340
when we cool this Neovia metal,

216
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,880
it's going to create this magnetic wave
in either up or down direction of either

217
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:26,624
up or down.

218
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,880
And that's going to allow us to encode
a two states as tiny magnetic fields,

219
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,850
right? He's going to be plus
one. It could be minus one.

220
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,140
And that can be plus one and minus one
at the same time, which is super cool.

221
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,430
And so by adjusting a
control knob on our computer,

222
00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:48,390
we can put all of these cubits
right, these little magnetic, um,

223
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:52,970
like magnetic coils coil is
not really the right word here.

224
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:53,960
These magnetic,

225
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,120
I'm super imposed a
particle cubits states,

226
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,380
we can put them all into a
state, which we can entanglement,

227
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,430
right?
We can entangle them.

228
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:10,431
So what happens when we take a single
cubit and we try to couple them with other

229
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:14,730
cubits so that we can have a more powerful
quantum computer? How do we do that?

230
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:16,380
So here's what it looks like.
So in this,

231
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,490
in this image we are seeing these
scripts, these gold strips, these are,

232
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,620
these are cubits.
So there are eight cubits.

233
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:27,080
Your four by four and the blue dots
represent what are called couplers there

234
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,470
couplers for these cubits.

235
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,500
And what the couplers do is there may
come superconducting loops and they put

236
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:38,430
many elements together and they allow
these cubits to interact with each other,

237
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,140
right? The more Cubans we have, the the
fact the, the faster our computer is.

238
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:48,820
And in fact we see an exponential speedup
where n is the number of cubits. Um,

239
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,660
you know, it's, it is an exponential speed
up the more cubits that we add, right?

240
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:58,130
So it's a magnetic field going through
the superconductor and we are putting

241
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:01,340
currents on either end of what
are called Josephson junctions,

242
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,490
which allow for this magnetic
field to be created. Um,

243
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:11,030
this quantum mechanical field that can
represent two states at the same time

244
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,950
when it's cooled. And so the really
interesting bit about the Qp, you,

245
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:19,910
the quantum processing unit, is that
there are no large areas of memory.

246
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:24,530
We're used to CPU, we're used
to von Neumann architecture,
right? Where we have,

247
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,150
we have a processor and then we have
memory but in a quantum computer,

248
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:32,360
but the processor and the memory
are interpolated together.

249
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,680
So it is both processing data and
it's storing data at the same time.

250
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,840
In that way it is very similar to neurons
in the brain in that we can think of

251
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:45,660
Cubans as neurons that
both process data and um,

252
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,900
store store data as well.

253
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,770
And we can think of the
couplers as synopsis that
we're connecting these neurons

254
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:52,604
together.

255
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,630
Okay.

256
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,930
Okay. So super, super cool stuff here.
And who provides these computers? Well,

257
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,650
D-Wave obviously IBM,
Google,

258
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:04,860
Microsoft until a lot of big players are
working on this right now I'm hitting,

259
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:09,020
we're, we're going to start seeing a
lot of startups coming to this space,

260
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:13,370
which is why I am talking about
this because the time is now,

261
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:18,550
the time is now for those of you who
are hungry to build applications for the

262
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:23,120
world that are going to
solve real business problems.

263
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,650
The time to use quantum computing is now
to speed up existing machine learning

264
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:32,270
algorithms and create entirely new
classes of machine running algorithms that

265
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:35,780
did not exist before. And I'm going to
show you how to do that in this video.

266
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,500
Now, Dewayne has a lot of
patents. When I was there,

267
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,970
I literally saw a massive wall of patents,
uh, which is good for them, right?

268
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,700
You know, market share, um,
that's going to be good for them.

269
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:50,960
And then there are others and so they've
been building a stronger and a bigger

270
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:54,920
and a faster quantum computer
over the past couple of years. Um,

271
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,280
and so, so that, that, that's
what that space is like. Okay.

272
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:02,480
So here's the big question. Are they
faster than classical computers, right?

273
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,820
That is the big question
that we want to answer here.

274
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,570
Or are they faster than
classical computers?

275
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,000
Right?
I liked the way you guys think.

276
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,870
So the answer is for some problems.
Okay.

277
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,500
It's not like they are going to
completely replace conventional classical

278
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:22,900
computers,
but they will augment that.

279
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:26,860
They will augment them and they will think
of them as a six. Right? Think of them.

280
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:31,360
Has specially special devices
for a specific set of problems,

281
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,580
just like we think of CPU at or CPS
or a processing sequential data.

282
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,450
GPS are great and matrix operations,
uh,

283
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,720
quantum computers or great at

284
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,030
solving problems that
involve quantum data.

285
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:54,050
So anything involving a simulation where
you're trying to simulate our universe

286
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:58,470
because our universe operates using
both classical and quantum mechanics.

287
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,680
And that is in fact why Richard Fiman
wrote the paper on this, you know,

288
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,450
a couple of decades ago because he
envisioned a computer that could simulate

289
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:10,630
reality perfectly.
And the only way to do that,

290
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:15,690
it's use a quantum computer so that we
can simulate quantum mechanics and um,

291
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,410
right. So, so there's that. We can use it
to speed up machine learning algorithms.

292
00:18:20,411 --> 00:18:22,810
We'll get into that in a second.
Um,

293
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:27,500
and so it's actually really hard to
build a quantum computer as well. Um,

294
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:31,780
we can think of this whole process
of quantum computing as a process of

295
00:18:31,781 --> 00:18:34,360
engineering.
The pattern of a complex set of waves,

296
00:18:34,361 --> 00:18:38,770
these electromagnetic waves in hopes of
channeling that flow towards the correct

297
00:18:38,771 --> 00:18:43,360
answer. So in machine learning, we are
used to defining an objective function,

298
00:18:43,361 --> 00:18:45,340
right?
We've got this objective function,

299
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,730
we're gonna and then we're going to learn
a function with a proper coefficients

300
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:50,530
using some optimization scheme,

301
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:55,080
like say gradient descent to get
solved that objective. And you know,

302
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:56,400
we might have some constraints.

303
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,720
Now in the quantum world when we
are doing quantum machine learning,

304
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,410
that same idea is there of
us to finding an objective.

305
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,000
But there is much more of an emphasis
on defining what the constraints of the

306
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:14,001
problem are because it's like defining
the constraints of the problem.

307
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:18,150
And then just like letting these waves
interact in ways that we have no idea how

308
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:20,730
they're gonna interact and then hopefully
it's going to come up with a solution

309
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,850
to our problem. Right? We don't know
what that answer is going to be,

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,700
but we can define the constraints
of the problem, you know,

311
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:30,360
threshold values and you know,
lower balance, things like that.

312
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,500
And then we'll converge on the function.
Okay. And that's kind of hazy. We'll get,

313
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:36,060
we'll get more detailed in a second here.

314
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,260
But there's another problem with
comp Quanta computers is that they,

315
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,470
they fall into this decoherence
coherence state, right? Uh, where, uh,

316
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,840
basically there are leaks there,
these quantum leaks,

317
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,460
and it's really hard to keep them all
in this coherent state where they're

318
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,060
entangled, they're working together and
they're, they're used to compute things.

319
00:19:57,061 --> 00:20:01,050
You know, it's, it's, it's the mixture
of variables involved in cooling and,

320
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,250
you know,
things like that.

321
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:06,900
So it's hard and a lot of times it's
not worth the effort to build a quantum

322
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:09,270
computer when you could just
solve a problem. Classically.

323
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:15,220
So what are the applications
of quantum computing now? Uh,

324
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,110
there are a lot,
these are being used in production,

325
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:22,310
so from cryptography to medicine
to obviously machine learning,

326
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,680
searching for, you know, in big datasets.

327
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,370
And I've actually got a giant list here
for different industries and how quantum

328
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:33,580
computing can be used to solve
problems in these industries.

329
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:37,270
So definitely check this out. You know,
a lot of different industries here.

330
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,850
Um,
and so even Dewayne,

331
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,940
they've got this great a landing page
that shows their clients and what they're

332
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,930
using for using quantum computing. So
from Volkswagen, Booz Allen, you know,

333
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:54,430
recruiting and NASA is using
it. Um, material simulation.

334
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:58,810
Like I said, I'm like five minute
envisioned, Monte Carlo simulations,

335
00:20:58,811 --> 00:20:59,644
things like that.

336
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:00,600
Okay.

337
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,770
And so we can think of this stage that
quantum peers are at now at the same

338
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:07,200
stage at classical computers
were in the 50s, right?

339
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:11,880
Still very introductory technology.
We have some basic idea of how these,

340
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,370
how this hardware works. But think
about classical computing. Do you,

341
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,660
you don't think that the people designing
the CPU in the 50s had a idea that

342
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,850
apps like Facebook and you know, et
Cetera, but the apps that we all use,

343
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,160
um, would actually exist.
It's such a, it's so,

344
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,990
it's so far off from the
original idea of a, you know,

345
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,470
okay.

346
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:39,580
Uh, about the hardware. So
here's, here's the real,

347
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,700
here's the real question.
How can it be used for machine learning?

348
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,590
So when I was there at the wave,

349
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,060
yeah,

350
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,750
when I was there at the
wave, I was very, um,

351
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:56,030
happy with, uh, the, the, the team.
They answered a lot of my questions,

352
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:59,270
a bunch of quantum scientists.
We all sat in a huge circle and just,

353
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,490
I was asking them
questions left and right.

354
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:05,810
And this is such an exciting
field of study of research.

355
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,770
Quantum computing is such an exciting
field because there's so much to discover

356
00:22:09,771 --> 00:22:14,450
still. But there are four known ways
that it can be used for machine learning,

357
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,010
including optimization,
sampling, colonel evaluation.

358
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,580
And of course, you know,
gleefully we, we, we,

359
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,870
we look at this and think,
Oh yes, linear Algebra. Why,

360
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,020
what did your own networks
use it use matrix operations.

361
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,450
What speeds up matrix operations? GPU,
why? Because they do them in parallel.

362
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:40,670
Could we speed them up even more using
quantum computers? I definitely think so.

363
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:41,600
I definitely think so.

364
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:45,140
And in fact we're going to look at
a paper in a second that does that.

365
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,460
So they will speed up some existing
algorithms and enable a new type of

366
00:22:49,461 --> 00:22:52,130
algorithm as well.
Okay,

367
00:22:52,131 --> 00:22:56,210
so some images and so let's
look at the leap, right?

368
00:22:56,211 --> 00:22:57,890
So let's look at their software that,

369
00:22:57,891 --> 00:23:00,890
this is what they demoed to me
in Vancouver when I was there.

370
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:05,750
So if you go to the dashboard here,
they've got some, they've got some demos,

371
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:10,460
they've got to an STK installed, they've
got a QP you dashboard. And uh, we've, uh,

372
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,780
we've got one hour of Cupe you time,
which doesn't seem like a lot,

373
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:17,630
but if you think about how
fast a quantum computer is,

374
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:21,500
you can compute a lot of things in
milliseconds so that that hour is actually

375
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:25,940
quite a lot for a three tier, right?
This is free for all developers to use.

376
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,480
Now here is the coolest thing here. And
then here's where they really got me. Um,

377
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:35,330
there are Jupiter notebooks in the
browser and we can compile these quantum

378
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:40,250
algorithms in the browser. So let's,
let's look at a demo here. Um, first,

379
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,590
and this is called
social network analysis.

380
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:46,610
And then we'll look at the code and I
will, I will myself as well. Okay. So,

381
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,050
okay,

382
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,450
let's look at this optimization
problem here. Okay.

383
00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:54,350
So this is an example of social
network from Romeo and Juliet. Okay.

384
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:56,690
So we all know the story
of Romeo and Juliet,

385
00:23:56,691 --> 00:24:01,640
two star crossed lovers from different
families that these families were enemies.

386
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:05,480
But then they fell in love. And so there
was that new connection that was forged.

387
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:06,314
Right?

388
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:14,370
Okay. Let me move this out
of the way so that our great,

389
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,430
oh my God. Move, move, move,
move on. Sometimes you just got,

390
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:25,360
there we go. Oh, show to continue. Okay.

391
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,060
So at the sort of the story,
where are we at?

392
00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:30,190
The start at the store and there
was a river that, that, that,

393
00:24:30,191 --> 00:24:34,570
that cuts that divide these
two communities, right? Um,

394
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:41,590
there's a river that divides these two
communities and they all are connected

395
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:43,320
with each other and then they have um,

396
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,940
connections across the river
that are negative, right?

397
00:24:46,941 --> 00:24:48,260
These are enemy connections,

398
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:52,310
but between each other they have friend
connections and then all of a sudden

399
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:56,340
Romeo and Juliet Fall in love and a new
connection is formed in this breath is

400
00:24:56,341 --> 00:25:01,040
social graph. And this leads to
instability or imbalance in the network,

401
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,770
right?
Because what ideally,

402
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:07,100
we want there to be no
connection between both groups.

403
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:12,101
We want them a balanced network in this
case would be one where there are no

404
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:17,000
positive connections between the families.
So how do we rebalance this?

405
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:23,330
So the way we would do this
kind of quantum computer
is we would set the degree

406
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:27,780
to which two variables agree and
that's the cubits coupling strength,

407
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,820
strength and the degree to which a
variable tend to a particular outcome.

408
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:33,950
And that is the body.

409
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,090
And we're going to look at this
programmatically in a second,

410
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,270
but basically we can rearrange that rap.

411
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,250
So such that in a way that uh,

412
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:48,240
there is no enemy connection across the
river and the graph is in fact balanced

413
00:25:48,241 --> 00:25:52,630
again, and we can use a
quantum algorithm to do this.

414
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,010
Okay. So you know, this,
this applies to, you know,

415
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:01,030
same exact thing is happening here with
this series and extremist thing and we

416
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,130
hit run and then it's, it computed
this structural imbalance problem.

417
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:10,300
And so what better way to demo how
this works then to look at code.

418
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:14,770
So if we go to developer tools here,
they have, or learning in docs,

419
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:20,190
Jupiter notebooks in the browser that
we can just start looking at right now.

420
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,200
That's,
let's check this out.

421
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:31,100
Beautiful. The colonel's
ready. Great. Good. Okay,

422
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:34,220
here's the kernel. So what are we
doing here? So let's just compile this.

423
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,730
So here's this toy example.
Nothing quantum is happening here.

424
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:39,230
And this like little,
I mean make this big.

425
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,550
Okay.

426
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:44,520
I think quantum is happening here.
Okay. All that's happening here,

427
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,930
it's bigger
is

428
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,390
we are building this network graph,
right?

429
00:26:53,391 --> 00:26:57,980
We are building a network graph and um,
there is a hostile relationship set up,

430
00:26:57,981 --> 00:27:00,770
hostile relationships and instead of
friendly relationships, that's it.

431
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,050
And then we can initialize a solver.
Okay.

432
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:09,360
And the solver hall explained
what the solver is doing here.

433
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,563
MMM.

434
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,040
And then we'll take that solver and
we'll use it to sample from the possible

435
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:18,730
outcomes.
Okay.

436
00:27:18,731 --> 00:27:23,500
So we have the solver and
it's going through solve
that problem by sampling from

437
00:27:23,501 --> 00:27:27,220
the set of possible outcomes.
And when we perform that,

438
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:32,350
it's going to show us the
frustrated relationships and
then rebalance the graph.

439
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,060
And we can even visualize that

440
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,340
right here.

441
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,980
Okay. So it, it rebalanced the
graph. We didn't see how it works.

442
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,350
You might be wondering.
We did see it worked,

443
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:52,020
but we didn't get to see this like little
visualization thing because a million

444
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:55,290
things go wrong in demos guys. But the,
but the point is that we just come,

445
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,070
we just computed I quantum algorithm in
the browser and now I'm going to code it

446
00:27:59,071 --> 00:28:03,120
myself. So don't worry if
you don't understand what
the solver itself is doing.

447
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,510
I'm going to code that myself now and
then we're going to look at what the

448
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:08,490
solvers are. Also. Let
me answer some questions.

449
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,340
I haven't been answering
questions mad fast, right.

450
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,110
What are the questions here? Uh,
the questions are, uh, numerous,

451
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,350
any questions? So SGD Oh, great question.

452
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:25,960
So STD will be useless with
quantum ml. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

453
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,980
Gradient descent is not going
anywhere for the time being. Um,

454
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,670
but we can think as the analog of gray
dissent in the quantum world as simulated

455
00:28:37,671 --> 00:28:39,590
annealing. Well, that's
simulated annealing,

456
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,980
quantum annealing because
quantum annealing is all
about energy minimization,

457
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:45,441
right?

458
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:49,940
We were trying to minimize some energy
and a system and simulated annealing is

459
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:53,330
used a lot by physicists to try to
minimize the energy in a system.

460
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,070
Quantum annealing is the analog of
that, um, to the classical world.

461
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,150
It's also the analog too.

462
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,800
It also the analog to,
um,

463
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,500
grainy the scent in the quantum world
because gradient descent is gradient

464
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:14,610
descent, is trying to optimize, um,

465
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,080
a landscape and it always
optimize it for the local minimum,

466
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,520
right?
The local minimum.

467
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:25,200
But what simulated annealing does is it
optimizes for the global minimum things

468
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:30,120
that Sdg Sgd stochastic gradient
descent cannot necessarily reach.

469
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:35,770
Uh, so there is hope, right?

470
00:29:35,771 --> 00:29:36,790
Because a global funding,

471
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:40,510
the global minimum is better than
finding a local minimum. Now,

472
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,160
gradient descent has a bunch of

473
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:51,700
right, exactly. In Gym. So, so there
are a bunch of trips into the cast,

474
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:56,600
the grading dissent to try to improve
its, uh, its abilities to optimize,

475
00:29:56,601 --> 00:30:00,980
right momentum. Adam, there's a bunch of
techniques and try to get it over the,

476
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:06,020
the giant hill that it has to go over.
Um, so yes, um, there is an analog,

477
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:09,830
it's called simulated annealing and there
is a lot of research in that direction.

478
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:13,430
Okay. So let me answer one more question
then. We're going against some math.

479
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:18,140
How can we learn ml in GPU?
So it turns out,

480
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,700
check this out, check this out. I'm
going to blow your mind. Second,

481
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,240
kick up this website, quadrant. Dot.

482
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:29,260
Ai Deep learning with a lot less data.
What,

483
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,500
what, what, what the,

484
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:37,990
what is this is a Dewayne business.
Okay. The power of generative learning.

485
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:42,880
You have my attention. You have
our attention. What is generative?

486
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:47,920
They've got a little demo here in
tensorflow. Okay. Okay. And the thing is,

487
00:30:47,921 --> 00:30:49,030
I've already looked at this by the way,

488
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:52,870
I'm just being theatrical
here so it's not using,

489
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:56,450
I don't think I look at the code here.
It's not add download it.

490
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:00,640
It's not using a QP.
You correct me if I'm wrong guys,

491
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:03,840
but it's not using the QP you here,
it's um,

492
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:08,680
using this probabilistic distribution
algorithm instead of the quantum machine,

493
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:12,850
but it's a step in that direction
of using the QP you, um,

494
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:16,060
very exciting stuff. I, I met with the
machine learning team when I was there.

495
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,120
Very, very exciting stuff
is happening right now.

496
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:24,100
Specifically with Boltzmann machines
with sampling, right sampling,

497
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:25,510
Gibbs sampling specifically.

498
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:30,690
I met with a scientist working on taking
variational auto encoders and improving

499
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:36,031
their generative abilities
using quantum algorithms.

500
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,170
And, um, there were,

501
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:43,390
I met another scientist that was working
on an algorithm that decides which chip

502
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:46,810
to use and when to use it between a CPU,
Gpu,

503
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:48,950
Qq and other assets,
right.

504
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,480
That want me to be perfect low level
algorithm where you have this high level

505
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:55,540
model that you define and then
that's a low level. It's like, oh,

506
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:58,210
I'll use a coupon for this, for
this. And there's that. Right.

507
00:31:58,211 --> 00:32:02,230
That would be all right. Cool. So,
um, yeah. Anyway, so that's that.

508
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:07,360
Make sure everybody's onboard here.
Great. And coding on now. Okay.

509
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:08,950
So you know,

510
00:32:08,951 --> 00:32:12,010
I thought when I was going to do this
livestream that I would just be coding out

511
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:15,910
four different examples, right? One for
colonel evaluation, one for optimization,

512
00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:20,230
one for sampling. Well, it turns out
that to even code a single example,

513
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:25,180
there's so much context that I have
to, you know, both learn and to convey.

514
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:29,380
And so I'm going to code, I'm going to
try to coat two examples, but we'll see.

515
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:33,520
For Time's sake. I might just,
I might just go with one.
And for simplicity's sake,

516
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:37,870
because there's a lot of, there
is so much theory here. Seriously,

517
00:32:37,871 --> 00:32:42,871
I have never come upon
any subfield of AI that I,

518
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,720
I've never seen such amazing,

519
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:51,350
exciting possibilities and literature.

520
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,873
Okay.

521
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:56,650
There's a lot. There's a lot.
That's all. I mean, the rabbit goal,

522
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:00,250
the rabbit hole goes so deep. I
mean, check this out. Check this out.

523
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:02,590
Let me show you this paper. I was just
reading actually before this stream,

524
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,050
check out this paper that I
was just reading. It's called,

525
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,730
it's literally called
quantum machine learning.

526
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,060
It was published a couple months ago.
Um,

527
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:14,890
huge collaboration between a lot of
people. Beautiful. Um, introduction.

528
00:33:14,891 --> 00:33:17,020
I mean they start off with um,

529
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:22,280
like human nature and told me and
Copernicus and then get into Hockfield

530
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,070
networks in Boltzmann machines.
So very cool stuff. But, but,

531
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:30,370
but check this out. By the way,
here's something that's very cool.

532
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:36,520
Are already measuring the speed ups
of these machine learning algorithms.

533
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:41,680
Quantum reinforcement learning, right? So
this is a part of move 37. So this is a,

534
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:45,730
here's your, here's our, our El
elements here. Um, and in general,

535
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,500
this is just good for reinforcement
learning engineers for and researchers and

536
00:33:50,501 --> 00:33:53,980
everybody, right? Because quantum
can be applied to all sub deals,

537
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,980
or I believe,
and here's where the belief comes in.

538
00:33:56,981 --> 00:34:01,981
I think that there is a
possibility to speed up many,

539
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,340
not all. I mean, I think
all has been disproven. You,

540
00:34:05,341 --> 00:34:07,570
you can't speed up everything
in machine learning,

541
00:34:07,571 --> 00:34:12,571
but there is a huge possibility space
and I believe that and we'll see as we

542
00:34:13,631 --> 00:34:15,520
learn more. But look, look at this.

543
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:18,940
There are clearly speedups here and
they've been denoted those speedups here,

544
00:34:18,941 --> 00:34:23,860
right? Um, square root of n
speed ups. So for perceptrons,

545
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:27,100
those are neural networks and you
know, things like that. So very,

546
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:30,100
very exciting stuff. Alright,
so let's start coding here.

547
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,500
Let's start coding here. Okay,
so here's what we're going to do.

548
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:40,590
We're going to start coding and
what am I,

549
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,090
what am I going to do is I'm just going
to start coding and then talk about what

550
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:47,950
I'm doing. So there is this library
called Die Mod. Okay. So Die Mod.

551
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:48,700
Uh,

552
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:53,620
basically he wants us build models
that are suited for the quantum,

553
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,840
the quantum machine. Okay.
Uh, Die Mod. That's what that,

554
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,100
that's what diamond does.

555
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,860
And a sheriff Api for binary
quadratic samplers were,

556
00:35:05,861 --> 00:35:09,310
we'll get into what that is in a second.
So let me just import the library.

557
00:35:09,311 --> 00:35:12,950
Now let's define our
input data, right? We,

558
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:17,170
we have to have to input data and let
me make sure this goes away. All right,

559
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,660
let me just find our can data.
Okay.

560
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:24,030
So our first input data is going
to be called H. And so what age is,

561
00:35:24,031 --> 00:35:26,680
is it is a binary variable.

562
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,760
H is a binary variable

563
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:34,620
and it's kind of value for
both zero and value for one.

564
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:40,610
What Jay will be is it's going to have
a single value for both zero and one at

565
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:46,410
the same time. So as you're in it, and
that value will be negative one point up.

566
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,690
So negative.
Now what is this?

567
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:54,780
So each represents our linear biases
and j represents our quadratic biases.

568
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:57,540
Now, now it's time to actually look
at what we're doing here. Okay?

569
00:35:57,541 --> 00:35:59,880
So I just need to start coding something.

570
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,370
So this is called the easy model or
the, the icing. Actually I model.

571
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:09,980
Okay. Um, the icing model
identifies phase transitions.

572
00:36:09,981 --> 00:36:14,010
So in physics, right, something is
either be solid, a liquid or a gas,

573
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,920
or in the right,
something is either a solid liquid or gas.

574
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:23,210
And how do we identify the transition
from one stays like a solid to a liquid or

575
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:26,520
a liquid to a gas, you know, et cetera.

576
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,400
And so the icing model represents this
as an objective function that we're going

577
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:34,820
to, that we see right here
expecting did we icing model does.

578
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,950
Okay. All right. So
that's the icing model.

579
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:45,520
And, uh, here's, here's what
everything defines here. So, um, this,

580
00:36:45,521 --> 00:36:48,160
this [inaudible] looking thing,
it's, it's sigma notation.

581
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,090
And what we're saying is let's
take the sum of all of the, uh,

582
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,370
of all of the variables that
are a part of our equation here,

583
00:36:57,371 --> 00:37:01,730
where n is the number of
variables, um, and as,

584
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:06,180
as represents a spin. And so
what this does, but let, let's,

585
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:10,060
let's step back for a second here
for a second. What this model is,

586
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,900
there is a lot of physical systems
that we could want a model, right?

587
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,220
So Electron from individual electrons,
the collisions of entire galaxies, right?

588
00:37:18,221 --> 00:37:22,510
So, uh, good models can
represent, are very generalizable.

589
00:37:22,511 --> 00:37:25,870
They can represent the
collision of galaxies and
collisions at the subway on my

590
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:29,660
level. And that's why a IC model is
a good model. It can represent a lot.

591
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,123
This model

592
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:36,650
was proposed by a guy named Ernst icing
and it's used to represent that phase

593
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:37,520
transition,
right?

594
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:42,521
So variables represent spin up or spin
down states that correspond to plus one

595
00:37:42,531 --> 00:37:46,430
or minus one values. These
are, these are magnetic,

596
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:51,710
these are a result of the
electromagnetic activity, okay.

597
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,040
Up Two particles.
And so they,

598
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:59,100
it uses discreet variables to represent
the magnetic dipole movements of spin

599
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:01,370
states,
which are either plus one or minus one.

600
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:07,070
And the data which are just the spin
states are organized as a lattice so each

601
00:38:07,071 --> 00:38:11,270
spin can interact with its neighbors.
And so this is this,

602
00:38:11,271 --> 00:38:16,271
this equation here then then represents
the state of that phase transition.

603
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,630
And is,
it is a quantum mechanical process.

604
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:25,040
It is a process from quantum mechanics
because it's dealing with the subatomic

605
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:29,750
level. And so what we need to, what we've,
what we're, what we just wrote here,

606
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,970
this is quantum data,
right?

607
00:38:31,971 --> 00:38:36,850
This represents quantum data because it's
dealing with phenomenon that occurs in

608
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:41,851
all reality based on quantum mechanics
at the subatomic level and it represents

609
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:46,630
a phase transition. So, um,

610
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,170
this is our objective function
and what we want is for,

611
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:51,580
okay,

612
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:55,720
there are to be a UN, an
equilibrium here, all of our,

613
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:59,110
of our spin states so that we,
we reach this objective function of,

614
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,800
of upstate and downstate, some magnetic
up and down states at the same time,

615
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:03,730
right?
Simultaneously.

616
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,920
And so the way we're going to do that
is we're going to construct this, uh,

617
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,420
missing icing model. And we can
call this a binary quadratic model.

618
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,780
Is it binary quadratic model,
but using the dime odd libraries,

619
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:21,730
there are different types of
binary quadratic models. In fact,

620
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:26,280
this is a superclass of
icing. We can also create, um,

621
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,380
a Cubo model is different, kind of not
going to talk about today. Like I said,

622
00:39:29,381 --> 00:39:32,770
there's so much happening here to,
once we define our model,

623
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,630
we can then sample from that model.
So remember a quantum algorithm,

624
00:39:37,631 --> 00:39:40,630
ports sample from a
space of possibilities.

625
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,350
Okay.

626
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:47,090
And we can sample from that model. It's
like that. And that's, that's it. We've,

627
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,930
that we've computed our quantum,
um,

628
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:55,190
result that's going to satisfy
this binary quadratic model,

629
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:59,280
which is an icing model.
And then we can pronounce it what we've,

630
00:39:59,281 --> 00:40:00,440
you look what we've,
um,

631
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,610
approximated and seeing
what's in the response data.

632
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,460
And I'm going to say, uh, this is
our sample. We have our energy,

633
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,953
right?

634
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,400
And we're going to print out
those samples and those energies.

635
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,790
Right,
right.

636
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,890
All right. Let's see what happens
here in Dalton Syntax where,

637
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,000
Oh four I'm from.

638
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:40,050
Okay.
Um,

639
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,950
right. Oh, this has to be print cs.

640
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:44,943
Okay.

641
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,090
All right, cool. So what does it,

642
00:40:48,091 --> 00:40:51,630
is it simultaneously computed
all the possible, um,

643
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:57,700
states that it could be in
those coefficients and it
found a what they are and

644
00:40:57,871 --> 00:41:00,420
then we're printing them all
out at the same time. So this,

645
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,010
this essentially we are simulating
this quantum mechanical system that

646
00:41:05,011 --> 00:41:09,450
represents a phase transition, uh,
particles from a solid to liquid,

647
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,660
or I look at your gas,
et Cetera. And this can,

648
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:16,210
this has proven to be faster,
um,

649
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,220
faster computer using quantum
algorithms over a classical algorithms.

650
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,110
Now optimization in general, we'd like,
we find that Romeo and Juliet problem.

651
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,610
It's a, it's a, it's a big
thing, right? In general. Um,

652
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:42,570
right. So, um, anyway,
right as a lot of people.

653
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:46,740
So there's that. Um, and
there's also sampling, right?

654
00:41:46,741 --> 00:41:51,420
So these quantum computers
can be understood as samplers
and prepare a special

655
00:41:51,421 --> 00:41:54,920
class of distributions
and

656
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:59,330
run. So Gibbs sampling,
things like that. Um,

657
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,990
want to make sure these people are not,
are in the right place.

658
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:06,500
There are a hundred people waiting here.
That's a, whoa, there's 40 people. Okay,

659
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:09,260
good.
I'm gear

660
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,940
wrong link.
Come to this one.

661
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,080
All right. Back to this.
Okay. So I'm sampling,

662
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,640
it's another example.
I'd like,

663
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:28,200
there's so much give sampling variational
audit encoders. Uh, you know, we,

664
00:42:28,201 --> 00:42:31,810
sometimes we initialize our weights as
random when we shouldn't. Um, there,

665
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,980
there are better ways of initializing
our weights for our neural network and

666
00:42:34,981 --> 00:42:39,360
then random, better than
random. And I'm right.

667
00:42:39,361 --> 00:42:43,710
So there's a lot of potential
here for sampling. Now.

668
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:49,860
Um, there's colonel evaluation,
there's the satisfiability problem,

669
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,720
uh, to sad problem, which
is an NP complete problem.

670
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:59,130
There is way too much for the single
stream. There's so much theory.

671
00:42:59,131 --> 00:43:02,130
I don't want to overload your guys here.
How are you guys feeling?

672
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:05,220
There's so much.
I still have so much to learn as well.

673
00:43:05,221 --> 00:43:10,221
Like I am totally a student of quantum
machine learning and I see a lot of a

674
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:15,780
potential there. So like, so,
uh, colonel evaluation, right?

675
00:43:15,781 --> 00:43:19,320
So in machine learning there are
kernel methods, um, where we are,

676
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:22,030
we have some high dimensional,
uh,

677
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,710
data and we want to separate
it by a hyperplane, right?

678
00:43:25,711 --> 00:43:29,900
So for classification for example, and
we can use the kernel method to, um,

679
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:33,030
convert that high dimensional data to
lower dimensional data so we can then

680
00:43:33,031 --> 00:43:35,760
visualize it and have the
hyperlink hyperplane go through.

681
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,460
So I support vector machines
are a good example of that. Uh,

682
00:43:38,461 --> 00:43:40,630
but there's also other examples as well.
Um,

683
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:45,570
and we can use a quantum algorithms
to estimate certain kernels.

684
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,940
One, they're difficult to
compete classically in.

685
00:43:47,941 --> 00:43:51,090
The last thing here is linear Algebra.
Now this is really,

686
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:53,130
I think this is going to blow the,

687
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:55,920
this is going to blow the
lid off of everything.

688
00:43:55,921 --> 00:44:00,921
Like if we can really get these quantum
computers to operate as neural networks,

689
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,090
you know,
if we can interpret the Matrix,

690
00:44:03,091 --> 00:44:06,810
ascribing a quantum gates as a
linear layer in a neural network,

691
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:11,820
we can visualize how the Gatewood connect
inputs and outputs. And this is a very,

692
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:16,770
very exciting area of research. And,
uh, that's, that's in the future, right?

693
00:44:16,771 --> 00:44:20,130
That there's so much theory there.
Okay.

694
00:44:20,131 --> 00:44:25,050
So it's overwhelming isn't it?
It's a lot of stuff. More physics,

695
00:44:25,051 --> 00:44:29,550
right? I mean, clearly, clearly. So, um,
you know what, I'm just gonna stop there.

696
00:44:29,551 --> 00:44:32,280
I don't want to overwhelm you guys.
There's a here and, and you know,

697
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:37,160
if you want to see me talk about more
quantum machine learning stuff, um,

698
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,920
definitely tweetdeck needs, we had
D-Wave. Um, and we'll, we'll get,

699
00:44:40,921 --> 00:44:41,760
we'll get something set up.

700
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:44,990
Maybe we'll do a full course on
this so that that's for later.

701
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:49,400
We're still working on move 37 right
now. And, um, we have a lot of,

702
00:44:49,401 --> 00:44:53,220
of work to do at school, the ids, um,
everything's always going to be free.

703
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,600
All my education will always be free.
Don't, don't even worry about that. Um,

704
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:00,840
but it's a super exciting time and I'm,
I'm glad to,

705
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:05,260
I'm glad that you guys are here. I'm, I'm,
I'm excited to continue with this, uh, uh,

706
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:09,930
this stuff and uh, yeah,
that's it, that, that's, uh,
that's it for this live stream.

707
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:12,990
Thank you guys. Thank you
guys for being here. Okay,

708
00:45:12,991 --> 00:45:17,430
so I'm going to go ahead and end
this live stream. Thanks. Karsten.

709
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:20,400
I'm going to end this live stream.
Thank you guys for coming and for now,

710
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:25,260
I've got to go, um, work
on some curriculum stuff,

711
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:29,940
so thanks for watching. All right, let's

712
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:34,330
love you too. Love you guys. Okay.
