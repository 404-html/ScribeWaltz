1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,660
All you need is love and
data and computation.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,430
Hello world,

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,690
it's Saroj and I'm going to list seven
ways to make money with machine learning.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,740

00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:15,600
When I release new videos,

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,770
billions of dollars are being
invested into the AI ecosystem.

7
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:24,771
So unimportant question to ask is
who is currently making money in AI?

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,780
Well, at the heart of the AI ecosystem
is the data itself. Without data,

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,800
there is no AI.

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,450
It needs data to learn from and currently
the vast majority of the world's data

11
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:38,850
is owned by just a few corporations.

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,210
On top of that comes the
base layer of AI chips.

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,800
These chips are what enable AI systems
to actually perform the processing

14
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:51,540
necessary. So far, Nvidia has been
the biggest winner in this space.

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,411
Just a quick,

16
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:57,411
the lands at their stock price over the
past few years shows how influential

17
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:00,600
their GPU chips have been in the industry,

18
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,140
even though they were designed
for rendering graphics.

19
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,550
It turns out that they're perfect for
the matrix operations that a lot of

20
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:13,500
machine learning applications require,
but it's not just in IBM,

21
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,010
intel, Google, and now a few
Chinese companies like Cambra,

22
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:21,270
con technology are designing
their own AI chips as well.

23
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,100
Built on top of these chips are the
platform and infrastructure of Ai.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,990
That is, where does the AI
processing and storage take place?

25
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,330
There's fierce competition amongst
companies like Amazon and Microsoft to

26
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:41,331
provide a complete cloud solution for
developers to run AI applications and the

27
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:47,871
cost of maintaining these massive global
data centers is something very few

28
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:49,410
can't afford.

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,580
On top of that are the actual
models and algorithms of Ai.

30
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,680
Google's tensorflow framework is still
the most popular in the field and it's

31
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:02,370
free. The reason being once
a company starts using it,

32
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,550
they'll likely need a lot of computing
power and who better suited to offer that

33
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,420
then Google, since Google cloud
is optimized for tensorflow,

34
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,200
once a company becomes
reliant on their software,

35
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,250
they will likely be a returning
customer for years. Very smart,

36
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,230
but that's not stopping the other giants
from releasing their own frameworks as

37
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:29,850
well. Then we have the enterprise
solutions built on all of this technology,

38
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,080
again, dominated by giants
like salesforce, Oracle,

39
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:36,750
which is somehow still alive and SAP.

40
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,790
Consumer facing solutions are being
offered by corporations that have massive

41
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:45,690
budgets and teams to
execute on innovative ideas.

42
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,940
And at the very top are entire
countries like China, the UK,

43
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:52,680
Germany, France, and Japan,

44
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:57,681
which are leading in terms of investment
into their respective AI ecosystems to

45
00:02:57,751 --> 00:03:02,080
foster economic growth.
So where do you fit into all of this?

46
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,380
At the very top above countries?
Nope.

47
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,520
At a glance it might not seem like there's
room to make money in this space with

48
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,850
so many large entities
with massive budgets,

49
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,070
but there most definitely is.

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,240
Let's start with the first way to
make money with machine learning.

51
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,670
Start a startup.

52
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,350
There is a massive space for startups
who can provide the best vertical

53
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:31,780
solutions across industries.

54
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,910
Big corporations don't have time
to tackle small niche problems,

55
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:37,923
but you do.

56
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,000
We've seen that startups can succeed
if they have access to four components,

57
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,500
large datasets,

58
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,360
domain knowledge that gives them deep
insights into the opportunities within a

59
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:50,194
sector,

60
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,390
a deep pool of talent around applied
AI and capital to fuel growth.

61
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,690
One leading startup example is a firm
they offer loans to consumers at the point

62
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:02,164
of sale,

63
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,260
a very competitive space and have still
managed to build a successful company

64
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,290
that's raised over 700 million US dollars.

65
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,210
They quickly created a defensible moat
to ensure that they remained competitive.

66
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,660
This is called the fly wheel effect
and it applies to all AI companies.

67
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,180
More data begets better AI based services
and products that gets more revenue

68
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,810
and customers.
That gets more data and it continues.

69
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,450
It's the circle of data.

70
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,990
Startups are actually disrupting every
part of the AI value chain even at the

71
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:42,670
lowest level.
Habana for example,

72
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:47,671
is a small team developing a chip that
supposedly outruns GPU is for inference

73
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,841
algorithms.

74
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:54,841
Mia lets developers deploy and manage
ml models in the cloud and just a few

75
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,380
minutes with a much more user
friendly interface than AWS.

76
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,680
Clarify provides custom models and
algorithms that perform different tasks.

77
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,700
The are,
they're easy to use.

78
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:11,701
Api and peak is providing data analytics
as a service directly to enterprises

79
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,600
with so many tools freely
available on the Internet.

80
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,900
Anyone with the right amount of motivation
and work ethic can succeed in this

81
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:27,280
space. If I were to build an
AI startup from scratch today,

82
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,430
I would write down a list of problems
that I personally cared about solving.

83
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:37,830
That's the only way to stay motivated
when issues arise in your journey and they

84
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:39,490
100% will,

85
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,890
then I divide these problems into
whether they fit into the enterprise or

86
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:46,150
consumer markets.

87
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,600
The Enterprise is where the most high
value use cases for individual startups

88
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,660
are, so I'd probably pick
an enterprise service.

89
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:01,020
Then I create well designed landing page
with a signup form that details what my

90
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:05,240
imaginary product would
do with a price point.

91
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,280
After getting feedback from friends on
the pricing and features and tweaking it

92
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:11,030
a bit,

93
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,590
I would share it on social media
platforms to see if anybody signs up.

94
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,770
If people actually sign
up knowing the price.

95
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,650
That's extremely exciting
and motivating isn't it?

96
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:26,990
I get right to work collecting irrelevant
dataset and training a model on it.

97
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,850
Once I have a working model,

98
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:33,851
I take on clients one by
one slowly building the
reputation of my new brand and

99
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:39,950
use the money I earned to higher end
scale. Remember where there's a will.

100
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,720
There's a way nothing lasts forever.
Amazon's cloud product,

101
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,590
AWS,

102
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:50,450
which earns more revenue by itself
than many big corporations do,

103
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,950
seems unstoppable,

104
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:57,130
but a decentralized computing network
that allows anyone to use their local

105
00:06:57,471 --> 00:07:02,471
machine to store and process encrypted
data could provide a lower cost option to

106
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:08,870
consumers in the near future.
The second way is contract work,

107
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,480
either as an individual or as a team.

108
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,580
I used to do contract work when I was a
college students as a way to make money

109
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:20,990
on the side and can definitely
recommended to you as well.

110
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,050
It's a hustle.
Clients won't come to you.

111
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,700
You have to go out and find them,
but before you do that,

112
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:33,730
you need to make sure you've established
a solid personal brand online that

113
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:38,270
includes a resume,
a portfolio website,

114
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,890
a linked in profile,

115
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:44,891
and most importantly a get hub account
with a few well documented projects that

116
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:48,890
showcase your skills
to prospective clients.

117
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,160
I've got a great video on this cult
resume for machine learning and how to do

118
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:57,080
freelance AI programming.

119
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:02,230
Definitely check out both of those before
browsing one of the many freelance job

120
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:04,940
board websites available on the web.

121
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,520
If you want to start a consulting firm,

122
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,550
having built an online brand is helpful
if you want access to a larger pool of

123
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:14,210
talent to join you.

124
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,290
Many teams these days are fully
distributed including school of Ai.

125
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,750
You went to find people
that you can trust,

126
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,160
that you enjoy working with and
that have equal or greater talent.

127
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:30,161
Then you then you can use
a team management board
like Trello to assign tasks

128
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,380
and split the work accordingly.
Decide what your target market is.

129
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,130
Then find clients in that
market by browsing social media.

130
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:45,131
Websites like linkedin and Reddit as
well as local events in your area.

131
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,430
For example,

132
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,460
consulting firms like sigmoidal focus on
working with big enterprises and medium

133
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:55,340
sized companies from just four countries.

134
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:00,530
The third way is to find a
job or internship and I've
got a great video on this

135
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:04,380
called how to find an AI internship.
Check it out.

136
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,920
The fourth way is to
write a technical book.

137
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,080
You have two options here.

138
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,650
Self publishing or using
an existing publisher.

139
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,950
I used to write blog posts
on cryptocurrency and one
of the editors at O'reilly

140
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:24,150
reached out asking if I'd be interested
in writing a book for them because they

141
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:26,970
liked one of my blog posts so much.

142
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,060
I ended up writing
decentralized applications
using their brand and O'Reilly

143
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:35,250
took care of marketing and distribution,

144
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,850
including printed copies
across many bookstores.

145
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,880
This is a great way to
earn a recurring revenue,

146
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,910
increase your brand reputation
and position yourself as
a thought leader in this

147
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:50,910
space, but be warned.
Writing a book is not easy.

148
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,940
I was spending eight hours every day
writing when I was staying in Tokyo for a

149
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,660
few months.
Write a book.

150
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,690
If you want to convey a way of thinking
rather than just demonstrating facts or

151
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:04,284
techniques.

152
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,500
What books uniquely offer the reader
as long form content is the ability to

153
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,970
learn how to think like the author
at a certain level of detail.

154
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,910
You shouldn't write a
book solely for the money,

155
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,950
but instead if you feel like none of
the educational content that you've seen

156
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:28,010
offers your perspective on
which technology stack works
best and envisions where

157
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:34,380
we're headed in the way that you do.
Publishers do take a royalty fee though,

158
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:38,190
and this varies per publisher if
you don't want to deal with that,

159
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,210
you can self publish your book
through a service like create space.

160
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,420
Books are a good source of passive income
there a recurring revenue stream and

161
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:52,461
you can also use the book as leverage
to later get speaking gigs like what Chi

162
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,850
Food Lee has been doing after publishing
his latest book, Ai Superpowers,

163
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,860
highly recommended by the way.
I loved it.

164
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,630
The fifth way is to make
educational content online. Blogs,

165
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,260
videos. There are a lot of
examples of this for blogs,

166
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:12,000
medium pays it's bloggers for publishing
on the platform and it's become a very

167
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,190
popular tool in the Ai community.

168
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,070
If you want to make a paid course,

169
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,340
you to me is probably your best bet to
get started as fast as possible without

170
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:26,520
having to build a learning
management system yourself.

171
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,880
But if you're willing
to play the long game,

172
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,490
then youtube is a great option.

173
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,760
You won't make money
from ad revenue at first,

174
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,970
but as you build an audience it will come.

175
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,940
You can get creative with
revenue stream here as well.

176
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:43,980
Once you've established an audience,

177
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,010
things like partnering with
affiliate referral programs,

178
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,320
Patrion and brand sponsorships.

179
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,380
The sixth way is to create
an automated trading bot.

180
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,060
I've got several videos on
machine learning for trading
in a link to them in the

181
00:11:58,061 --> 00:11:58,894
description.

182
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,910
Creating a high frequency trading bot
focused on cryptocurrencies like bitcoin

183
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,300
is a popular project
idea in the Ai community.

184
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,690
The advantages of focusing on crypto
currencies is that you're not necessarily

185
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:17,701
starting with a handicap against the big
trading firms because the technology is

186
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:21,550
relatively new and the
APIs are really good.

187
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,190
People have definitely
made profitable bots,

188
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,510
but no one will share their source code
because that would be giving away their

189
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:29,344
secrets.

190
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,970
The best thing to do in this case is to
go on get hub and search for relevant

191
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:38,971
crypto trading Bot repositories until you
find some well documented examples and

192
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:40,780
learn from them.

193
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,920
And the last way to make money with
machine learning is to compete in machine

194
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:48,400
learning competitions.
Kaggle is a great choice.

195
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:52,780
The winners of their competitions
receive hefty cash prizes.

196
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,090
Knew Mariah is another good example.

197
00:12:55,091 --> 00:13:00,091
Data scientists compete to see who's model
can predict asset prices the best and

198
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,630
earn money if they win.

199
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,460
Hackathons are also always a fun way to
earn prize money and there are several

200
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:09,700
listings like Katie nuggets
that help you find them.

201
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,950
Find a local hackathon and compete.

202
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,790
You could even make a living attending
and winning hackathons around the world.

203
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,880
Anyway, I hope you found my tips.
Useful. Wizards links to everything.

204
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,210
Will be in the video description. Please
subscribe for more programming videos,

205
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:25,540
and for now, I've got to make some
paper, so thanks for watching.
