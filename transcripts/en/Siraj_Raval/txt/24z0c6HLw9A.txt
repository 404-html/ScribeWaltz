Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, how's gun chapter in? What's up? Not much done. Pretty good. Do you mind if I ask you 67 questions? Yeah, go for it. Alright, let's do this. Cool. What project are you currently working on? So we just launched the universe and I'm working on some of the followup releases we're going to do for that. Awesome. How would you describe the culture at open AI? Super Cool. I love everyone I work with here. Uh, very open. Lots of good mentorship. What was it like attending MIT as an Undergrad? Really, really great. Uh, MIT has a lot of cool sub communities. They're all super creative. You went to school at Nyu, do you Miss New York City? I think it was my friends there. Um, but I don't miss the weather. Favorite internship? Uh, Amazon, if you could repeat one experience again, what would it be? I'd like to go back to Japan.

Speaker 1:          00:45          Why do you think deep learning has gotten so popular recently? It's really well for a lot of problems. Um, but I think people are sort of confusing it for like the last big innovation, but there's more to come. What is your favorite operating system? Who Been Too nice? If you could spend an evening with one famous person, who would it be? Michelle Obama. Do you play any sports? I do rock climbing. What time do you go to sleep? Like midnight. Most adventurous thing you've ever done. What? Skydiving. What's one source you use to stay up to date in ml? Uh, so Jack Clark who does PR for us has this newsletter called import Ai. It's great programming, language of choice for machine learning. Definitely pipeline. Favorite professor. Let's go. Josh Tenenbaum in MIT named one person you really admire. I'm also professor Fay. Fay Lee. She does a lot of AI and also outreach neuroscience stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:42          How are you liking the bear? Yeah. Great. There's a lot of cool communities here. What drives you to be an engineer? I really like building things and especially the things that I build can help other people. What's the most beautiful thing in the world? Let's say it's helping out other people, even if you don't agree with them or if you're different from one another. What's your favorite exercise? Uh, I did Japanese Tyco drumming. Favorite food? Croissants. What's more fun? Computer Science Theory or implementation? I think implementation, but you might think differently. What website do you waste? Time. I spent a lot of time on Facebook. My friends read a lot of cool stuff there. Last person you emailed. I emailed a candidate in robotics that I met at nips. You get an all expenses paid trip to one city. Where do you go? Well, never been to Africa.

Speaker 1:          02:30          So maybe Cape Town. Would you visit Mars? Not unless it was cheap. What's one thing you can't live without? Um, my bicycle. What's one of your favorite genres of music? Spotify tells me that I listened to a lot of ambient electronic. So let's go with that. What's one skill you wish you had better drawing. What's the first thing you do when you wake up? I hit snooze. What techs editor. Do you use? Emacs but not a holy war, I promise. What open source library do you really like? Uh, I think really the requests in python recently. It makes GDP super easy. What's one of your favorite movies? Uh, the original matrix. What was a hard problem you recently solved at open AI who were dealing with some weird bugs when the environments we're resetting and universe. So trying to figure out why that was going wrong was tough.

Speaker 1:          03:21          What inspired you to get into machine learning? I've always been really interested in how humans think and the existence of be sort of interesting biological, cognitive agents. But what if you could build one yourself? What was the first program you ever made? Um, first interesting program I ever made was to figure out how to spell your name using a chemical elements. Symbols. Whoa. What's one book you really liked? Um, man, a wizard of Earthsea are still, go ahead. What's a big misconception about, you don't realize I was born in Australia. What's one thing that excites you?

Speaker 1:          03:55          The future? I mean, who knows how it's gonna turn out best advice you've ever received. Someone pointed out that I've already got a lot of the things that I want, so I should stop being so stressed out about it. What's the bravest thing you've ever done? Quitting Grad school with? Super tough. I had sort of planned the trajectory for my life and having to change that really hard. What's one piece of advice you'd give yourself 10 years ago? I'd say to ask for more help. I kept trying to do things on my own. You spend more time on the internet or real life? Definitely real life, but often in front of a screen code. Do you have any pets? No. What's something you've learned in the past month? What it's like to release a big project? Do you like spicy food sometimes. What's a movie that made you cry? The end of the Lord of the rings. If you were in the world, what is one law? I think freedom of the press is great and there should be more of that. Do you think will solve intelligence in your lifetime? I think we'll probably build systems as capable as humans, but we won't understand how they work yet. Who is one person you looked up to when you were in college?

Speaker 1:          04:58          Not to own all of us. She was my mentor for my master's thesis. She was combining computer science and neuroscience in the way that I was really excited by. What deep learning library do you use the most? We now use tensor flow and I've used more theone no, in the past, Andrew on one said machine learning is like the new electricity. Do you agree yet? But maybe in the future if you were to start from scratch today, what is the learning resource you would use to learn machine learning with a good book like bishops book, but then actually trying to implement the stuff yourself. Don't just read it and bring it down. Bring in three. Really actually try it. What is one career goal you have lead a big project Sunday. What's more interesting? The brain or the universe or the brain is part of the universe, but I do think it's pretty interesting part.

Speaker 1:          05:41          If you could be a superhero, who would it be? A lot of people say that the thing about Batman that's cool is that he doesn't have any like super powers or magical abilities. I kind of like that. What's your spirit animal? Uh, save that I'm, you know, I'm really friendly. I like get along well with people. Maybe my spirit animal head Louse. Do you think one shot learning will gain momentum? It kind of has to. If we're going to really get somewhere with intelligence, we have to be able to learn from less data. Would you ever go to Coachella? No. Instagram or vine Graham Mac books or Microsoft surfaces books, but I get a surface is not bad. Pen or pencil. Pencil. Would you ever wear the Iwatch? I try anything once. All right, Catherine, that's it for my 67 questions. Thanks so much for answering those. Awesome. All right. Have a good one.
