Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello world at Saroj. Let's go through three dots. You have to see the first example is an Israeli startup called the zoos. Zoos Zuzu, the decentralized version of Uber. Uber is a centralized right sharing it. That means all data requests and decisions go through a central server owned by Uber. Uber decides how much drivers get paid and can see where your writing is going whenever they want to. Let's do this decentralized because it's owned by the community instead of a few people who own a giant server, the APP uses its own internal currency called Zeus Tokens. These tokens are cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, except there are no minors maintaining the network with computing power, so no proof of work algorithm. Instead, the miners are drivers who maintain a network with the amount of miles they driven. They get rewarded with zoos tokens based on how much they drive.

Speaker 1:          00:46          It's an algorithm called proof of movement. Writers pay the drivers with the same tokens for rods. So how does everyone get tokens? Will Zeus has something called the crowdsale a crowd sale and adapt this kind of like an IPO on day one. The creators of the DAP decide how many tokens they want to create and then sell them at some initially decided price. These tokens act as both currency in the APP as well as equity. Since you are an early adopter, you should be rewarded for being one of the first to use the deck. The more valuable that that becomes, the more valuable the tokens becomes. So you can trade tokens for Fiat currency to spend on other things if you'd like. Since the APP is peer to peer, that means data moves from phone to phone with no server intermediary and the APP is open source.

Speaker 1:          01:30          So if you want to develop for it or set up a team of developers and contribute, you can do that. You can post it proposal for how much you'd like to get paid as well. Same for designers or marketers. The community decides on fund to allocation. There are different ways to reach consensus and these are being experimented with currently, but overall it's a more democratic system where the people who use the APP get to participate in how the APP itself is run. The founders created a legal corporation and the bylaws require that the obey the will of the community's books so it looks like it's already off to a good start. The second example is called open bazaar. Open bazaar is a decentralized Ebay. Ebay decide what you can. Account cell takes a half d cut of all transactions and you have to be in a country that allows Ebay to use bit.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Openbazaar has a platform that lets buyers and sellers connects directly to the seller of goods without involving with third party to hope to data and charge a transaction fee. The craters really wanted to build on the idea of creating a truly free trade platform. I mean, they're never really has been anything like the bizarre is the pass on the Internet. Bizarre is where peer to peer marketplaces where buyers and sellers could interact directly with one another without any middlemen in between gable to observe the transaction. Openbazaar doesn't have its own token, but it doesn't use bitcoin for payments. They've got some dope algorithms to solve some interesting problems. For example, when it comes to the issue of identity, they use an algorithm called proof of burn to ensure that a seller can create a million stores to avoid bad reputation. Proof of burn means that every time a user opens a store, they have to spend some bitcoins that disappear or burn, so it's really expensive to make multiple stores.

Speaker 1:          03:04          The APP is also open source so anyone can contribute, but if they want to get a team of people to continually maintain the apple quality, unlike a lot of other open source projects, they should issue an internal Tolkien eventually pretend. The third example is scenario scenario. He's a decentralized social networks. This has been tried a few times before and failed. I'm looking at you diaspora. It always fails because the technology was never there and it's been a security nightmare to keep user data secure, but I think scenario has a good shot at making us valuable social networks. It uses its own currency called the amp. In traditional social networks like Facebook and Twitter. The middlemen gets all the money for your data from advertisers, but since there is no middleman, since the APP is peer to peer, if someone wants to pay for your data or attention, they'll pay you directly with amps.

Speaker 1:          03:51          All users get a reputation score based on how many people like the content they post. The higher the reputation, the more valuable your content is. The 10th and network is pure appear. No one can shut it down like the Chinese government did to Facebook and you own your data. No one had Facebook can peer into your private messages to friends. Since your data is stored locally instead of Fanta a service, those are the few I could find that I thought were pretty cool. That's where the future of software open source, democratic and fair compensation for all users. There are more out there and many, many more to be created in the future.
