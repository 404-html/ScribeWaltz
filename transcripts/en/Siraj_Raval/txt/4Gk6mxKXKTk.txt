Speaker 1:          00:03          We have to talk about this hello world. It's Saroj and Chinoiserie Chinese state government run news organization just for build the first AI news anchor. They train the model on video data from real news anchors, so it was able to learn relevant features like speech patterns and facial movements, but they didn't reveal the type of model they used, so I'm going to take an educated guess. It's very likely that they use what's called a generative adversarial network Orgam to do this and have proven to be able to generate all sorts of data that looks very real, but it's fake. The process is simple. One neural network called the generator is fed random data as input and transforms it through a series of matrix math operations and to an output image. Another neural network called the discriminator is fed an image from the actual training data, which in our case would be a single video frame and through a series of again, matrix operations outputs a simple binary value, classifying it as real or fake.

Speaker 1:          01:06          We also feed the discriminator, the output of the generator and since it's so different from the real data, it will classify it as fake. We can measure just how different it is from the real image and by using this error value we can change the numerical values ever so slightly in both networks such that in the next iteration the generator will produce a more realistic looking image. Since videos are just a series of image frames, we can use a fully trained generator to eventually output very realistic video data, combine it with a text to speech system and this anchor is capable of working 24 hours a day without needing any breaks, which greatly reduces the cost of news production and improves efficiency. She also claims that it's capable of learning from live broadcast videos. China has accomplished an incredible feat in just 30 years. It's transformed itself from one of the world's poorest countries to its second largest economy in China.

Speaker 1:          02:06          The relationship between state and society is profoundly different from that in the west. And so our, its various traditions of governance, some of which date back to 5,000 years ago, their values reflect Confucianist philosophy, meaning plurality, pragmatism and collectivism, not individualism. All of this has shaped its government and it's impossible to talk about China's rise to AI power without talking about its most powerful figure. Xi Jinping Xi is the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. He's at the core of a seven member Standing Committee of the politburo and together they formed the inner most circle of China's governance structures. All Chinese institutions including the government court, military and crucially tech companies report to this party. She's 40 year long, uh, sent to the presidency involved 16 major promotions through county, city and province levels and then numerous other institutions with reviews at every single state to assess his leadership abilities.

Speaker 1:          03:10          And despite numerous human rights abuses, endless press, censorship and environmental damage, this authoritarian structure has driven China to become the second largest economy in the world. She has near absolute power. The man is even enshrined in the constitution itself. This is important because a quick look at his bookshelf during his annual New Year's Day greeting shows that he has copies of Pedro Domingos, the Master Algorithm, and Brett kings augmented life in the smart lane, both of which discuss AI technologies in detail. I've read the master algorithm. That book is technical. It covers concepts like Bayesian inference and support vector machines. She understands the transformational power of AI at a technical level, arguably more than many other world leaders, and this has manifested itself in China's ambitious AI plan by 2020 it envisions that China's progress in AI should keep pace with the world advanced level. While it's AI industry becomes an important economic growth point by 2025 at once, you have achieved a major breakthrough in AI to reach a leading level with AI becoming the primary driver for China's industrial advances and economic transformation.

Speaker 1:          04:27          And by 2030 in wants to become the world's Premiere Ai Innovation Center, a $1 trillion AI industry. When it comes to the implementation of Ai. China has one clear advantage over other countries in that it's the most populated country in the world, which means more data. Ai Algorithm needs lots of data to learn from. The more data, the better the result. What matters in implementation of Ai is speed, product quality, data, government support and execution, all of which China is excelling at. But the U S and Canada have an edge in AI research. The top researchers in the world still live there. If the climate for researchers in China becomes drastically better though, don't expect them to keep their allegiances. The Chinese AI startup environment is very gladiator. Like think survival of the fittest. Fail fast, fail early, fail often working very long hours is the norm as that's what's necessary to succeed.

Speaker 1:          05:25          Take Uber for example. Uber is a business that was invented in the u s in matches, drivers and riders together with cars being the mode of transportation in China. However, as startups started trying to emulate Uber, they try out every possible iteration, shared mopeds, shared bikes, shared concrete mixers, shared mobile phone chargers. Many of them died, but a few like mobike rose up to become Unicorn companies reaching 20 million rides per day and being sold for two point $7 billion in three years. This rapid prototyping and tweaking approach is uniquely Chinese. Another example is food delivery. Postmates is a successful US company that offers food delivery, but it would never work in China. Why? Because may Twan, it's Chinese equivalent, is able to deliver food to any location within 30 minutes and under 70 cents are faster and cheaper that Postmates ever could. That's because the founder learned that people wanted to eat, take out food, but it had to be delivered within 30 minutes and that the costs should be brought down to 70 cents per delivery in order to profitably offer free delivery.

Speaker 1:          06:34          May Twan worked on this problem for years. Eventually they hired 600 k people on mopeds inventing an AI algorithm to find writers willing to work during meal hours and modifying the vehicle to be low cost using battery power. It took them billions of dollars of losses and many years of iteration before they got there, but they did it. Chinese companies are ruthless stealing best practices from each other, copying what works. So what may Twan did was build an indestructible moat. It would require far too much time, capital and effort for any copycat to build the infrastructure that they did and that's how they won. Because of this, it's valued at 60 billion US dollars to compare in the u s Groupon, Yelp and open table are collectively worth less than one 10th of that. Chinese apps are often more feature rich and efficient than their American counterparts. We chat for example, it's like whatsapp on steroids.

Speaker 1:          07:34          Not only can you message people, you can book a taxi, get food deliveries, pay your bills, book train tickets all from one act. This does bring up the question of privacy. Giant Chinese tech companies like Tencent and Alibaba are gathering huge amounts of data from their users. Outcries on Chinese social media show that citizens have been concerned that their data was being mined illegitimately by private companies and sold on the black market. In response to this. China issued their first data protection standard that lays out rules around what is consent and the conditions upon which companies can collect personal data. The way the government responds to public outcry is not through a democratic process. Unlike his predecessor who allowed people to voice their opinions to the government directly through democratic means like town halls. She uses a combination of surveillance, AI and big data to monitor people's lives and behavior in minute detail.

Speaker 1:          08:37          Every day he gets a briefing on public sentiment scrapped from the web on various issues. She is also very interested in autonomous weapons. Just this month, 31 high school children were selected for a four year program in AI weapons systems out of more than five k candidates think drones that decide who to kill, how to kill them and do so more efficiently than any human ever could. This kind of technology put into the wrong hands could quickly become weapons of mass destruction, but there is hope by Du has recently become the first Chinese company to join a u s led alliance on AI called the partnership on Ai. This effort to include China in the global discussion on regulating AI is one step in the right direction. She also doesn't like being compared to Winnie the Pooh, so all references mentioning that phrase are classified using neural network technology and systematically deleted.

Speaker 1:          09:34          The state government holds a tight grip on all social network data, all voices, all media, everything is controlled. The amount of surveillance and censorship in China is truly astounding. Cameras are installed across countless street corners in stores, in offices using computer vision technology powered by convolutional neural networks to detect and identify people's faces. This helps the government track people based on their social credit score and modify it based on their behavior. The social credit score system is a centralized database that gives each citizen a number that defines their reputation. The problem is that social trust has eroded in China. Everyone has an aunt or uncle who's been swindled or scammed by someone, and the reason for that is that the Chinese government doesn't allow for third party social institutions to exist outside of the scope of government influence and control. It's a government created problem and they provided a government created solution, the social credit score system, so while many Chinese are wary of it, they welcome it as a way to potentially remedy the crisis of social trust, financial records, criminal records, online social network data.

Speaker 1:          10:53          Whether or not you buy alcohol, all of it informs your credit score. They've used it to ban people from traveling on trains and the government can even reduce your social score if you disagree with its policy. It also uses AI to predict crimes. Police officer's regularly visit certain homes to collect data on things like how many people live in a household, how many times they prey, what books they have, and these data streams are fed into a public security system. Their algorithm aggregates all the data from these different sources and flags who might become a threat to authorities. We don't know what the algorithm is exactly, but it's likely a deep learning classifier out putting a probability of criminality. We can thus think of the Internet in China, like a real time privately run digital intelligence service. The great firewall has blocked countless American services from reaching the Chinese population.

Speaker 1:          11:49          Despite the government using AI to exploit people, censor the population, and create autonomous weapons. It's also using AI to lift people out of poverty and increase economic stability. Surveys show that while the Chinese majority generally like their style of government, there's also a strong demand in China for Western values like freedom of speech, government transparency, and rule of law. The best thing we can do is partner with the Chinese across industries, respect their unique society and way of doing things, and provide uncensorable applications using blockchain technology that allow them to connect with the rest of the world. Because as long as we all have a voice, it makes it much harder to violate basic human rights. It's an exciting time for China and the rest of the world. Shisha please subscribe for more programming videos and for now, I've got to visit China sometime, so thanks for watching.
