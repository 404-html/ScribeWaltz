Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello world, it's Saroj and I've now selected over 800 school of AI deans across 400 cities globally. In the past week. These deans have been hard at work building infrastructure to welcome wizards from their respective communities to learn more about AI technology. They've been creating Facebook groups, meetup groups, Twitter accounts. It has been so incredible to see. School of AI chapters are safe spaces for wizards everywhere. They're a place to meet likeminded people, learn, get inspired and educate others. The deans are guardians of our core values and mission and will help guide you on your Ai Journey. Some deans have even held their first local class already, which makes me very happy to see. I've attached a link to a listing of all school of AI chapters. It's in the video description. Find Your City, join your local group and attend the first class. Make sure to offer to help your local dean in any way you can. Some are still looking for suitable venues and or local sponsorships. It is truly an amazing time to be alive and let's spread this AI power.
