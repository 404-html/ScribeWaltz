Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is about free money. Say whoa. Hello world. It's the Raj and universal basic income. It's a centuries old idea that we might just be able to implement on a global scale using recent advances in blockchain technology. I'll give a technical overview of some projects in the space aiming to do that. In this video, we are increasingly moving towards an age of abundance where AI is accelerating progress in almost every field. Ai agents can do jobs that humans would normally do with far more efficiency diagnostic apps or replacing thousands of healthcare workers, self driving cars and trucks will replace 5 million drivers. Internet sales are on the way to replacing millions of retail workers. It's happening staggeringly fast and it's not just AI that tricking the job markets. It's the way we've structured the web currently of BW services collect and monetize the majority of the world's data.

Speaker 1:          01:00          As AI takes on more and more labor, the data you generate, your unique perspective of the world, that's something that no robot can ever take, but right now we're giving it away for free in return for a free service. So the few who run these massive services are earning all the money. Wealth inequality continues to rise because of this. And a recent study shows that almost half of all jobs in the U S or at risk of being automated in the next 20 years. So what do we do here? Well, we, well, we can't just stop working on technology. It's too useful and humanity needs it to solve some of the world's biggest problems. What if people could earn a set amount of money every month just because they exist? This idea is called a universal basic income. The most common proposal for how a system like this would work is one where a national government sends out regular checks to every citizen regardless of their employment status.

Speaker 1:          02:01          Pilots of this style of program are already underway in Finland and Canada. In rural Kenya, a basic income is managed by give directly, even in India with a population of over 1 billion people. It's considering establishing a basic income in the u s y Combinator started a basic income test last year on a small portion of the local population. And for decades, residents of Alaska have each received about two k US dollars every year from the Alaska permanent fund. So the idea has been tested and we've seen the results instead of people just becoming lazy and unproductive. Studies show that it actually increased people's productivity rather than reducing it. That's because it both improved their mental and physical health and encourage them to pursue work that actually mattered to them, not just to put bread on the table. And when you actually care about the work that you're doing, your output is going to far exceed what you do if you didn't care.

Speaker 1:          03:04          You could imagine though that this would take a long time for countries to adopt and the need for this is really on a global scale. Since automation technology affects everybody who can access the Internet and allowing a few people to decide how much money is given to a very large amount of people. Has the potential for corruption? Is there a better way? Well, we know that bitcoin's blockchain for the first time allowed the minting and distribution of money to be decentralized. That is decided by rules encoded into a network protocol instead of behind closed doors, and it did this on a global scale. It created this global network of miners and developers and users. Could we create some kind of cryptocurrency system that we could dedicate to distributing a basic income? It would be pretty cool. It'd be globally accessible, open source and a much faster solution than relying on national governments, but we have two major questions to answer if we're to get there.

Speaker 1:          04:05          First, where does this money come from? And second, how do we prove that one person only has one account? We don't want to make it easy for one person to create multiple accounts and received multiple basic income streams. Let's take a look at two projects in this space to see how they're doing it. The first is grant coin, which is a fork of pure coin. The founders of this cryptocurrency created a nonprofit organization based in the US. It's already distributed the equivalent of about 13,000 US dollars to more than 1500 participants in over a 79 countries across the world for fruit to verify the identity of its users. It asks them to upload a government issued photo id. Although this is a centralized identity system, it works the grant, quite foundation staff and volunteers manually review these applications to ensure that each id is in fact unique.

Speaker 1:          05:02          The founders gave 99% of all created grand coin to the foundation which it holds in reserve. The remaining 1% is created through the proof of work mining process to reward minors for maintaining the public ledger. The plan is to gradually release the coin into circulation during the next 50 years. The foundation acts as a hub for donations. These donations can be from charity groups, other Ngos and individual donors. Generally, as is the case with most cryptocurrencies, the more people that get involved, the more people want to join and this rise in interest is what causes people to want to trade that currency for another which has more value. As far as I can tell. This is currently the most successful implementation of a crypto basic income. Another cool project is called circles. They're idea is that every person in the system gets their own currency, but this currency has no value at first.

Speaker 1:          06:00          People who know each other can agree to set a fixed exchange rate between their currencies. They would mutually agree to each other's existence. They formed a circle of two people and within this circle both currencies can be seen as equal. This allows exchanges along circles and connects people across a network together also considered a web of trust model. So if person a has a relationship with B and B has a relationship with see a can pay c with c coined by exchanging a coins for be coins and be bitcoins to see coins, it's built on top of the theory blockchain. Each account constantly generates an income of about a thousand units per week and the rate at which the income is generated increases by about 5% every year. Groups can also be created. These groups can verify new accounts as members and exclude certain accounts as well. Members can even convert their private money into group money.

Speaker 1:          06:58          This one seems complicated, but hey, the founders have the right intentions and the get hub repository is active. There are some other examples as well, and I've linked to them in the video description. Pretty much all of these are very new pilots. No one has really figured out a massively scalable way to do this yet, but all the building blocks are there. So to summarize, automation is going to replace a lot of humans in doing a mundane work over the coming years. We can use blockchain technology to experiment with creating systems that provide a universal basic income to people globally and to projects that are working on this. Currently, our grants, coin and circles. The coding challenge for this week is to create your own plan for how a basic income crypto currency system would work. Submit your get hub links in the comment section, and I'll announce the top two entries next Friday. Please subscribe for more programming videos. And for now I've got to save the world, so thanks for watching.
