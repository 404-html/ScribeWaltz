Speaker 1:          00:02          Hey Dan, how's it going? Hey, you go, sir. Rob's mind if I ask you a few questions. Let's do it. All right. Well, uh, how much do you sleep every night? About six hours. Where do you live in Amsterdam. Where did you study at Columbia University. What's your favorite book? The road by Cormac Mccarthy. What is the coolest deep learning project you've seen open mind by Andrew Trask? Do you need to know very complex math at the level of calculus or linear Algebra to start on the path of deep learning? No. In fact, you just need to know programming and if you can code with carrots, you can do this stuff in nine or 10 lines of code. If you want to get more advanced than you'll use some math. How long did it take you to get into the machine learning? It took me, I was on and off for about three years, but to really get started, it took me about three months.

Speaker 1:          00:48          I live in a developing country. How can I make a positive change here? Through machine learning there is always an opportunity to use machine learning in some way. Find a problem that you want to solve, that's the first step. And once you do apply machine learning to it, you can always do that in order to master deep learning. Is there any other language we should learn other than python? Javascript comes in at a close second, uh, and also go is a great language. Which courses did you take it you need that you would recommend? Uh, at my university, uh, there were, I mean it was, it was a closed university, but online I can say a great course to take is that you Udacity, deep learning Nano degree as well as Andrew new deep learning course. Can Ai be used to retouch skin portions by removing blemishes?

Speaker 1:          01:34          Like with Photoshop? Oh, for sure. Yeah, that would be a, uh, there'll be a generative problem for, you'd want to, you'd want to use an autoencoder to encode that image and then you would learn the latent representation and then you could generate an image without the blemishes. Which country would you like to visit most? Uh, I'm really excited to go to India in five days, so I will be in India. I'm very excited and if you've started today, which learning resource would you use? Domestic, deep learning. I wonder what I would use my channel for sure. My channel and also I would look at you, Udacity and Coursera. How can introverted or shy people improve their confidence to be more like you as these traits are helpful in tech? It just takes a lot of practice. I'm not naturally a super social person but but just by constantly putting myself out there in front of the world, being vulnerable, it definitely just builds up your confidence so it's a discipline that you build up over time.

Speaker 1:          02:28          What drives you to create Youtube Khan contents instead of working on some high end AI or machine learning research independently or collaboratively with great minds of our time. I would love to do a project that is put in the hands of millions of users, but it's kind of a sacrifice, right? Making content is my way of making impact. I could do one or the other. Ideally I could do both. We'll see. We'll, we'll see where that goes. Have you ever tried clarifies cool image recognition technology, which is a direct competitor to Google. I have, I think it's really easy to use and a thumbs up. What do you think about independent startups competing with big giants and Ai Tech such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and why would you prefer one over the others such as clarify versus Google? There is definitely a space for startups for sure.

Speaker 1:          03:12          There's so many different exit strategies are so much different data that's available for small startups that you can use that Google or Amazon or the giants haven't used yet. There's the space is really hot. So don't be, don't be discouraged by the fact that Google and all these big companies exist. Okay. Well if you are an element, what element would you be called and what would your properties be? I would be Saroj IOM and my properties would be dreaming big and competence and science, scientific thinking. Lots of managers lack an understanding of it. And what ml is capable of. And your experience, how would you best manage the expectations of what is possible and what is realistic? Uh, well yeah, I mean the standard rules rules apply of under promising and over delivering. So just you'd have to have a good knowledge of your problem domain first.

Speaker 1:          04:04          And if you do, then be able to say what you can and cannot do. Don't just make bs promises cause that's gonna Backfire. Do you stand for net neutrality and how is it important to you? Oh, for sure the Internet is, it has to be a level playing field. I mean I went from zero to I think 170 k subscribers just on my own so far. And uh, yeah, if, if net neutrality didn't exist, the top creators on Youtube would just get higher and higher in terms of subscribers and I would still be at zero to 30 k subs. We need it. How do I start my journey as a tech speaker? Uh, somewhere, right? I mean you always have meetups near you just do something small and work your way up. Build a name for yourself, your name is your brand build. It starts somewhere.

Speaker 1:          04:46          Do you get sponsored by conference organizers for your talks? I have been offered and I've just started to do the whole speaking thing in person. I mean I could just make videos. Uh, so yeah, I'm going to start charging soon cause it takes a time, time sacrifice away from my other content. When did you start with machine learning? I started, I mean it's, it's kind of ambiguous. Like I started in college when I was a sophomore, you know, I dabbled in it but I only really seriously got started about a year and a half ago when I started this channel. What problems could you result with deep learning technology in 10 years? Me personally or just in general? A lot of applications in healthcare, uh, taking away a lot of the grunt work that doctors have to do. And also in democratizing data, there's a huge opportunity there because everybody wants data but data isn't accessible to everybody.

Speaker 1:          05:35          So any kind of project that does that helps with that is that is a good opportunity. Do you watch any TV shows like silicon valley, Mr, robot or Westworld and if you've watched them, what do you think? I have heard of them. I've seen the first episode of Silicon Valley, it's too much like my life, so I'm not going to watch it. I actually don't have time to watch that much long form content. I watch a lot of youtube, but not really long shows. Uh, so tell me what role do you think that tissue there's of machine learning to play weeding bias in machine learning that any models, prejudice or towards minorities? It all comes back to the data. Make sure that you have quality diverse data, right? Overfitting can result in the things we see it in news where there is bias in terms of race.

Speaker 1:          06:19          So make sure you have diverse state and why is it machine learning called statistical learning? It could definitely be a, it's just, it's just brands, right? These are just brands and stories and marketing and we call it different things, but in the end it's all about mathematical optimization. What are your personal objectives for the next five years? I would like to build a content machine and kind of like a Khan Academy for Ai Slash Netflix for education. That just gets really big and gets a lot of people to watch and it makes a big, big impact. Will be solve intelligence in your lifetime. Um, yes we will 100% I don't even know why I had to think about that for a second. Yes, we will. We will. What is the best resource for learning mathematics involved in machine learning or deep learning? Uh, there's a great deep learning book by Ian Goodfellow. Definitely check that book out. Also my channel for sure. The math of intelligence series, watch it all. Those are the two best ones. In terms of the current market, which jobs would you think would get first affected by artificial intelligence?

Speaker 1:          07:24          Anything that is just people don't like any jobs that people don't like. So anything like call center support or a cashiers as well. Cashiers. In terms of the current market, which jobs would you think would get, I set that one 33 if you were stranded on an island for life, which three apps when you choose and why? I would choose Twitter because I absolutely love Twitter. I would choose Facebook just because, yeah, social media and also read it because I love reddit. How important are data structures and algorithms for machine learning will? It leads me to be deep learning as well. I'm a beginner. Data structures and algorithms are super important for anything you do in computer science. Definitely. If you have any interest in web development, mobile ml, blockchain, just get your data structures and algorithms in line first and then move on to the harder stuff.

Speaker 1:          08:13          What's your view on Elan's concern about the surgeon AI? He's totally right. We need to regulate it. We need some kind of oversight in some way to make sure that the bad actors don't get too much power. What's the project you've built that you're most proud of? My Youtube Channel. What's the one resource which helps you get up and running quickly and machine learning? The machine learning sub reddit. Do you have a circle of people you mentor personally who claimed to grow in the field of machine learning? If yes, how can someone join? I don't. I, I don't have enough time for that right now. My channel. I think of everybody as a group. Uh, yeah. How do you see reinforcement learning impacting the future in terms of practical applications, practical applications, reinforcement? It's one of those emerging like it's, it's going to have, it's the heyday. It's not right now. Maybe it's, maybe it's next year, maybe it's in five years. But in terms of the first applications, I would say it's, uh, anything with cleaning robots or real life robots that will do some kind of disaster recovery or something that humans don't want to do. If you could go back in time with the same knowledge you have now, when and where would you go?

Speaker 1:          09:19          I would go back to New York to Columbia, and I would have started my youtube channel earlier. Is it essentially needed when you prepare for technical interviews to try to solve problems on your own without looking at solutions?

Speaker 2:          09:36          Yep. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          09:36          for sure. Yeah. You got it. You got to work the brain, right? It's a discipline. You got to work the brand. The better it gets at this algorithm stuff, the better it's going to be for your interviews. Okay. So Raj, you're awesome. I want to learn about machine learning, but I'm a complete beginner. Could you outline a rough idea of what I should look to do to learn machine learning? Just okay, watch my learn python for data science series. Then watch my machine learning for hackers series. Then watch my intro to deep learning series, then watch my math of intelligence series in that order. What math courses have you taken? I mean on and off, I've taken some calculus courses, linear Algebra here and there online at university in high school. But in the end you, the best way to learn this stuff is to just a con academy is a great resource.

Speaker 1:          10:16          Let me just put it very simply. Use Khan Academy for your math essentials. What do you think about the latest achievement of open Ai's Dota playing agent? Oh my God, that was so bad ass. That is very cool. I'm so glad that open AI did that. They are back. Uh, they are hot right now, so um, yeah, I think it's awesome. Do you think that a masters degree is required to work in big companies or is it bachelors and being good enough? Being good is enough for the right companies of course are always going to be companies that really care about your credentials, but the but the best companies care about what you can output. So make sure you have your get hub full of great projects. How many hours a week do you work in study? Oh my God, I work at least 80 hours a week. I am a workaholic. I work Monday through Saturday. I take Sunday off. Uh, but sometimes they even work on Sunday. Yep. Can you juggle three balls? No. Who is Saroj revolt?

Speaker 1:          11:11          The first of its kind. What is intelligence? How far are we in solving it? Intelligence is the ability to adapt and to learn. And we are, I would say five to 10 years away from solving it. What our gas generative adversarial networks are a technique invented by Ian Goodfellow that like you that have to neural networks dual against each other and the result is being able to generate data types that have not been possible before you were about to get into a fight. What song comes on as your soundtrack? Uh, fight music by M and m. This kind of music use it anyway.

Speaker 1:          11:52          What can you speak besides programming ones? English. Good. Drop the which is a dialect from north India, Hindi, which is the language of India. Spanish from high school. I grew up in Houston, Texas. Shout out to Houston and I worked at a flea market with my dad just selling cell phone accessories, talks about and I had to learn Spanish. So Spanish, Hindi. We dropped the and I'm learning Dutch. We'll see how that goes. What do you ever go to Mars? Of course I would go to Mars. I am just waiting to go to Mars. That's going to happen for sure. Ilan, if you're watching this, you know, you know what the deal is. So checking. Yeah. How do I get into research without a masters or a Phd? Yo. Okay. So my thing is I am trying to democratize research, right? So I haven't really gone into that field, but we're getting to a point where anybody will be able to publish a research online.

Speaker 1:          12:36          I'm trying to grow the amateur research community. You don't need to have a phd to publish valuable research. We're going to get to that point in terms of what the progress so far in that field, I would say it's, um, distill.pub. What do you do for a living? I make youtube videos. I make some money off of ads and Patrion uh, and my deal with you, Udacity, that I just did. How do you think blockchain and AI, it can be implemented together? Oh my God. Great question. Open mind by Andrew Trask. Check that out. Great example. File coin is another great example. Uh, anytime you want to create a decentralized application, AI can be used to make it more autonomous. These are all tech, blockchain and AI or just technologies to make autonomous software. What inspired you to get into AI? I was traveling through India and I saw a lot of problems that I didn't think would be solvable in my lifetime.

Speaker 1:          13:29          And I just came to the realization that the only way we're going to really solve all these problems, the only real chance we have is to solve Ai. Your greatest inspiration. Why? Uh, it's a tie between Kanye west for being a creative who is unapologetic and uh, Andrew Andrew, what's your daily routine? I wake up at 8:00 AM I drink some coffee and I either I start writing and programming and editing and sometimes shooting. If I'm shooting a video and I do that until nine or 10:00 PM on and off. Suggest some good books. You think people should read, read. Uh Oh. Okay. Some good books people should read. Read the deep learning book. I already said that. Read, uh, how to create a mind by Kurzweil and one wore this a superintelligence by Bostrom, Nick Bostrom. That was the best advice you've ever been given. I also sapiens by the book sapiens.

Speaker 1:          14:34          The best advice I've ever been given is every time you have a decision, it was actually by my hair, my hair dresser. He said every time you have a decision and you think the harder choice, the more risky choice is going to be worse. It never is. So just take the leap and do the riskier thing. What are the coolest libraries you use often a tensorflow and also Pi torch and I have been really getting into decentralized applications, so I would say truffle and open Zeppelin and etherium. How can deep learning help in solving unanswered questions in biomedicine?

Speaker 1:          15:09          Yeah, I mean you could use generative models to generate new types of medicine. You could use discriminator model to detect diseases that exist. So both of those things. What do you think about Andrew Higgins new course on deep learning? I think it's dope by I support anything that he does. We were trying to democratize AI, so definitely check it out. What do you think about the future of decentralized applications? The time is now it's happening. And do you think machine learning and deep learning are just overhyped by tech giants? Can it really solve general and Super Ai in the future? Or is another AI winter coming, uh, statistically speaking? Yes, another AI winter is coming. We don't know how long it's going to be. Deep learning could be the path forward. We don't know. Personally, I think one shot learning is going to be the, the field that is going to be the next step after deep learning where we need less data for the same results. But it's a very exciting space and as long as we have a tension and we have hard, hardworking people in this space, it's going to keep, it's going to keep up accelerating. Cool. Well, thanks for answering all my questions and showing me around. Awesome. Thanks, Dan. Yeah, yeah.
