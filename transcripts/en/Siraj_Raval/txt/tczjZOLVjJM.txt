Speaker 1:          00:01          Ready to go behind the scenes. Hello world, it's Saroj and let me show you how to teach people artificial intelligence. I'll go over three crucial concepts in order, how to design a curriculum, how to teach in real life, and how to make an educational AI youtube video. If you're new, click subscribe to keep up with my latest AI content. I've now been teaching people AI for about two years full time on Youtube. Every week I create as much AI content as I possibly can. Read me placed feedback and improve it to be even better the next week. Before you start writing curriculums, you've got to start with the most important first step. Believe you can do this. It's estimated that the human brain has about 70,000 thoughts per day, that 70 k opportunities to program positive beliefs about yourself or it could be 70 k opportunities to reinforce your same old self doubts.

Speaker 1:          01:03          If you believe you can't teach AI because you don't have a degree or you're too old or you're bad at math, that will become your reality. The mind responds to its programming like a machine, but the difference is that you have the consciousness to choose what source code you want to input. Neither of my parents went to college, they struggled financially when I was growing up, and I don't have any graduate level degrees. The reason I've been able to do this is because I believed I could. The Internet is your university. It's your responsibility to use it. As such, anyone can become an expert in this field if they'd put in the time to study and are motivated to push past the difficulty. So onto designing an AI curriculum, start by asking yourself four questions. What's your topic? Who are your students? What do you want them to be able to do and how will you measure their ability?

Speaker 1:          02:08          Teaching a curriculum takes a lot of endurance, so the best way to prevent burnout is to pick a topic you're really passionate about. The topic you pick will also depend on what stage you're in, in your AI journey. If you're just starting out, it might be learning basic python for machine learning or linear Algebra, basics for machine learning. If you're more advanced, it could be modern day neural architectures or reinforcement learning. Spend some time alone to browse the web and just brainstorm. Find some cool AI demos. Read some blog posts, watched some videos, listen to some podcasts, see what researchers are talking about on Twitter. Eventually you'll find a couple of topics that excite you. Pick the one that excites you the most and don't worry if you don't understand that topic completely. Teaching is the best way to learn anything. Learn and teach as you go.

Speaker 1:          03:13          Now, depending on the difficulty level of your curriculum, certain student populations will be best suited for it. Try to learn as much as you can about your students. Are they in university? When was their last dental appointment? What should you expect them to know before the first lecture? What problems do students typically have with this material? At this level, there's very likely already been curriculums created that are somewhat similar to your topic. Find them on Google and see what kind of prerequisites they ask of students. What are students concerns and questions. Usually forums and social media groups are a treasure trove to learn about them. The next question is what do you want your students to be able to do? It's supremely important to have goals in mind when both studying and teaching Ai. This can be application specific, like the ability to create a classifier for health care or more broad like the ability to read and understand the math for deep learning.

Speaker 1:          04:20          It could also be the ability to take a more advanced course or even get a job in the field. Try to answer these questions as specifically as you can as it will give structure to everything else. Next, how are you going to measure students' abilities? While some learning goals can be achieved through listening to a lecture, some might require active experimentation, practice and discussion. You might want to create quizzes or group project assignments, a midterm, a final, a hackathon, a cage match. There's a lot of possibilities. I found several free learning management system tools you can use to help you create these easily. There'll be in the video description when it comes to designing the curriculum itself. You want to synthesize existing curriculums and add in your own touch. For example, if we want to create a curriculum on convolutional neural networks will see that both Coursera and Stanford have courses on this topic.

Speaker 1:          05:27          They both have their merits. The Coursera course seems more real world application oriented while Stanford's is more based on theory. Coursera dives straight into CNN theory while Stanford starts with feed forward neural network theory then moves on to comp nets. Stanford also moves on to talk about newer libraries like Pi Torch near the end. While Coursera doesn't, but neither of these courses mentioned using convolutional networks on text data, which they've been shown to surprisingly perform well on specifically regarding sequence classification and while these presenters are clearly credentialed, their lectures are not as dense and attention grabbing as they could be. Just ask Carrie k. H perhaps we could even add our own section on ethics applied to computer vision or you have a more comprehensive history of previous techniques in computer vision. It's important to develop some intuition around the order of complexity of these subtopics. It looks like CNNs require an understanding of several topics including matrix multiplication, gradient based optimization, and feed forward neural network theory, different courses.

Speaker 1:          06:46          We'll tackle these prerequisites in different ways. Some will attempt to teach them all within the course including programming and some will require preexisting knowledge. I've found it's the most fun to teach all or almost all of the necessary Prereq's within the confines of a course and it's not over promising. If you can actually deliver, it will be more challenging, but that's what makes this process so fun, right? There are tons of different ways of ordering topics by complexity. Maybe you want a deep learning library first approach or a math first or an application first approach, whatever works for you. I've also found hosting my curriculum on get hub is a simple and easy way to get developers on board. Plus get hub allows endless edits and collaborations on things you might've missed out on, which students have definitely helped me with. Curriculums longer than 12 weeks are really hard for me to stick to as my interest wanes near the very end and I want to start working on other curriculums that might be a good upper threshold and have a diverse set of learning resources.

Speaker 1:          07:58          If you have too much broad content, students may complain that it's not detailed enough. If it's too deep, students may complain that there's not enough high level overview and real world applicability. That's why having both is the best path forward. Now with your newly formed curriculum, you're ready to start teaching AI. If you're hosting a weekly meetup, a university class of public school class or an after school club, you'll be teaching in person. From what I've learned, teaching at various venues in real life, you need to be very engaging. It's 2018 and people, especially AI enthusiasts have no patience for a boring lecturer. What with all the engaging educational creators popping up every week on social media, they also have their cell phones in their pockets full of interesting things to do. What you can do in person that you can't do in a video though is engage in real time.

Speaker 1:          09:01          Don't think of it like a lecture, but more like a conversation. Encourage your audience to interrupt you, to ask questions, to debate a point amongst themselves. You can get feedback in real time and give them a unique experience and depending on your locale, the audience will likely have a shared set of cultural and or societal experiences. Leverage that relate your topics to things your audience can relate to if you're teaching AI and Carola, for example, mentioned ways AI can be used to help with the flooding people are experiencing. I love watching charisma on command. There are some great techniques to learn how to capture and keep an audience's attention. You want to be strong but humble, fun, but educational. This doesn't come easy, just like all things worth doing and practice makes perfect. Now, if you're like me and want to make educational videos for your curriculum, let me give you some insights into my process.

Speaker 1:          10:04          I first choose a topic for a video that I find interesting. Then I spend time learning, synthesizing blog posts, videos, research papers, anything I can find on that topic. Once I feel prepared, I'll write a script. I first introduced the topic, give the history of it, showed some real world applications, discuss the mathematical theory, then dive into the code, followed by a discussion of the demo and a conclusion. I'll revise it once to correct any spelling and ordering errors. Then I'll add in some humor on this second pass. That's to keep it engaging and give it my voice. I'll then read my script off a teleprompter. You can find several online links, will be in the video description. I read my words from a teleprompter with the green screen behind me and some led lights on either side. I use a sign Heizer globally or microphone, a Canon DSLR camera.

Speaker 1:          11:05          Then once I have footage, I'll transfer it over from my SD card to my computer. While I used to edit my videos myself for a little over a year and a half, I now have an editor helped me with this final cut pro is what we use to edit the footage. You'll first one to key out yourself. Then add in a background, add an images that help explain what you're talking about. I tend to look for memes that are technical as they are the best intersection of engaging and educational. If you want to take your video to the next level, you can use Adobe after effects to create animations linked to a course on that in the video description. Then just export and upload to your favorite social media platforms. Share to your friends and relevant to spread the AI power as far as you can. It's okay to learn AI by teaching it and yes, creating a learning path for other people and then following through with it is hard work. But if you believe in the power of AI to solve some of the world's hardest problems, it's worth every ounce of effort. And that's Iraq. It subscribed. And I'll grant you three wishes and make sure to connect with me on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook for more AI content. For now, I've got to teach, so thanks for watching.
