Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello world. It's Saroj and I'm excited to announce that school of Ai is launching a research lab thanks to Google cloud. We're going to offer 10 wizards, 1000 US dollars in cloud credits to pursue some exciting research directions. There'll be our fall 2018 fellows. Each of them will receive personalized mentoring ship from one of our experienced advisers to help them along their journey. We'd like to grow the amateur research community that means wizards from around the world who aren't necessarily a part of academia or industry. We believe that by enabling them to do research with a complete pipeline of resources, from funding to mentorship to helping them submit their work to relevant outlets, the entire AI community will benefit. So here's the plan. We've got some research directions that we think are particularly exciting, including metal learning or learning to learn quantum machine learning, one shot learning or learning from small datasets and deep reinforcement learning.

Speaker 1:          01:10          But these are all suggestions. All 10 selected applicants will be able to choose the research direction of their choice. With one caveat, it has to be applied to one of the United Nations, 17 sustainable development goals. Current AI technology accessible to anyone with an internet connection allows ordinary people to create solutions to accelerate the progress of each of these school of AI research is applied research. We make scientific discoveries with specific real world use cases in mind and we need a new standard for how these papers are presented. To that end, I've assisted to deep reinforcement learning engineers, Laura Gracer and Kang while Lune and helping build out a framework for deep reinforcement learning research called SLM lab. It's design was guided by four principles, modularity, simplicity, analytical clarity, and crucially reproducibility. We've got several baseline reinforcement learning algorithms implemented and more to come. SLM lab is an easy way to get started with deep reinforcement learning research.

Speaker 1:          02:25          You can just build on top of an existing algorithm and benchmark the results. All the algorithms relevant environments and testing tools are included in a single repository. We have both a static and dynamic version of our paper. The static version is a pdf, like all papers are, but the dynamic version is a Jupiter notebook. We've hosted it on Google Colab, which means that anyone who reads the paper can also view the results and a demo of SLM lab by running code themselves in their browser. No dependencies necessary. We want this to serve as an example, school of AI researchers should create both a static and a dynamic version of their research paper. So I hope you're hyped. You'll find a link to the application in the video description. We'll take one week to choose applications and announced them publicly. So if you're interested, hurry up and sign up now.
