Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello World Suraj here. Big comp is a currency just like the US dollar or the Japanese, yet accept bitcoin doesn't belong to anyone. No one owns it, no government bank company or person. It's just open source software that anyone can download in brows. It's an invention that no one owns, but anyone can use kind of like email. It was created in 2007 by a mysterious person into Toshi neca mode. The search was to, Toshi isn't going on for years, but no one has ever found him before and since then the total value of the bitcoin network has grown from nothing to over 5 billion US dollars. Once you joined the bitcoin network by opening a wallet, it will generate your way 25 character, long public and private key using cryptography. Hence my big point is called a cryptocurrency. This is your bitcoin address. Think of it kind of like your bank account number.

Speaker 1:          00:51          You can give your public key to anyone. It's what the, we use the send money team, but your private key is for your eyes only. Anyone who has a private key can access all of your funds. So keep it safely hit every time someone sends bitcoin to another person. The bitcoin network is responsible for processing the transaction. The bitcoin network has maintained by a bunch of computers that verify all transactions to ensure that they are valid. This process is called mine and anyone can set up their computer to become a miner. Can get paid for maintaining the network. All have to do is download the bitcoin client and start mining. My new requires a lot of computing power, so you'll need a really, really good GPU chip. An AC computer would work best when anyone gets the client. Their computer will start downloading somebody called the blockchain.

Speaker 1:          01:45          The blockchain is a huge list of every single bitcoin transaction that has ever happened in the network. These transactions are bundled into units called blocks. These blocks are all chained together in order of timestamps, a chain of blocks. Blockchain get it when anyone makes a transaction. Each mine checked to see if the transaction was ever made before and it's copy of the blockchain. If it was never made before and we'll recognize it as a valid transaction. If at least 51% of the network agrees that a transaction was valid, it clears and it's added to the blockchain. The blockchain is sort on every miner's computer. There is no central computer whatsoever. It's completely decentralized. That means no one can shut down big, but what if a bad guy decides he wants to try to generate fake bitcoins? Couldn't he just create a bunch of mining accounts and approve his own transactions as a new majority?

Speaker 1:          02:45          Well, yeah, but bitcoin has incredible security system designed to defend against that type of attack. Also known as a civil attack. There's an extra step that every miner has to do. Once it says that a block is valid, it has to solve a bunch of randomly generated mathematical problems using its computing power and what's the solving them? Other miners can verify that it did indeed solve those problems. This is called the proof of work algorithm. Minors have to prove that they've done a certain amount of computational work before their vote is valid. What this means is that more for a bad guy and spend money twice or dumped spent, he has to control more computational power than 51% of the bitcoin network. The total computational power of the bitcoin network is currently 13,000 times greater than the 500 fastest supercomputers in the world combined has Kanye says,

Speaker 1:          03:40          thanks [inaudible] no one person or entity has that much computing power. So then then work has never been broken before and it only gets stronger cause more miners join like adding their computing power to only 21 million bitcoins can ever be created at the current rate of creation. The Alaska Colin would be mined in the year 21 four so when that happens, the miners will then be paid with just transaction fees instead of transaction fees and generate coins. This makes bitcoin a deflationary currency on might be inflationary USDOT do you pushing her needs? If there's a hard limit on the amount of currency that can be created and inflationary means that more currency can be created, but what isn't inherently better or more natural than the other? There is no natural state of money. Its natural state is neither inflationary nor deflationary. Money is not a natural thing. It's a tool we use in our society to transfer decks amongst ourselves, turning the dials on the economic models for money in either direction for both pros and cons. Bitcoin can plug into the existing system or money transfer and make it faster and more efficient and more widely available. There's so many ways to get involved.
