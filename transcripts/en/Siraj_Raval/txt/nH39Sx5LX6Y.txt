Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey Stephen, how's it going? And so I'm just not bad. Do you mind if I ask you 67 questions? Sure. All right, let's do this. What is the culture like at salesforce? How the culture is great. It's a real emphasis on research and uh, really I guess advancing Ai.

Speaker 2:          00:15          What excites you the most about machine learning?

Speaker 1:          00:19          Thinking. So the capability for people to do stuff that no one had really been able to do before that, like an entire workforce of people.

Speaker 2:          00:25          Okay. Do you miss about where you grew up?

Speaker 1:          00:30          Okay. One thing about Australia is eucalyptus leaves. They are beautiful and they smell so nice. Eucalyptus trees everywhere. And Luckily we have a few of them in California. What time do you wake up? I wake up, uh, oh gosh. More like 10:00 AM it was one of the most stressful but a truly pleasurable experiences in my life. I loved so much.

Speaker 2:          00:52          What website?

Speaker 1:          00:58          I would have to say Twitter is my main vice. And also verse year

Speaker 2:          01:02          favorite machine learning

Speaker 1:          01:06          mixture of soft maxes.

Speaker 2:          01:11          One person. Who would it be? Uh, Shannon from entropy. Your last AI started Gacaca wired by salesforce. How did you celebrate?

Speaker 1:          01:27          The whole team went out and had drinks and one of the nearby bars so we're pretty tight. So a normal, what's it like doing research as a full time job? As a full time job? It's amazing cause you actually get to hurt it on the exact problem that you're interested in and just stay there and keep working at it. Bravest thing you've ever done. Um Ooh. Probably move to the u s but away from friends and family. What is one thing that scares you? I would say heights. Honestly. This is something that I don't think I'm ever going to be able to work. Poss favorite movie inception. Do you play any instruments? Uh, yeah. I'll actually play piano and Trump burn and get tall. What's more interesting? Neuro Science. Physics early because we can understand that

Speaker 2:          02:17          better at the moment. That's present you've ever received.

Speaker 1:          02:22          When I was like I think nine or 10. My parents actually gave me a computer but they sat it in the middle of the carto and I didn't even realize it until I go to the room. What is something you do to relax? Uh, best thing is usually television shows or movies with friends.

Speaker 2:          02:39          What is something surprising about you?

Speaker 1:          02:42          I am probably one of the pickiest eaters you'll ever meet and chicken nuggets and frozen coker are basically my life.

Speaker 2:          02:49          You prefer cats or dogs? Horses. What's the machine learning model that doesn't get enough attention? I think studying,

Speaker 1:          03:01          I think starting um, with like the simplest baseline models is the best way to go. Sir. Just stick with multilayer perceptron for the starting point, what's your favorite

Speaker 2:          03:14          operating system? I got to say Linux. Do you play any sports? Not really. No. Most adventurous thing you've ever done.

Speaker 1:          03:25          I'm a multiday hike through the Australian outback

Speaker 2:          03:28          source. Do you use to stay up to date and machine learning

Speaker 1:          03:34          please? Twitter again, like the people you find there was this amazing programming

Speaker 2:          03:38          of choice for machines. Hyphen. Favorite professor

Speaker 1:          03:44          did James, Karen from the University of Sydney, Australia. Why do you think programming is fun? I think programming, it enables you to do some completely and utterly a tremendous things. Again, you'd never be able to do yourself. You can control a machine that can run billions of calculations a second.

Speaker 2:          04:00          What's the most amazing thing

Speaker 1:          04:04          society? Because I don't see where the end point is for it. Favorite? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:11          Chicken nuggets. Name one person. You really admire?

Speaker 1:          04:16          One of my curve. Uh, my um, colleagues. James Bradbury. What was your first program? Oh, sorry. First program. It was a hello world app that literally just read in my name and then spell it out back at me.

Speaker 2:          04:30          Didn't you talk to on the phone?

Speaker 1:          04:34          Um, Brad and from, and video.

Speaker 2:          04:39          Where do you go back home to Australia. Would you live on Mars? What is one thing you can't live without? Unfortunately my laptop. What is one skill you wish you had? I honestly don't know. What is the last thing you do before bed?

Speaker 1:          05:04          Okay, so I actually play the same set of four songs from a soundtrack every night from Ender's game. What texts editor do you use of them?

Speaker 2:          05:14          What open source library you really high torch is beautiful. What was the hard problem you recently,

Speaker 1:          05:22          so most recently, um, language modeling. What's the meaning of life, friends, family, and um, I guess science. Who is one offered you really like, I love, um, Isaac Asimov. What is one thing that excites me?

Speaker 2:          05:44          [inaudible] we're

Speaker 1:          05:45          getting back into space. Best advice you've ever received. Um, just go for it. Even if you have no clue what you're actually doing. What is one piece of you'd give yourself

Speaker 2:          05:57          10 years

Speaker 1:          06:01          less worried about making mistakes.

Speaker 2:          06:04          You spend more time on the internet or real life and to not. Well and truly do you spend, do you have any pets?

Speaker 1:          06:12          Yes. If you count my parents or it's three dogs, one cat and three horses.

Speaker 2:          06:17          What's something you've learned in the past month?

Speaker 1:          06:22          Difficult audio is in terms of actually processing it with deep learning. Do you like spicy food? No, not at all. What is a movie that made you cry? Uh, up the beginning of,

Speaker 2:          06:35          if you ran the world, what is one live you'd enact in?

Speaker 1:          06:40          Oh, I'm going to try and stay away from being too controversial. Um, a, a very soft universal income. Is the singularity near not near enough to worry about yet. Who is one person you looked up to when you went to college? Um, John. Jonathan Comma fells. Her basically taught me a good chunk of the programming. I know her.

Speaker 2:          07:02          What deep learning library I touch. If you were to start from scratch today, what is a learning resource you would use to learn machine learning?

Speaker 1:          07:12          Uh, foster AI by Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas. What is one goal you have in the next 10 years and the next 10 years? I want us to be able to compose an entire orchestra without having to think about it. Favorite subject in school when you were growing up? Oh, a Latin.

Speaker 2:          07:30          If you could be a superhero, who would it be?

Speaker 1:          07:34          Something to be said about iron man for the fact that he had to develop everything himself. What's your spirit and Oh, probably slough. I'm kind of lazy.

Speaker 2:          07:45          What do you predict comes next after the deep learning height?

Speaker 1:          07:49          Hopefully the deep blending her a hype doesn't die down. But, um, I think everything connected devices, bitcoin or ethereum. Ethereum.

Speaker 2:          07:59          Did you delete your Facebook? Nope. Google home or Amazon? Alexa, neither.

Speaker 1:          08:05          I don't want anything listening to me. You prefer supervised or unsupervised learning? Unsupervised. Favorite conference you've ever been to? Uh, probably nips last year. Awesome. Steven. Well, thanks for answering those questions. Thanks man. All right. Have a good one.
