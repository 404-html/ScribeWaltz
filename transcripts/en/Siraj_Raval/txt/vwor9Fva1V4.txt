Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello world, it's a Raj and supply chains. I know it doesn't sound like the sexiest word ever, but it is a very, very important industry that AI can be applied to an improved greatly. There's a huge potential there. In this video we're going to improve the revenue streams for a simulated company using this logistics wizard that IBM has provided. What this is, is it's an example of how AI can be used to optimize the supply chain for some distribution company. So for those of you who don't know, a supply chain is the process of taking, of taking an item from raw materials into a finished product. And there's a lot of middlemen along the way. So anything you order on Amazon prime for it to go from, from where it is to you, all of that is the supply chain. And there are distributors, there are, uh, you know, drivers, all sorts of different middlemen in the middle and the weather affects the price of the shipment.

Speaker 1:          00:56          There's all of these variables and this is imperfect, perfect example of how AI can be used to, to make a process more efficient. And so what this is is it's a simulated demo of a global logistics company. And what they do is they ship products, they've got three distribution centers, five active shipments, one has been completed, and for retail centers, this is where the product is actually sold to consumers. And what we can do is we can simulate a storm using this button. So hits simulate storm. And what's going to happen is it's going to simulate a storm. It's a snow storm, it's a moderately severe snow storm. And what happened because of the storm, because of the storm, we have uh, had supply shortages in these two cities from salt lake to Raleigh and from Salt Lake to Boston. And I can either approve these Aurukun deny these, I'll say approved for the first one and reject the second one.

Speaker 1:          01:47          And what this is going to do to my bottom line as let's say I'm the CEO of this company, is it's going to either increase my revenue or lose it. Okay. So that's the demo and we're going to look at that at the end. I'm also going to explain the like the technical details of what's happening behind the hood here, how it's doing that, but you know, high level if you just want to try it out without like having to code or looking at the technical details, this IBM demo link in the description is perfect for you anyway, so, right, so like I said, the supply chain is that network between a company and its suppliers to produce and distribute a specific product and the supply chain represents the steps it takes to get that product to the consumer. So we can see this nice little infographic we have to start, which is a factory and this person or robot.

Speaker 1:          02:31          Then the forecasts, ideally using AI right now it's done mostly using humans. It forecasts the demand. How many people are going to want this product and based on that forecast, they will create enough product from raw material to meet that demand and then they're going to allocate all of that onto these trucks. They're going to optimize the routes without these trucks take to get to the consumer. They're going to assort all of those finished products in those boxes in the distribution factory and then send them to the retail center and hopefully, hopefully more customers buy the product. There is actually profit, right? Hopefully there is profit after this giant process and it's a very long and complicated process to go through, right? I mean there's, there's so many middlemen here, but the problem is that what if the consumer doesn't like it? Right? Ideally you want to cut your losses as a business and right now there are people, consulting firms, agencies that companies hire to do this and they're very, very expensive.

Speaker 1:          03:28          Companies lose a lot of money due to the supply chain and if you as a small startup can save any company, even 5% on their transportation costs because you're using AI to optimize the ideal time that they should send this shipment. Factoring in the weather conditions, factoring in consumer demand, can factoring in whatever it is, if you can show to them that you can do that, not only is that a big deal, you will get paid so much money. There is so much money to be made into supply chain. Okay. I've been, I've been researching this. There's, so there's a lot of money. Seriously. This AI for business series me basically being like, how can have you applies to this whole, my God, this, what am I doing with my life? I need to know. But anyway, I want you guys to make money. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          04:12          Like we're, we're a crew, we're homies, you know, you guys make money, I get happy. That's just how it works. And I've got my paid course in book sales and ad revenue and Patriot and, um, speaking deals and other things that I do for revenue. So with that, I'm good. Uh, someone said in the last video, like show a little glimpse of the real survived. So I'm showing you that also one more guns to the real Saroj. I'm in New York right now in my makeshift studio and uh, I'm here for this Crypto, a award thing, which I thought like, should I even go to that? But, um, I'm here because like, it's cool. I went to this cosmos, a party last night. Cosmos is a really cool a blockchain network. They're one of the few that I actually like. Um, they helped me make Suraj coined back in a few days ago, which not a few days, a few weeks ago, months even, which I don't think it worked out because people took it the wrong way.

Speaker 1:          04:58          But the point is that they're, they're pretty cool and um, anyway, so yeah, it's good to be in New York anyway. So the supply chain, there's a lot of components there, right? There's requirements, planning, sourcing, manufacturing, all of these requirements. And right now this, in this, in this infographic here, you're seeing artificial intelligence, all of that is done by humans. I mean, seriously, this is a very old industry, right? This is like as old as products themselves have been and no one has even thought about applying AI to it until the past five or six years ago. Right? Because that's when deep learning really started like two to come into the mainstream. The other reason is because there's so much data, right? The suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, they have so much data. I have a sample data set for you right here to take a look at.

Speaker 1:          05:43          Okay. This is just a very small example that I found from what was a key data.com and its supply chain shipping pricing data. Okay. So they have some project code and this is like real world data. Like it's, it's not pretty, it looks ugly. You're like what is this? What am I looking at? What am I even trying to do here? If you're, if that's the case then you're looking at some really real, real world data. Cause that's how it looks. It's our job as data scientists to find the needle in the haystack to find the, the three keys in the, the simulation as a ready player. One was in that movie. That's how it was. So, um, anyway, so we've got country, these are all features and w okay, so let's, let's think through this for a second. Let's say this is our data set, right?

Speaker 1:          06:25          Like scheduled delivery date clients. Okay. Wow. Okay. Sub Classification. Okay. There's a, there's a label that we could potentially use, you know, all of these different things. Okay? So there's, there's quite a lot of features here. But remember if this can easily be a supervised learning problem where we have a label and then we had the input data, right? So all we have to do is we have to decide what that label is going to be, right? It could be, you know, what is the, we want to predict what the weight is going to be. We want to predict what the fright cost is going to be given all of these other conditions. Let's say it's that we want to predict what the cost is going to be given all of these other features, okay? So we can easily do that with psych. It learn, right?

Speaker 1:          07:07          We split the training data and two, this is the x and here's the why. The why is the cost. The X is everything else. And what this is going to amount to is a giant matrix, right? We're all of these values right here are going to constitute a single data point, which is a single matrix, right? Value one comma value to comma bio about you three comma. But notice how some of these are dates. Some of these are strings, some of these are numbers. What we want to do first is to regularize all of this data. So it's all numerical, right? And we'll just, once it's all numbers, right, then we can feed it to the neural network or whatever, whatever we're going to use probably a neural network because that's the best for sure. So once we do that and we, so we have the input data, we have the labels and we're predicting the mapping.

Speaker 1:          07:54          Remember it's all about predicting that mapping. And once we predicted that mapping after a sufficient number of data points, then we'll say, you know what? Let's say I'm going to deliver it on. And you say some date in the future, you say, okay, on this day and with this kind of client with this, what's the price going to be? And it's going to tell you based on everything else, here's the likely costs and it's going to cost you. Okay, so but I think a good way to do this, that's one way. I mean notice there's so many things we could predict, right? We could predict the the, the, the class label that is going to be, it's going to be an HIV test is going to be pediatric. That won't necessarily be good for us, but we could do that. But what I think would be the most efficient would be time series forecasting, right?

Speaker 1:          08:41          On what date should I send out this shipment such that the price is going to be the lowest. So that is considered time series forecasting and notice how, how many features there are. We could not draft this alone, this data set just like this. We would have to reduce the dimensionality of this Dataset, right? Using a technique like Tsne or PCA, right? Which is principle component analysis. Both of those, those techniques. I have videos on search to Raj, PCA, Saroj, t dash, s, n, e. And then once we do that, then it's going to be a two dimensional graph where it's going to be one dimension is going to be everything, all the features. And the other dimension is going to be the time, right? Every single day of the month and the year. And it's going to plot out what that looks like. Okay. And so what we wanna do is we want to find that lowest point.

Speaker 1:          09:35          And what we can do is once we grab that out, we could see what that lowest point is and then we can say, well, this is the optimal point right here. So that's another way we can do this. But if we're trying to figure out the best date to ship something based on the weather pattern, that's easily a time series forecasting problem, which we can do with chaos, which I'll show you at the end of this video. Um, but anyway, so that's, that's a, that's a little bit of a, a Dataset Speil for you anyway. But the problem with supply chains, and there is a big problem, is that there are, there are these silos, right? There are silos. It's, it's not easy to just say, I'm going to make an AI startup gimme your supply chain. Like it's like one big Dataset. It's not always, you know, they're, they're different companies that deal with all of these things that require armies of expensive planners and they usually run complex engines at each step of the process and at each node in the supply network.

Speaker 1:          10:28          So they are missing out on these huge opportunities because there locally optimized for their own, you know, their own little silo. But if someone could get an overhead view of all of the data, you could optimize the f out of everything, which is awesome, right? So that's what we want to do. We want to get that huge end to end data set of the entire supply chain. And so if we look at, you know, people were surveyed, companies were surveyed, what the most costly outcomes were for, uh, for their supply chains. And most people said margin erosion. And the second one was sudden demand change, which is also a big one, right? So suddenly people don't want the product or suddenly you know the margin is the margin has eroded or whatever it is, which I assume is like the product margin. Like let's say the cost of the raw materials went up for some reason like oil for example, because of political reasons or whatever, what have you.

Speaker 1:          11:21          But that that's a huge deal as well. And you can predict all of these things. You can predict that a product is going to fail. You can predict that there's going to be a disruption in the product, full flow, all of this, if you pass efficient data, you can predict these sticks. This is a super power and think about it. Most of these companies, they don't know. They don't know that anything about this, you know, you are literally watching a video on supply chain applied to AI. So there's a lot of opportunity in this space. So supply chains have a lot of data and it's all sorts of data. It's transactional data, it's time based data, it's gps, mapping numbers, strings, texts, dates. There's a lot, and we have to regularize all this data so it's in the same numerical format and then we can feed it to a machine learning model, but they've got so much data and the AI should not be a black box, right?

Speaker 1:          12:09          Whenever you have a client accompany a distributor distributor, you've got to be able to explain to them why you made a certain decision. And the best way to do that is to visualize that data, right? To show them, here is why. Here are, here's the point, here's the, you know, here's the the minimum minimum that I found. Here's a gradient. You know, things like that. You don't have to say the word gradient, but you have to show them visually how you came to your conclusion. That's one way. Another way is, I mean, depending on the type of neural network you have, if it's a convolutional network, you can show them the features inside. You could say like, well, here's the abstractions that it's built. There's a lot of different ways, but the point is that you should be able to explain your findings. So, uh, what are the different ways that AI can solve this problem?

Speaker 1:          12:51          Right? So I mean there's so many different ways that AI could potentially solve this problem. And if you think about it, what's really exciting is 13% of companies, only 13% that were served, that were surveyed by forester said that the supply chain was where the focus of AI was in internally, which is huge, right? And it's going everywhere else, marketing, sales, other areas. But it's such a, it's, there's so much data there in that field and there's so much potential for increasing revenue, right? By streamlining and optimizing the whole, the whole process. So it's a huge opportunity for startups. And so if you think about it, the supply chain, all the people who are planning it, the drivers for the cars, the people who are unpacking boxes, who are checking for quality, all these things, every single part of that can be optimized, can be automated.

Speaker 1:          13:39          And if you think about the Internet of things and Mike Drop blockchain, we can create a fully, fully, fully autonomous system here and to end autonomous, no humans needed, um, that can be self aware, self governing and self determining. And I'll add to that self optimizing, right? It just gets better and better over time. So, and the reason I say blockchain is because right now we trust middlemen with saying that a package was sent from point a to point B and we have to pay those middlemen. But ideally we could use some kind of immutable ledger blockchain that nobody controls and say. And every time a shipment is sent it's timestamped on to that blockchain. And then we can say, hey, oh it was there. Right? This is when it happened. It's on this blockchain, its immutable, nobody modified it. I don't have to trust anybody.

Speaker 1:          14:22          So that's how blockchain can be used here as well. Timestamping shipments and when they happen and when different actions occur, it's a publicly verifiable way. So what are, what are startups that have actually done this? So one idea. So what are ways that AI can be applied to this industry? Right? And I'll talk about startups inside of this. So one is chatbots for procurement, right? So whenever you have someone who is running some kind of company, they can say, hey, I want to be able to access, you know, this, this could be like some data that they need for the supply chain or whatever. And the, the Chat Bot can give them that data. It can pull it from the Dataset and say, here it is. They can also say, you can also ask it like if I were to do this, what would be the likely outcome?

Speaker 1:          15:01          It can make predictions using a pretrained model in the background. So one company that is doing this is chime box. So with Chime Bot is doing is they are acting as a chat bot interface for these suppliers, right? So, um, basically, you know, they're, they're making the chatbot for different industries, but procurement is one of them. And they can ask these questions, which is super useful because a chat Bot is 24, seven, it doesn't need sleep. You don't need to pay it, you know a lot like it as much as a human and it's, it's, it's a very optimized um, idea. So another one is supply chain planning, which is what we're going to do, right? So how could an AI be used to help forecast the inventory? How much you need planning a demand supply, these things, these kinds of things. Ai is perfectly suited for that.

Speaker 1:          15:43          Clear metal is one startup that is doing that right now, right? Supply chain visibility, making predictive alerting and collaboration possible. Check them out. And by the way, I want to say that none of these startups should dissuade you from doing something in this field. There's a huge opportunity. There's a huge space, there's a lot to share. And these are just, this is just an example for you to look at it and say, this is possible machine learning for warehouse management, right? If we think about who is in control of the warehouse, it's a human need to make sure that the robots are in order, that the, you know, this person is getting paid, et cetera. And there's a lots for a human to keep in mind. This is a, this is a huge job and AI can definitely help that human or even replace that human in that job.

Speaker 1:          16:20          Rubik cloud is a good example of intelligent decision. Autumn is automation. Definitely check that one out. Autonomous Vehicles, that one sounds like an obvious one, but Google Waymo, Uber drive dot. Ai Comma. Dot. Ai. There's a bunch of, uh, potential in this space to create self-driving transports that can automate the, the driving process portion of the supply chain. And also you don't have to make a capital intensive car or truck to, to, to make a self driving, um, startup. You can make software for them. You can make a, you can, you can collect data, aggregate data, you can create better mapping software, et cetera. There's a lot of potential there as well. Natural language processing is another one, right? So the data that we're looking at is very, uh, you know, it's hard to read, right? There's so many different features, item description delivered to client date, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          17:09          Ideally we could use natural language processing to interpret all of this data and then create a simple Q and a system where we could just ask this, ask our Dataset, what is this? And it would just find it exactly what we need and just tell us that exact day. Like what was the vendor I IMCO term on the 5th of November, right? Something like that. Like an NLP natural language interface where we can use plain English to ask it questions and things like that. Data log. Dot. Io is doing that. Um, death taxes and data preparation. You're on your own for death and taxes. But we've got you covered for data preparation. I love that. Great. A great little slogan. So, uh, last one is a predictive analytics for supplier selection, right? As you can see, it's very complicated. There's a lot of potential decisions that a human has to make.

Speaker 1:          17:52          Your, anytime you can offload a very hard decision to a machine, you are, you've, you've done something very good for society, right? So, uh, supplier selection, who's the best supplier? Who's going to be the, you know, um, optimal choice for different actions that you would perform in the supply chain. Great example of Ai. So to get to this logistics wizard that I was talking about earlier, so IBM has this service called bloomix. Bloomix is using their Ai Watson to do a bunch of different tasks. So in this case, a task we're looking at is called the logistics wizard. And what that does is it's using an AI to create the simulated environments for this global retail distribution company and simulate bad weather. And so what we can do is we can track that bad weather, we can trap cars, our shipments, we could see what's going wrong, what's going right, and it will tell us those things.

Speaker 1:          18:41          And it's using an AI to make predictions. So what we can get into the details of, you know, all the different things this can do, but this is like, uh, you know, ready, ready to go solution. And what you can do is you can actually use this and your tool set for another company, right? Because there is an overhead to even having to look at this. Well you can say, is it like a plain English direction? Like here's the best thing to do based on my data, my analytics. So you can actually use this for our company. You can use this in unison with other models, care os, tensorflow, Pi Torch, build your own models, try out different models for different use cases and just have all of those in your tool set, um, to, to, to use as predicted power for your client. Now there are different ways to build a model.

Speaker 1:          19:24          Um, if we look at this, right? It depends on what we're trying to predict, right? If we're trying to predict the label or if the shipment mode, the fulfillment dates, the scheduled date, the price, what are we trying to predict here? Right? And that column is going to be our label. Everything else is going to be our input data, right? Which usually in my videos is just one single column, but sometimes it can be multiple columns, right? And that's a little harder, uh, to, to think about. But really it's just one giant matrix. We don't actually have to think about like how the mapping is working. We just know that it's going to learn that mapping. That's really the key. It's went to learn the mapping between one or more columns x, you know, x values and the label, which is whatever we're trying to predict, the price, the time, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          20:07          And so what I want to do right now is I want to do a little bit of pseudo code just so you could get an idea of what I'm talking about here. So let's, let's, let's see. What we want to do is we want to predict the, um, let's say the price. We want to predict the price of a shipment given all the other variables. And what we've done is we have our data set here, we have our price as well. See, here's the freight costs and USD and let's assume where we're, we've gathered whether data we've gathered, even stock data, whatever kind of data. And we put them all into columns in our giant Dataset and we want to predict the price. And so, because time is involved here, there are dates involved. What we could consider this as is a time series problem, right?

Speaker 1:          20:46          We're trying to forecast in a time series problem. So what I can do is I can say, okay, this is going to be my supply chain. Uh, and I'm going to import the libraries that I need. That's going to be care os, that's going to be pan does for data preprocessing, that's going to be psychic, learn for data regularization and um, it's a pseudo code by the way. And we'll get to the real code. I just want to show you how I think and you know, just think through it with you. So what are we going to do? Well, we're going to create a function called prediction. And inside of the prediction function, we're going to say we've got our input data. So is there input data is going to be a part of a pandas data frame. Okay. So this is, we're pulling this into memory and this is going to be a input dot CSV file that we saw and we're going to split it on let's say the 19th column.

Speaker 1:          21:37          So everything before the 19 column, all those data points are going to be the x, right? The input data. And the last one is going to be the price and that's going to be the the label. And that's all we did. We split the data into training and testing data. Uh, well we, we can actually do that with at Lawrence we can say x, Y, x test, why test? Now we can take that input data, which is just split and we could say, we could say sy Kit, learn dot split, let, let's just say it's already split, but this just kind of format to into four different variables. Okay. And so they're, um, important data. That was our first step. Then we split data into training and testing data. Now we'll build a model build model using Cara Ross of course, off subsequential and now we're going to build our network.

Speaker 1:          22:35          Okay. So we're trying to predict what that price is going to be. So what we can do is we could look at Ken Ross and we could take some of those snippets here. Let's just say it's going to be a two layer model. Everything is fully connected. Uh, ideally we would want an LSTM network, which I'm about to show you. But for the sake of this pseudo code demo, I'm just trying to show you like how this goes. Um, lastly, we're going to fit the model on the data. We built it, we've compiled it, we defined it's lost function, and then at the very end, we can make our prediction just like that. And this is going to be x, and this is gonna be y. And now once we're done, we'll predict our classes. And what it's going to do is going to print out a giant matrix of all of those features and all the values given this price, right?

Speaker 1:          23:23          So we're going to make a prediction about what the features would be given a price, and then we could give it some price that we want ideally. And then we'll say, well, here's what you should have. Here are the optimal levels for all of those features. And we could just kind of tune it there, give it more data, get more accurate results, et cetera. So, uh, but what we would want in this case if we have a lot of data, is an Lstm, a neural network, a long short term memory network as a type of recurrent network. And everyone, whenever we're dealing with sequences of data, we want to use a recurrent network because the past matters, right? It's not just learning the mapping the past matters as well because you can't just say, you know, predict the next word in a sentence without knowing the words that came before it because the past matters.

Speaker 1:          24:01          So LSTM networks are a type of recurrent network that could predict longterm sequences, which is what we likely have. And we can, you know, have some data preprocessing up here to make sure it's all in the same format. And then we could just run our training loop on DLC. I'm network, very simple stuff. Uh, but yeah, I just wanted to show you that you can use this, you can use carrots to build it on your own. You can find the data set. I have a link to that in the description. You can use IBM's blue mix if you don't want to have to code, and one a very easy to use solution, but there's a lot of potential in this space and I hope you found this video useful. Also, if you have any comments, any feedback suggestions, definitely post them in the comment section. I always read my comments. I might not reply to all of them, but I read all of them. So thanks for watching. Please subscribe for more programming videos and for now I've got to attend a crypto award, so thanks for watching.
