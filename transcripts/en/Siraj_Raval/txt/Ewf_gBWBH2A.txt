Speaker 1:          00:05          Hey Allen, how's it going? That's great. How are you? Pretty good. Can I ask you six or seven questions? Yeah, sure. Go for it. What's one application of plots of computing that you're most excited about so it could fall diagnosis. Do you miss MIT? Uh, sometimes I need to be politically correct here. Favorite part of the software stack? Oh, I love, so first of all, I love the tools, right? And making it easy for developers to be able to rate code in the quantum system. I love that. What's one thing you really like about Vancouver? How the view from my apartment, this is amazing. Overlooking Coal Harbor in the mountains. Where did the name D Wade come from? I have no clue. What do you do to relax?

Speaker 1:          00:47          I fly. I'm a pilot. Will quantum computing replace classical computing? Uh, it will probably always work synergistically with classic computer classical computing through hybrid algorithms and applications. Last thing you made with your hands. Uh, some gesture I'm sure. Next. Probably while I was driving. Next problem you want to solve? Uh, um, you know, I am really impressed how next problem I want to solve. Oh, delivering our next generation processor. What advice would you give yourself 10 years ago? Uh, do exactly what you ended up doing over the 10 years that followed. What website you waste time on.

Speaker 1:          01:40          Don't waste a lot of time on websites. I uh, right now I'm spending all my time looking at the monitoring system for the new leap service and I love being there. Last person you've emailed it was, uh, somebody who reports to me about, um, doing some planning work. You get an all expenses paid trip to one city. Where do you go? Bora Bora. Would you visit Mars? Uh, know what to take too long to get there. I love my family. What is one thing you can't live without? Diet, Dr Pepper. What's one thing people often misunderstand about computers? Anyway, this is our lab a he wave systems. I've been trying to avoid your question. Um, but people often misunderstand about quantum computers. Um, uh, I believe quantum computers are going to solve real commercial problems or at least pieces of real commercial problems sooner than most people think, but they're not gonna do it by solving problems that are intractable classically by being able to solve existing problems that can be solved through existing classical computers, but just more efficiently. What text editor do you use? Word Open source library that you really like? Uh, yeah, the uh, ocean tool suite from Dui. What's one of your favorite movies? Uh, I always liked air force one and my, now I'm giving away my age. What is something you do to come up with project ideas? Yeah, just think about the marketplace and what customers are telling us they want or need. Can we take some steps inside? Yeah, please. Your hobbies outside of flying, that's flying an airplane. Not any other form of light. What is the first program you've ever made?

Speaker 1:          03:54          Um, it was a synthetic aperture radar program when I was back in college. Professor, uh, that was a while ago. My thesis advisor run revisted am I take ideal culture in one word?

Speaker 2:          04:13          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:14          An ideal culture team, team oriented culture, best advice you've ever received. Um, go for it.

Speaker 2:          04:27          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:28          You think you need a phd to do quantum developing now will the singularity, I don't think you need a master's degree if you're a good python program program or you can program the d system. What's your spirit animal?

Speaker 2:          04:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:44          I don't know. Favorite Linux? Uh, whichever one we're using with Dua. What's something you've learned in the past?

Speaker 2:          04:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:57          MMM. So we just had our customer conference and there were 20 new applications that our customers have developed. Everyone of those applications was interesting and something new that I learned and are sorry. Ah, okay. I was a Nerd, any rd nerd and I was proud of it. What resource do you use the most to learn about the latest breakthroughs? Uh, I mean the web. What's something that excites you about the future? Quantum computing. If you were to start from scratch today, what is a learning resource you would use alert.

Speaker 2:          05:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:43          Oh, I would go to leap the new cloud service from Dua of the new quantum application environment, which has all the training materials you need to learn about quantum computing. What's the bravest thing you've ever done? Wow. Uh, I don't really feel like I've done anything brave. What is the meaning of life?

Speaker 2:          06:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:04          Uh, you know what a family, uh, you know, just my wife, my kids family. Look, it's the last thing that frustrated you.

Speaker 2:          06:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:15          MMM. When we pushed an update to the leap service prior to lines and there was some changes in it that I wasn't made aware of it ahead of time. You've got frustrated me. Name one person you really admire. Um, my wife, what's the most beautiful thing in the world? My wife. What are the people you've met at Bonton conferences? Like,

Speaker 2:          06:46          okay.

Speaker 1:          06:47          It depends on the conference. Um, you know, sometimes their investors, uh, sometimes there are physicists and mathematicians. Sometimes there are hardcore engineers, sometimes it's developers. It depends on the conference. What's a music genre you're currently into? I mean for me it's the 60s in the 70s. Again, my age cause that we have to keep coming back to that. Oh No, no. In fact, that was the last question. Great. Awesome. Well thank you so much. My pleasure. It was great. It's a fun, fun thing.
