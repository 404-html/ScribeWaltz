Speaker 1:          00:00          Nobody really is in a position to guess how big a computer you need, or a bigger, faster computers and you need to do the highest levels of human thought. And I suspect it's rather small and that each bit of what a computer does probably needs thousands of neurons. And so most of the brain is because neurons are rather unreliable and noisy and flaky. We need a lot of them, but they're not computing very much.

Speaker 2:          00:30          Interesting. So, so, uh, Alpha go played this move, which I want to hear more about in a second, but, uh, Lee has left the room. He left the room after room after that move. Huh? I mean, I'm not even going to ask me. It's a very surprising, it's a surprising move. I wasn't expecting that.
