Speaker 1:          00:06          Hey Rachel, how's it going? Oh, hi sir. Do you mind if I can ask you 67 questions there? Cool. Do you miss your undergraduate years at Swarthmore? Yes. You got a phd in math from two. How was that experience? It was pretty miserable. What is something you miss about where you grew up? Um, my friends and family and delicious food. You need a PT to do machine learning research? Absolutely not. What excites you the most about machine learning? I just think all the real world problems that can solve. It's really powerful. What was it like working at the early days? It was, it was pretty chaotic. What was the funniest part about working at Uber?

Speaker 1:          00:53          I think it was, it was a once in a lifetime opportunity and it was a really interesting data set to have all the gps data. What website do you absolutely love to spend time on? I guess Twitter. I love hate. What country do you believe will contribute the most to ml and the next decade? Oh, that's a good question. Um, I think a lot of countries, well theory till what time do you wake up? I usually around 8:00 AM paper machine, morning paper of 2018 and I think Leslie Smith's one cycle. I like Tim. Nick got Bruce data sheets for datasets. You can be one person. Who would it be at the sane up to faculty. What do you do to relax? Like Yoga and playing with my daughter. What's it like three research and as a full time job it's a lot of fun. I really enjoy kind of like the creativity and flexibility. I have words we're trying to make deep learning, easier to use for people that don't, can't afford expensive computers. It might not have giant data, sad center kind of all around the world and from different backgrounds. What's your working dynamic life? I was really great. We're just kind of totally on the same page and have very similar values.

Speaker 1:          02:20          Um, I'm really proud of our courses and just our students' successes and kind of all that companies they've launched in the projects they've, they've completed or done and I think a finish finishing my phd and then in the face of kind of a lot of uncertainty and obstacles. Why are there so few women in machine learning? This is a big question. I think there's a lot of um, there's some toxicity in the field and a lot of related fields of math and computer science. What is one thing that scares me? I think our current political situation, we were moving at Clu us now I don't my daughter a yoga and playing with my daughter. What is something surprising about, um, like I said, I grew up in Texas. You prefer cats or dogs? Dogs. What's the machine learning model that doesn't take it up? Attention. Random forest.

Speaker 1:          03:35          That's my like computational linear Algebra class was a lot of fun. If you keep one experience again, what would it be? The month I spent in Japan. Why do you think deep learning has gotten so it's really, it's really useful. What is your favorite operating system? I don't have a strong preference. Most adventurous thing you've ever done. It said switching into tech and moving to San Francisco, getting rid of everything I owned when I didn't know anybody out here. One resource you use to stay up to date in machine learning? Twitter programming, language of choice for machine learning. Python. Favorite professor at j? Tell Baka and Cheryl grood from Swarthmore. It's math department. Why do you think programming is fun?

Speaker 1:          04:27          It's really fun to create things. It's neat to have the power to build stuff. What's the most amazing thing in the world? That's a huge question. I think friendship and family favorite. Comfort food, comfort food, maybe ginger, chicken and rice. What was your first program? The first program that I remember was we had to output how much interest you would pay on a credit card. Just like I'll put it to the terminal. You got an all expenses paid trip to one country where you go, I'd like to go to Malaysia. Would you live on Mars? I'm not sure I would visit. What is one thing you can't live without? Um, uh, high quality pillow. What is one skill you wish you had better negotiation skills. What text editor do you use them? What open source library. Do you really like? Pi Torch and the fast I library was a hard problem. You recently saw dealing with brain surgery. What's the meaning of life, I think to, to love the people around you and to try to have a positive impact. What is one piece of advice you'd give yourself 10 years ago? Um, it's okay. It's okay to be happy now. You spend more time on the internet or real life? Nike, be close. Maybe real life. What's something you've learned in the past month?

Speaker 2:          06:09          MMM.

Speaker 1:          06:13          Yeah. I've been learning a lot more about a ethical issues and kind of disinformation and propaganda. You like spicy food? Yes. What is a movie that made you cry? Big Hero six. If you ran the world, what is one law you that universal health care is the singularity near now. Who is one person you looked up to when you were in college? I looked up to David. Eddie has a health care, um, for evidence based healthcare proponent. If you were to start from scratch today, what is the learning resource you would use to learn machine learning? I may be biased, but a fast AI, practical, deep learning for coders. What is one goal you have in the next 10 years? I think really to kind of continue doing what I'm doing. Favorite subject in school, when you were growing up, math, if you could be a superhero, who would it be? Penny from inspector gadget. What's your spirit animal? Maybe a squirrel. What do you predict comes next after the deep learning hype, and I think the deep learning is going to keep going for a while. We still have so much potential to unlock their. Cool. Rachel, thanks so much for answering these questions. Oh, thank you. Who else you around.
