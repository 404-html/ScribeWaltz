Speaker 1:          00:00          That'd be good. It's the right ask you use your content creator car. The instructor I Dang, I love have you tried to eat natural cause he has a mission is by educating developers to build Ai. He's also a dad and an entrepreneur, founder of a crowd funding platform for developers called Harvey. Uh, he developed Ios apps and then has a host of open source work sites that you like to travel musician who was Morton and scuba diver. And then I was like tempted to say hello world. I think I'll need that again.

Speaker 2:          00:42          Welcome. All right.

Speaker 3:          00:47          Hi everybody. All right. Testing for eight, seven, six. That's the next code for Bitcoin. So buy it at that price. I'm just kidding. Okay. Uh, yeah, yeah. You know the, the end of that description was like this really old description that O'Reilly wrote when I wrote the book decentralized applications like four years ago, which at the time Havi was yes, a crowdsourcing platform that I helped create, but now it's deprecated it et cetera. You know how stuff moves in software. It's just like hearing God and like 30 seconds. But, uh, yeah, so this talk is called decentralized. Let me move out the way. Let me just get a feel for how this is going to work. Okay. Decentralize artificial intelligence. That's the name of this dog. It's really combining two technologies that are very hot today. Deep learning and blockchain. We know about these two technologies, right? Even if you're a data science, you studied blockchain at at some point it's articles. It's, it's hard not to, to look at this space with some, some level of interest. So we're going to talk about how to combine these two technologies together to make something beautiful. So I want to start with a quote by a very well known public figure, or shall we say the quote, is he alone? Who owns the youth games for the future? And this is by Adolf Hitler.

Speaker 3:          02:07          I just want you to think about this quote for a second. He alone, who owns the youth? The gains, the future. What did he mean by that? Clearly he knew what he was talking about. He was able to influence the youth to kill people by the hundreds of thousands. So I want to ask you guys this question. Who owns the youth? Single word answers is an open question. You can raise your hand once a youth. Yeah. Facebook. Okay. Really Smart Guy. Any other, any other, um, snapchat. Okay. You guys know what's up. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Um, yeah. Facebook, snapchat, those are, those are some possible answers. But let's, let's talk about what the, what the larger answer to this question is. Who owns the youth? Who owns the future?

Speaker 3:          03:02          So in the 80s, the web was created, et Cetera, et Cetera, or ride the worldwide web of, you know, we, we, we know that the web was created, but I remember going to, Sir sir, I was in Geneva, had to talk him at cern in Geneva and it was amazing. Like the data scientist, they're like, we were getting so technical, they knew exactly what was going on. Their questions were so beautifully orchestrated. They were challenging me. It was amazing. It was people, I mean, the amount of data that cern has is amazing. Like, anyway, that's a tangent. When I was at cern, I remember seeing Tim Berners Lee's office, the creator of http hypertext transfer protocol for the worldwide web. Arguably without that protocol, everything that we're doing, carousel, everything about the web wouldn't exist. And I remember seeing his office and just standing there for a second and being like, wow, this is where it all began.

Speaker 3:          03:49          And then I backed up for a second. There was just like, oh my God and all these kids are coming in. I was like, oh I bet I bet her backup. And these kids started coming in in mass and they were like, I dunno, eight to eight or 10 years old. It was like a school field trip. And they came in and they saw and then the teacher was like, or the guidance and this is where the world wide web was created. And the kids were like, oh my God. And they took a snapchat and immediately left. Like they didn't even like some of the kids just when they, one of them when the guide said that they just got and kept walking. So that's who wants a future snapchat, right? Cause it gets you snapchat.

Speaker 3:          04:24          That was web 1.0 this man is web 2.0 who knows who this guy is? Just shout it out. Jeff Bezos, who is the richest guy in the world right now. Jeff basis. Yeah. In 98 this was Jeff basis. He was selling books. That's all he wanted to do with amazon.com it was selling books in a very, very small office. His office was just a desk, right? And now Amazon is more powerful than Walmart. It's market cap is higher than Walmart. It's market cap is higher than any book seller in the world. Barnes and nobles, et Cetera. All of these global brands, Amazon eats them up literally. Quite literally. Amazon acquires them. So Jeff Bezos owns Amazon. He, so he's the largest shareholder in Amazon and Amazon is just one example. We've got snapchat, we've got Google, we've got Facebook. And these entities that we've created over time have been a result of entrepreneurs saying, how do we take web 1.0 and how do we capitalize off of it?

Speaker 3:          05:27          How do we create something where we can make money off of it, which is, it makes sense, right? This is a beautiful technology and the initial aims for the web were beautiful. They were very pure. Let's take this decentralized Internet that Tim Berners Lee helped create and let's create services on top of it, right? So let's, let's let me take the server. Right? And it started having, you know, all of these computers talk to each other, which was very hard to do at the time. Let me just make one central server, let me make, let me use this to http protocol to create this, get and sets transfer and store all of that data on the central server like that. Right? And it made it easy to do things like have an Amazon, have an Ebay, have a marketplace that was social network, have a ride sharing service.

Speaker 3:          06:09          All this stuff that we use today is because we were able to create these centralized services, it worked really well and there were no problems. In fact, it was a faster way to do things, right? It was a faster way. And it was a more efficient way. It just worked, but what's happened now is really bad. Objectively speaking, this is not my opinion. It is objective Lee, a bad fit, and this is not just coming from me. This is coming from the creators of the web. Tim Berners, Lee, Jerome Linear, the pioneers of the Internet don't like what has happened today, what the Internet has become.

Speaker 3:          06:46          How do we fix this? What does web 3.0 look like not web 1.0 or 2.0 not having centralized services but decentralized services. What the web, the original vision for the web was to have decentralized services in a good economy. We monetize more and more, but in a bad economy we monetize less than less. What is the most valuable resource we have today? Can anyone answer that question? What is the most valuable resource at any person has today? Yes? Another word for knowledge is data. Data. Exactly, but what are we doing with our data right now? We are giving it away for free in return for a free service. Right? That's, that's a part of the terms of use for all of these services. We use Facebook, Facebook's terms of service, snapchat, Internet service. You let us use your data. We can learn from your data.

Speaker 3:          07:37          We can profit off of your data. We can sell your data, and in return we'll let you use a service. That's fine, right? It works. But what's happened is this is shrinking the economy because all of that data is being concentrated in the central servers. He's connected courts that everybody has a connector, right? These are gateways for the wet. We need that data because as automation technology gets better and better as we learn to automate all of these things, the only agency, the only power you're going to have in this new world that we're very fast moving to is your data, but right now you're giving it away for free. So what value do you bring to the world when you don't own your data? Nothing. Zero. You have no value. If you give away your data, you have no value. So you need to own your data and profit from your data, right?

Speaker 3:          08:26          This is a kin to something like a basic income. When robotics and automation technology and AI and deep learning and machine learning, when all of that gets good enough in the next five to 10 years, probably everything will be automated. Everything. Everything that can be automated will be automated. I just made that up on the spot. You call it my loan. There's accountability as well. Okay, so accountability is we don't know what they're doing with our data. Right? First of all, we want to own our data. We want to profit off of our data. Right now we're giving it away for free and they're doing something with it that we don't even know what it is. They don't have to tell us. Right. They don't have to tell us what they're doing with the data. They could give it away to governments. They could use to spy on people.

Speaker 3:          09:03          I was having a conversation with a friend a few days ago. Okay. We were talking about something, a single topic later on on her phone in the ad it said, the topic that we were talking about, they are listening on our phones. They are listening in real time. Facebook is listening. Our phones, they're listening to us. They are using that data because there are no checks and balances. That's just, that's just what's happened. There are so powerful. They're all around us. The Internet of things is really a set of spy devices for these central authorities and last week we are trying to solve AI and I'm going to talk about that at the very, very end, but we're trying to solve AI and we need a way to do that and this is how we do that. All of these problems are shrinking economy, data, ownership, accountability and towards general intelligence. All events can be sold if we moved to web 3.0 so you guys wouldn't with me like we need to move to web 3.0 rights. This is the, this is the plan. How do we do this? So I'm going to tell you how to do this. Okay, I'm going to tell you how to do this. I'm going to show you right now. How did you, you ready? Okay. There we go. It all starts with something very, very simple.

Speaker 3:          10:17          The link list. Oh, here at saint the link list before. Awesome. Yeah. Okay, so the link list is a very, very simple data structure. I've got the code for it right here. Don't worry if you've never coded before, don't worry about it. It's only you know, 12 lines of code, 12 single lines in python. And what this does is it creates a data structure called a linked list. And a link list is just a very simple object that's linked to the next object that's linked to the next object that's linked to the next object. And it just goes on it. But as much as you want. And we can make one in python, we'll just say class node. This is a class, this thing, this square, and let's say, let's give it some functions. Get data. Okay. That's going to give us what's inside of here, which is if we could store it the word hello, get next, get the next note in the list.

Speaker 3:          11:07          Stack sent data. What do I want to put in this thing? Hello. A number on an image or video, whatever data and set next one's gonna be the the data and the next link to the next note in the link list. That's it is a simple data structure. This is going to help us move towards web 3.0 you might be thinking, wait a second. No, this has been around since the 80s how is this going to help me with anything? So let's take this link list. Let's, let's take this linguist and let store a copy of it on let's say a million computers. Let's just say, hey guys, I've got this link list. I want you to store a copy of it. And inside of this link list, we're not going to store the word Holo APP does nothing for us. What's instead store I transaction and not just one transaction, several transactions, in fact, millions of transactions between people payments.

Speaker 3:          12:01          Let's store that and let's try to make it so that no one can modify this linked list. No one can change the transactions in this link list. How do we do that? Okay. What if we had a separate system of people and all they did was they solved random mathematical problems with our computer, and this required a lot of computing power, like a lot. So much so that in order for you to be able to change any of the data in any of these nodes, you would have to have more than 50% of the computing power of all of those notes that are solving these random mathematical problems. Now, what if the amount of computing power in those notes was greater than the 500 fastest supercomputers in the world combined? Well then you would have to have more computing power and the 500 fastest supercomputers in the world combined to change this, the data in this link list. What that means is no one could change the data in this link list. So if we did that, we had a link list that everybody sorted a copy of that no one could change the data in.

Speaker 3:          13:10          We would call it a blockchain. And that's what the Bitcoin blockchain is. It's a glorified linked list. That's it. It's a glorified link list. And instead of calling them links or notes, we call them blocks. And the reason it's called a chain is because it's not just pointing to a random node with the word hello in it. It's pointing to a random node with transactions in it and the reason that the transactions are stored as his tree decision tree to be specific, we can call it a Merkle Dag as well. We don't have to talk about that is because that's just a more efficient way of storing and retrieving from it. But you can just think of it at an abstract level as just the list of transactions. And that's a blockchain. So this is a very new idea, right? This, this was you know, eight nine, 10 years ago when Satoshi invented this, this, this concept, it was the first time where we could say, I'm going to store my transactions in this data structure.

Speaker 3:          14:06          That's what the blockchain is. It's a data structure. I'm going to store my data and this thing and no one's going to be able to modify those transactions. That's why we use banks, right? There are only a few real banks in the world that we trust enough to store our money in our, you know, something very valuable because we trust that they're not gonna modify essentially the, the list of transactions in our account. They're not going to modify it. They're going to say, this is the amount you had before and this is the amount you have now. Trust us. Right? And that's it. We trust them. But what if we could store our money in a way that we didn't have to trust the bank so there's not a third party. This is the first time that we've ever been able to do that. The, in the advent of this data structure. Right. That's cool. Okay. Okay. We don't need a bank. Great. So what, what else could we store this thing besides transactions? We don't need a trusted third party to store our transactions. We don't need to trust a third party to store our data. We don't need to trust a third party to store our code. What about our web apps? What about our apps like snapchat and Facebook and Google? What if we could store code in this thing, not just transactions.

Speaker 3:          15:18          And that is what the theory is. Blockchain is they took bitcoin's blockchain, the added a bunch of other data like logs, difficulty, timestamps, mixes. But really what matters is this, the code, you don't just the store transactions in the ethereum blockchain, you store code. What that means is every computer, every note, remember it's a glorified link clicks. Every node in the network is storing coat instead of pushing code to a single server like Heroku, right? That's how we usually build web apps. We store it on a single node that everybody has to agree upon. So in order to modify that code, you would have to have more computing power than the 500 fastest supercomputers in the world combined. So this is a trustless way to build web apps and that's how we're going to get to web 3.0 so what does code on a theory I'm look like?

Speaker 2:          16:18          Go back

Speaker 3:          16:19          this, this 17 line of code snippet is what you would call an initial coin offering. 17 lines of code is responsible for raising more money. And the past two years that I've been raised by every IPO in the past 10 we're talking about more than a hundred billion US dollars worth of, of investments from the public, the public, every ICO that you're seeing these days is a result of this. Someone takes this as a variable that says how many, you know, shares or coins or tokens do I want and how much do I want to sell those tokens for? They take this code and they push it to the ethereum blockchain via a push command in terminal or they can do it via a web app and then they have this public address, you know, 25 characters or core more and they say, here's the address, ICO time invest. And then people just, you know, 30 million in a single day.

Speaker 3:          17:16          This is kind of stuff happens. This is very powerful and no one controls this, right? This is the advent of a new structure, similar to a corporation, a new type of institution that no one, no one controls. And we can do this with the ethereum blockchain because we don't have to trust a third party, not just a bank, but even the government legal documents, things like that. We can build these with smart contracts things every, every time. We'd had to require to trust the third party. We can remove that and push that instead in the form of contracts to the ethereum blockchain.

Speaker 2:          17:50          There's a problem though, so

Speaker 3:          17:53          if you think about, okay, well I'm going to make a web app and it's going to, it's going to pull from the weather.com Api and it's just going to tell you the weather. That's it. Okay, so it's called my weather app, decentralized.com and all of this places a single text. The weather today in Singapore, and it pulls that data from weather.com is Api with the parameter of Singapore. Now it returns the result and a displays that, right, whatever degrees Celsius. If we were to do that on the ethereum blockchain, it wouldn't work. Why? Because every single node in the network has to pull back that data at the same time, right? Because they're all executing that code at the same time. But what the weather changes over time, right? So they would all have to agree upon the time. How do you do that? You can't, right?

Speaker 3:          18:42          So the solution to this is to have what's called an oracle and the oracle is a trusted third party source that speaks to the web that the ethereum blockchain can pull from. So you might be thinking, wait a second, okay, I thought this was trustless. What does, what does it deal with this oracle thing? There are networks of Oracle's out there, you know, delegations four or five of them and they can all agree, a crew agree on, they can have consensus on some data, but this is a solution to pulling data from the, from the web 2.0 in the, in the form of API APIs until we have a better solution. But that's how it works right now.

Speaker 3:          19:21          So you might be thinking, okay, we can have our application level constructs on the ethereum blockchain, we can pull data in the form of oracles from the web. But then how do we store like huge databases onto the blockchain? Could we do that? I mean you could technically, but then every minor, everyone who's downloading a copy of this blockchain within have to store all of that data on their personal computer. Facebook has a lot of data. If we were in a decentralized Facebook and say this is the authority on version of Facebook, everybody would have to store a copy of Facebook that's just infeasible. So what we need, it's not just a, an application level construct that says, here are usernames here, your tweets here, you know, et cetera. We needed to point to some kind of decentralized data store, a storage for data that is not owned by anyone.

Speaker 3:          20:11          Now, the best solution for this that I've found is called the interplanetary file system. So high PFS is big. There's a, there's a lot to go into about IPFS. Um, it's, it's, it's, it's a beautiful system the way it works, but essentially it's a group of computers that all agree on some data. So if I want to push some data to Google cloud or AWS right now, right? The services owned that data, right? So I would say, you know, I've got some huge video, let me push it to Google cloud or AWS, and they would store it. How do we be centralized that with IPFS, it's a network of computers who are saying, I'm an IPFS snowed, right? When you pushed that video to IPFS, they not everybody's stores a copy of that video. One person will for our copy, that video will be split up into several parts and replicated across the network. So then you might be thinking, well, what if someone deletes their node? Well, there's already replications everywhere. How are these nodes incentivized? Well, there's this idea of file coin where these nodes or pay to store this data. So it's how to incentivize these notes. So that's kind of our complete list of solutions for this web 3.0 we can have a data store called IPFS. We can have etherium to store code and application level constructs and Oracle's to pull data from the web. This is, this is how web 3.0 works. This is the new stack.

Speaker 3:          21:41          So this is how it works, right? If you're a young references content, big data that's stored on IPFS, it gets that static content. That distributed application gets that content from IPFS and it gets the global state or theory. It's, it's a global state machine, so if we combine IPFS and Ethereum, we can build these distributed decentralized applications. Right, but what's a talk? What is, what is really a talk without talking about deep learning, right? Deep learning is where it's at. We've got this thing called a neuron in our brain theirselves. Billions of these cells in our brain and they make us intelligence. They give us consciousness and love and emotion, all these things. We feel it because of this thing. It's a collection of them. I don't know how they work. You go to do you either. There's nobody needs is the most renowned neuroscientists in the world.

Speaker 3:          22:32          No one knows how this thing works, but in the 50s some guy was like, I mean I get the basic idea. There is some data that's being fed into this thing. Something's happening here and then it sends it out and then very roughly, very, very roughly. He created a mathematical model for this thing. He says, he said, we have these inputs. Let me just take this, these inputs, these are a set of numbers. Let me apply some kind of summation to this. And then some kind of nonlinear entity as in, um, let me take this data and make sure that it, it can learn a function that can learn any type of function, both the linear and a nonlinear function that means any type of function. And then I'll put a result, right? So it takes some data, it does something to it. And then it outputs that data.

Speaker 3:          23:22          And what happens here has been the topic of debate amongst many researchers, like what do we do to it? But the, but the, but the idea is the same as when we take some input data, apply some kind of function to it, and then we have an output and then we change these things together. So we got, we have a lot of [inaudible]. And what happened is the deep learning revolution, right? All of these things that humans are good at. Image recognition, uh, driving cars, et Cetera, all these things. For some reason, this model that resembles the human brain works well, sometimes even better than we do. So this is kind of, this is mind boggling, right? On silicon, these chips, we roughly estimated the, the rules that are happening here and it's doing something that even humans can't even do. Could there be some universal law of intelligence out there that we're just slowly approximating, that we're just slowly coming close to probably. And this is our first step there. Deep Learning, incredible technology.

Speaker 3:          24:19          Okay, so how do we combine all three of these things? How do we combine IPFS if theory in department? Well, there's one really great example that I know of called the open mind that a friend of mine has built with his community. But the idea is this. If I'm a data scientist and you have some data, if I want to train my deep learning model on your data, how do I do that in a way that involves no third party where you don't have to trust me that I'm going to look at your data. Say it's very sensitive, like patient data, like for hospital records. How do I train my model to learn from your data? So I can make predictions about say cancer or some other disease without looking at your personal information. So this is a perfect example of how you can put these three technologies together. You can have IPFS store that data. You can have a theory, build an application level construct for smart contracts so that the data doesn't have to be stored on a central server. And you could use deep learning to learn from that data. So if you want to know how all three of these can work together and look up open minds, the website is open mind dot. Uh, but it's, uh, it's a, it's a great example of how to combine all these three, these three things together.

Speaker 2:          25:30          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          25:32          So where does this lead us? Eventually? This is a, this is a graph of emergent, higher level complexity, simple AI agents that are answered, but complex warm behavior emerges. Right now we have AI and they live on servers. They live in our phones, they live on laptops, but if we could free these AI's from the confines of servers and let and let them live in a decentralized space, they could speak to each other, they could learn from each other, and perhaps the real solution to higher level intelligence is to let that complexity emerge rather than trying to coat it in. Why don't we just let it emerge, right? We don't know how consciousness works, but we have this basic rough idea of how it works. What if we just need to give it enough complexity and what that real intelligence emerge, we just can't even understand it. That is very likely the case. And if we use blockchains and we use it theory, I'm, when we use IPFS and all of these decentralized technologies we can create real artificial intelligence is that are as smart if not hundred thousand times smarter than all of us. Lastly,

Speaker 3:          26:38          you might be thinking, why would we want to do that? Why do I care about that? Right? Water crisis sees the spread of infectious diseases, weapons of mass destruction, North Korea, Donald from interstate conflict, failure of climate change, adaption, energy, price shock, fiscal crisis is unemployment. Biodiversity, Watson ecosystem collapse would say, well, it's too late for us to solve climate change. It's too late. No matter what we do, we're not going to solve it. We are. We are headed for destruction. We are headed for complete Libyan. There is nothing we can do. We're screwed. I don't think so because those people don't know about the power of Ai, right? If we solve Ai, let's just say we solve it, we create an intelligence that's as smart, if not smarter than all of us. We can give it an objective, a goal, a function, and that objective could be solve climate change.

Speaker 3:          27:32          It would look at data in a way no human ever could in a way that 10,000 plus scientists put together in a room for a hundred years couldn't solve. It could fall all of these things immediately. It could move us towards this utopia that we didn't think even possible before. If we do it the right way and if all of us together are thinking about ways to do this, we all have to be thinking about how these technologies work together. If you even barely understand how this technology works, it is your responsibility to do something about it because there are millions of people across the world. We don't even have food and water rights efficient [inaudible] in Maslow's hierarchy of these, they don't have any of these things. How can they come to these kinds of insights? They cant everybody in this room. It's your responsibility to do, to, to work on this, to, to help make this happen. How do you do that? You, you learned from the Internet. You use this new inner university that we have is collective university to teach yourself to educate yourself on how these technologies work and how you can best influence the problems in our world using these technologies. So I want to leave you with a single remark, solve AI or die trying. That's my motto. That's what I live by and if you want to learn more, there's my youtube channel. Subscribe. Thank you very much.

Speaker 1:          28:54          Okay. Yes. Uh, we have in this community, so anybody have any questions? Okay. The example that you follow, right? That we can have, it became a peculiar dot back to fund that the Algorithm be why not the act? The thing that I can be a little holiday [inaudible] yeah. Security is definitely an issue we have to solve when it comes to decentralized applications. One of the reasons that we centralized stuff was because one person could just secure everything, right? It's much more secure to have data on a central server. So to is one

Speaker 3:          29:42          really, really great area to focus on if you're looking on something to work on as one of those looping fields. There was so much a startup could do their distributed security, the centralized security in terms of a solution right now for security in general for decentralized applications, uh, one thing could be better ways of storing data that's involved replication. So replication is one example, right? A lot of times data is just lost and IPFS or something like it's just lost because there's not enough replication. So looking at different ways, different algorithm for replicating data that our edition, that would be a great way to solve security that could have taught the update. They do know ain't nobody can modify it, but if you want to provide that, they would be on me that they were due by Dave or David. But if I want to pick your of the lead actor that twill or other eye maybe gated or that day, that cannot really act as the medium ones any for why are we have, we definitely have to build an extra security layer layer on top of it, like their, their ideas within these communities for ipms sanitarium for security layers.

Speaker 3:          30:58          But we would need a different protocol and entire loan. Like one of these issues, one of the ways that this springs up his identity, right? We don't know who you are. We don't know how to authenticate you identity protocols as a layer on top of these data and application level protocols. That would be something that's very necessary. People have tried this. Microsoft even tried this with one ID. It didn't work, but the problem was they weren't thinking about it the right way. So you've got to think about it from a decentralized way. How do I make, how do we make an identity protocol that can speak to these other protocols, it seamlessly. And there's this idea of cross chain transfers, atomic swaps from the bitcoin community. Um, I think that would be a good place to look for inspiration.

Speaker 3:          31:45          Uh, hi. I was wondering, will let us do with skating full, uh, the full homomorphic encryption because if I'm not mistaken, it's lush. And I'll tell that deep learning, the deep learning models tends to view computational halts. Yeah. Yeah. So, okay, so two questions there. One, uh, how do we scale homomorphic encryption? And two, how do we solve the problem of deep learning, being very computationally expensive that together just the mold and stuff. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. You know what it is. So, uh, so there's this idea of one shot learning where we learned from one or two examples. Like if we look at how humans learn, you give me your, give me an image of something that I've never seen before and in two or three examples I'll be able to classify it. Whereas with deep learning, it requires hundreds of thousands if not millions of images.

Speaker 3:          32:40          This is a problem. This is not even close to how we learn. I think the best example of a very data efficient, deep learning algorithm is it actually came out of Facebook and he was called the memory augmented neural network. So right now we intertwine the processor with the memory in the neural network. That's the weight values, right? Those matrix wait values. But what if we could separate that memory into a separate module and it can say, here's the memory module. It's just a glorified matrix. And then we have the wait values. Well what happened when they train this thing was it was able to recognize handwritten digits with only 15 examples. This was like two years ago. And then that, that project didn't get that much attention. It should have because that was amazing. I would say, uh, look at that, that project as an example, Facebook, Ai Research Omnia Blot Dataset, it's going to be the first link on Google, but more efficient people, any models is another open field of research.

Speaker 1:          33:41          Okay. What was willing to drink. So it was us to the changes in those of a different perspective. So currently for example, using some of the typical Asian functions which met them at ease. If you are, you know, like see more more. So these guys, any mathematical evolution such that, you know, future perhaps it could be one just as you do really get, there'll be a shift in terms of how we will get a new roof space. And then the second questions, I'm just curious as to, um, you know, I, these days they have robots that can jog and he truly like the tone we need. The, so in terms of cyber security, I'm not sure how well it is, but what if one day it happens to be at the hands of maybe someone who was extra monies or terrorists see what example where we all we do because the weapons, everything can be don't come to, and this school was just go, you know, is my goal blogging two years, some of the robots, uh, talking about, um, humans in a very negative way.

Speaker 1:          35:20          If we see some like the one that has, I can't remember her name, the lady who has these others. Yeah. Yeah. So there was something negative about the regime, things about human. So I mean, what if one day robots like this and they learn how to manufacture the mass wrapping of destruction or whichever way that they can behave by terminates, for example. I don't know, how would it be if you come off? You know, these are good questions. Good questions. The first question about different ways of looking at ads and neural network in the future

Speaker 3:          36:00          model that we have right now, this is one of the most exciting areas of research and all of computer science right now. How do we evolve the neural network architecture? There's this idea of, well, let me just act more more layers. Let me change the weights. Let me add a new type of layer, right? And these are, these are okay, this works. But what if we change the entire hardware? What if we said, instead of running it on silicon, let's run it on a quantum processor? What happens then? There's the, there's a brand new use, quantum processing. We don't know. There's this idea in neuroscience of quantum nano tubules, that that's the seat of consciousness that actually lives in multiple dimensions. Who knows? But there's a lot of great research in hardware as well. So if you want to look at really, really, really different radical breakthroughs and neural networks, I would actually look at the hardware, the hardware level, not the algorithmic level.

Speaker 3:          36:47          Onto your second question about Terminator Ai. So, uh, some people say that the Bitcoin blockchain is, uh, some, some people will say that bitcoin is one of those systems where you can sell drugs easily and you can, but it's one of those systems that is very untraceable, right? This is not true. Bitcoin is the most traceable system in the world. Key examples, Silk Road, right? The founder of Silk Road, every single transaction is stored in a public way that everyone can, can view, right? They can view it, they can validate it, they can see exactly the trail of transactions. Now, what happened? What happens if we take these transactions and instead we abstract them to two actions in a network. This person likes this tweet. This person did this with this money, this person launched this nuke, right? If we put everything onto this public ledger that everyone can view, that's a way to democratize, read access to actions by everyone. So if there was some kind of governments ride, for example, probably the Singaporean government, we would do something like this cause they're awesome.

Speaker 3:          37:52          Where are they said, let me just make everything public and viewable by people right? Then every politician would have to record all their transactions on a blockchain, right? There would be no more, uh, there were, there would be much less corruption. There would be much less. Right. Because this thing, this would, this would be validated by everybody when it comes to nuclear weapons, weapons of mass destruction. If we are able to create these systems in a way that everyone can verify, there's more transparency, there would be less likely of a risk like that. Right. Because these people would have to be held accountable and that's really where this whole blockchain stuff plays in. It's all about accountability.

Speaker 1:          38:33          Okay. Do you do that with all the work be done on that group of stake in blockchain 2.0 there may be a better technology than in theory coming?

Speaker 3:          38:49          Yeah, I do. I do. I do. There are some promising blockchains out there. I think one is, one is car Dano, right. Um, Charles Hoskinson was one of the former founders of etherium and uh, he's work he's been working on with that, with, with a really great team. They're working on KYC compliance as a way to merge that with the existing financial infrastructure is great. I think the idea is that they have our grades and yes, there could be something better than proof of work for sure. I mean, proof of work is one of those really computationally expensive processes that wastes a lot of electricity across the world that we could put that could be put to better use. Why have these computers off random mathematical problems? Why not instead have them solve protein folding or some prompts, some, you know, real problem that matters. So yes, there's a lot of potential right now. However, in terms of building something that affects the population, that affects consciousness, that affects culture. If theory mean, you know, bitcoin, these are ways of doing that very fast and then we can update those systems later on.

Speaker 1:          40:02          We being possible right now, he sold me on the Games chess. You think you would have more practical problems like four times the other pacifier one is half deck. You was on pain in the real world other than yes. Yeah, right.

Speaker 3:          40:27          I do. Well, the idea behind reinforcement, so reinforcement learning has been around since the 60s it's not new. All of those concepts that Alphago used last year, Alphago was a beat. The best go player in the world will refresh her and which was a huge deal because AI experts predicted that it would take 10 20 years for that to happen. We did it in a decade less. All of the components of Alphago, Monte Carlo tree search, right, value networks, policy networks, neural networks, these all had all been around for decades. What was the different steps? Well, they just synthesize some ideas that hadn't been put together and fed it more computing power than we'd ever been able to get it before. And then it gave us this result. No one thought possible. So the real breakthrough there was just giving you a computing power. There was no difference in terms of the algorithms, just a synthesis of old ideas into one bigger new idea, which is how most of research works to be real.

Speaker 3:          41:21          But do I think that we could do better? For sure, for sure. I don't see why we aren't thinking of new ideas for reinforcement learning. Right? There's so much we could do in terms of search strategies for reinforcement learning. There's so much we could do when we combine deep learning and reinforcement learning together. Games have been a test bed for AI because if we can generalize to different games, maybe we could generalize to task step matter. That's why these big institutions that have been focused on games, what they're really trying to do is apply it to real world applications. Some examples would be a cooling data centers. That's what Google did with the same reinforcement learning algorithm they use on a game. They used to reduce the F or increase the efficiency of cooling their data centers, but I think it was 40 or 50% which is huge.

Speaker 3:          42:06          That's one example and that's just because Google did it. Guess what? Google open source that out rhythm. If we look on get hub and we see these reinforcement learning algorithms, we ourselves can take them and apply them to some use case, right? All these researchers at the top institutions are working on games because they're trying to improve the generalization ability. We can, uh, use it to solve problems today, right? So we can take those algorithms, we can use it to solve real problems. Some avenues like maybe three that I can think of for reinforcement learning specifically would be, for example, traffic control. Uh, that's a, that's a reinforcement learning problem, right? Reward, uh, using an agent to taking a reward and then cycling that back into the system. Another one would be, um, increasing the efficiency of bandwidth between applications, like peer to peer applications. That's another one for reinforcement learning. And a third one can just making these up as I go. A third one would probably be, uh, you know how Google did this with the data center. We can do that with just lights in general, right? Energy efficiency. That would be another one for reinforcement learning. All these ideas were, we were talking about some event, some timeline, right? What we are trying to increase the efficiency of something that's happening over time. That's the reinforcement learning problem, right? Because it's interacting with a new environment. It's not an input, output, static data set. It's a dynamic environment. So think about an environment, thinking about time, think about sequences and apply reinforcement learning there.

Speaker 3:          43:35          Yeah, the big one. Last one.

Speaker 1:          43:37          Yes. Well you mentioned any about how you get head individual simple on blockchain and I'll call [inaudible] and that's the next step. What have you don't like the emerging, can't control this one. You didn't write like entered the column individually. You know what you do, but you don't know how to behave in the system. So what then? That's a great question. So I met someone,

Speaker 3:          44:08          work on the ethics team. I did mine and she was telling me that she was kind of going through this game with me. Or if she was saying, oh, why should we release this course card? Why should we do this? Why should we do this? But the conclusion that she made me come up come up with, which is what the conclusion is. He had already come to the thought process was that deep mind wanting to be the first to come up with the real intelligence. They wanted to be the first to AI because they knew that they themselves would be benevolent with it. They didn't trust that other people would. So that's why they didn't open source it at the time. However, that's not good for us, right? Because if someone at deep mind is not benevolent for whatever reason, they could use that AI for evil by whatever your means of evil.

Speaker 3:          44:48          It's how do we prevent that? The best way to prevent any kind of malpractice, any kind of malintent. It's a democratizes technology to give it to as many people as possible. There's a famous quote by, um, this English playwrights, Lord acton also by Elon Musk, but the quote is the best way, and I'm paraphrasing, the best way to prevent the rise of a desperate, someone who is a, on how all powerful dictator is to democratize access to power. If the easiest way is to centralize that power. So if we decentralize this power to AI, to blockchain, to all this technology to data specifically, then we can better increase the probability or likelihood that we reach a good state in the future. Is there a possibility that someone who is a bad actor will use this technology? For sure. I mean, life is full of existential risks, right? But doing this, democratizing these, these technologies further increases the probability that that won't happen because we'll come up with some sort of security system or fail safe or check system that would prevent that from happening. Maybe there's a decentralize AI that goes rogue. Well, there might be a decentralized security system that prevents that, that someone created beforehand.

Speaker 3:          45:59          We just all have to be thinking about these things. It's good. It's a good dog.

Speaker 1:          46:05          That's all. Yeah. I'm always very fearful. Those beavers that shed at times for three, this time around, she knocks was coming here. If any intention, let's put our heads together. Thanks Lucas. Okay. Be here a while for networking and stuff like that. So thank you very much with them.
