Speaker 1:          00:01          Hey Joe, what's up? Hey, how are you doing sir? Pretty good. How are you doing all right. Are you down to answer a couple of questions? You want to walk the talk? Yeah, let's do it. Cool. What project are you currently working on? Working on image compression using neural nets. Why do you think deep learning has gotten so popular recently? Other than it obviously doing really well in a lot of problems. I think it also gives people with a technical skill set a chance to think about like big questions, like consciousness or things like that. Hey Joe, what's your favorite operating [inaudible] favorite thing about working at Google? Um, I would say all the smart people and it's pretty flexible. How would you describe your experience at Princeton? A hard and formative. If you could spend an evening with one famous person, who would it be? I feel like John Stewart would be hilarious to hang out with.

Speaker 1:          00:51          Do you play any sports? Uh, I used to do a lot of rock climbing, but not so much since I moved to the bay area. What time do you go to sleep at night? What's your favorite car? My motorcycle Honda to 50 CVR. What machine learning model would you never use? That is a trick question. I would use any model that gets the job done. Programming language of choice for machine learning. Tensor flow. So c plus plus and python. Favorite professor, Robert Chaperia, name one person you really admire? Uh, I would say any of my friends who moved to a foreign country without speaking the language. How are you liking the bay area? I love it. Favorite place I've lived by far. What drives you to do research? I think it's in that golden sweet spot for me of hard enough so that I feel like I'm growing but not so hard that I cried myself to sleep every night.

Speaker 1:          01:36          Was there ever a class in college you really didn't like? Um, I would say, uh, yeah. I'm not sure. What's the most beautiful thing in the world? Uh, your smile of course. Ash. Uh, what's your favorite exercise? I've been working on the clean and jerk these days. Favorite food? Who? Dawn. Definitely. Do you miss the east coast? Not, not really at all. What website do you waste time on? I like the only person I know that doesn't, I don't really waste that much time on websites. I think the last person you emailed, uh, I just emailed my team about setting up a reading group. You get an all expenses paid trip to one city. Where do you go? I really want to go to one of the mega cities in Brazil. That would be great. Would you visit Mars? Uh, yeah, if they have wifi. What is one thing you can't live without? I guess I just learned it's Wifi. What is the first thing you do when you wake up? Hit the snooze button. What texts editor do you use? Uh, I wish I could say something like them or Emacs, but I uh, am using a Google internal tool. What open source library do you really like? I, again, I'm kind of biased, but I would probably have to say tensorflow. What's one of your favorite movies?

Speaker 1:          02:48          The Matrix. I don't watch that many movies. What did something you do to come up with research ideas? I love talking to anybody and everybody that will listen to me. Ah, that's been pretty good for me. What inspired you to get into machine learning? It kinda just happened I think, uh, I moved out here and I guess a lot of the problems that were in machine learning, some really interesting to me. What was the first program you ever made? Probably either hello world or one of those like four loop things that a certain number of asterix. What is one book you really like? I really like Perdido street station. What is one thing you are afraid of? Um, not having a positive impact, I guess. What is a big misconception about you? I think I simulate an extrovert pretty well, but I'm actually pretty introverted. What is one thing that excites you?

Speaker 1:          03:38          Um, I really, really love to travel and meet New People. That's advice you've ever received? Uh, it wasn't directly like this, but it was something like, even if somebody looks like they have their shit together on the outside, they probably have a lot of stuff going on that you don't necessarily see. What's the bravest thing you've ever done? Probably moved to California without having a job. What is one piece of advice you'd give yourself 10 years ago? Uh, take care of yourself better. If you were a rapper, which rapper would you be? Probably Snoop Dogg because of the physical resemblance. Do you have any pets? Um, I used to live with a dog, but sadly I don't anymore. What's something you've learned in the past month? Um, I just learned something about generative adversarial networks. What is a topic and machine learning you like to explore more?

Speaker 1:          04:33          I really like to get into sequence to sequence modeling a bit more. Do you think will solve intelligence in your lifetime? I don't think so actually. So anytime somebody says it's something can't be done, they're usually wrong. But if somebody says that it's going to take a certain amount of time, usually it's like 10 x that if you are in the world, what is one law unit? Uh, I don't know. NAP time for everybody. What is something you do to relax? I read a lot of fiction. I exercise and a wash Rukh Khan videos. What is the risk that comes from deep learning? I would say, uh, maybe forgetting about all of the kinds of machine learning that came before that, uh, aren't necessarily related to deep learning nowadays. People want to just throw your own that stuff and that's not always the right answer. Who is one person you looked up to when you were in college?

Speaker 1:          05:15          Ooh, I'm not sure. What were you like as a kid in grade school? I think I was kind of a jerk. What deep learning library do you use the most? Uh, not, not unbiased here, but probably tensorflow. Andrew on one said machine learning is like the new electricity. Agree. Yeah, I think that that sounds pretty good. Uh, it's just, it's amazing the way people are able to use machine learning to do a large number of different things. If you were to start from scratch today, what is one learning resource you would use to learn machine learning? If you're not afraid of doing math and maybe Kevin Murphy's textbook, uh, what is it a machine learning, a probabilistic approach? If not, again, I'm probably pretty biased, but I think the tutorials on the tensorflow website are pretty good. What is one major unsolved research problem you'd love to tackle?

Speaker 1:          05:57          I really want to figure out like a generally better way of sampling the data during training. Then uniformly random. What is the most surprising result you've ever gotten from your research? So my team published a paper a while ago on our image compression work and it's pretty amazing that we're able to basically compete with state of the art without doing anything like entropy coding or a variable bit rate per patch. What's more interesting? The brain or the universe? Definitely the brand. If you could be an x men character, who would it be? A wolverine so I could get the cool like facial hair. What's your spirit animal? A squirrel does p equal NP. I don't have very strong feelings on the matter. I'll leave it to the suits and Washington to decide. Would you ever go to burning man? I have gone to burning man snapchat or Facebook, Facebook, android or iPhone right now. Android could go either way or go. I use Google way more than I use duck, duck go Linux distro of a two. All right, Joel, that's different. My 67 questions. Thanks so much for answering those. Absolutely. It's a pleasure. All right. Have a good one. See you around.
