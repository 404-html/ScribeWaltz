Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey Peter, how's it going? Hey sarge, how are you doing? Pretty good. Can I ask you 67 questions? You sure. What is the culture like at UC Berkeley?

Speaker 2:          00:09          Very supportive. Uh, hardworking but fun culture. Will online learning replaced physical learning? Well, um, I think it started to shift a lot in that direction, but I personally, the real luck to meet the people I'm learning from.

Speaker 1:          00:23          What is something you miss about where you grew up? Um, I'd say the food. The food? Yeah. What time do you wake up? Um, it 20. What website do you absolutely love to spend time on? Um, let's see. I try to avoid spending too much time on any websites. Machine learning paper of 2017. Um, I'm going to pass on that. It seems too, too, too picky to meet one person. Who would it be? Okay. I need one person. Who could it be? Um, Roger Federer. Favorite car? Uh, I prefer my bike. What's it like working with physical robots?

Speaker 2:          01:12          It's been really surprising how people connect so strongly when they see physical robots do things. I never anticipated this. When bringing people buy for the first time in the lab,

Speaker 1:          01:22          bravest thing you've ever done? I'm not the one to take a lot of risks. I would say. What is one thing that scares you? Um, I like to take good care of my health, I guess. Favorite movie, Shawshank redemption. Do you play any instruments? No. What's more interesting? Physics or neuroscience

Speaker 2:          01:47          call. But uh, I'm at, I've been more inclined to study physics so far.

Speaker 1:          01:51          Best present you've ever received. What is something you do to relax?

Speaker 2:          02:04          A lot of physical exercise, running tennis, basketball, cycling.

Speaker 1:          02:09          What is something surprising about you

Speaker 2:          02:17          beat that? Uh, back in high school, my, uh, well my goal was, was tried to become a professional basketball player rather than a researcher.

Speaker 1:          02:25          You prefer cats or dogs?

Speaker 2:          02:28          I prefer a no pets in my house.

Speaker 1:          02:32          Why do you like reinforcement learning specifically? So much

Speaker 2:          02:37          beauty of reinforcement learning is that it kind of gets to what is kind of close to what you think about when you build a real intelligence system. It's something that has, tries to achieve goals, try to learn things about the environments. Never done before. And I find that very intriguing.

Speaker 1:          02:51          Favorite project you used to work on? I would say Stanford helicopter project as a phd student and I

Speaker 2:          02:59          think a live, it was the big pants we went through to get to the results, um, which made it yet more rewarding too to get to them. What project are you currently working on? A lot of our work is, so there's a few things going on at Berkeley. A lot of the work is on reinforcement learning, imitation, learning metal learning. I'd embodied intelligence with trying to put this into practice and get real robots in the real world to do these things. And then I have great scope. We're trying to do it now. Ai for grading automatically grade your homework and exams are largely automatically grade them to uh, let teachers spend time on other things.

Speaker 1:          03:34          If you could repeat one experience again, what would it be? Speed one experience again. What would it be? I'll pass on that for now. Why do you think deep learning has gotten so popular recently?

Speaker 2:          03:52          I think it's, it's getting really good results on problems that people just weren't able to get the same results on. Think computer vision, speech recognition, learning to peer that play video games, learning to control robots, prompts. I seemed out of reach for a very long time and now there's a real tangible progress. What's your favorite operating

Speaker 1:          04:10          system? Macro s for me. Do you play any sports? Um, they'll play it. I tried to

Speaker 2:          04:19          play a lot of sports. My favorite ones are tennis, basketball and a running. What one source you use to stay up to date in machine learning? Um, definitely archive is uh, critical. Uh, and then newsfeeds, like her party's archive, sanity preserver. And also on Twitter. I follow a lot of people that poster papers on Twitter. What's one? And they'll research or you fall in Twitter? Just a random one. Jeff Dean programming. Language of choice for machine. I should admit that as a professor I don't write a lot of code. Um, so it's mostly my students who, who write the code. So I don't really have a preference here. Favorite professor? Harris professor? No, I'll go with my phd advisor. Android. Why do you think programming is fun? You think programming is fun because in a very short amount of time you can do very powerful things compared to any other engineering discipline where typically it takes days, weeks, months to build something and programming. You can build something in an hour that actually does something.

Speaker 1:          05:25          Last person you talked to on the phone? I'm not sure. Yeah. You get an all expenses paid trip to one country. Where do you go? Australia. Would you live on Mars? It depends on who comes along with me. What's one thing you can't live without? Exercise. What is one skill you wished you had?

Speaker 2:          05:58          Have time to polish more programming skills which have not finding time for anymore. What is the law? What is usually the last thing you do before bed? I do a few dedicated stretches and breathing exercises that get me into sleeping mode. What texts editor do you use? I use sublime. Sublime. What open source library do you really like?

Speaker 1:          06:26          Okay.

Speaker 2:          06:27          Personally, don't use them myself, but I know my group benefits a lot from tensorflow and Pi Torch. What was a hard problem your team recently solved?

Speaker 1:          06:37          MMM,

Speaker 2:          06:41          super. Recently. Those results are not public yet, but there'll be a couple of papers coming out that it will be, I'm very excited about of things that are already public. I would say the one shot visual limitation where work led by Chelsea Finn where we're able to learn from videos of humans showing how to do something rather than from tell operating robots and the robot can learn from that. What's the goal for embodied.ai? Our goal is our longterm goal is essentially make physical goods as readily available and as cheaply available as digital goods by making manufacturing and logistics extremely, extremely streamlined, best advice you've ever received.

Speaker 1:          07:24          Um, let's see.

Speaker 2:          07:33          Maybe I wouldn't say explicit advice, but I think maybe what our hold the closest to my heart as a, what I've seen from being Andrex phd students is, um, how kindness is always in everything he's doing and how, you know, that is just a really important value and no matter, you know, what you're trying to achieve. What's one piece of advice you'd give yourself 20 years ago?

Speaker 1:          07:57          Um, that's all

Speaker 2:          08:04          pretty happy with how things have gone. I don't think I would give myself any other advice and that I think not, I'm not saying I went down the shortest path and everything, but I think sometimes going down a path that ends and having to restart is not about thing you spend more time on the internet is or real life. I spend most of my time I'm behind the computer, uh, and as a way to essentially communicate about research with my collaborators. What's something you've learned in the past month?

Speaker 1:          08:39          MMM, I would

Speaker 2:          08:42          say what I've heard in the last month is that I have not found any time to read any papers in. I need to change that. If you ran the world, what is one light you didn't enact immediately? If it worked? The rule the world? Is that what you said? Wow. What a hypothetical. Um, I think it's really complicated too to put things in place. But I think, you know, if just in general people, if we could somehow find a way for people to be more kind of just generally kind and everything they do, I think a lot of problems would be resolved in the singularity near not sure what's near, but uh, I guess given we started embodied intelligence, we think there is still, you know, a lot to be done with regular AI before the singularity will take over. If you were to start from scratch today, what is he learning resource you would use to learn machine learning?

Speaker 2:          09:33          Yeah, so it's a couple of things I would use. I would um, look had the faster they AI to learn a few things. From there I would look had Andrew Rinks, uh, deep learning AI course. I would look at [inaudible] d planning course and then I would look at the deeper El bootcamp that we built last summer and also surrogate Levin's deep reinforced planning course. And all of those are available on line so anybody can start working with those favorite subject in school. When you were growing up cause x, if you could be a superhero, who would it be?

Speaker 1:          10:10          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          10:12          I guess I, in fact if I could be a superhero, I'm not too familiar with most superhero sell. Maybe I'll pick a real world person and I'd like to be somebody who really mix a lot of difference. So I think the way Elon Musk is tackling things like climate change bottom up by building companies that can really make a change. I find that really inspiring. What's your spirit animal? A Koala? What do you predict comes next after the deep learning hype?

Speaker 1:          10:40          Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:40          I think what we've seen with deep learning is at the essence leverage the things that are today available that you didn't have before. More data, more compute. And so I see a trend where we'll continue to have more data and more compute. So if anything comes about that can leverage even better, more data, more compute, maybe metal learning if you consider it separate from deep learning. But I think it's part of it. But anything that really leveraged to the latest resources that are available. But more questions, coffee or tea, tea, summer or winter, summer, Google home or Amazon Alexa. I always switch both of them off chrome or safari, chrome, WWDC or Google. Io. None of them are are the rights or rights for me, nips and I clear. Awesome. All right, Peter, that's it for my questions. Thanks so much for answering those. Sure. Thanks, Sarah. Have a good one.
