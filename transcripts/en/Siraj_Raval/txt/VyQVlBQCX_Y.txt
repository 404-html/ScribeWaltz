Speaker 1:          00:00          In the past few years, we've seen incredible advances in artificial intelligence and blockchain technology that have enabled a new breed of applications, decentralized applications or Dapps for short. These are open source governed by the community and crucially profitable for both the creators and the users. Open OpenBazaar, for example, let's buyers and sellers connect with each other directly with zero restrictions on trade steam. It is a decentralized social network where users get paid for the content. They post opus let's music creators keep all of the revenue they earn and [inaudible] allows its users to earn money by contributing to a crowd sourced hedge fund. This space is just getting started. A new stack is emerging for developers, one that will fuel the next wave of global companies. Etherium acts as a decentralized computing platform. The interplanetary file system has a decentralized storage network and deep learning as a layer of intelligence able to accomplish almost any task if given the right Dataset.

Speaker 1:          01:13          I'm so Roger Vol and this is the first course in the school of Ai. I'll show you how to combine these technologies together to build your own decentralized application. We'll build dapps together that cover a huge range of use cases from decentralized gaming to ride sharing to social networks. Along the way, you'll have access to an amazing community of peers, quizzes, graded projects, weekly live streams where I answer questions while building demos and your own certificate of completion timestamped on the blockchain for permanence. So if you want to be a part of the future of the web, get hype and sign up today.
