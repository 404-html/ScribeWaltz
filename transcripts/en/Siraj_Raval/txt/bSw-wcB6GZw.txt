Speaker 1:          00:00          This quantum computer is too powerful. Let's see how it works. Hello world it Saroj in. Anyone who has a laptop and an Internet connection can now use a quantum computer to submit and run applications receiving solutions in seconds. The waves leap service is the first cloudbase quantum application environment that gives developers real time access to alive quantum computer. In this video, we'll use the leap service to build a simple application to monitor a crop health sensor network. Quantum computing is already being applied to early real world applications. Volkswagen, for example, first used data from 418 taxis and Beijing to see how well a quantum computer could optimize the travel time of taxis in the city. Based on that success, VW has stated that they are working on putting their algorithm to use commercially for traffic management. In Lisbon. Recruit communications applied it to optimize the efficiency of matching advertisements to customers for web advertising and recently announced they could increase sales using a quantum algorithm from cryptography to medicine to financial markets.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Quantum computing can be applied to almost every industry to solve real problems. Quantum mechanics is the body of scientific laws that describe the motion and interaction of photons, electrons, and other subatomic particles that make up our universe. Quantum computers exploit the rules of quantum mechanics to solve problems, and these rules are hard for us to conceptualize because there are so different than what we're used to. Let's say we flipped the coin, we know what will happen. It'll go up and then down and land on heads or tails. These are all single truths, but if we shrunk down to the subatomic level, and again flip the coin, there would be multiple truths. The coin would be in both heads and tails simultaneously in the air. It could be 60% heads and 40% tails, for example, simultaneously, and he would stay in midair until it's observed by some measuring device, be it a human or a machine.

Speaker 1:          02:23          Pretty Wild, right? To quote Dr Feinman, if you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics. Quantum computing exploits three key features of quantum mechanics for computing. Superposition, entanglement and quantum tunneling particles can exist across all possible states simultaneously. And this is known as a superposition of states and electron, for example, may exist in two possible spin states usually referred to as spin up and spin down simultaneously. And sometimes groups of particles interact in ways such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the state of the others, even when the particles are separated by a large distance. This is called entanglement and quantum tunneling helps quantum computers explore the space of all possible solutions to a problem which can be thought of as low line points in a mountainous terrain by drilling through all the mountains simultaneously rather than having to go over them.

Speaker 1:          03:28          D-Wave invited me to Vancouver to see their quantum computer in person and it was an incredible experience. I saw that while a classical computer uses bits that perform computation there, quantum machine uses cubits. So in San up taking on the value of either zero or one, it can take on both at the same time in a super imposed state. And these cubits can be entangled with each other to compute huge amounts of data and solve certain complex problems that would take classical computers millions of years to calculate. The way this is done is not by using what we're used to that classical see moss or complimentary metal oxide semiconductor transistor, but instead what's called a squid or superconducting quantum interference device, Aka quantum transistors. Instead of using silicon, it uses a metal called neodymium that when cooled below negative 264 degrees Celsius becomes a super conductor and starts to exhibit quantum mechanical effects.

Speaker 1:          04:30          While irregular transistor only lets us encode to different states using voltages, accubid can encode to states as tiny magnetic fields that can point up or down simultaneously couplers connect cubits together as such that they can exchange information easily. As amazing as quantum machines are, let's be clear, they are not a replacement for classical computers. Instead, they're complimentary for a subset of classical problems. Quantum computing will make a dramatic difference. We can in fact think of the quantum computation process as engineering the pattern of a complex set of waves in hope of channeling the flow towards the correct answer. So let's take a look at the leap service firsthand to see what it offers us. We can sign up for an account on the landing page. Then we'll be able to access the dashboard here we can see how much time we have to use the quantum processing unit or QP you.

Speaker 1:          05:29          It doesn't seem like a lot of time, but it is because quantum computers are so fast, they can perform computations in just milliseconds. There are a whole host of learning materials on this dashboard including educational videos, research publications, and real world case studies that show how their clients have used their quantum computer to solve customer problems. The Community Support Tab also leads to access to their technical forums that allow developers to share and learn about quantum computing. My favorite part of the dashboard or the interactive demos that can be viewed in the browser to learn more about specific use cases as well as Jupiter notebooks that demonstrate different quantum algorithms. In the cloud. The ocean Sdk is the waves python library that wraps the API and lets us access to QP you in a simple three step process. After installing it using the popular pip installer, we just set our API token and we can verify our connection to the CUPE you with the D Wave Ping Command.

Speaker 1:          06:34          So for our use case, imagine we're a software as a service startup that creates custom sensor networks for farmers so that they get crop information in real time, allowing them to make smarter decisions. We can build a network of devices that can sense water quality, air pollution, crop health, and more. Then we'll want to create a security system that ensures that this system is not compromised by a third party and the data's stolen will want to monitor network traffic as it moves between all of our routers. We could place a traffic monitor on every single device in our network, but that would be an expensive hardware cost. Instead, what if we placed network traffic sensors in the minimum amount of spots necessary such that the sensors are still able to monitor all traffic in the network? We can consider this a graph problem. Nodes are sensor outposts full of different equipment and the edges represent all the paths that data flows through.

Speaker 1:          07:34          Between these notes, we're trying to find what's called the minimum vertex cover of vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident with at least one vertex in the set. A minimum for techs cover then is the vertex cover of smallest size. Let's open our own cloud notebook using the leap service to solve an optimization problem. We can visualize a simple example of this using the network x Python package. It's used to study the structure of complex networks. After importing it, we can create a five node star graph in a single line. The minimum set of vertices that touch all edges is node zero. That's the solution to this simple problem, but the general problem of finding as such a set is NP hard. Well first, solve this problem on a CPU. Since first a small number of variables, it's possible to compute classically in a relatively short time.

Speaker 1:          08:30          Then we'll do it on the QP you to solve it. On the CPU will initialize a sampler using the exact solver module of the official Die Mod Api. A solver is a resource that runs a problem and samplers are processes that sample from low energy states of a problems. Objective function, which is a mathematical expression of the energy of a system. The sampler we've initialized returns a binary models value for every possible assignment of variable values. This is a collection of binary valued variable that are variables that can be assigned to values like negative one and one with associated linear and quadratic biases. Uh, Bq m samplers, samples from low energy states in one of the default models defined by d wave in the API and returns an iterable of samples in order of increasing energy. This helps formulate optimization problems. Then we can use the wave network's library to produce a Bq m four our grab and solve it on our select sampler.

Speaker 1:          09:31          We're not explicitly creating the Bq em, it's obstructed by the ocean tool. So given the problem graph, it returns a solution to a Bq em that it creates internally. Now to solve it on a quantum processor, we can use a d wave sampler and a new addition. The embedding composite. This maps unstructured problems to the graph structure of the selected sampler via a process called minor embedding. Our problem star graph must be mapped to the qps numerically indexed cubits. We'll see that it creates a new graph and solves it on the QP you. We can know that this solution isn't unique. In fact, there are multiple valid solutions. When we give our algorithm a much larger graph that consists of real world data, it will perform the same tasks and we can use the output as a guide as to where exactly we should place traffic monitoring equipment.

Speaker 1:          10:25          We now know the least amount of equipment we need to buy to monitor the entire network. A lot to take in all at once. I know, but it's a very exciting field. There are three things to remember from this video. The waves leap is the first cloud based quantum application environment that gives developers realtime access to allied quantum computer. Quantum computing uses three key features from quantum mechanics to perform computations, including superposition. Entanglement and tunneling, and we can solve the minimum bird techs problem for a graph much faster using a quantum machine than a classical one. Also, coding challenge for the week. Create a simple application using leap that solves a problem. I'll give a shout out next week to the top two entries and a special prize for number one. I'm looking for great documentation and an interesting use case. Good luck wizards. Please subscribe for more programming videos and for now I'll get a stop interfering. So thanks for watching.
