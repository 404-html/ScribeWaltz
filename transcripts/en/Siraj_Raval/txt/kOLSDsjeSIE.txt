Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello world, it's arrived and everybody fails at some point. The question is how do you overcome this failure? I'm going to recall five times in my life where I failed big time and talk about how I later recovered. To give you some insight into ways of overcoming failure in general. One of my first big fails was fitting into the modern American narrative. What I mean is I was born in Houston, Texas. Shout out to h town, two parents from India and I spent my formative years there. I was born with the name Saroj and in middle and high school I got made fun of a lot in a racist way. I also never saw any character in American TV or movies that looked like me doing cool stuff and it makes sense. Indians had only started to migrate to the states in the past couple of decades, but I didn't feel like I fit in with the Indian culture either.

Speaker 1:          00:57          I was never Indian enough for that group. My family, of course loved me, but I wanted that love and acceptance from the kids at school and the ladies of course. And I just never felt it. I want it to be white. I didn't want to be racialized, Aka put into a box as that Indian kid who did some great thing, but instead I wanted to be that kid who did some great thing, so I legally changed my name to Jason Scott Revelle. The year before I went to College at Columbia University in New York City, I lightened my skin, changed my style, tried to be a whole new person, a fresh restart on life, but what I later found was that nothing really changed. I still didn't feel fully accepted and introducing myself to Indian people became awkward. Alf, as the years passed, I learned to fully accept myself for who I was.

Speaker 1:          01:50          I stopped trying to be what I thought other people would like and instead focused more on being the best version of me. Sure. I don't know anyone out there who's both a wrapper and really into artificial intelligence. Sure. It's not a normal thing, but I'm not a normal person. I'm a new breed and I'm going to bring my abnormal reality into the mainstream narrative and change culture. I'll make a place for myself and not as Jason. I legally changed my name back to Siraj and it was liberating. When I focus on being true to myself. I started to attract the right kind of friends and finally felt that sense of belonging that I always wanted. My second big fail I had was my first startup lucid robotics that I started as a student at Columbia. I was so manically obsessed with building a robot to help the elderly with chores.

Speaker 1:          02:45          I woke up every day really excited and spent long nights in the robotics lab planning next steps. I managed to find a team of great people. After countless interviews, I managed to raise a seed round after rejected by 30 or 40 venture capital firms in New York and we managed to build a working prototype, but the market didn't want our product. The team got disillusioned with the idea and our investor lost hope. Nine months of hard work and I had nothing to show for it. The worst part was that failing at the startup made me slowly lose my passion for robotics in a big way, and I didn't know if it would come back. I felt really lost and afraid. I didn't know what I should do next, but I did know that I didn't want to dwell on this. Failure to long San Francisco was a place I'd always wanted to live in, so I packed my things and moved to a hacker house, 20 beds in one room.

Speaker 1:          03:44          It was gritty, it was uncomfortable, but it was me moving forward from failure into a new environment of possibility and as I met starry eyed entrepreneurs there, my passion for AI returned and I began to search for new ways to have impact. The third fail I had was getting rejected from so many different jobs. During my first fulltime job hunt in SF, I made sure my resume looked well formatted and impressive and I use a bunch of recruiting agencies to help me get interviews for different startups in the area. But one by one I got rejection after rejection and every time I would lose a little bit of hope. Meanwhile, I had friends who seemingly easily got jobs that really cool companies. I didn't know what I was doing wrong. Maybe I wasn't enthusiastic enough during the interview. Maybe I needed to study more, maybe I needed to apply for a different position.

Speaker 1:          04:44          It was really stressful, but I found that since I ensured my body and mind were healthy and that I kept a positive attitude on life, I preserved through all the rejection until I got my first offer. It's never easy rising up the career ladder, whether you go through a corporate route or a startup route, you continually build trust in your own name brand by the brands, Aka companies you've worked with and things get easier as you go, but you've got to put in that initial effort to get your first gig. No matter how many rejections you get. At first. My fourth fail was getting fired from Twilio and this is the first time I'm publicly admitting that when I first landed the job as a developer educator at Twilio, I was delighted. I learned so much in such a short period of time. Technical Writing wasn't some chore that Developers had to do.

Speaker 1:          05:38          It was a craft, a skill that can be honed over time. A mix of math and programming and prose. It was the perfect job for me. I was writing Api docs in multiple programming languages for multiple products that affected over a million developers. I loved my team and what I did, but near the end, my performance started to drop. I had the idea to make videos for developers and my team at the time didn't really think it was a good idea to focus on that. So I started my own youtube channel to experiment with the idea. I started dedicating more and more of my time to that and my performance at my job suffered as a result, so I was eventually let go. I gave myself a single week to feel sorry for myself. I felt like I'd let down so many people who believed in me, but in that failure, I found the opportunity to finally be able to work on my youtube channel full time.

Speaker 1:          06:37          I was able to turn that sorrow into excitement. It was risky, it was fun, it was liberating and I don't regret it one bit. My fifth failure was actually multiple little failures all the times I received mostly negative comments when I first started making youtube videos. Some of my initial videos were really low budget and I definitely got a lot of criticism. My close friends at the time sat me down and told me it wasn't a good idea that I should instead get a job at a cool company or think of some B to B product idea, but I was so motivated by a mixture of wanting to educate people and wanting my own independence that I kept at it defiantly. I learned to take each negative comment as crucial feedback. I let the critics helped me mold and shape the content so that it got better and better every time.

Speaker 1:          07:33          I watched lots of youtube videos of people who inspired me and made sure to stay inspired. Even during my darkest hours, I didn't really know what it was that I was doing. Was it a startup? Was it a hobby? All I knew is that I had a mission to inspire and educate developers to build AI, and that's what kept me going no matter how silly I looked on camera and eventually the channel grew to what it is today. It's been just over two years since I started this youtube channel because of it. I've had the opportunity to speak at the United Nations cern, a bunch of conferences all over the world. I taught a deep learning course at u Udacity. I made a video for Elan Musk. So many awesome things have happened and I've just started what's turning out to be a very successful company, the school of Ai, if I can do great things.

Speaker 1:          08:29          So can you, so get to it wizard. I'm here for you. The winner of last week's coding challenge is how much shake Ahmad used a really cool data set to predict whether or not students would get probation in their second year, and he use logistic regression to do this great work. And the runner up is blahdy. Blahdy also used a logistic regression model built in num Pi to predict whether or not there was breast cancer in some patients. Amazing work.
