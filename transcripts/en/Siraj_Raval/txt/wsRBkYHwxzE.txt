All I've got is rumor and now our Crime Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, one of whom was calling it a scum ball activity. The other saying, Bill Gates saying he would short this thing if you could, and you're saying they're all wrong.

A community that's able to provide financial services to the 2 billion people on Earth without a bank account for the first time, that's able to create new jobs for people that were never before possible. A community that's beginning to transform every single industry. So the question is,
