Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello world, it's Saroj and ripple. It's a digital currency designed for banks. That's right. I said for banks, not to replace banks, but for bex, and it's controversial, but it's one of the highest market cap current currencies out there in the space right now. So in this video, I'm going to build a minimal ripple client that acts as a wallet. Here's an example. Okay. So what we can do with this client is we can generate an identity just like this. And uh, first I got to yet. So there's our identity, it's 25 characters. And then what we can do is we can connect to the ripple network and then it's going to say, okay, it connected with the results success, and then we can send payments, uh, by using the token Xrp to another address. And that's it. That's the only three things we're going to, we're going to code out to get a feel for how the ripple API works in javascript.

Speaker 1:          00:52          So it's going to be a simple web app like that. But first we've got to talk about this thing, right? How does this thing worked? Is a decentralized, is it centralize? What's the deal with ripple? Right? So we're going to go into his history, some of its features, it's consensus protocol, the Xrp token versus the Iou. And then we're going to build this thing. So first of all, Tldr, there's a lot, there's a lot here. So all the ripple tokens, the XRP Tokens, they've been issued. So you can't, uh, they can't meant any more. They're not doing that. There's no rewards for minors. All the tokens have already been issued. Okay. They'd been pre mind. And it's not a blockchain. That's, that's a very key point. It's very similar to a blockchain, but it's not a blockchain in that, that transactions in the network aren't grouped into these blocks and inside of the blocks or the transactions in the form of a Merkle Dag.

Speaker 1:          01:40          No, no, no, no. It's just one giant list. Okay. And every node in the network maintains a copy of that list, but it's not in the form of blocks that are pointing to other blocks just to, you know, it's just a nit picky distinction that I want to make before people say, oh, it's a decentralized blockchain. It's not a blockchain, it's just a digital currency. You could say it's a digital currency made for banks and there are a group of validater nodes and that's how the network agrees upon, uh, whether or not a transaction is valid. So nodes will vote on a set of validater nodes. Like these are kind of like senators in the U S Senate, right? It's not like the u s is a direct democracy where every participant can vote on every single law. No, we elect in the u s we elect, uh, what are called senators and then they make all the decisions for us and we trust them.

Speaker 1:          02:30          So it's not decentralized. It's not completely, it's not completely centralized. It's somewhere in the middle, nearing towards centralized. But I'm going to talk more about that. So, um, and, and these validators aren't earning any rewards for validating these transactions. They're just doing this because a out of goodwill and be, because only that validater nodes can make, uh, can vote on changes to the protocol. So they get voting rights in that way to the protocol. Oh, there's also this idea of a gateway and, uh, basically any business can register as a gateway and then you can create your own issuances. So if I'm a business and I have like, let's say I'm an airline, I can register as a gateway and the ripple network, and then I have some, you know, miles or bonus points or something, people can pay me, say a thousand US dollars and then I can send them a thousand bonus points and ripple will facilitate that transaction, that exchange between currencies.

Speaker 1:          03:26          And a lot of banks are using this right now. But, uh, the main use of Xrp as a, as a token is to pay for transaction fees. That that's why it exists. And when you pay the fee, the XRP is our burnt and then destroyed. So the total number of XRP existing become smaller every day. That was just the Tldr. Before I go into all of this, okay, so back to the history. So, uh, payments online. So http, http as a protocol basically made a communicating with people online globally, instantly, right? So globally you could communicate with anyone online instantly, but the same kind of innovation did not apply to the payment space because we had already created this kind of network of pre internet protocols like Ach, swift, et cetera. And banks had different relationships with each other and this was kind of tacked onto the http web, but it was still slow, right?

Speaker 1:          04:19          Certain banks had to have relationships with other banks. Here's a little bit of discrete math for you. If you think about the common editorial complexity of a problem where I'm a bank and I want to send you money and you're a bank, however, we don't have any direct relationship. So what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to go through this chain of banks, right? And each bank has a relationship with another bank, common editorial laid. This could be, this could be an explosion in terms of the complexity of how many different hops the transaction has to go through, right? But with ripple, the idea was let's create a protocol for these banks so they can transfer money from one to the other directly. Ripple really solves two main problems. One instant transfers between banks, right? So right now, if I send money internationally from bank a to Bank B, that takes between three to five days.

Speaker 1:          05:08          But with ripple, if a bank uses this, then you could send money instantly and to the second problem is lower transaction fees, right? So how can we make this transaction happen with the lowest costs and for these two problems? Ripple actually does this very well. I know ripple actually solve this problem very well for banks. Okay? There are some downsides in terms of decentralization, which I'm going to go into. But you know, bitcoin tried to solve this problem of removing a bank, right? So it's not like ripple and bitcoin or competing in any way. They're completely different protocols. Bitcoin is, is, uh, speculatory currency, right? It's, it's made for speculation. Really. It's it, yes, it's a digital currency, but no one's using bitcoin as a currency. Let's be real. Like bitcoin is a tool for speculation. It's an asset class. And we can use the blockchain as this kind of global distributed ledger where we can add all sorts of digitized assets and timestamped things for, you know, just proving that something exists without needing a third party.

Speaker 1:          06:11          Smart contracts. There's a bunch of functionality, but we can't just say, you know, no one's using bitcoin for it. You know, day to day transactions. It's too volatile. But it was made for consumers, right? From person a to person B send a transaction without needing a bank. Ripple is not like that to ripple is for, for banks to send money between each other. And it was designed to eliminate bitcoins, reliance on centralized exchanges as decentral, as decentralized as Bitcoin is, you still, if you want to exchange that bitcoin into any other currency, you got to go through one of these centralized exchanges like Coinbase or bits stamp, et cetera. So with ripple, it supports payment in any type of currency, whether that's cryptocurrency, Fiat currency or any kind of, you know, tokens that are not even currency, like bonus points or miles or whatever ripple is being adopted by a lot of banks.

Speaker 1:          06:59          It's being adopted by a lot of governments, Bank of America, HSBC bank in over 65 countries. Japan is a major player in ripple. Um, it's, it's like, I think I read somewhere like up to 40% of transactions in Ge, in Japan in five years are going to be using the ripple protocol in some way because the banks in Japan are adopting ripples so fast. But, uh, I hear that. Here's this other image of, you know, the ACH transfer process, you know, US bank to Ubank, whop, whop, whop, whop, whop, whop. And then bitcoin is, you know, direct to direct, however, seven to 45 minutes for a transaction. And then ripple is six seconds. Okay, six seconds. Instant transfer. So let's see here. Where are we with ripple, right? Let's, let's look at the coin market capitalist here. Ripple is for all time, right? This, this thing has been around for four years.

Speaker 1:          07:47          It's just been kind of chilling until recently. And Boom, look at this explosion. It is hot. It is hot right now. The currency is hot. And what drives the, the prices of these cryptocurrencies? Remember, it's speculation. It's news and a lot of banks, a lot of institutions are adopting ripple, which is what, what, what, you know, accounts for this, right? In the future. More and more it's going to be utility instead of speculation. But right now it's mostly speculation. Arguably ripple has a lot of utility. That's why these banks are using this right now in production. Like real banks are using this protocol. Uh, but you know, it's not perfect. Obviously it's not perfect. It's a proof of concept. And there are problems with, they like one problem is when it was founded, it, there was a huge pre mine, right? So 80 billion tokens were allocated to the company and the Ripple Labs Foundation and then 20 billion were given to the three founders.

Speaker 1:          08:40          Right? Um, so today glow globally, banks are connected through proprietary networks. There's no open standard for communication. Hence all the hops between networks, but ripple enables any bank to access any bank on the network, uh, directly, right? It costs about 0.04 a sense and takes three to five seconds to send. Whereas bitcoin take cost over 25 US dollars sometimes and takes up to an hour. So here at three features that I thought were really useful for were really cool about ripple. So the first feature are the gateways feature. So for gateways, the idea is this, so anyone can register to become a gateway. These are businesses that provide a way for money and other forms of value to move in and out of the Xrp Ledger, right? So if I'm a, you know, a bank, a bank can apply, obviously it to be a gateway, but a person can apply to be a gateway as well.

Speaker 1:          09:29          So if I'm a person and I've got to say USD, and this dude is only going to accept euro's, he's like, you know, I worked for you and I deserve 500 euros. And I'm like, okay, I've got, you know, 600 USD and I'm going to, but I don't have heroes. I want to pay you. Right? So I've got my bank, you've got your bank in Europe, I've got my bank in the u s and I'm going to pay ripple will facilitate this transaction by the use of water called gateways. So the gateway is going to say, I've got USD and I've got euro and you're going to send money to me and then I'm going to send money to him. Okay. And so in the, in the middle of all of this, we've got Xrp as a bridge between all of these currencies, right from USD to euro XRP acts as that bridge currency.

Speaker 1:          10:10          And so what happens is the network is going to work like this. You propose a payment by specifying the source, you and the destination accounts and the currencies. The system gives you a quote based on public offers. There are these entities called market makers, and these are basically anybody can be a market maker. They'll do things like arbitrage, but basically they'll profit off of making buy and sell orders in the network and they're basically making the market by making these buy and sell orders. So you'll say, I want to make a transfer and here's the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for that transfer. The market makers will have all these buy and sell orders for all of these different conversions and the network will match you up with the best for your threshold for what you're willing to pay. Then the gateway will then facilitate that transaction between you and the destination using that buy or sell order from the market maker.

Speaker 1:          11:00          The market maker will make that transaction fee and Xrp and the pain will go through the gateway. It can go through several gateways actually, but it will get to the destination within three to five seconds, six seconds, seven seconds under 10 seconds for sure. But it's a really fast, a way to send money between banks, right. So there are different ways that gay, there are different models that gateways can follow. You can have an issue in gateway, a private exchange, and merchants can accept the payments in exchange for goods and services with the outside world. So there's a lot of different ways that you can be a gateway. There's other feature I thought was really cool, was not cool, but just interesting. Uh, not necessarily cool but interesting. That's, that's a better word for this. But the freezing balances feature. So, uh, this was actually a very controversial feature, but, and you know, there's a lot of negative hype around this that ripple gateways can freeze users funds any time.

Speaker 1:          11:54          This is true, but there has to be some corn, some kind of reason for that, right? So if you think about compliance between all these different governments, you know, KYC compliance about it at a ripple was made to facilitate transactions between banks. And if you really want to do something for banks, banks are all about government compliance. So any protocol they use has to be compliant with these, you know, governments, right? So if a government needs to, you know, freeze a transaction, they see something illegal happening, they need to reverse funds. They need to, you know, whatever. There has to be some way for them to do that. So ripple allows for governments to then freeze funds by seizing the whatever's in the gateway, that intermediary to prevent any kind of illegal transactions. Now this is controversial and a decentralized space, right? Because this allows control from governments and third parties, right?

Speaker 1:          12:43          So, but um, that's, that's how it is. And because it is compliant, that's why its market cap is rising so fast. That's why that's why all these banks are adopting it so fast because it's, it is government compliance. So yes, the negative is that governments can seize those funds if there is some illegal transaction. So there is some trust involved there. Uh, but they can't seize XRP. So that's the really key difference. They can seize any currency that the gateway is holding, except for Xrp because that is a digital currency. It is not a Fiat currency. So these market makers, anybody can be a market maker. They can make a living off of being a market maker. But what they do full time as they look for, you know, buy and sell options and they will hedge the on those options. So they'll make some profit by saying, you know, I've got x amount of currencies, I've got y amount of this currency and then I see this order, I'm going to, you know, say I've got that and then I'll get the transaction fee.

Speaker 1:          13:39          And it's just continually do that. And this will be facilitated, facilitated through the gateway. So when it comes to consensus, we can think of the network like this. We've got two banks, right? Bank a and Bank B and someone will send money from bank a to bank B and it's going to go through the ripple network. These are the validator knows they're going to validate all those transactions. Market makers are going to, are going to make buy and sell orders to facilitate the exchange between these currencies. It's a decentralized exchange. Once it is approved, it's going to go through a gateway and then end up at the receiving end of the bank. So, like I said, there is not a blockchain. There's just a giant ledger. Just think of it as an a giant excel spreadsheets. And inside of this, it's got the ledger number, account settings, balances, transactions, whether or not a transaction was validated, all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          14:30          And every few seconds, this giant list of transactions is updated over time by the validater nodes as new transactions are coming in, right? So ripple runs a network of servers. Anybody can become a client's, right? And at the heart of the network is this ledger, it's a distributed database. Uh, and so any server can introduce a transaction to them network. These transactions go out to all active ripple servers and the servers automatically come to consensus about a set of transactions to apply it to the ledger creating a new closed ledger. So, but how, how is it doing this? Right? So this is where the trust and the kind of centralization comes in. It's not completely decentralized. Remember I said that from the start, but the goal of consensus in ripple is for each server to apply the same set of transactions to the current ledger. So every server is going to, basically it's going to say how many other a validater nodes have approved this transaction.

Speaker 1:          15:26          So every or node is going to agree whether on whether or not a transaction is valid based on if other validater nodes say it's a valid transaction. So the validater nodes are trusting their, the other validater notes, right? So they are all trusting each other. So there is some trust there and the servers are continually receiving transactions from other servers in the network. And basically every validator node is polling the other validater nodes to see if they have accepted a certain transaction. And so it's, uh, it's, it's going editor iteratively, right? So, and so a server is going to receive proposals from the other servers and the network. A proposal is a set of transactions to consider applying to the ledger. So they're going to propose, you know, x amount of transactions. These are all valid. Let me propose that to all the other validater notes.

Speaker 1:          16:13          And the server only pays attention to incoming proposals from the server set. They're matched with the candidate set. And if there is a, uh, it at the server, a server is going to take transactions that have received at least a 50% approval rating and package them into a new proposal. And this goes iteratively, that proposal goes out to other servers in the network, the process repeats, but this time it looks for a 60% approval. The process repeats this time a 70% approval. And at that point the network has reached consensus. So there is trust involved amongst the validater nodes with each other who in turn are trusted by the network. They are voted on by the network. So there are two types of payment methods here. One is Xrp and then the other is an Iou. So XRP is the native currency of ripple. And anyone can accept Xrp, they can send Xrp. It takes care of cross border transactions.

Speaker 1:          17:06          But there's also this concept of the Iou. So IOUs are issued on the platform and they are redeemable for a fungible asset like USC or gold or whatever. Anyone can issue these IOUs. But in order for someone to accept a payment, they must trust that person who issued them to be able to redeem the Iou for the underlying assets. So there is some trust involved and mostly banks are using this IOU concept to say, okay, you know, I don't have the fun here, but I'm going to promise that I'm going to give this phone to you. They'll accept that payment and then hopefully the bank then sends that money. So this is, there is this trust involved, but it's faster. Okay, so let's get to to building this thing, right? So, uh, let me open this up. Okay. So in the index dot, html, uh, I've got this basic html and all we're going to do is we're in a code up the Java script for, uh, showing, uh, generating an identity in the network and then connecting to the network and then sending a payment.

Speaker 1:          18:04          Three different things, right? What each of these html, these dom elements are doing are there, they're using an on click, an event listener to call these three javascript functions that are using the ripple, uh, Api, right? So we've got press to generate an identity press to connect to ripple and then press to send a payment, right? So if we go down here, here's the ripple, a js library. Just, you know, I'm just putting it in time inside of this script, html tag. We're just going to scroll down, scroll down, scroll down, scroll down, and then we'll get to the, to the part where we can, you know, code this, this part up the, the, the part that matters here. Okay. So, um, first to open in the opening set up, I'm going to say, here's my address. Uh, and then I want the remote server, which I'm going to initialize using the ripple, uh, object and instance of the ripple a server.

Speaker 1:          19:00          And then in the servers I'm going to use are these default servers right here that, uh, I could have my own server, I could use another server, but luckily there's this client, a globally that I'm using, is using right here, that ripple provides that I can use as a, as a server to just connect to directly. And then I can say, okay, let me generates a, an identity. So this is what's called, whenever we say generate an identity. So in this function I'll say take the result of generate address, which is a part of the ripple Api. And then set the identity in the html to whatever the result of that is. And then set the secret, my remote server to the resulting address. That's it. Okay. Just like that. And now I'm going to have the connect function. So for the connect function, I'm going to say connect, uh, connect to ripple.

Speaker 1:          19:56          Okay? So this is going to connect to the ripple network, right? This is our very, very simple minimalist client that we're building here. And we're going to use a remote that we initialize before to say, here is a callback function that's going to return an error and the response, and we're going to say either the result, their response, or it's going to be successful, whether or not it's successful, do the following, get the outcome, uh, and then, well, we're going to say, okay, connected to ripple so we can display that in html, connect to ripple. And then alert outcome, right? Just like that. And then lastly, we're going to say, send Xrp, right? So whenever we hit, you know, sin, we're going to have, we're going to specify an amount, right? The amount of Xrp to destination. And then we're gonna say, okay, so take the transaction.

Speaker 1:          21:03          There's going to be, we're going to use that same remote object to create a transaction, or it's going to ask for some, it's going to ask for some, uh, parameters. So we'll say, my address, here's my address, the source, here's the destination that I've specified, destination. And then lastly, we'll say, here's the amount, the amount is whatever I specify it right now I can say transaction dot summit. Here's my transaction. I've initialized it as an, as an object. And now I can submit that transaction. It's going to be in the form of a callback. Did it, was it successful? Was it not? This will tell us, notify the outcome, error response. And that's just going to take the result of that. Okay? So yeah, those are three basic functions. And then we can go back. We can see the results here. Uh, we can connect to ripple, we can generate an identity, we can send the payment. I don't have any XRP in this wallet, but it's very simple. All the code for this is in the get hub repo in the video description. So definitely check it out. I've got more detailed documentation and instructions there, so I hope you found this useful. Please subscribe for more programming videos. And for now I'm going to work on a music video, so thanks for watching.
