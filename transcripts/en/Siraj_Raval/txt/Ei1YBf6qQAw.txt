Speaker 1:          00:00          Deep blue, the IBM computer beat Garry Kasparov, I'm getting weirdly has resigned is a whole new team of humans going up against opening I five is defining vision for AI. Research has always been to eventually create an algorithm that can solve any problem. It's Cs and given the recent rapid advances in Ai, we are getting closer. Reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning in which the goal is to learn how to act in an environment to maximize our reward signal. There have been lots of different algorithms proposed to help this goal, many of which involve learning a way to represent all or part of the environment, but learning a general representation of diverse data was shown to be a hard problem and the promises of reinforcement learning in large part were left unfulfilled. But in recent years hope emerged when deep learning proved to be able to learn a robust representation of whatever type of data it was given.

Speaker 1:          01:08          The combination of these two approaches called deep reinforcement learning is what's behind the latest advances in Ai. Deep RL is now making its way into industrial applications created by companies both big and small pit dot. Ai is now using it to outperform traditional hedge funds by applying it to algorithmic trading. The Vu is using it to address the challenges of managing complex enterprise supply chains. Uber has applied it at massive scale to be able to more efficiently match riders and drivers together and Oh sorrows using it to create some of the smartest factory robots ever made. Helloworld it Saroj and join me as I teach it. This free 10 week reinforcement learning course. I've called move 37 I'll take you on a journey through the basics up to modern day techniques. Every week we'll build apps together that will cover both toy and industry problems. You'll be able to measure your progress along the way by chatting with your peers, both online and offline at school of AI chapters globally, taking quizzes, coding challenges, and two graded projects. I'll have weekly coding live streams to help answer any questions and my assistant instructors will be available to help in our community slack channel. All Wizards who complete this course, get an official school of Ai Certificate signed by me. This is going to be a wild ride. So sign up now and join our movement.
