1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,953
In Milton's Paradise Lost Satan as an 
intellectual figure and you see that 

2
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:09,480
motif emerge very frequently by the way 
in popular culture.

3
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:11,460
So for example,
in the lion king,

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,683
the figure of scar who's a titanic 
figure is also hyper intellectual and 

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:17,934
that's very common that the evil 
scientist Motif for the or the evil 

6
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:23,010
advisor to the king,
the same motif.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:23,853
It encapsulate something about 
rationality and what it seems to 

8
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:31,161
encapsulate as the idea that rationality
like Satan is the highest angel in God's

9
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:34,710
heavenly kingdom.
It's a psychological idea.

10
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:35,544
You know that the most powerful sub 
element of the human psyche is the 

11
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:40,314
intellect and and it's the thing that 
shines out above all within the domain 

12
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:49,800
of humanity and maybe across the the 
domain of life itself.

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,723
The human intellect.
There's something absolutely remarkable 

14
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:52,884
about it,
but it has a flaw and the floor is that 

15
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:55,314
it tends to fall in love with its own 
productions and to assume that their 

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,393
total solzhenitsyn,
when he was writing the Gulag 

17
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:06,231
archipelago had a warning about that 
with regards to totalitarian ideology.

18
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,903
And he said that the price of selling 
your God given sole to the entrapments 

19
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:17,220
of of human dogma was slavery and death 
essentially.

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,500
And Satan in May in Milton's paradise 
lost.

21
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,820
Satan decides that he can do without the
transcendent,

22
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:32,430
he can do without God.
And that's why foment rebellion.

23
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,340
It's something like that.
And the consequence of that,

24
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,693
the immediate consequence from Milton's 
perspective was that as soon as Satan 

25
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,423
decided that what he knew was sufficient
and that he could do without the 

26
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:47,154
transcendent,
which you might think about as the 

27
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:51,600
domain outside of what you know,
something like that.

28
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,030
Immediately he was inhale.
And when I read paradise lost,

29
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:59,130
I was studying totalitarianism and I 
thought,

30
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,450
you know,
the poet,

31
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,363
the true poet,
like a prophet is someone who has 

32
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:07,014
intimations of the future.
And maybe that's because the poetic 

33
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:13,200
mind,
the philosophical or prophetic mind is a

34
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:14,190
pattern detector.

35
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,830
And,
and,

36
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,370
and there are people who can detect the 
underlying.

37
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,740
It's like the melody of,
of a nation.

38
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,163
Melody has in song the song of the 
nation and can see how it's going to 

39
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,500
develop across the centuries.
You see this,

40
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,660
you see that nature because nature,
for example,

41
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:30,390
in the mid,
around 18,

42
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:31,224
60 or so,
and he prophesied what was going to 

43
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:33,714
happen in the 20th century.
He said that he said specifically that 

44
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,950
the specter of communism would kill 
millions of people in the 20th century.

45
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,023
It's amazing prophecy.
He said that in the notes that became 

46
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,180
willpower and Dostoevsky was of the same
sort of mind.

47
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:52,960
Someone who was in touch enough with the
fundamental patterns of,

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,880
of,
of,

49
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,803
of human movement that they could 
extrapolate out into the future and see 

50
00:02:57,871 --> 00:02:59,880
what was coming.
And I mean,

51
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,010
some people are very good at detecting 
patterns,

52
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:02,844
you know,
and,

53
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,043
and,
uh,

54
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,030
Milton I think was of that.
