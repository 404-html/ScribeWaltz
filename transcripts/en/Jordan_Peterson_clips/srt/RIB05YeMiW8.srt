1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,980
Okay,
quick question.

2
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:02,814
Are you a Christian?
I suppose the most straightforward 

3
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:09,900
answer to that is yes.
Although I think it's.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,500
Let's leave it at.
Yes.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,170
I'm a bit dissatisfied with that because
there are so many kinds of Christians.

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,090
Christian,
well,

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,743
there are.
There are truths to other than the 

8
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:31,630
literal that perhaps are more truthful 
than even literal truth.

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,443
No.
There are many kinds of truth and I 

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,723
don't mean that in A.
I don't mean that in a postmodern way 

11
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:39,384
actually,
but the truths that govern behavior and 

12
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:45,230
the truths that emerged from facts are 
not the same truths.

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,930
What do you do you believe that Jesus 
rose again from the day I find it.

14
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,310
I cannot answer that question and the 
reason is because.

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,753
Let me think about it for a minute.
See if I can come up with a reasonable 

16
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:13,131
answer to that.
Well,

17
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,623
the first answer would be it depends on 
what you mean by Jesus and historical 

18
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,903
human being that existed in a.
It was a physical body and then it was 

19
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:32,331
on earth that was literally was 
literally came back to life after death.

20
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,750
I would say that at the moment I'm 
agnostic about that issue,

21
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,580
which is a lot different than saying I 
don't believe for it's happened.

22
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,960
Explain why when I get to that,
when I get to the New Testament,

23
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:01,794
in my biblical lectures,
I'll spend like six hours trying to 

24
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:04,824
explain what I think about that,
but one of the things I have come to 

25
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:10,314
learn over the last 15 years in 
particularly in particular is that the 

26
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:14,600
world is a theory,
theory,

27
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,270
strange place.
It's far stranger than we think and what

28
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,104
we don't understand about consciousness 
and its relationship with the body was 

29
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:22,964
still many books and you could say the 
same thing about our relationship with 

30
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:30,660
time and perhaps corporality and 
vulnerability and all and death for that

31
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:31,494
matter.

32
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,650
So I don't understand that.
The structure of being well enough to to

33
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,850
to make my way through the complexities 
of the resurrection story.

34
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,713
I would say it's the most mysterious 
element of the biblical stories to me 

35
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,800
and perhaps I'm not alone,
is now.

36
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,953
I mean it's the central.
It's the central drama and in the 

37
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,573
Christian Corpus,
let's say,

38
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,630
but I don't believe that it's reasonable
to boil it down to something like,

39
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,800
do you believe that or do you not 
believe that?

40
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,860
You know it's not.
It's I don't know what the limits.

41
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,980
I don't know the limits of human 
possibility.

42
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,973
I don't know intriguing because I had 
very much has you down as somebody sold 

43
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,180
us essentially projections of the human 
consciousness.

44
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,083
They are that and I could say I could 
say the death and resurrection of Jesus 

45
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,243
Christ symbolizes the necessity of the 
psyche to a sequence of deaths and 

46
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:49,570
rebirths attainment of the ideal.

47
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,660
That's what I expected you to say is 
true.

48
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,540
It's a phoenix.
It's a phoenix story.

49
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,530
No know the actual facts.
It started.

50
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,220
The thing is is that just because that's
true,

51
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,280
it doesn't mean that's all true about it
because I also don't know.

52
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,960
So here,
for example,

53
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,573
in order to stay alive,
it's necessary to get the balance 

54
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:18,664
between death and life are in your 
psyche and your physiology because that 

55
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,003
keeps you alive.
Your cells die and regenerate all the 

56
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:29,410
time,
and if you die too much,

57
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:31,690
then you die,
and if you don't die enough,

58
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,420
well then you also die.
You end up with cancer or something like

59
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:35,254
that.
You have to get the balance between 

60
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:36,850
death and life,
right?

61
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,923
In order to survive.
I don't know what would happen if you 

62
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:42,194
got the balance between death and life 
exactly right and I don't know what the 

63
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:51,490
upper limits are to human possibility 
and and neither does anyone else,

64
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,420
and human consciousness and human beings
are capable of.

65
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,470
We don't know what we're capable of,
I suppose is the final answer,

66
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,990
and so I'm unwilling for a variety of 
reasons which aren't,

67
00:05:02,991 --> 00:05:03,824
which I can't explain.
They're tangled up with the experiences 

68
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:08,770
of the experiences that I've had that I 
can't.

69
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,823
I can't.
I can neither understand newer 

70
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,950
explained,
but I'm unwilling to rule out.

71
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,500
I'm unwilling to rule out the existence 
of heaven.

72
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,530
I'm unwilling to rule out the existence 
of life after death.

73
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,873
I'm unwilling to rule out the idea of 
universal redemption and the defeat of 

74
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:28,270
evil.
Now I know perfectly well that all those

75
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:31,420
things can be pro well conceptualized 
metaphorically.

76
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,050
I know that metaphorical 
conceptualization,

77
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,643
but I'm not willing to make the claim 
that those ideas exhaust themselves in 

78
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:47,890
the metaphor of it's,
you know,

79
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,223
I'm not in a position as of yet to 
articulate why I think that in a manner 

80
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:59,971
that would be anything other than a 
jumble of lateral thoughts.

81
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,323
I have thoughts,
but they're not organized and part of 

82
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:05,624
the reason I'm doing the biblical 
lecture series is to organize those 

83
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:12,210
thoughts.
That's so interesting.

84
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:14,610
I had one day I'll have a chance to ask 
you more about that.
