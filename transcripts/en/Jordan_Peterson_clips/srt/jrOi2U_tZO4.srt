1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,800
It's our shared apprehensions about the 
implications of situations for behaviors

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,173
that constitute our cultures and it's 
those shared maps that bring 

3
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,640
predictability to our interpersonal 
relationships.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,653
You can only understand that if you 
understand what the world is like when 

5
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:18,194
it's not predictable and it's difficult 
to understand that for water and people 

6
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:22,964
who live in peaceful times because our 
culture is so successful at regulating 

7
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:29,450
our interpersonal behavior and even the 
environment for that matter,

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,463
but we hardly ever encounter a situation
where anything remotely unpredictable 

9
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:34,574
happens,
so you can't tell what it's like to be 

10
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:37,670
faced with something that's 
unpredictable,

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,863
so you don't know what it's like when 
you're in an environment where it 

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,773
doesn't rain because you're part of a 
successful community in your 

13
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:46,000
extraordinarily well protected it.
You're like,

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,980
you're like a a boy that lives inside 
the castle.

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,880
You can't see over the wall,
doesn't even know that they're there.

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,900
There's all sorts of terrible things 
outside the castle,

17
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:56,510
but everything inside is peaceful and 
that's the world.

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,043
The boy has no idea what he would be 
like if we went outside into the real 

19
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:01,094
world where things were actually a 
predictable because he's only had a 

20
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:05,630
chance to observe his behavior under 
stable conditions.

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,880
Wherever that is predictable and 
acceptable.

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,680
It's even worse now in a sentence.
It's better the way to.

23
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:16,681
I mean it is peaceful now anyways.
I mean even compared to 15 years ago,

24
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:18,674
there's much less ideological dispute in
the world about how the conduct is fair 

25
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:26,090
is then there was staying in the mid 
seventies when people are more or less.

26
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:27,470
I mean I know there's exceptions to 
this,

27
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:30,560
but people the world over half,
more or less accepted in this desk,

28
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,420
for example,
for a market economy,

29
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,493
there aren't very many ideologies that 
appear attractive even in the 

30
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:37,064
imagination in contrast to to Western 
style democracies and I mean that's a 

31
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,640
pretty recent occurrence and it's 
unlikely to last for any great length of

32
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:44,474
time I think,
but it is peaceful now that the fact 

33
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,550
that that piece makes it even more 
difficult for us to either to understand

34
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:54,450
ourselves or to be sufficiently 
motivated.

35
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,333
I'm just kind of just also because when 
things are going really well and 

36
00:01:57,711 --> 00:01:58,544
everything's predictable,
then you presume that you know what 

37
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:01,580
you're doing.
In fact,

38
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:02,414
that's the basis on which you base your 
judgments about whether you know what 

39
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:06,794
you're doing.
If you perform a procedure and what you 

40
00:02:08,451 --> 00:02:10,250
predicted it occurs.
You're right.

41
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,340
That doesn't mean you know everything,
but as far as you're concerned,

42
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,174
that's sufficient.
