1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,220
In order to have any positive meaning in
your life,

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,683
you have to identify the goal and you 
have to be working towards it and there 

3
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:11,220
is a technical reason for that and the 
technical reason as far as I can tell is

4
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:12,054
that the circuitry that produces the 
kind of positive emotion that people 

5
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:18,750
really like is only activated when you 
noticed that your.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,993
Because when you're proceeding towards a
goal that you value and so that means 

7
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:26,670
that if you don't have a goal that you 
value,

8
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:27,504
you can't have any positive emotions.
So technically that's the incentive 

9
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:30,924
reward system and it's the underlying 
circuitry as dopaminergic and when that 

10
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:35,484
circuitry is activated,
then it's part of the exploratory 

11
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:38,670
circuit.
It makes you.

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,773
It gives you the sense of being actively
engaged in something worthwhile and 

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,350
that's you know you.
You tend to think of positive emotion is

14
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:47,184
something produced by reward,
but there's two kinds of positive 

15
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:50,310
emotion.

16
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,930
One is the reward that's associated with
satiation and that's conservatory reward

17
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:57,240
and that's the reward you get when 
you're hungry and you eat.

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,853
But the thing about eating when you're 
hungry is that destroys the framework 

19
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:03,840
within which you are operating,
right?

20
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:07,770
It's time to eat what you eat and then 
that frameworks no longer relevant.

21
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:08,604
So the conservatory reward eliminates 
the value of framework and then you're 

22
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:12,281
stuck with,
well,

23
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:13,114
what are you going to do next?
And so the conservatory reward has with 

24
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:16,914
it its own problems.
But the incentive reward is constantly 

25
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:20,214
what keeps you moving forward and 
incentive reward because it's 

26
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:27,090
dopaminergic also is analgesic,
literally analgesics.

27
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:27,924
So if you're in pain,
you take opiates and that that will cut 

28
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:31,554
the pain,
but so will psychomotor stimulants like 

29
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:33,954
cocaine or amphetamines.
And so it's literally the case that if 

30
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:38,334
you're engaged in something that's 
engaging and you're working towards a 

31
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:42,750
goal that you're going to feel less 
pain.

32
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,180
And you can see this happening with 
athletes who you know,

33
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,073
they'll break their thumb or something 
or maybe sometimes even their ankle and 

34
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,074
they'll keep playing the game.
Of course afterwards they're suffering 

35
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:53,760
like mad.
But the fact that they're so filled with

36
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:58,761
goal-directed enthusiasm means that 
whether Peyton systems are in some sense

37
00:01:58,981 --> 00:01:59,814
shut off.
So that's an interesting thing because 

38
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,760
what it suggests,
I mean then you could imagine,

39
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,713
I might say,
well how happy you are you that you've 

40
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:12,060
made a certain amount of progress and if
you think about it,

41
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:13,050
what you'd say is,
well,

42
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:13,884
it depends on how much progress and in 
relationship to what so hypothetically 

43
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:19,314
you're going to be happier if you've 
made quite a bit of progress towards a 

44
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:22,104
really important goal and then you have 
to think through what it means for a 

45
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:27,810
goal to be really important because 
that's not obvious.

46
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,793
Now you could say,
here in this class and you're listening 

47
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:36,150
to some information and maybe there's 
two reasons for that.

48
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:38,760
You might find the information 
interesting per se,

49
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:40,200
but let's forget about that for a 
minute.

50
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,173
You need to listen to the information so
that you can do well on the assignment 

51
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:45,894
so that you can do well in the class.
You need to do well in your classes so 

52
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,434
that you can finish up your degree.
You need to finish up your degree so 

53
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:53,550
that you can find your place in the 
world.

54
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,743
You need to do that so that you're 
financially stable and maybe you can 

55
00:02:56,851 --> 00:03:00,490
start a family and have a life and 
that's part of being a good person,

56
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,353
something like that,
and so that's a hierarchy of goals and 

57
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,190
you might say that being a good person 
would be the thing,

58
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,310
however vaguely thought through.
That's at the top of that hierarchy,

59
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,620
and then when you're doing things that 
serve the ultimate purpose,

60
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,663
then you're going to find those more 
meaningful and that meaning is actually 

61
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:21,514
produced as a consequence of the 
engagement of this exploratory circuit 

62
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,890
that's nested right down in your 
hypothalamus.

63
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:28,750
It's really,
really old.

64
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,270
It's as old as thirst and it's as old as
hunger.

65
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,980
It's really an old system and so you 
want to have that thing activated.
