1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
Okay,
well so you've got this room and it's a 

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,713
place that you can operate,
so it's actually a little bit of the 

3
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:08,400
cosmos that's under your control and so 
that's.

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,181
And you might think,
well,

5
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:10,620
it's only a room,
so who cares,

6
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:11,454
but that's the wrong attitude because 
God only knows what you can do in your 

7
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:15,564
room.
No orange may God only knows what you 

8
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:21,600
will do in your room.
Maybe only nightmares I have about knock

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,270
her in his room.
Yeah,

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,160
but so first of all,
in order to set your room up properly,

11
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:29,460
you have to know what you're going to do
in there and that means that you have to

12
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:30,294
know what you're going to do and that 
means you have to know what you should 

13
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:33,174
do.
And so part of setting up your room is 

14
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:35,094
figuring out what you should do.
And so that's hard because your room 

15
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,640
should serve your purposes and if,
unless you have purposes,

16
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:42,474
then you don't know what purpose the 
room should serve and you can't set it 

17
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:47,130
up and then so the room should.

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,490
The room should invite you to be the way
you want to be.

19
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:51,324
When you're in the room,
so if you envision yourself the way you 

20
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,550
would like yourself to be,
then you should build the room.

21
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:57,384
So it's the stage where that drama can 
take place and then if you try to make 

22
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:04,020
the room beautiful,
that will also teach you,

23
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,500
that will also improve your taste,
right?

24
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:10,200
Because maybe you have to buy a painting
and so you have to learn something about

25
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:13,380
art and you have to paint it and then 
you have to learn something about color.

26
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,130
You have to learn something about 
harmony and form and then you know,

27
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:17,851
you said,
well,

28
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:18,684
you're learning something about how to 
regulate yourself physically and 

29
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:22,584
psychologically and you're setting up 
the room so that that's going to be an 

30
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,570
easy something that you can do without 
undue complexity every day.

31
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,070
Right?
Well that can be phenomenally useful,

32
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:33,020
you know,
because it,

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,953
let's say that that adjusts the way that
you act half an hour every day just for 

34
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:38,461
example.
Okay,

35
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:43,440
so that's about three hours a week and 
that's about 150 hours a year.

36
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,863
And so that's about three weeks worth of
work weeks per year that you've changed 

37
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:52,280
in your life just by attending to the 
hammock.

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,333
And you want to get that exactly right 
because you actually need some rest and 

39
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:56,244
you need to be creative.
And so this idea of getting your room 

40
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:01,830
sorted out,
which people are,

41
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:02,991
you know,
they're,

42
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:05,850
they're having a lot of fun with and 
laughing out about a lot.

43
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:06,684
It's really.
And so I'll give you a little Christian 

44
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:11,430
interpretation about that too.
So,

45
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,593
um,
it says in the New Testament that the 

46
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,450
Kingdom of God is like a mustard seed.
And of course a mustard seed is very,

47
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:19,440
very small,
very small.

48
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,523
It,
it will build itself given the proper 

49
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:26,010
circumstances into quite a magnificent 
and complex,

50
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,500
fully developed plant,
almost a tree.

51
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,610
And so when you make your room perfect,
and that's a mustard seed,

52
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,740
that's,
that's equivalent to heaven,

53
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,200
that's what you're doing is you're 
really,

54
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:38,034
that's what you're doing is you're 
building a little microcosm of the 

55
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,810
Kingdom of God on earth.
And that,

56
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,430
that will have agreed to do it 
correctly.

57
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,510
That will have power.
