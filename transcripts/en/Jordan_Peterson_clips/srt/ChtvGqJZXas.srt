1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,970
Nothing motivates me aside from eating 
to sleeping.

2
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:03,804
I lie in my bed all day,
no one on my computer or my phone not 

3
00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:07,364
doing anything.
I just lie there thinking what's 

4
00:00:08,991 --> 00:00:12,170
happening to me.
I would say that you are.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,603
This is not a diagnostic comment and I 
don't know enough about you to provide 

6
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:17,234
that sort of information,
but I would recommend that you see a 

7
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:21,794
therapist and be screened for depression
because that's what it looks like to me 

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,670
and I would say that if it's depression 
you should do something about it because

9
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:29,504
depression is very hard on people that 
produces a lot of stress hormones like 

10
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:35,570
cortisol and that can hurt human man.
You know,

11
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:37,850
if it's only been a couple of days I 
wouldn't worry about it,

12
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:41,060
but if it's a chronic pattern then you 
should go talk to somebody.

13
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:42,650
Even your family doctor,
you know,

14
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:46,610
and there's always the possibility that 
a low dose of an antidepressant might be

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,390
worth trying.

16
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,100
You know,
in a month if it fixed you.

17
00:00:49,101 --> 00:00:52,400
But I would say don't,
don't stay in that situation now.

18
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,140
Go,
go find out,

19
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,090
do whatever you have to do to get out of
it,

20
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,383
and especially the fact that you're not 
on your computer and you're not doing 

21
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:00,771
anything,
you know,

22
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:02,120
you're,
you're ruminating,

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,133
that's just lying there thinking about 
snoop's of negative emotion and you 

24
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:08,000
don't have any positive emotion,
you know,

25
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,220
that's why you're not on your computer 
or your phone.

26
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:11,054
And so one of the characteristics of 
depression was supposed to have the 

27
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:17,300
characteristics is a decrease in 
positive motivation.

28
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,343
And so that means that you're not 
interested in anything and an increase 

29
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:23,110
in negative emotion and that can 
manifest itself in.

30
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:26,120
Now I'm just lying there thinking,
you know,

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,770
so,
um,

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,500
go talk to someone,
go talk to someone,

33
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,920
tell someone that this is happening,
gift to your family doctor,

34
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,993
let them know what's happening.
Get them to give you a depression 

35
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:40,430
screening and uh,
and see what you can do about it because

36
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:43,580
there are effective treatments for 
depression.

37
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:47,330
And sometimes antidepressants work like 
a absolute charm.
