1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,203
When my son was born,
my daughter was about year and a half 

2
00:00:03,161 --> 00:00:06,710
old and you can get pretty intense 
sibling rivalry with,

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,070
with kids aren't separated by three 
years,

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,650
doesn't mean you should separate them by
three years,

5
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:12,484
but,
but because the older kid is still 

6
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:15,610
pretty dependent,
so you got to watch that.

7
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:16,444
So the first thing we did was we talked 
to her about the new baby that was 

8
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:21,700
coming and we told her that that was 
going to be her baby,

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,080
you know,
as well as our baby.

10
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:23,914
That's your baby.
And then we taught her to get a hug and 

11
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:28,150
we had her act that out.
It's like okay,

12
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,083
when when the new baby comes,
there's going to be times when your mom 

13
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,240
was preoccupied.
You got to say it in a way,

14
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:36,340
a three year old,
one and a half year old,

15
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:37,174
something like that was one and a half 
can understand and that means acting it 

16
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:40,900
out in playing.

17
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,100
Right?
Like pretend play.

18
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,293
But the message was there'll be times 
when you're going to feel lonesome and 

19
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:47,920
you have to come and get a hug.
Well,

20
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:50,260
so then we'd have for practices like 
let's play a game,

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,150
pretend you're like,
okay,

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,800
now come and get a hug.
It's like,

23
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:54,780
okay.
She'd get a hug.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,950
This is better than the knife game.
I think it's better.

25
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,380
It's better.
It's better than the knife gate.

26
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,990
Well in so okay,
so far.

27
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:05,020
And then we had our new,
our son and we helped Mckayla,

28
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:07,430
my daughter figure out how to take care 
of him and you know,

29
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,300
when he wasn't in a half year old can 
actually take care of the baby.

30
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:12,820
They can watch the baby and the baby 
cries.

31
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:14,240
They can come and tug on you,
you know,

32
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,120
say the baby needs,
you know,

33
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:18,340
whatever the baby needs.
And so then,

34
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,893
well then there's the older child also 
gets a set of privileges because of 

35
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:23,560
that.

36
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,393
It's like,
well,

37
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,280
you're older,
you don't get to be an infant anymore.

38
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,560
That's kind of socks because mums with 
you all the time,

39
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:31,240
it's like,
what do you get in exchange?

40
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,760
You get some more freedom.
You get some more status,

41
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,670
you get some more power.
It's like it's a good trade off.

42
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,190
That's why you want to grow.
That's fine.

43
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:39,024
You want to become an adult.
You don't want to steal that from 

44
00:01:40,781 --> 00:01:42,550
people.
It's still there.

45
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,373
It's that sense.
That's the witch in Hansel and Gretel 

46
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:50,140
who fattens up the kids and eats them.
It's like compared to my layer,

47
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,640
the Latin gingerbread and candy,
you wouldn't have to do anything.

48
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,410
I'll take care of you.
It's like,

49
00:01:56,411 --> 00:01:58,360
yeah,
run away from that person.
