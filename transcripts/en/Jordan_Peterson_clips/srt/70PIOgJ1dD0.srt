1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,500
What cures in therapy is truth.
That's the curative.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,590
Now there's exposure to the things 
you're afraid of and avoiding as well,

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:08,424
but I would say that's a form of enacted
truth because if you know there's 

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,120
something you should do by your own set 
of rules and you're avoiding it,

5
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:17,700
then you're enacting a lot.
You know you're not telling one,

6
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,560
but you're acting went out.
It's the same damn thing.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,573
So if I can get you to face what it is 
that you're confronting that you know 

8
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:27,800
you shouldn't be avoiding,
then what's happening is that we're both

9
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:28,634
partaking in the process of attempting 
to act out your deepest truth and what 

10
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:36,180
happens is that that improves people's 
lives and it improves some radically and

11
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,183
the evidence,
the clinical evidence for that is 

12
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:41,210
overwhelming.
We know that if you expose people to the

13
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:43,040
things they're afraid of but that 
they're avoiding,

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,113
they get better and you have to do it 
carefully and cautiously and with their 

15
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:47,324
own participation and all of that,
but of all the things that clinicians 

16
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:53,890
have established that's credible,
that's number one,

17
00:00:53,891 --> 00:00:58,480
and that's nested inside this deeper 
realization that the clinical experience

18
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:00,250
is redemptive,
let's say,

19
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:01,084
because it is designed to address 
suffering in so far as the people who 

20
00:01:03,881 --> 00:01:04,714
are engaged in the process are both 
telling each other the truth and then 

21
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:08,620
you think,
well obviously,

22
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,570
because if you have some problems and 
you come to talk to me about them,

23
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,950
well first of all just by coming to talk
to me about them.

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,750
You've admitted that they exist.
Man.

25
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:19,510
That's a pretty good start in second.
Well,

26
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:20,344
if you tell me about them,
then we know what they are and then if 

27
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:23,614
we know what they are,
we can maybe start to lay out some 

28
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:28,570
solutions and then you can go act out 
the solutions and see if they work.

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,930
But if you don't admit they're there and
you won't tell me what they are.

30
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:32,943
And I don't,
and I'm like posturing and acting 

31
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:39,010
egotistically and taking the upper hand 
in all of that in our discussions.

32
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,600
Well,
how the hell is that going to work?

33
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,390
You know,
it might be comfortable moment to moment

34
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:45,610
while we stay encapsulated in our 
delusion,

35
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:46,444
but it's not going to work.
So a lot of that seems to think it 

36
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:50,950
through.
It seems pretty self evident.

37
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:54,390
And you know,
Freud thought that repression was at the

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,700
heart of much mental suffering.

39
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,860
The difference between repression and 
deception is matter of degree and that's

40
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:03,090
all.
It's technical.

41
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,953
It's a technical differentiation.
And Alfred Adler who was one of Freud's 

42
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,360
greatest associates,
let's say,

43
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:10,194
and much underappreciated,
I would say he thought that people got 

44
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:15,570
into problems because they started to 
act out a life lie.

45
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,413
That's what he called it,
a life lie that's worth looking up 

46
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:20,610
because Adler,
although not as charismatic as Freud,

47
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,713
was very practical and,
and really foreshadowed lot of later 

48
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,124
developments and cybernetic theory and 
of course young believed that you could 

49
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,400
bypass psychotherapy entirely by merely 
making a proper moral effort in your own

50
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:36,660
life.
And Carl Rogers believed that.

51
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:37,494
It was honest communication mediated 
through dialogue that had redemptive 

52
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,443
consequences and the behaviors believe 
that you do a careful micro analysis of 

53
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:46,794
the problems that are laid before you 
would help introduce people to what 

54
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:50,094
they're avoiding.
It's like all of those things to me are 

55
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:53,034
just secular variations of the notion 
that truth will set you free 

56
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,173
essentially.
