1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,160
The case,
and this is practically speaking,

2
00:00:03,161 --> 00:00:03,994
is that it is not at all unreasonable to
think of God the father as the spirit 

3
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:11,860
that arises from the crowd that exists 
into the future.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,113
Right,
and that's we talked about that in 

5
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:16,540
relationship to the idea of sacrifice at
least a little bit more,

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,610
or we're going to make sacrifices in the
present so that the future is happy with

7
00:00:21,611 --> 00:00:23,130
you.
The question is,

8
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:25,770
what is that future that would be happy 
with you?

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,580
And the answer to that is it's the 
spirit of humanity.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,503
That's who you're negotiating with 
because you make the assumption that if 

11
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:36,720
you forgo impulsive pleasure and get 
your medical degree,

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,050
that when you're done in 10 years and 
you're a physician,

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,363
humanity as such will honor your 
sacrifice and commitment and open the 

14
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:47,170
doors to you.
Right?

15
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:48,004
So you're treating the future as if it's
a single being and you're also treating 

16
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:54,160
it as if it's some something like a 
compassionate judge.

17
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,143
You're acting that out and maybe we had 
to imagine God in that form before we 

18
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:03,360
could understand.
Once we started to understand that there

19
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:04,194
was a future,
perhaps we had to imagine God in that 

20
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:06,654
form in order to concretize something 
that we could bargain with so that we 

21
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:10,644
could figure out how to use sacrifice to
figure out how to guide ourselves into 

22
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:16,200
the future because as sacrifices,
a contract with the future,

23
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,600
but it's not a contract with any 
particular person,

24
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:19,434
it's.
It's a contract with the spirit of 

25
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:23,190
humanity as such.
It's something like that,

26
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,443
and so when you think about it that way,
that should make you faint with 

27
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,863
amazement because that is such a bloody 
amazing idea to come up with that idea 

28
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:34,200
that you can bargain with the future.
That is some idea,

29
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:35,040
man.
That's,

30
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,310
that's like the major idea of human,
of humankind.

31
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,350
We suffer.
What do we do about it?

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,400
We figured out how to bargain with the 
future and we minimize suffering in that

33
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:45,234
manner.
It's like no other animal does that 

34
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:47,101
either.
You know,

35
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:48,630
like the lions,
they just eat everything.

36
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,900
I think a wolf can eat 40 pounds of meat
in a single city.

37
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,550
Right?
It's like there's some meat,

38
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:54,384
eat it.
It's not like save some mammoth for 

39
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,890
tomorrow.
That's,

40
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,120
that's,
that's not a wolf thing,

41
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,220
man.
That's a human thing and that might mean

42
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:04,740
you have to be hungry today or maybe 
you're a farmer,

43
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:06,570
you know,
several thousand years ago,

44
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:07,404
6,000
years ago or so with agriculture first 

45
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:09,624
got going and you're starving to death 
waiting for the spring planting and you 

46
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:14,880
think we built it bloody well,
better not eat those seeds.

47
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,453
Right?
And that's really something to be able 

48
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:20,180
to control yourself,
to make the future real,

49
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,320
to put off what you could use today and 
not just in some impulsive manner,

50
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:26,180
man,
maybe your kids are starving to death.

51
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:27,014
You think we are not touching the seeds 
that we need for the future and for 

52
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:31,874
human beings to have discovered that and
then to also have figured out that we 

53
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:35,450
could bargain with the future.
It's like,

54
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:37,970
man,
that's something and I think that that.

55
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,060
I think that the stories that are laid 
out in this book actually describe,

56
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,310
at least in part the process by which 
that occurred.
