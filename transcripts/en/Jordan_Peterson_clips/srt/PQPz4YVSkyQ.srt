1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,720
Any tips on avoiding booze?
Yeah,

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:05,100
that's a real tough one.
Well,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,100
I would say a couple of things.
There is a drug.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:08,963
If you're a binge drinker,
there is a drug called naltrexone that 

5
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:14,930
you could consider and you take 
naltrexone every day.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,780
It doesn't really have any psychological
effect on you,

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,220
but if you're a nail trucks don't 
respond.

8
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,054
Or what will happen is that it will 
dampen your positive response to 

9
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:26,700
alcohol.
So some people who are alcoholic,

10
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:30,480
many of them have a very pronounced 
opiate is uh,

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,513
an opiate effect from alcohol.
It looks like it's mediated by Beta 

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,970
endorphin and now trucks into is an 
opiate blocker.

13
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:40,440
And so,
um,

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,173
what naltrexone seems to do is dampen 
the positive response and the positive 

15
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:47,274
response which would be opiate.
And then dopaminergic is the same 

16
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:54,750
response that makes you want to keep 
drinking when you start drinking.

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,570
So if you're one of those people that 
has a drink and then has to have another

18
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:58,404
one,
then has to have another one and you 

19
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:00,960
know,
soon all your money's gone.

20
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,650
Then the probability that you have an 
opiate response is pretty high.

21
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:07,450
And now trucks can help with that.
Um,

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,290
generally when people take Naltrexone,
nick,

23
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,080
keep drinking,
they try to control but to keep drinking

24
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:17,160
it and they learn over time that the 
alcohol doesn't have the same punch,

25
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,023
still pleasant but doesn't have the same
overwhelming punch than it did at one 

26
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:23,730
point.
So that would be one suggestion.

27
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,720
And it's worth drawing the other reasons
like makeup plan,

28
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,780
I would say do the future authoring 
program,

29
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:30,614
you know,
because it isn't that you're trying to 

30
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,420
avoid booze.
Exactly.

31
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,420
It's that you're trying to restructure 
your whole life,

32
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,313
you know,
because if you're a drinker than all 

33
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:39,804
your friends are drinkers and,
and you're used to drinking in every 

34
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:43,494
social situation and the places that you
go to socialize or places that you 

35
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:47,634
drank,
tim,

36
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,190
like it's really built in as a whole set
of habits.

37
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,730
And so what you have to do is kind of 
redesign your life.

38
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:57,480
And you have to think of things.
You can't just stop drinking.

39
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,010
You have to figure out what you're going
to start doing instead of drinking.

40
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,903
There's a hole that you have to fill in 
and you know the future authoring 

41
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:06,984
program will also helped you figure out 
what your life could look like in the 

42
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:10,404
absence of alcohol and what kind of Hell
you could end up being if you keep 

43
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:19,410
drinking and it causes all the problems 
that it can cause and I think you really

44
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:20,244
need to like,
you need to think through the hell that 

45
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:23,514
can occur and you have to think through 
how your life could be valuable without 

46
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,980
alcohol so that you can be motivated 
enough to to try to,

47
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,233
to regulate it.
And I would also say if you fail and 

48
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:36,684
slip,
don't berate yourself and beat yourself 

49
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:39,570
up.

50
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,403
Just start quitting again because you 
know if you can cut your alcohol intake 

51
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:47,340
down 75 percent,
that's a hell of lot better than zero.

52
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,563
And often people go all or nothing just 
like they do with their quitting 

53
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,900
cigarettes and she quit for a month and 
then have a cigarette and say,

54
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:57,780
oh my God,
now I'm now I've broken the pact.

55
00:02:57,781 --> 00:03:00,670
And then they'll smoke a whole pack.
They'd be smoking again.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,833
You don't have to do that.
You can just decide that you slept and 

57
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,224
that you're going gonna get back on the 
wagon again and now it can take a long 

58
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:09,514
time,
but I do believe that you need a better 

59
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:12,910
vision of life,
right?

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,833
You have to find something to do with 
it's better than alcohol and that might 

61
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:19,090
take some,
some real consideration,

62
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:23,260
especially if alcohol is a very potent 
drug for you.

63
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,960
Then I would also say don't hesitate to 
try the NALTREXONE.

64
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,853
This,
it's got a pretty decent clinical 

65
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,770
history and it's basically harmless.
So.
