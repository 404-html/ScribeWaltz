00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,410
So I got a story to tell you that you 
might like,

2
00:00:02,411 --> 00:00:04,780
because I've thought a lot about that 
use of language,

3
00:00:04,781 --> 00:00:05,614
you know,
because language can be used as 

4
00:00:07,121 --> 00:00:09,280
camouflage.
And so here's the story.

5
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:10,114
I think I got this from Robert Sapolsky,
so he was talking about zebras and 

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:15,903
zebras of course have stripes and 
hypothetically that's associated with 

7
00:00:18,341 --> 00:00:19,174
camouflage,
but it's not a straightforward 

8
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:24,880
association because zebras are black and
white and they're on the velt along with

9
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:25,714
the lions.
The lions are camouflage because their 

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,353
grasp colored.
But the bloody zebras are black and 

11
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:32,170
white.
You can see them like 15 miles away.

12
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,400
So okay.
So biologists go out to study zebras and

13
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:39,820
they're like making notes on a zebra and
they watch it and then they look down at

14
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:41,440
their notes and then they look up and 
they think,

15
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,483
oh no,
I don't know which Zebra I was looking 

16
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:45,010
at.

17
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,210
So the camouflage is actually against 
the herd because the zebras,

18
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,870
a herd animal,
not an individual.

19
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:50,704
And so the black and white stripes 
breakup the animal against the herd so 

20
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:54,454
you can't identify it.
So this was a quandary for the 

21
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:58,420
biologists.
So they did one of two things,

22
00:00:58,421 --> 00:01:01,180
one was drive a jeep up to the,
to the zebra,

23
00:01:01,181 --> 00:01:04,450
heard and use a dab of red paint and Dab
the horn.

24
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:08,080
Should the zebra or tag it with an ear 
tag like used for cattle.

25
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,950
The lions would kill it.
So as soon as it became identifiable the

26
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:15,280
Predator,
yes,

27
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,890
the predators could organize their hunt 
around that.

28
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:21,130
Identify all about animal.
That's why you know there's the old idea

29
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:23,530
that lions and predators take down the 
weak animals,

30
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:26,380
but they don't.
They take down the identifiable animals.

31
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,470
So that's the thing is if you stick your
damn head up,

32
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,510
you get picked off by predators.

33
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,343
And so one of the things that academics 
seem to do is congregate together in 

34
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:37,900
heard like entities and then they share 
a language,

35
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:38,734
right?
And the language unites them and also 

36
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,093
keeps them.
As long as they share the same set of 

37
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:44,674
linguistic tools among themselves there,
they know that there isn't anybody in 

38
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:48,694
the,
in the codery that's going to attack 

39
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:53,140
them or deed destabilize the entire 
herd.

40
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,920
And that seems to me to account for that
impenetrable use of language.

41
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:57,850
It's,
it's,

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,713
it's group protection strategy and it 
has absolutely nothing to do with the 

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,673
search for.
It's the search for security within a 

44
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:07,510
system and not the desire to expand the 
system.
