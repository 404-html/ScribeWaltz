1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,900
There's some lovely representations of 
of Paradise.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,540
This is a garden of earthly delights.
What's his name?

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,740
Say That Bosh?
Yes.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,460
Hieronymus Bosch.
He has a crazy.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,353
I mean if you,
how he didn't get burnt at the stake is 

6
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:21,460
absolutely beyond me.
I mean,

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,950
you know,
some of you know about Salvador Dali,

8
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:24,784
I suppose most of you do.
I mean delis a piker compared to 

9
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:27,970
Hieronymus Bosch.
Man,

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,170
you could spend because there's three 
pieces of this particular painting.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,280
You could spend a very bizarre and 
surreal month looking at that painting.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,833
I don't know what it was with Bosch,
but he was some sort of creature that 

13
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:46,570
only popped up once and probably for the
best.

14
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,603
And so there's been very many 
representations of Paradise Mean God 

15
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:57,601
only knows what that is.
It's like I could probably guess,

16
00:00:57,701 --> 00:01:00,340
but I won't.
And then look,

17
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:01,390
I mean that's,
that's,

18
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,460
that's the lion lying down with the 
lamb.

19
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,293
Right?
So that's this idea that's maybe 

20
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:09,100
projected back in time that there was a 
time or maybe will be a time when,

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,353
when the,
the horrors of life are no longer 

22
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:15,490
necessary for life itself to exist.
Right.

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,613
And the horrors of life,
or of course that everything eats 

24
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,330
everything else and that everything dies
and that everything is born in the whole

25
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:23,164
bloody places at charnel house and it's,
it's a catastrophe from beginning to 

26
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:27,310
end.
And this is,

27
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,340
this is the vision of it being.
Other than that.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,070
And you know,
there's a strong idea.

29
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:33,933
This was also in implicit in the 
alchemical ideas and I think it's also 

30
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:37,564
implicit in the scientific revolution 
that human beings can interact with 

31
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:43,744
reality in such a way so that the tragic
and evil elements of it can be 

32
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:47,464
mitigated.
And so that we can move somewhat closer 

33
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:51,940
to a state that might be characterized.
Well,

34
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:52,774
that's obviously imagistic,
but it might be characterized by 

35
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:58,240
something like that where we have the 
benefits of actual existence without all

36
00:01:58,241 --> 00:02:00,490
of the catastrophe.
That seems to go along with it.
