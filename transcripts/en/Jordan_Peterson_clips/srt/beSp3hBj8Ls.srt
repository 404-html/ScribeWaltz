What do I think of Paul Joseph Watson 
supposition that populism is the new 

2
00:00:04,451 --> 00:00:08,140
punk slash counterculture?
That's a good question.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,153
I mean you see that you see,
I would say some indication of that on 

4
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:12,364
Youtube,
although it's not easy to get an 

5
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:14,824
unbiased sample of what's going on on 
Youtube because of course youtube tends 

6
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:19,864
to present you with things that are akin
to the things that you're already 

7
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:23,854
watching.
It does appear to me that the 

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,273
conservative commentators on youtube are
playing somewhat of the same role that 

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,000
the counterculture played.
Let's call it more traditionally,

10
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:39,460
even though that's a funny thing to say 
about the counterculture.

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,623
What I'm wondering more is whether or 
not not so much whether it's a 

12
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:44,614
counterculture,
but if it's something that's more 

13
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:48,790
specifically associated with a place 
that men,

14
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,030
young men are finding their new 
political voice online.

15
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,180
Part of the reason that I'm wondering 
about that,

16
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,014
although there are a number of female 
conservative commentators who also 

17
00:00:58,241 --> 00:00:59,074
become popular online,
is because many of the commentators 

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,130
appear to be man and many of the people 
who are following them also appear to be

19
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:07,720
mad.
And so,

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,800
and it's not obvious to me that men,
it's easy now for men,

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,880
especially young men,
to have a political voice on campus,

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,190
for example,
or perhaps even in public.

23
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,653
Um,
and so maybe they're turning to youtube 

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,473
to,
to find these viewpoints that aren't 

25
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:29,830
being destroyed,
disseminated widely in the,

26
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,690
in the popular media.
