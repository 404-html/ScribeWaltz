00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,210
The act of eating,
especially if you're hungry,

2
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:03,044
especially if you're starving,
produces a rapid spiritual 

3
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:05,930
transformation,
right?

4
00:00:05,931 --> 00:00:07,400
I mean,
some of you,

5
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,263
this is worth knowing.
You probably have a crabby partner or 

6
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:11,354
child because everyone does and one 
thing you might try is that if they get 

7
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:20,051
erratic during the day and you know,
get all volatile about nothing at all,

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,820
it's given them something to eat.
Really.

9
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:24,160
I'll tell you,
a man needs this souls.

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,210
If I do this with my clinical clients 
all the time,

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,770
it's like they say,
well,

12
00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:29,480
I fly off the handle at the littlest 
things.

13
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:30,160
It's like,
okay,

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,460
yeah,
I'll just try this for a week.

15
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,020
When when you're crabby and 
unreasonable,

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,050
eat a piece of cheese or eat a peanut 
butter sandwich,

17
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,270
eat something that's high protein,
high fat,

18
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,373
and then just wait 10 minutes and see if
you're sane and you'll find out that 

19
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:42,973
you're saying after you eat so often 
that you just can't believe how crazy 

20
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:49,600
you are when you're hungry.
Here's.

21
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,490
It's really absolutely bloody 
remarkable.

22
00:00:52,491 --> 00:00:53,900
So I'm telling you,
try this.

23
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:54,440
It'll,
it'll,

24
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,273
it'll.
If especially if you don't eat 

25
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:58,670
breakfast,
this will change your life.
