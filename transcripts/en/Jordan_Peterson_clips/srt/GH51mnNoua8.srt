1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,990
I've,
I've,

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,990
I've gone around and spoken and a large 
proportion of my audience has been young

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:07,160
man.
He,

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,510
you know,
under 30 something like that.

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,650
And I've spoken to them a lot about 
responsibility.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,023
And what's so odd about,
about this is that of all the things 

7
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:19,794
that I've spoken about,
cause I can see the audience and I can 

8
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:22,134
feel how the audience is reacting 
because I'm always paying attention to 

9
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:26,550
all of you.
It's in so far as I can manage that.

10
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:31,470
So I get some sense of how what I'm 
saying is landing,

11
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:32,304
you know,
which you have to do if you're going to 

12
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:35,310
speak effectively to people.
And what,

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,100
what happens is if I talk about 
responsibilities,

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,280
everyone b is silent just like they are 
now.

15
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,530
It's silent and,
and not moving,

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,780
right?
Focusing attentive.

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:46,963
Say Pick up your responsibility,
pick up the heaviest thing you can and 

18
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:51,384
carry it.
And the room goes quiet and everybody's 

19
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:53,964
eyes open.
And I think that always makes me break 

20
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:59,490
up.
I was,

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,173
I don't,
I don't know why I was speaking to an 

22
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:15,300
English journalist today who's going to 
write an article in spectator magazine.

23
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,260
I was talking about this and at the same
point in the discussion the same,

24
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,380
I had the same emotional reaction.
I don't really understand it.

25
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,170
It's,
I think it's something,

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,330
there's something about it that's so 
crucial because you know,

27
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:28,164
we've been fed this on ending diet of 
rights and freedoms and there's 

28
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:31,974
something about that especially,
there's something about that that so 

29
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:38,190
pathologically wrong and people are 
starving for the antidote.

30
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:41,550
And the antidote is truth and 
responsibility,

31
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,540
right?
And it isn't.

32
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,850
It isn't because that's what you should 
do.

33
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:45,950
And some,
you know,

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,193
in some,
some I know better or someone knows 

35
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:52,740
better for you,
what you should do.

36
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:54,870
Since it's that,
it's that it's that,

37
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,210
it's that that's the secret to a 
meaningful life.

38
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,043
And without a meaningful life,
then all you have is suffering and 

39
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,480
nihilism and despair and all of that and
self contempt.

40
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:05,250
And,
and that's not good.

41
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:06,084
And so the man,
it's necessary for men to stand up and 

42
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:14,751
take responsibility and they all know 
that and are starving for that message.

43
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:16,734
And the message is more that that's also
a good thing to stand up and take 

44
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:23,130
responsibility because you're cursed so 
much now from,

45
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:23,910
from,
from,

46
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,743
from when you're young with this notion 
that your active engagement with the 

47
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:32,280
world is part of what is destroying and 
undermining the planet and adding to the

48
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:34,260
tyranny of the social systems.
It's like,

49
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,150
how about not so much of that,
hey,

50
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,420
because it's,
it's,

51
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,390
it's,
it's two soul deadening.

52
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:42,960
It's anti human right to the core.
And my sense instead is that,

53
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,103
you know,
if you,

54
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,540
if you were able to reveal the best of 
yourself to you in the world,

55
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:52,050
that you would be an overwhelming force 
for good.

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,273
And that whatever errors might be made 
along the way would wash out in the 

57
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:57,294
works.
And that's the other thing that you see 

58
00:02:58,171 --> 00:02:59,004
in the abrahamic stories.
Because Abraham is not a perfect person 

59
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,973
by any stretch of the imagination.
He's a real person and he makes 

60
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:07,090
mistakes,
but it doesn't matter.

61
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:09,150
The overarching narrative is,
you know,

62
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,320
maintain your covenant with God and 
despite your inadequacies,

63
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,100
then not only will you prevail,
but your descendants will prevail.

64
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:19,240
It's like,
great,

65
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,800
that's really good news.
You know?

66
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,380
So it's been really something to see 
that in the,

67
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,850
in the stories.
