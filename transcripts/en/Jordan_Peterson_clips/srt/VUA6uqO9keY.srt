1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,170
What's my advice to young men seeking a 
woman for marriage and family?

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,450
You can't eliminate the necessity of 
being attracted to one another.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,940
That's important.
And that's mysterious,

4
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:12,720
you know?
Um,

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,430
so for example,
here's a funny thing.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:15,983
One of the things we know that attracts 
people to one another is bilateral 

7
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:19,014
symmetry.
And so if you take men and you ranked 

8
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:23,274
them by the symmetry of their faces and 
then you give the asymmetrical men tee 

9
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:30,114
shirts to wear clean tee shirts for a 
day and the symmetrical men clean t 

10
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:34,344
shirts to wear for a day.
And then you give the t shirts to women 

11
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:38,850
and you have them rate the,
the older,

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,283
the women rate the odor of the 
symmetrical men as more attractive than 

13
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:44,814
the odor of the asymmetrical men.
And there were other factors that 

14
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:52,320
determined sexual attractiveness that 
are based on biological factors that are

15
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,690
so that deeply embedded in terms of 
smell,

16
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:55,320
for example.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,480
So a women also tend to,
uh,

18
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,290
not be sexually attracted to the old,
to the scent of men whose,

19
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,210
who have,
if I remember correctly,

20
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:11,211
it's rh factors that would make for 
potential trouble in childbirth.

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,253
And the often,
the reason that the women give for not 

22
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:16,914
preferring the scent of those men is 
that they smell too much like their 

23
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:20,700
brother,
something like that.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,060
So there was weird,
mysterious things that determine whether

25
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:26,640
or not people are sexually and 
physically attracted to each other.

26
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:30,360
And I think it's very important that 
that's part of a marital relationship.

27
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,720
The next most important thing is trust.
Man.

28
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,613
It's like there.
There's no marriage that's successful 

29
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:40,830
without trust you guys.
You got to tell each other the truth.

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,113
And one of the reasons that you'll 
believe that marriage as a and an oath 

31
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:46,950
and Carl,
uhm,

32
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,110
as a bond was necessary.

33
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,580
It's really wise.
It's like,

34
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,683
you know,
telling the truth to someone is no 

35
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,920
simple thing because there's a bunch of 
things about all of us that are terrible

36
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,150
in weak and reprehensible and shameful 
and all of those things.

37
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:02,940
And they kind of have to be brought out 
into the open and dealt with.

38
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,223
And you're not going to tell the truth 
about yourself to someone who can run 

39
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:09,840
away screaming when you reveal who you 
are.

40
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,110
And so the,
the marriage bond is something like,

41
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,430
okay,
here's the deal,

42
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,703
I'm going to handcuff myself to you and 
you're going to handcuff yourself to me 

43
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,610
and then we're going to tell each other 
the truth and neither of us are going to

44
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:25,530
get to run away.
And so our,

45
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,260
once we know the truth,
then we're either going to live together

46
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:29,094
in mutual torment or we're going to try 
to deal with that truth and straighten 

47
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:34,200
ourselves out and straighten ourselves 
out jointly.

48
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,213
And that's going to make us more 
powerful and more resilient and deeper 

49
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:41,820
and wiser as we progress together 
through life.

50
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,063
And,
and I think that's absolutely brilliant 

51
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:46,110
because if you leave the backdoor open,
man,

52
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:47,550
you're going to use it,
that's for sure.

53
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,593
And the oath is there.
And this was young's commentary on the 

54
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,083
spiritualization of,
of the human pair of bond and by 

55
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,240
Christian marriage,
for example,

56
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,720
which,
which emphasized,

57
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,470
what would you call it,
the subordination of both members of the

58
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:03,304
marital union to a higher order,
a personality that was embodied in the 

59
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:09,964
figure of the logos.
So the idea is that in an in an in the 

60
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:13,870
Christian marriage,
for example,

61
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,260
the man isn't the boss and the woman 
isn't the boss.

62
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,410
The boss is the mutual personality 
composed by the seeking of truth in both

63
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:26,250
of them.
And that's conceptualized as their,

64
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,450
their joint subjugation to the logos.

65
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,450
And that is absolutely dead on man.
It's like the ruler of your marital life

66
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:34,624
should be your vow to tell each other 
the truth because like in hard times 

67
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:39,964
during your life,
when you've done something stupid and 

68
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:42,214
idiotic,
that might take you down and you don't 

69
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:45,860
have anybody that you can turn to.
You know,

70
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,710
if you have a partner that you can 
trust,

71
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:48,670
you can go say,
hey,

72
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:49,504
you know,
I made a big financial mistake man and 

73
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:52,024
it's really torturing me and I feel like
a complete idiot and it's really 

74
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:55,144
dangerous.
And the person there is going to help 

75
00:03:56,951 --> 00:04:00,220
you figure out what to do about it.
And they're going to know that when they

76
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:02,620
make a stupid mistake and they're bloody
well going to,

77
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:05,650
that they can come and talk to you and 
that you guys are going to work your way

78
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:06,130
through it.

79
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:06,963
And that's a big deal.
And there's a couple of things our 

80
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:12,700
culture gets really wrong and one is it 
devalues marriage.

81
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,790
That's really a very bad idea because 
marriages,

82
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,013
marriages like a third of your life and 
maybe more and kids are a third of your 

83
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:22,610
life and your,
your,

84
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,350
your life outside of marriage and kids 
is a third of your life,

85
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,633
you know,
approximately speaking and to miss any 

86
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:33,100
of that is a massive,
massive mistake.

87
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,560
Now,
having said that,

88
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,603
I will also say that for some people 
missing one or more of those is 

89
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,330
necessary because they have a reason.
You know,

90
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:44,164
maybe they're brilliantly creative 
artists and they need to devote 

91
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:49,690
themselves entirely to their career or 
they're outstanding in some way.

92
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:50,524
And so they need,
they can justify the sacrifice of one 

93
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:55,780
part of that triad of being to another 
part.

94
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:58,790
But for a generally speaking,
it's a very dangerous thing.

95
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,623
And,
and it,

96
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,820
it,
it shouldn't be done.

97
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,940
And also kids get an absolutely terrible
rap,

98
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,893
you know,
because kids are delightful if they're 

99
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,014
well behaved.
One of the chapters in my new book is 

100
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:12,970
called don't let your children do 
anything that makes you dislike them.

101
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,013
And you can do that,
especially if you discuss it thoroughly 

102
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:17,164
with your spouse.
You're the person that's helping you 

103
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:19,774
discipline the kids and children are the
best company because they're really 

104
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:26,320
enthusiastic about everything they love 
doing new things.

105
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,140
They really love you.
So they're happy that you're around.

106
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,543
Um,
all you have to do is make sure they're 

107
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:35,110
not too hot and they're not too cold and
they've had something to eat and they're

108
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:35,944
not too tired and you don't expect them 
to stay engaged in something for longer 

109
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:41,764
than they can manage.
Because we used to take our kids when 

110
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:45,010
they were little out to restaurants for 
example.

111
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,843
And they could sit there no problem and 
behave really nicely when they were two 

112
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:48,874
and three,
but they couldn't do it for more than 

113
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:52,660
about 45 minutes.
He can't push your luck.

114
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,853
But I also noticed with little kids is 
that they got antsy and unreasonable 

115
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,530
about five to 10 minutes before the 
adults did too.

116
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:02,510
It's just the adults were too stupid to 
notice.

117
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:04,970
The kids would notice right away.
So back to marriage,

118
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:06,830
when you look for someone that you're 
attracted to,

119
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,693
that you love,
and then you look for someone that you 

120
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:09,674
can bloody well trust,
and then you tell them the truth and 

121
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,993
that way maybe you can get through life 
and you can have someone to weave the 

122
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:18,314
rope of your being with and together to 
make to make your joint ropes stronger 

123
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:23,564
and you can have some continuity in your
narrative and you can have children and 

124
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:26,984
then you can have grandchildren and like
you can have a life man and there's 

125
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:30,884
nothing.

126
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,250
You're so fortunate.
If you can manage that and also,

127
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:35,084
you know,
marry someone you think would be a good 

128
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,990
mother and that has enough sense.
Generally speaking,

129
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:40,850
to know that she wants children.
Now,

130
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:41,743
some women don't want children and fair 
enough and some women perhaps shouldn't 

131
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,200
have children.
That's also possible.

132
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:52,660
But the general rule of thumb is,
especially once a woman's,

133
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:53,990
you know,
in her mid twenties,

134
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,430
if she doesn't know that she wants 
children or won't admit it,

135
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:02,300
unless she has a viciously important 
reason,

136
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,800
then she's not oriented properly.
Psychologically she,

137
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,850
she,
she isn't.

138
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,100
She doesn't know what's important in 
life.

139
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,260
Now,
that might also be the case with you,

140
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:14,450
and it probably is.
But as a rule of thumb,

141
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:15,380
that's a really good one.
