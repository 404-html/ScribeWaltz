1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,450
We talked a little bit about this,
uh,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,410
over a drink we had a couple of weeks 
ago,

3
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:07,080
but what about the couples that have no 
kids,

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,660
couples that just say,
you know,

5
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:10,494
we're,
we're more interested in our 

6
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:13,740
intellectual pursuits or traveling or 
something.

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,580
You think they are really missing sort 
of like a key component of,

8
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,930
of what life is,
right?

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,420
I do.
I really believe that.

10
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:21,620
I mean,
I think they don't.

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,740
I think the kids have a bad rap.
That's the problem.

12
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:27,200
That's also why I wrote this chapter in 
part because,

13
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,940
you know,
you see this too,

14
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,890
a lot of Hollywood depictions of 
children's,

15
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:34,950
very rare that you see children 
portrayed knowably in,

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,780
in a,
in a,

17
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,810
in a Hollywood film.
You kind of saw with Harry Potter.

18
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,450
I liked that and that's partly why that 
was so popular.

19
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:43,190
I mean those kids had some,
you know,

20
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:45,740
there were bad kids and they were good 
kids and they're heroic kids.

21
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:48,140
Like they were treated pretty in some 
sense,

22
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:50,330
realistically given that it was such a 
magical,

23
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,430
you know,
enterprise and,

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,473
and,
but they had some courage and they had 

25
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:57,140
some heart and they had some 
rebelliousness and so,

26
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,243
so I liked that.
But the thing that you have to 

27
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:02,960
understand about kids is they're 
unbelievably good company,

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,273
you know,
and so they pay you back for your care 

29
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:11,070
of them and by being ridiculously a 
music there,

30
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:11,963
their little clouds and they're doing 
crazy little stunts all the time and 

31
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:17,210
they have a sense of humor that kicks 
in.

32
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,210
Like I have a grandchild now that's two 
and a half months old and that child can

33
00:01:22,851 --> 00:01:26,750
already smile and has the beginnings of 
a sense of humor.

34
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,771
And that's,
to me,

35
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:29,840
that's a miracle.
It is.

36
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:32,360
It.
And so they're very funny.

37
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,460
They're really playful.
They really,

38
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,294
really like you.
And you can have the kind of 

39
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,610
relationship with them that you set out 
to have.

40
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,550
And so that's very,
very interesting now.

41
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:45,830
And you can also,
like once I had little kids,

42
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:48,740
I spent a lot more time with them than I
did with my friends.

43
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,603
Say.
And the reason for that was that I 

44
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:53,114
actually found it more enjoyable to do 
things with little kids than with the 

45
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:59,180
adults.
And the reason for that is like,

46
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,103
by the time you're 30,
say you've seen so much of the world 

47
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,080
that you actually don't see the world 
anymore.

48
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,150
And this is technically true.

49
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,090
Like I'm old,
I'm 55 when I walked down the street,

50
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,800
there's houses,
I don't look at them,

51
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,550
I have house icons in my memory and I 
just see the house icons and,

52
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:18,384
and so the older you get in some sense,
the more what you see of the world is 

53
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:25,430
your memory and that's kind of,
it's efficient,

54
00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:27,670
but it's sort of dad,
you know,

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,720
and,
and artists help break through that.

56
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:34,640
They show you something as if it's new 
again,

57
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,750
you know.
And,

58
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,010
and so that's why van Gogh's irises will
sell for $160,000,000.

59
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:43,070
It's like you haven't looked at flowers 
since you were three.

60
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,623
Okay.
So the thing that's cool about having 

61
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:46,574
little kid is everywhere you go.
Because we're so good at putting 

62
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:55,070
ourselves in other people's bodies.
The kid revitalizes the world.

63
00:02:55,071 --> 00:02:56,120
And the kid's like,
oh,

64
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,970
I mean that's what a two year old looks 
like all the time.

65
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,080
They're just completely awestruck by 
everything.

66
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,680
And you can see that again.
And that's really interesting

67
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,753
man.
I know you know about my love of star 

68
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:08,884
wars,
but I watched empire strikes back with 

69
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:12,640
my five year old at the time,
nephew.

70
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,730
And at the moment when darth vader told 
he was his father,

71
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,573
I was staring at him and he loves star 
wars and I was looking at him and the 

72
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:22,000
way his eyes opened,
I was like,

73
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,590
wow.
Like what?

74
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,300
That,
that thing,

75
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:28,600
like that's what it's all about,
that's what it's all like as an adult.

76
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:32,110
How could I ever as a 41 year old have 
that experience again?

77
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,720
And that's what you're talking about,
about and,

78
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,660
and a movie is art.

79
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,950
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

80
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:36,784
Well,
I took my daughter to see the mask with 

81
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:41,440
Jim Carrey when she gets like a little 
bit young for that.

82
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,340
Um,
and I held her on my lap during,

83
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,710
I think she was,
she was probably only about five,

84
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,170
maybe something like that.
But I took her out one night.

85
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,370
We went,
saw the mask and it's pretty intense and

86
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,213
it was like holding a,
what would you call a bundle of 

87
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:01,600
electrically charged barbed wire for an 
hour and a half.

88
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:05,620
She was just like that and like I said,
it was perhaps a bit much for her,

89
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,690
but he had the knife.
It was exactly.

90
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,190
But I mean you,
you,

91
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,980
you forget how much impact the world has
and you know,

92
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,170
if you bring little kids around,
old people,

93
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:19,600
you can really see this [inaudible] old 
people will sit around.

94
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,650
Like when we first had my daughter,
when she was the first grandchild on my,

95
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,693
my side,
we'd take her up to this lake that I go 

96
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:29,560
to see my parents that way,
the hell up in northern Alberta.

97
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,663
And she was like a little fire.
You know how people sit around a fire 

98
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:34,750
and look at it,
they can't look away.

99
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,613
It's because we're all the descendants 
of the first crazy chimpanzee who 

100
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:40,780
couldn't keep his God dammit fire,
you know?

101
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,170
And that's what little kids are like 
and,

102
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,013
and the older people just watch them 
nonstop and it's partly because they're 

103
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,600
participating in that renewal of the 
world,

104
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:50,800
you know,
which is like,

105
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:51,634
it's like a reintroduction to the 
unsalted paradise of being something 

106
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:58,390
like that.
But it only works if the,

107
00:04:58,391 --> 00:04:59,224
if you like your kids.
And so there's a disciplinary element 

108
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:03,064
that's really important too.
And one of the things that modern 

109
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:05,824
parents don't understand,
and I think this is because of the 

110
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,770
exceptionally permissive ethos of the 19
sixties,

111
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:15,220
were when we developed this idea that 
everything that society does to children

112
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:20,221
is bad and so don't damage your children
by putting restrictions on them.

113
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,873
It's like,
that's just not so wrong that it's 

114
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:24,274
almost impossible.
It's why people shy away from kids 

115
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,453
because they don't understand that you 
don't have to put up with any 

116
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,563
unpleasant.
You don't have to put up with any 

117
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:37,210
unnecessary unpleasant nonsense from 
children.

118
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,830
It's not necessary.

119
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,080
It's interesting.
So the.

120
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:40,914
You could almost argue that the sixties 
led to exactly what you're talking 

121
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:46,014
about.
These kids who then were taught to be 

122
00:05:47,611 --> 00:05:50,190
afraid of everything.
They become a mess there,

123
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:51,024
the parents have now,
and that's probably in part why they're 

124
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:57,980
having less children or at least talking
about family and children in a

125
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,520
different way when there's.
There's also less trust in the structure

126
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:04,820
of the family because the divorce rate 
has proliferated and it's hard.

127
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,983
Like there was a woman in our department
in the psychology department who's 

128
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,070
allison,
what's Helen's last name?

129
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,960
She's going to hate me if she ever 
watches this.

130
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,710
I can't think of it.
We'll post the full post.

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,180
You're going to get it the second week 
and I hope that's right.

132
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:21,890
It's probably not.
Anyways,

133
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,113
she showed that if you.
If you interfere with the maternal 

134
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:30,050
relationship between rats and they're 
pops because children are called pops,

135
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,453
that you can see the detrimental effects
of that disruption three generations 

136
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:37,130
later.
Right?

137
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,060
Yeah.
So you know,

138
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,953
you disrupt those early bonds,
you disrupt the familial structure that 

139
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:43,250
echoes.
It takes.

140
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,560
It's like an oral tradition in some 
sense,

141
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:46,394
you know,
because being a good mother is not just 

142
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:49,430
something that you're taught.

143
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,470
It's something that you kind of have in 
your bones.

144
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:54,500
If you were mothered properly.
Like my father was an excellent father,

145
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,663
especially when I was a little kid.
He really spent a lot of time with me 

146
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,430
and I used to love it when he came home 
and,

147
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,460
and like I have a natural affinity for 
little kids and I do believe it's,

148
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,803
it's in large part.
That's why it's because I just know how 

149
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:12,254
to react with them and it's.
I do believe it's because of the way 

150
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,270
that I was treated when I was little 
kit.

151
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,463
You disrupt that.
It's like lots of people don't trust 

152
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:20,804
themselves as parents say because they 
were hurt or they didn't have good role 

153
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:26,450
models or they don't trust the familial 
structure.

154
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:30,470
And so you know that all that all makes 
people afraid.
