1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,810
Tell me if you disagree with this.
Okay,

2
00:00:01,811 --> 00:00:04,990
because I'm a psychologist,
not a sociologist,

3
00:00:04,991 --> 00:00:05,824
and so I'm dabbling in things that are 
outside of my field of expertise and 

4
00:00:08,231 --> 00:00:10,160
there is some danger in that,
but the,

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,403
the central postmodernists claim seems 
to me that because there's a near 

6
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:15,304
infinite number of ways to interpret a 
complex set of phenomena which which 

7
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:19,534
actually happens to be the case that you
can't make a case that any of those 

8
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:23,974
modes of interpretation are canonical 
and so if they're not canonical and if 

9
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:32,290
that canonical element isn't based in 
some kind of reality than it serves some

10
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:35,140
other master,
and so the master that it hypothetically

11
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:35,974
serves for the postmodernists is nothing
but power because that seems to be 

12
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:41,500
everything that they believe it.
They don't believe in competence.

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,453
They don't believe in authority.
They don't seem to believe in an 

14
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:47,020
objective world because everything is 
language mediated.

15
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,210
So it's an extraordinarily cynical 
perspective that that because there's an

16
00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:54,970
infinite number of interpretations,
none of them are canonical.

17
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,520
You can attribute it to everything to 
power and dominance.

18
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,563
Okay,
so that that seemed like a reasonable 

19
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:04,741
summary of the radical relativism.
It's a radical relativism now,

20
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:07,240
but the strange thing is despite.
Okay,

21
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:08,074
and so what goes along with that is the 
demolition of grand narratives and so 

22
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,970
that would be associated,
for example,

23
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:15,670
with the rejection of thinkers like Don 
and Eric Norman,

24
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:16,504
because of course their foundational 
thinkers in relationship to the idea 

25
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:24,160
that there are embodied grand narratives
that's never touched,

26
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,180
but then despite the fact that the grand
narrative is rejected,

27
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:32,120
there's a neo Marxism that's tightly,
tightly allied with postmodernism.

28
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:34,570
That also seems to shade into this 
strange identity.

29
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:37,390
Politics and I don't.
Two things.

30
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:39,940
I don't understand the causal 
relationship there.

31
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,260
Like the skeptical part of me thinks 
that postmodernism was a,

32
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,333
was an intellectual.
It's intellectual camouflage for the 

33
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:49,084
continuation of the kind of pathological
Marxism that produced the Soviet Union 

34
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,470
and that it has no independent existence
as an intellectual field whatsoever.

35
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,663
But I still can't understand how the 
postmodernists can make the no grand 

36
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:02,524
narrative claim but then immerse 
themselves in this grand narrative 

37
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,090
without anyone pointing out the 
evidence.

38
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:12,220
Contradictions.
Like I don't understand that.

39
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:13,510
So what do you think about?

40
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,793
Well,
I can only speak about literary know 

41
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,133
professors really,
and they seem to me almost universally 

42
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:21,540
in theU ,
s to being very naive or they,

43
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,374
they,
they seem to know nothing about actual 

44
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:26,140
history,
political science or economics.

45
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:28,180
So it,
it is simply an attitude.

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,193
They have an attitude of Marxism become 
simply a badge by which they telegraph 

47
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,810
their,
um,

48
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,110
their solidarity with the working class 
that they have nothing to do with,

49
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,963
right?
I mean,

50
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,900
and generally nothing but contempt.

51
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:41,541
Yes.
And,

52
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:42,850
and,
and the thing is that the,

53
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,690
the,
the campus leftists are almost notorious

54
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,750
for their,
uh,

55
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,200
for their rather snobbish treatment of 
staff.

56
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:49,620
I mean,
they don't,

57
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,310
they don't have any rapport with the 
actual working class members of the,

58
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:55,470
um,
of the infrastructure,

59
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:56,970
the janitor,
the janitor is,

60
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:57,920
and you know,
even the,

61
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,823
even the secretaries,
it was kind of high and mighty 

62
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,990
aristocracy and there were just,
these are people who um,

63
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,853
who have wandered into the English 
department and our were products of a 

64
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:09,904
time when I'm doing the new criticism.
They were when history with history and 

65
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:17,440
psychology had been excluded.
Me and my ambition.

66
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:18,274
Okay.
Was,

67
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,080
I mean I love the new criticism.
Okay.

68
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:22,780
As a,
as a style of textual analysis.

69
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,371
Right?
And,

70
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:26,860
and the and the new criticism had 
multiple interpretations.

71
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,410
Okay.
That were possible and we're encouraged.

72
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,423
In fact,
one of the great projects was made in 

73
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:32,910
Max series.

74
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,620
Twentieth Century views were what you 
had at least some books.

75
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:36,454
I adored them in college and it was 
about Jane Austin or about Emily Bronte 

76
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,624
or about wordsworth and they were 
collections of alternate views of the 

77
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,424
same thing.
The idea that there were no alternative 

78
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,394
views and there was no relativistic 
situational kinds of interpretive 

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,833
approach is nonsense.
But the point was we needed to restore 

80
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,740
history to literary literary study.
Okay.

81
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,410
And we needed to add psychology to it 
because it was,

82
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,410
it was great animus against Freud.
When I arrived in,

83
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,520
in graduate school,
in fact,

84
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:07,354
I actually went into the director of 
graduate studies and protesting the way 

85
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:10,774
Freud and Freudian were used as,
as negative terms pay in a sneering way 

86
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:16,260
by that very wasp professors.
Right.

87
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,820
So we need to do it.
Actually,

88
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,320
it seemed like we were moving there,
get in there early.

89
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:24,190
Nineteen seventies was a great period of
psycho biography about great.

90
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,720
About political figures.
Okay.

91
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,100
And so I thought it's happening in all 
of a sudden they all got short circuited

92
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:30,963
by this arrival of,
of poststructuralism and postmodernism 

93
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:33,891
in the,
in the,

94
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:35,480
in the 19 seventies.
Right.

95
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,580
Um,
so I,

96
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,360
I,
I,

97
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,600
I feel I'm an old historicist okay.
Now not a new historical.

98
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,600
So I mean,
I think new stores.

99
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:43,440
So it was an absolute scam,
right?

100
00:04:43,441 --> 00:04:44,260
It.
And it's like,

101
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,730
it's just a way.
It's like tweezers you'd like just,

102
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,970
you pick a little bit of this,
a little bit of that,

103
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:49,804
a little bit of that you make a little 
tiny salad and someone that is atomized 

104
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,040
thing,
right?

105
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,310
It's supposed to mean something.
It's all can be very superficial,

106
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:59,410
very cynical,
very distance.

107
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,241
I like,
I,

108
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:00,820
I am,
uh,

109
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,290
I am the product.
Okay.

110
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,310
Of Old historicism German philology.
I decide my,

111
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,400
my first choice of profession when I was
a child.

112
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,650
What was Egyptology archeology,
[inaudible] I'm.

113
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Everything I ever think about or say is,
is related to an enormous time scheme.

114
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:17,104
Okay.
From from antiquity and indeed from the 

115
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,803
Stone Age,
and that is the problem with these 

116
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,810
people.
They're their male educated.

117
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:27,400
The postmodernist and academic Marxists 
are male educated,

118
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,290
embarrassingly so.
Okay.

119
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:34,291
They know nothing before the present,
so call okay is absolutely a joke before

120
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,500
the enlightenment.
Okay.

121
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:40,430
You mean per perhaps he might be useful 
to people to talk about what happened at

122
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,490
after Neil classicism,
which by the way,

123
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:45,880
he failed to notice a lot of what he was
talking about.

124
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:46,714
Okay.
Turns out to CB simply the hangover of 

125
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:50,110
neoclassicism.
Okay.

126
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,080
This is how ignorant that man was.
I mean,

127
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,220
his head was.
He was not talented as a researcher.

128
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,870
He knew absolutely nothing.
Okay.

129
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:56,470
What stuff?
You know,

130
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,303
nothing about antiquity.
How can you make any kind of large 

131
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,203
structure,
large mechanism to analyze western 

132
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:06,770
culture without knowing about classical 
antiquity?

133
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:09,110
Okay.
He did not see anything from some person

134
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,110
who had no business making large 
theoretical statements about anything.

135
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,670
Well,
maybe,

136
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:17,670
maybe part of it is that if you,
if you generate an intelligible doctrine

137
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,083
of radical relativism,
then there is no reason to assume that 

138
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:23,614
there are distinctions between 
categories of knowledge or between 

139
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:27,340
different levels of quality of 
knowledge.

140
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:28,174
Right.
So I've seen the same thing in the 

141
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,430
psychology departments,
although we have the,

142
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,870
uh,
what would you call it?

143
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:35,704
The luxury of being bounded at least to 
some degree by the empirical method and 

144
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:39,640
by biology,
right?

145
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:43,270
It's one of the things that keeps most 
of the branches of psychology relatively

146
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:44,440
sane,
you know,

147
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,620
because the real world is actually built
into it to some degree.

148
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,360
But if you accept the postmodernist 
claim of radical relativism,

149
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:53,194
then you completely demolished the idea 
that there are quality levels that are 

150
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:58,900
associated with education because 
everything becomes the same.

151
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,800
And that seems to me to be a perfectly 
reasonable justification for maintaining

152
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:03,634
ignorance.

153
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,630
You know,
like Food Co.

154
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:07,240
I actually found him the most readable 
of the lecan.

155
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,780
There are de fuko trIad.
You can read fuko.

156
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,853
I read madison civilization and a couple
of his other books and I thought they 

157
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:16,144
were painfully obvious.
You know the idea that mental disorder 

158
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:19,954
is in part a social construct is self 
evident to anybody who has even a 

159
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:23,734
smattering of psychiatric training.
I mean the real narrow medical types 

160
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:28,264
tend to to think of a mental disorder,
let's say as something that might be 

161
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,260
purely biological.
They have a peer disease model,

162
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:36,094
but nobody's who's a sophisticated 
thinker ever thinks that it's a bit 

163
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,890
partly because medicine is a brand of 
engineering,

164
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:42,724
not a brand of science because it's 
associated with health and the 

165
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:46,084
diagnostic categories are hybrids 
between physiological observation and 

166
00:07:49,271 --> 00:07:50,104
sociocultural condition.
Everyone knows that and so when I read 

167
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:54,730
madness and civilization,
I thought,

168
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:57,790
well that's not radical.
That's just bloody self evident.

169
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,403
I actually think that he began know the 
entire turn toward a total theological 

170
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,800
grounding of,
of modern psychology,

171
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,670
social psychology,
and was was well,

172
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,800
well launcher the 19 twenties for 
example,

173
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,723
know the levels of ignorance of these.
These people moving with all original 

174
00:08:16,231 --> 00:08:17,064
have not read durkheim.
They've not read mocks of or are they 

175
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:20,550
not read erving goffman.
Okay,

176
00:08:20,551 --> 00:08:21,384
so in other words,
to me for everything is the costing of 

177
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,913
the estimate because I had read the 
sources from which he was borrowing 

178
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,980
without attribution,
but I mean,

179
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,690
again,
I know these people,

180
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:32,220
I mean I,
I've met him in some cases,

181
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,290
knew them in graduate school,
people who went onto become these,

182
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,340
these,
these admirers of fico,

183
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,560
lack on dairy dot and I know what their 
training was there.

184
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,720
Training was pureLy within the english 
department.

185
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:43,554
That's all they ever knew.
They never made it any research outside 

186
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:46,180
of that.
Right.

187
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,340
And so the idea for coal is simply this 
is a mechanism,

188
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,383
it's like a little tiny kit by which 
they can approach everything in culture 

189
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,920
and then with the contortions of 
language that deliberate labyrinthine,

190
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,430
elitist language at the same time as 
pretending to be a leftist.

191
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,470
Okay.
This is one of the biggest frauds.

192
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:05,400
every practice.
