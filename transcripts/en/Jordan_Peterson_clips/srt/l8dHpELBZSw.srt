1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,313
You're always contrasting what you want 
and happy with what you think is that 

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,980
they're both more and wherever there's a
deviation,

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,060
wherever what you want to happen isn't 
going on.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,603
Then you feel anxiety,
curiosity as well here in pell to 

5
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:16,884
explore the anxiety is the thing that 
comes up first and the larger the 

6
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:24,150
magnitude of the unexpected occurrence,
the greater the amount of anxiety.

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,520
One of the things we're going to try to 
determine in the courses,

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,790
how you can understand how large a 
disruption and given unexpected event is

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,740
because you know,
minor thing.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,220
Let's go back to this other diner for a 
second.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,680
Here's a.
here's a way of looking at it.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,690
So let's say you're,
you know,

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,700
you're going to wear three plans to get 
there and this plan doesn't work,

14
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,643
so that means that produces outcomes.
It isn't what you envisioned and this 

15
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:53,400
plan doesn't work.

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,850
It produces on a normal civilian as 
well.

17
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:58,890
But this plan does work well.
That's no problem.

18
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:00,660
I mean those are pretty minor league 
disruptions.

19
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,703
All you do is you keep the same vision 
of yourself and the same vision of the 

20
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:06,144
future.
You just switched between plants and 

21
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,573
you're really in trouble if none of your
plans work or if someone messes around 

22
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:17,490
with your representation of this for 
this,

23
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,130
so you can say,
for example,

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,513
you want to get into medical school and 
you need 30 courses to get into medical 

25
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:31,341
school and you should have a's on all of
them and you get a b plus on one course.

26
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,421
Okay,
well,

27
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:35,790
he's done all these other courses.
That's not such a big deal.

28
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,643
It's a minor league disruption.
It causes you a certain mode of anxiety 

29
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,400
and produces a certain amount of 
exploratory behavior.

30
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,670
Perhaps go with the professor and say,
why isn't that I got this being the last

31
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,280
one is expecting a don't.

32
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,510
You don't what that's going to do the 
vision of the ideal future and so on and

33
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:53,400
so forth.
That's one sort of disruption.

34
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:54,510
You're a bit anxious,
but hey,

35
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:56,850
you have 29 other courses.
It's not such a big deal.

36
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,320
Now instead,
write down cap and You score in the 50th

37
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,183
percentile.
Well now you're in trouble because you 

38
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:06,294
have a vision of yourself.
We think this is your version of the 

39
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:08,874
unbearable present.
You know a doctor that's a pain in the 

40
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:13,230
neck,
but you're a potential doctor.

41
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,153
You have the intellectual resources at 
your disposal and the educational 

42
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:21,651
background and and and the familial push
perhaps to make him into a doctor,

43
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,480
and so that's what you perceived 
yourself as.

44
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,314
That's your story about yourself because
you're the person with this set number 

45
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:34,020
of potentials and you also have a visual
of what it is that you're going,

46
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,063
oh,
am score comes back and you're in the 

47
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:36,980
15th percentile.

48
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,450
Well,
your,

49
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,343
your ideal future is gone.
That's a big problem because that means 

50
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:47,700
that all of the events that have 
surrounded you,

51
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,720
that surround you now and as far back as
you can remember,

52
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,943
that were given determinant significance
by this particular plan have all been 

53
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:57,714
cast into chaos because everything that 
you've done up to that point has been 

54
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,940
predicated on the notion that this is 
where you were going and that means that

55
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,170
the significance that you attributed to 
me,

56
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:10,390
everything was attributed to everything 
in relationship to that goal.

57
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,010
You blow out the goal and all those 
significant,

58
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,300
sir,
back up in the air,

59
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,313
you have to modify your version of 
yourself like what the hell are you 

60
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:19,840
going to do now they're going to be a 
doctor.

61
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,010
He put a lot of work into this.
Plus it's your whole self conception.

62
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,220
Well this is gone.

63
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,490
This is gone.
This is irrelevant,

64
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,140
right?
I mean the other 29 courses,

65
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,123
why the hell are you even here now?
So that's one example of the levels at 

66
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:39,160
which normally occur.
Minor League anomalies,

67
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,870
no problem.
You just screwed around with when you go

68
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:43,260
to the same place,
major league anomalies,

69
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,113
it's a new ideal future.
That's part of the reason that people 

70
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:52,831
are so prone to ideological conflicts.
It's like this is an ideology can say it

71
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:56,500
has a particular version of the way 
things are.

72
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:58,230
Knowing a little bit for me to see 
college is pretty.

73
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,493
It's pretty explicit.
What's the unbearable presence so to 

74
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:02,944
speak?
Well,

75
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,413
I know this is a bit dated,
but we're running out of hard line 

76
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:07,174
etiologies to fund that,
but by the time the unbearable present 

77
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:14,350
is the class struggle and we kind of 
reasons for that,

78
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:18,850
it's basically the fault of the are 
exploring before the ideal future is the

79
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:23,520
point at which those unfair divisions of
capital are eliminated debt.

80
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,090
There's a whole bunch of means to that 
end.

81
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,133
That's that's an ideology.
While someone else has a different 

82
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,060
ideology,
different version of the significance of

83
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:31,894
current events,
a different version of the significance 

84
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:34,923
and the nature of the ideal future,
how they completely different 

85
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:39,070
apprehension of how to transform one and
the other.

86
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,220
With those two cultures come into 
contact with how,

87
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:43,054
first of all,
they make each other anxious because 

88
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,060
they're not convinced,
commensurate pools,

89
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,410
and if this is the structure that 
regulates emotion,

90
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,483
well what's going to happen?
You can just give up your damn plans 

91
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,410
because then your emotions are 
dysregulated.

92
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,263
We fall into chaos so to speak.
You don't know where you are and you 

93
00:04:58,961 --> 00:04:59,794
don't know who you are.
You don't know what to do and you don't 

94
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:04,210
know where you're going because that 
makes you anxious.

95
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,120
Neither side is going to give up.
Give up near certainty.

96
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,483
The only thing left and under what 
circumstances is conflict and you see 

97
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:15,070
this look,
how do arguments escalate?

98
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,330
An argument with someone that you love 
even they want one thing.

99
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:21,550
You want another,
you discuss it.

100
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,503
You know,
getting anywhere your tempers raised 

101
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,380
because the abstract discussion isn't 
healthy.

102
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,420
Finally,
you give up,

103
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,020
maybe move to to violence to solve your 
problem,

104
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,540
to hammer out story,
so to speak and do that,

105
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:39,550
but still oppressing the person who has 
the different different.
