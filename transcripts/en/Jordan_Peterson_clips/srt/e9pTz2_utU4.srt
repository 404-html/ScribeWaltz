1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,760
Then there's the example of rats,
which I love.

2
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:03,594
This is Jaak Panksepp work,
and he wrote a book called affective 

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:06,770
neuroscience,
would I,

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,820
which I would highly,
highly recommend.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,330
I have a list of readings,
recommended readings on my website.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,240
It's a brilliant book and he's a 
brilliant psychologist,

7
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:19,440
really one of the top top psychologist 
as far as I'm concerned,

8
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:22,290
both theoretically and experimentally,
a real genius.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,410
He's the guy who discovered that rats 
laugh when you tickle them.

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,920
They loud laugh ultrasonically,
so you can't actually hear them,

11
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:29,754
but if you record it and slow it down,
then you can hear them giggling away 

12
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:33,054
when you tickle them with an eraser,
which is sort of like their mother's 

13
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:36,234
tongue.
It's often what lab people use as a 

14
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:40,620
substitute for the licking of the little
wrapped by the mother.

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,770
So,
so,

16
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:45,090
and he discovered the place circuit and 
in mammals,

17
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:46,530
which is like a major deal,
right?

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,363
He should get a Nobel prize for that.
That's a big deal to discover an entire 

19
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:54,250
motivational circuit whose existence no 
one had really predicted,

20
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,163
you know,
apart from the fact that obviously 

21
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:58,760
mammals play and uh,
even lizards,

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,170
maybe some of the more social lizards 
seemed to play,

23
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,120
you know,
so anyhow,

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,673
but panksepp observed,
I think this is a brilliant piece of 

25
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:09,660
science,
is that first of all,

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,590
juvenile male routes in particular,
like too rough and tumble play.

27
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:17,340
They like to wrestle and they actually 
pin each other just like little kids do.

28
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:18,174
Or like adult wrestlers do.
They pin their shoulders down and that 

29
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:22,620
basically means you win.
And so,

30
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,030
okay,
so that's pretty cool.

31
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:27,180
But what's even cooler,
I think while there's three things,

32
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:28,014
one is the rats will work for an 
opportunity to get into an arena where 

33
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:32,940
they know that play might occur.

34
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,320
And so that's one of the scientific ways
of testing in animals motivation,

35
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,250
right?
So imagine you have a starving wrath and

36
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:43,140
it knows that it's got food down the end
of a corridor.

37
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,183
You can put a little spring on its tail 
and measure how hard it pulls and that 

38
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:49,260
gives you an indication of it's 
motivational force.

39
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:50,094
Now imagine the starving rat that's 
trying to get to some food and you have 

40
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,640
a little spring on his tail and you 
walked in some cat odor,

41
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,090
so now that route is starving and wants 
to get out of there.

42
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,790
He's going to try to pull even farther 
towards the food,

43
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:06,630
so getting away plus getting forward are
separate motivational systems and if you

44
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:07,464
can add them together,
it's real potent and part of the reason 

45
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,513
why in the future authoring exercise 
that you guys are going to do as the 

46
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:14,904
class progresses,
you're asked to outline the place you'd 

47
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:19,020
like to end up,
which is your desired future,

48
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:19,854
and also the place that you could end up
if you let everything fall apart is so 

49
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:28,821
that your anxiety chases you and your 
approach systems pull you forward.

50
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,900
You're maximally motivated,
dead,

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,033
and it's important because otherwise you
can be afraid of pursuing the things 

52
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:37,080
that you want to pursue.
Right?

53
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:37,923
And that's very common and so then the 
fear inhibits you as the promise pulls 

54
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:42,444
you forward,
but it makes you weak because you're 

55
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:45,960
afraid.
You want to get your fear behind you,

56
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,510
pushing you,
and so what you want to be as afraid,

57
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,710
more afraid of not pursuing your goals 
than you are of pursuing them.

58
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,300
It's very,
very helpful.

59
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,343
And lots of times in life,
and this is something really worth 

60
00:02:57,781 --> 00:02:59,090
knowing,
you know,

61
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,050
this is one of the advantages to being 
an tournament's adult,

62
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:05,860
is you don't get to pick the best thing.
You get to pick your poison.

63
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,023
You have two bad choices and you get to 
pick which one you're willing to suffer 

64
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:10,744
through.
And every choice has a bit of that 

65
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:12,880
element in it.

66
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,713
And so if you know that,
it's really freeing because otherwise 

67
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:18,130
you torture yourself by thinking,
well,

68
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,920
maybe there's a good solution to this.
You know,

69
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:22,540
compared to the bad solution.
It's like,

70
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,090
Nah,
sometimes there's just risky solution,

71
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:25,924
one and risky solution to.
And sometimes both of them are really 

72
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:30,754
bad,
but you at least get to pick which one 

73
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,060
you're willing to suffer through.
And that's,

74
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,900
that actually makes quite a bit of 
difference because you're also facing it

75
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:40,240
voluntarily then instead of it chasing 
you.

76
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:44,710
And that is an entire different entirely
different psychophysiological response.

77
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,873
Challenge versus threat.
It's not the same even if the magnitude 

78
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,073
of the problem is the same.
And so putting yourself in a 

79
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:53,920
challenging,
let's call it mind frame,

80
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,873
you can't just do that by magic.
Putting yourself in a challenging 

81
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,193
mindframe is much,
much easier on you psychophysiological 

82
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,150
because you don't produce,
you don't go into the generalized stress

83
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:04,984
response to the same degree and you're 
activating your exploratory and seeking 

84
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:09,034
systems which are dopaminergic,
we mediated and that involved positive 

85
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:15,460
emotion.
So if you can face something voluntarily

86
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:16,294
rather than having to chase you,
it's way better for you cycle 

87
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:19,554
physiologically.
So that's partly why it's worthwhile to 

88
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:27,490
go find the dragon in its layer instead 
of waiting for it to come and eat you.

89
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,863
So and especially when you also add the 
idea that if you go find the dragon in 

90
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:32,854
it's layer,
you might find it when it's a baby 

91
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:36,550
instead of a full fledged bloody 
monster.

92
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:38,470
That is definitely going to take you 
down

93
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,480
really.
