1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,560
Okay,
yes.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,590
What is your opinion on the whole 
cultural appropriate?

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,390
Okay,
two questions.

4
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:10,224
What's my opinion on the alt right and 
what's my opinion on cultural 

5
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:13,224
appropriation?
The idea of cultural appropriation is 

6
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:16,320
absolute nonsense.

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,080
That's that.

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,363
No,
there's no difference between cultural 

9
00:00:25,811 --> 00:00:27,730
appropriation and learning from one 
another.

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,090
The same thing.
Now that doesn't mean I can't.

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,870
That doesn't mean that there's no theft 
between people.

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,213
There is no.
It doesn't mean that just because you 

13
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:39,394
encounter someone else's ideas,
you have an immediate right to those 

14
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:42,784
ideas as if they were your own,
but the idea that manifesting in your 

15
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,050
own behavior,
some element of another culture,

16
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:52,960
the idea that that's somehow immoral is 
insane.

17
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:55,980
It's actually one of the bases of peace.
You know,

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,853
one of the things that the various 
groups of human beings that exist have 

19
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,010
to offer each other is the tremendous 
value of their culture.

20
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,650
You know,
it's been really interesting to me,

21
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:06,484
for example,
to watch the response of ball of 

22
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:12,250
everyone,
but for this argument to you,

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,280
for young Caucasian males to hip hop,
you know,

24
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:16,114
there's an aggressiveness about hip hop 
that's really attractive to young 

25
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,500
Caucasian males and there's something 
observed about,

26
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,543
about the,
the spectacle of the young Caucasian 

27
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:30,010
males taking on the persona of inner 
city black gang members,

28
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,620
you know,
but,

29
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,560
but I'm sympathetic to it because there 
is an aggressiveness to that,

30
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,693
to that art form that's a necessary 
corrective to the insistence that the 

31
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:45,070
highest moral virtue for a modern man is
harmlessness,

32
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,560
which is observed.

33
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,570
Women don't even like harmless man.
They hate them.

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,940
They liked them apart.
