1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,370
I had a friend at one point who was a 
very bitter person and he had a bunch of

2
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:06,204
problems and some of them were self 
inflicted in some of them were fate I 

3
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:12,400
suppose,
and he had his.

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,430
He had become very,
very destructive,

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,810
murderously,
destructive,

6
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:17,700
genocidally destructive.
I would say.

7
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:18,534
You could see it in his dreams and,
and he lived with me for awhile and I 

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,524
knew him very well.
He was a friend of mine from the time I 

9
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:31,881
was 12 until the time he committed 
suicide when he was 40 and when he lived

10
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:35,280
with me I was trying to help him get on 
his feet,

11
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:38,820
which was why he had come to live with 
me because he thought maybe I could help

12
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:43,821
him get on his feet and he could only 
take relatively low level jobs.

13
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:46,260
You know,
like he had some mechanical ability.

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,400
He didn't,
he didn't get educated.

15
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:48,870
Although he's a very,
very smart person.

16
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:51,600
He probably had an Iq of about 135 or 
something like that.

17
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:55,470
He's very smart and so he was bitter too
because he hadn't educated themselves to

18
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:56,760
the level that has,
as you know,

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,850
his intellect would have demanded.
So we had to take jobs that were beneath

20
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,420
him intellectually and he had a re.
He had that real intellectual arrogance,

21
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:04,254
you know,
because he was smart and really smart 

22
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:06,954
people often come to believe that only 
smart matters and if they're smart and 

23
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:12,714
all that and all that matters is smart 
and then the world is sort of laying 

24
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:19,700
itself at their feet and they've been 
terribly betrayed and,

25
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:23,430
and then they claim to their 
intelligence which is more like a talent

26
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:26,220
or a gift.
Like it's like it's an idol,

27
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,420
you know,
a false idol,

28
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,700
which is exactly what it is in a very 
dangerous one.

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,953
And get cynical about the stupidity of 
the world and the fact that there are 

30
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:35,364
talents weren't properly recognized and 
that's just not that helpful because 

31
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:40,500
smart is a good thing.
But I'll tell you,

32
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:41,334
if you don't use it properly,
it will devour you just like all 

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,080
arbitrarily assigned.
Tell it right.

34
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:48,510
So you might have a talent,
but it's your friend.

35
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:51,390
If you use it properly and you misuse 
it,

36
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,313
it will be your enemy and maybe that's 
how God keeps the cosmic scales 

37
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:57,210
adjusted.
But anyhow,

38
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:58,044
my friend was a very smart person,
although not as smart as he thought he 

39
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:01,524
was unfortunately and and,
but he hadn't done what would have been 

40
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,334
necessary with that intelligence to make
it manifest itself properly in the 

41
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:09,504
world.
And that also embittered him because he 

42
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:15,600
also knew that there was more that he 
could have done if he would have done it

43
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,643
and perhaps more that he could still do 
what I was suggesting to him while he 

44
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:22,680
was living with us because he was,
you know,

45
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,293
two levels from homeless by that point 
was that he should find a job that he 

46
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:31,620
could find working in a garage,
working in a shop,

47
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:32,454
something like that because he had some 
mechanical ability and that he should 

48
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,373
do.

49
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,973
He should separate himself from the 
arrogance that made him presumed that 

50
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:46,441
such a job would be beneath him because 
at that point no job was beneath him.

51
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:48,570
And,
but more importantly,

52
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,810
it's not so obvious that jobs are 
beneath people,

53
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,600
you know.
Because even if you're a,

54
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,050
even if you imagine you have a job as a 
checkout person in a grocery store,

55
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:05,340
you know as a fairly unskilled job,
you can be in some miserable,

56
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,990
resentful,
horrid bastard doing that job.

57
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:08,824
Boy,
you know you can come in there just 

58
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,564
exuding resentment and bitterness and 
making mistakes and making sure that 

59
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:15,514
every customer that passes by you has a 
slightly worse day than they need to 

60
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,043
write and pilfering time and perhaps 
pilfering goods and being resentful 

61
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:26,404
about the people who,
who gave you the position because 

62
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:33,310
they're above you in the dominance 
hierarchy and talking bad things.
