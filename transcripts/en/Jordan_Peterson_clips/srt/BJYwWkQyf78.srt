1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,993
What it means to be a conservative in 
the nineties and especially 2000 has 

2
00:00:03,791 --> 00:00:07,480
changed.
So it is true that you know that,

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,540
that the conservative,
we're not in any way anti-science,

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,690
um,
until much more recent times.

5
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:16,210
Now actually both sides are anti science
about different sciences,

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,780
but I'm in America,
the right wing,

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,760
the Republican Party.
Ha,

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,283
it's controversial,
but I do believe that the polarization 

9
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:26,770
starts with the right moving further 
out.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,550
So what it means to be conservative to 
the anti anti evolutionary,

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,370
which is actually what's happening on 
the left now to exactly.

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,313
That's it.
This modern Bret Weinstein the other 

13
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:36,410
day,
and you know,

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:36,990
he,
he,

15
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:37,823
one of his claims is that evolutionary 
biology has something in it to offend 

16
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:43,320
everyone.
So it's a,

17
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:46,620
it's a science that's very likely to be 
targeted by extremists.

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,603
You also brought up something that 
actually touches on the eye on the 

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,773
difficult problem of how it is that you 
might define someone who is 

20
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:56,910
ideologically possessed,
let's say,

21
00:00:56,911 --> 00:01:01,470
or ideologically rigid,
because the idea was that you can make a

22
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:02,304
valid case for the utility of free 
information flow and the free flow of 

23
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:07,284
people that would go along with that and
you could make a good case for the 

24
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:10,320
danger of that.

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,543
And so the idea might be that if you're 
only making a case for the danger of 

26
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:16,560
that,
then you're tilted too far to the right.

27
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:19,140
And if you're only making a case for the
utility of that,

28
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:21,160
then you're tilted too far to the left.
Exactly.

29
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,143
That's right.
And so we can look at immigration as a 

30
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:24,514
nice example.
There was a recent essay in the 

31
00:01:25,481 --> 00:01:27,430
Atlantic,
I think it was by Peter Beinart,

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,200
where he,
um,

33
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,840
he reviews.
He,

34
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:32,674
it starts with a lot of quotes that are 
pretty nuanced positions about 

35
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:37,630
immigration from Barack Obama.
Paul Krugman,

36
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,330
a bunch of other people on the left who 
used to be able to say,

37
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,710
on the one hand,
you know,

38
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:43,210
compassion,
economic,

39
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,770
on the other hand,
you know,

40
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:49,090
we have to have a legal process and 
there's a threat to low wage workers,

41
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,013
so people on the left used to bill to 
talk about immigration and talk about 

42
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,670
the pros and cons,
pluses and minuses,

43
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,090
but beinart shows how in the last four 
or five years you can't,

44
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,800
if you so much as suggest that will 
maybe immigration is Annette.

45
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,633
Good,
but it might have some deleterious 

46
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,560
effects on certain classes of low wage 
American workers.

47
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,810
You could get in big trouble,
right?

48
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:11,644
Because that's instantly prejudicial 
because immigration has become a sacred 

49
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:15,904
topic.
So this is the key thing that I want 

50
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:20,950
everyone to keep in mind.
We are fundamentally religious creatures

51
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,053
were built for religion and it's a great
achievement to create a scientific 

52
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:26,104
establishment and an academic 
establishment that keeps that way of 

53
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:29,404
thinking out.
Scientific thinking is not natural 

54
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:32,224
thinking.
Religious thinking is natural thinking 

55
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,320
and what's happening to us in the last 
few years especially is a flooding in of

56
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,183
religious thinking and so let's get a 
bunch of social scientists talk about 

57
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:44,050
immigration.
What are they going to do?

58
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,610
Look at the data,
way up.

59
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:47,320
The pluses and minuses.
No,

60
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,663
they're going to.
Many of them feel they're on a team and 

61
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:53,110
that team is fighting the right.

62
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,570
The right is anti-immigrant.
It includes racist elements,

63
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,920
therefore that justifies us in being pro
and social sciences are always.

64
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,840
There's always ambiguity.
There's always conflicting studies,

65
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,213
multiple causal factors.
Is that always in the social science 

66
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:09,460
study?
That's right.

67
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,323
So beinart point was that the left used 
to be able to think straight about 

68
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,520
immigration.
Clearly it had a,

69
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,200
you know,
it was generally pro immigration,

70
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:18,580
but it used to be able to think 
straight,

71
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:23,170
but in the last few years a religious 
orthodox mindset has overtaken it.

72
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,033
Okay.
So we might as well also pointed out 

73
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:27,430
that it's a primordial religious 
mindset,

74
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,623
right?
Because I mean there are Christian or 

75
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:32,770
Jewish,
I mean ancient tribal,

76
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:34,620
small scale,
lots of gods.

77
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,290
Right,
right.

78
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,970
Well,
so then one of the things that you might

79
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:41,440
suggest is that when you throw out a 
sophisticated religious structure,

80
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,580
unsophisticated religious structure 
comes in to fill the gap.

81
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,540
I do.
So that's true.

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,120
So that's definitely worth thinking 
about.

83
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:50,590
So that's right.
So that's right.

84
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:54,860
The thing to write with religions,
we have to clarify fundamentalism is the

85
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:55,840
problem,
not religion.

86
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,020
And so if you did a close tribalism,
that's right.

87
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,140
If you get a fundamentalist know I'm 
happy to say,

88
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,993
and if you have people applying to a 
Grad program in psychology and I find 

89
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:08,170
out that they're Christian,
that's fine.

90
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,260
There's no problem.
But if they're fundamentalist Christian,

91
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,603
I would think,
well let's say let's say it's not 

92
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:14,720
psychologists.
Suppose it's you know,

93
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,160
geology.
So someone applies to a geology program.

94
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:20,020
There are fundamentalists,
young,

95
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:22,810
earth creationist or you gonna admit 
them.

96
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,580
No,
I don't think you should.

97
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,640
They're not able to do the right kind of
thinking based on what we know to be the

98
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:30,874
case.
They're there.

99
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,370
They're not in the scientific paradigm 
in the type that's right.

100
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,400
So,
so if we wouldn't admit a fundamentalist

101
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,263
Christian to a geology program,
why would we admit someone who is just 

102
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:41,884
as fundamentalist about certain moral 
and political issues into a sociology 

103
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:45,274
program or into a psychology program if 
they come in knowing what the right 

104
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,920
answer is committed to that right 
answer,

105
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,390
likely to get angry at anyone who 
contravenes that right answer.

106
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,160
Um,
and,

107
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,660
and showing signs of close mindedness.
I don't think they belong to grab the.

108
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:02,494
I guess the question is how in the world
do you set up mechanisms to ensure that 

109
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:09,610
you're not swamped by fundamentalists of
any sort?

110
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:12,550
So those are people who are reducing 
everything to a single cause.

111
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:13,384
It's something like that.
How can you implement a structure that 

112
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,073
protects the organization against that 
without the structure itself becoming 

113
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,660
totalitarian?
Because these things,

114
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:24,650
these things spin out of control so 
fast.

115
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,890
But so I think what we have to realize 
in the academy is that we face,

116
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,813
I think we face an existential crisis.
We rely on an enormous amount on public 

117
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,280
goodwill.
We get enormous tax subsidies,

118
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,353
a direct research support and recent 
polling shows that while Democrats have 

119
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:46,354
always had a higher opinion of the 
universities than Republicans until two 

120
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:49,324
years ago,
everybody thought universities are a 

121
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:52,270
good thing.
They make life better.

122
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,030
So Americans had been very supportive of
higher education.

123
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,730
There have been rising grapes on the 
right,

124
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,753
but it's only between 2015 and 2017 that
now republicans go from saying mostly 

125
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,580
universities are good things in two 
years.

126
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,740
They go way down and say universities 
are bad things.

127
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,570
They're making things worse.
Now,

128
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:12,600
how is this news greeted?
Pundits on the left are saying,

129
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,860
oh,
those republicans are so anti science.

130
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,480
Look how ignorant they are.

131
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,900
They now hate universities.
Come on.

132
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,973
Anybody's been watching the news.
Anybody who's seen the mobs to shout 

133
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:26,960
downs,
the illiberal behavior,

134
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,490
you know,
the metaphor I use is like,

135
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,543
you know,
Americans on the right and left are 

136
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:32,690
really supportive of the military.
We have.

137
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,990
It's one of the few institutions that we
still hold in high esteem on both sides.

138
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,570
And so the Republicans more than 
Democrats.

139
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,610
So suppose you had Gallup poll and I,
uh,

140
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,190
showing Republicans liked the military 
more than Democrats,

141
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:44,024
but both really like it.
Then suddenly in 2015 we started seeing 

142
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,123
video from all over military bases,
the military academies in which the 

143
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:57,160
military leaders are overtly right wing.
They are there.

144
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,063
They're saying terrible things about 
leftists and progressives and the 

145
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:02,084
midshipmen and the cadets,
and everybody is mobbing the occasional 

146
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,370
liberal and to behaving in a really 
despicable,

147
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:08,204
scary and intimidating way.
What do you think the left would now 

148
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,820
think about the military?
Obviously support for the military would

149
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:14,654
plummet.
That's what's happening in America with 

150
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:17,234
universities.
We are losing the support of half the 

151
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:21,410
country.
This is unsustainable,

152
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,890
especially in red states where they 
control the purse strings.

153
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,750
So I think we have a major crisis.
I think we've got to go into crisis mode

154
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,370
and we've got to clean up our act.
