1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,770
Clease Noren how to use the results in 
the new personality test for progress in

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:05,604
life,
trying to compensate some sites that 

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,810
that received fewer points,
well at the risk of sounding self.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,040
That's actually why we developed the 
self authoring suite,

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,810
was to help people improve their website
performance and mental health.

6
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:23,830
Now,
we don't have direct evidence that will,

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,290
that will improve personality,
but I suspected that evidence would take

8
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,124
a very long time to accumulate.
What we do know is that the self 

9
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,320
authoring suite,
especially the future authoring suite,

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,720
um,
helps people,

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,790
helps university students,
for example,

12
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:39,624
stay enrolled in university.
It increases the probability of that by 

13
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:45,700
about 25 percent and increase his grade 
point average by about the same.

14
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:46,534
Then there's good theoretical reasons 
for assuming that writing is a good way 

15
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:52,344
of,
of,

16
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,253
um,
writing about yourself and about your 

17
00:00:55,021 --> 00:01:00,021
past and about your future is a good way
of catalyzing personality transformation

18
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:01,524
because it appears that personality,
the human psyche is organized at the 

19
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:06,120
highest level of abstraction.

20
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,953
Using something like self narrative and 
a well-developed narrative makes the 

21
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:15,510
frame for your life and helps you 
stabilize your negative emotions.

22
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:16,344
And also experience more positive 
emotions because you only experienced 

23
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:19,404
positive emotion in relationship to a 
goal and that can make goal directed 

24
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,980
activity lot more rewarding.
So you know,

25
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:26,814
it's a lot easier to engage in 
activities that aren't intrinsically 

26
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:33,310
rewarding if they're linked to something
that you really find important.

27
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,390
And so I would say if you want to work 
on your personality,

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,660
well the first thing you have to do is 
figure out who it is that you want to be

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,793
and then you have to make the plan and 
maybe you have to clean up your past as 

30
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:44,844
well.
And the self authoring suite was 

31
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:46,794
designed no quite carefully in order to 
help people do that with a relative 

32
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:54,780
minimum of effort.
Not that it's easy because it's not,

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,860
but a relative minimum minimum of effort
compared to other technologies,

34
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:00,640
let's say,
and like,

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,620
like longterm psychotherapy and,
uh,

36
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,540
to make it cost effective as well.
So.
