1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,113
Okay.
So presumably the reason we've got into 

2
00:00:02,621 --> 00:00:05,750
this situation,
this mindset you might call us,

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,240
right?
I want to say we,

4
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:12,980
I mean the culture certainly on the left
is this remarkable transformation that's

5
00:00:12,981 --> 00:00:13,814
taking place in the potential and 
possibilities that women have enjoyed 

6
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:20,870
over the last 40 years when they turned 
out to be,

7
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:25,871
it seems much more plastic and capable 
and having a great deal more talents and

8
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:29,084
potentiality is that we used to think in
the 1950s and this extraordinary 

9
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:34,214
liberation that's happened and it has 
happened on questions as has seems to 

10
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:41,730
have led us to the point of view that 
there is a kind of infinite malleability

11
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:42,564
going well,
but you can see how the argument would 

12
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:45,490
have got there.
Well it's,

13
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:50,050
I would say it's partly about,
it's certainly partly post birth control

14
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:52,480
confusion,
right?

15
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:54,550
Because with the invention of the birth 
control pill,

16
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:55,384
you basically have a new female or 
because there's never been a female in 

17
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:03,334
the history of life that have voluntary 
control over her reproductive 

18
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:07,414
capability.

19
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,320
And now that's possible.
MMM.

20
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,590
So then the question arises,
well,

21
00:01:15,591 --> 00:01:20,591
what is this new creature life?
And one answer is she's like any way she

22
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:22,234
wants to be.
And then if you ally that as well with 

23
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:25,504
the Marxist sharp turn up,
which is a social construction as 

24
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:32,860
doctrine that the state constructs the 
individual and should do so then you get

25
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:34,230
a double whammy.
And that,

26
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:35,064
so some of it's understandable because 
we are still trying to figure out the 

27
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:38,344
parameters of female behavior once 
femininity is unlocked from involuntary 

28
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:49,981
reproductions and also the birth control
can about,

29
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,720
I've pretty much the same time,
it says it quite an uptick in economic.

30
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,563
So there was presumably a great deal,
well possibility there is a great deal 

31
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:05,851
of possibility because it's quite clear 
that women are as intelligent as men for

32
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:09,340
example.
Although the variability might differ as

33
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:12,790
we discussed and there was 
conscientiousness man and so,

34
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,620
and there is created as men.

35
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,070
So although they may not be as creative 
as old man's,

36
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,410
so that remains to be seen,
but we'll see how that plays out.

37
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:23,244
So it's not surprising that there's a 
lot of upheaval in the relationships 

38
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,500
between men and women because the bird 
is,

39
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,413
you know,
when humanity looks back on the 20th 

40
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:35,400
century,
they're going to identify three dramatic

41
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:38,480
revolutions.
One is going to be,

42
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,470
let's say the last half of the 20th 
century.

43
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,543
One is going to be the transistor,
the other is going to be the hydrogen 

44
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:49,114
bomb,
and the third is going to be the birth 

45
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:51,644
control pill.
And they're all of of of revolutionary 

46
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:59,830
significance.
It's even more complex than that because

47
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:02,320
it turns out that women on the birth 
control pill,

48
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:04,690
like feminine men better than masculine 
men.

49
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,790
So the preference actually shifts when 
their own,

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,780
because of some hormonal change.
Yeah.

51
00:03:12,781 --> 00:03:13,614
So if you track women across their 
menstrual cycle when they're not on the 

52
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:17,624
tails,
so what you do is you show them 

53
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:21,190
photographs of men,
the same manny,

54
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,790
but all you do is vary his jaw width,
which you can do.

55
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,713
We're on a continuum with the computer.
Now John With is associated with 

56
00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:34,590
testosterone.
So larger job guys have higher levels of

57
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:39,591
testosterone and women prefer the larger
job guy when they're ovulating.

58
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,063
And the smaller John's guy,
when they're gifted from reproduction 

59
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,530
possibility.
And,

60
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,443
and so you see,
women might want a monster to mate with 

61
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:52,210
and uh,
and uh,

62
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,100
uh,
pell to raise children with.

63
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,070
And I think in,
in the beauty and the beast story,

64
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:02,910
which I think is in some ways the 
central female myth,

65
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,223
there's an attempt to bridge the gap 
because what the woman does is find a 

66
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:07,344
monster and payment,
but you want your man to be tame enough 

67
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:12,844
so he doesn't eat your children,
but you want them to be rough enough so 

68
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:18,540
that your son has a fighting chance in 
the mating hierarchy.

69
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,374
And so that you have someone tough and 
aggressive is potentially able to 

70
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:23,454
protect you around.
And there's a lot of sexual 

71
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:26,900
attractiveness.
I'm not park.

72
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,250
And now element.
