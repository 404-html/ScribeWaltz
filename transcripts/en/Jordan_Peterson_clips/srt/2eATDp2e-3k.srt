1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,660
One piece of evidence that I love,
I think it's so well,

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:04,494
there's a couple.
One I would derive from friends to wall 

3
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:08,370
who's a famous primatologist and he 
studied,

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,413
he studied the prototype morality that 
emerges in chimpanzees and it's very 

5
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:16,680
much rest nested in their dominant 
structures,

6
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:17,514
you know,
because you could think of morality in 

7
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:19,554
some sense as the understanding of the 
rules by which the dominance hierarchy 

8
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:23,730
operates.
Right.

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,680
And so you could say,
well,

10
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:26,670
the biggest,
ugliest,

11
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:27,504
meanest chimp and the male dominance 
hierarchies in chimps seemed to be the 

12
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:31,044
predominant ones.
Although the females also have a 

13
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:34,770
dominance hierarchy in it.
It's not quite so clear in Bonobos,

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,500
which seemed to be more female 
dominated.

15
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:40,260
But in any case,
I'm the champ.

16
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,560
Primary chimp dominant structure is male
and you could think,

17
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:44,394
well,
it's like the.
