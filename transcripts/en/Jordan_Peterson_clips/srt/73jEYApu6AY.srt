1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,000
Conscientious people like they,
they value hard work,

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:08,560
rules,
order reliability,

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,280
integrity and structure,
and so their dutiful.

4
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:15,070
We analyze what predicted military 
performance.

5
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:15,830
For example,
in theU ,

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,780
s army overwhelmingly conscientiousness.
That's not surprising,

7
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:23,170
right?
Because it's a very structured rule,

8
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:28,171
ordered top down follow procedure sort 
of endeavor.

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,253
Now the armed forces had problems with 
that to some degree because they were 

10
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:33,274
also simultaneously looking for people 
who could think independently on their 

11
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:39,220
feet because if you're in a battlefield,
for example,

12
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,650
especially if you're isolated from your 
command structure,

13
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:42,484
there's going to be times when you have 
to make extraordinarily difficult 

14
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:45,274
decisions on your own,
but if you're selected primarily for 

15
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:49,504
conscientiousness,
that's not going to be your forte 

16
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:52,930
because if you're a conscientious 
person,

17
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,320
what happens is that you enter into a 
contract with someone,

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,810
even yourself,
and then you carry it out.
