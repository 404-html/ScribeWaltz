1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,553
I started watching a lot of pornography,
the pornography that I was watching had 

2
00:00:05,891 --> 00:00:08,550
to fit in with that.
I can't just watch anything.

3
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:10,920
I,
I became very limited to watching a very

4
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:15,921
specific type and I read the book,
the brain that changes itself by Dr.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,140
no dot.
I could see that exactly.

6
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:19,974
And I.
So even though I knew that the more 

7
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:26,490
times you give in your building up the 
circuitry and the last times you give in

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,310
your getting better.
I just,

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,183
I've had issues with that.
So that's what I've recently done that 

10
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,124
I,
I've stopped watching pornography for 

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,680
about a month now.

12
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,410
Okay.
So let,

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,630
let me ask you about that because you 
know,

14
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:38,464
there's a,
there's a big undergrown conversation 

15
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:42,280
about pornography that's happening on 
the web,

16
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,750
you know,
and with,

17
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,780
with many man and it's hard to tell how 
many deciding to stop using pornography.

18
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,603
And you know,
I've made some comments publicly about 

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,730
pornography use being,
let's call it sub optimal,

20
00:00:57,731 --> 00:00:59,050
you know,
because it.

21
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,490
Well,
because it,

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,593
I think that it,
it isn't good for the women who were 

23
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:05,710
involved in it and it's not good for 
young men because it's,

24
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,800
it's too,
it gives you access to something,

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,810
gives you access to part of something,
but denies you access to all of it.

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,630
And I think it's dangerous because of 
that,

27
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:21,150
because it,
it offers immediate gratification,

28
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:22,090
but no.
Well that's it.

29
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:25,380
It offers immediate gratification,
but no medium to longterm development of

30
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:27,690
character or life.
I guess that's it.

31
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,850
And,
and that seems to be a dangerous kind of

32
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:32,820
trap.
And the other thing is that it's also A.

33
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,790
Norman has talked about this Dr Doidge.
No,

34
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:36,624
it's,
we don't know what that kind of massive 

35
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:43,310
exposure to multiple virtual sex 
partners and,

36
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,203
and,
and does two to the development of the 

37
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:48,644
sexual sexual behavior and sexual 
gratification and sexual impulse in 

38
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:55,920
relationship in,
in young men at all.

39
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,933
So it's a technological,
technological marvel that's very 

40
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:03,450
dangerous I would say,
or at least it has the potential to be.

41
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,660
So what do you think the pornography use
did to you and what utility,

42
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:11,060
if any,
has there been in stopping?

43
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,790
I found that,
well it's just,

44
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:15,624
that's one issue that I've had or have a
major issue that I've had in many 

45
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:19,734
different facets,
has been looking for instant 

46
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:23,820
gratification.
So for me it's been food,

47
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,983
marijuana,
TV in pornography and I just found that 

48
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:33,300
my thoughts would be always just looking
for one of those and it in,

49
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,570
as soon as they experience was over 
your,

50
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,523
you'd have just had this little quick 
release where you feel good and then 

51
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,573
back in pain.
And I've sort of realized that my 

52
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:48,450
pleasure was just getting rid of pain,
like pain and pleasure are two sides,

53
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,313
sides of the same coin.
And I was just flipping the same coin 

54
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:56,961
over and over and how I felt now without
doing it.

55
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,770
Well,
when I first decided stop,

56
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,533
uh,
I thought I'd try writing down every 

57
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:06,150
time a thought came to watch pornography
and I,

58
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:07,810
I couldn't believe it the first day.

59
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,350
Like it seemed like almost like once a 
minute.

60
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:13,510
Like I just have a thought saying watch 
it,

61
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:14,344
watch it.
And my thoughts would try to trick me 

62
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:18,220
and say,
oh,

63
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,053
but just by observing,
and I don't know what you think about 

64
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:23,764
this,
but what I would do is when I get the 

65
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,750
thought to do it,
I,

66
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,583
I bite down on my thumb in one 
particular spot and then I found that 

67
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,010
the next few days the thoughts were just
coming less and less.

68
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:36,850
And now that it's been a month,
I rarely have the thought.

69
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,043
And the benefits I find is that I just 
feel so much more aware and I'm not 

70
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,860
seeking pleasure as much.
I'm just enjoying going,

71
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,960
going for walks and being in nature.

72
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,780
Hmm.
Well,

73
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:53,000
you know,
your,

74
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,133
your report is,
is really quite reminiscent of an 

75
00:03:57,841 --> 00:03:58,674
addiction actually because,
and you mentioned this and you did a 

76
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:03,090
good job of explaining it.
You know,

77
00:04:03,091 --> 00:04:03,924
if you.
If you engage in a behavior and then 

78
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:08,820
it's followed by a burst of pleasure,
like an orgasmic release,

79
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:09,654
then that behavior is going to be 
powerfully reinforced and the circuitry 

80
00:04:14,011 --> 00:04:14,844
that that drives you to,
that behavior is going to become 

81
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:17,934
dominant because behavior that 
culminates in a reward tends to become 

82
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:22,644
stronger.
And that includes attitudes and ideas 

83
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:27,510
and thoughts and impulses and 
rationalizations,

84
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:28,344
you know,
of exactly the sort that you were 

85
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:29,934
describing.
Then you said that it really plagued 

86
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,263
badly for the first day or two and then 
started to decrease quite precipitously 

87
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,780
after that.
And that's,

88
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,850
that's a good example of how behavior 
extinguishes if you cease rewarding it.

89
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,633
So,
and what does that freed you up to do 

90
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:47,664
and what do you think that's going to do
in terms of your willingness or ability 

91
00:04:50,911 --> 00:04:55,020
to pursue longterm a longterm 
relationship?

92
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:55,680
Yup.

93
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,450
For Free Time,
uh,

94
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,800
uh,
made a schedule after watching your,

95
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,663
your personality lectures and I just,
I have obviously I have a lot more time 

96
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:06,820
on my hands to,
to do those things.

97
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,193
Um,
and in terms of finding a partner since 

98
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:11,854
I've been back in Canada,
I haven't even for a lot of times I 

99
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,414
haven't approached women because I just 
feel that no matter what it leads to 

100
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,650
just have difficulties.
On one occasion there was a girl who was

101
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:29,810
hitting on me and we went on a couple 
dates and it went great.

102
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,230
She was attracted to me.
I was attracted to her,

103
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,920
we had a great time,
but when it came time to be intimate,

104
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:38,920
adjust,
I was shaking like a leaf,

105
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,950
like I just because I was so used to 
using the same stimulus of imagining,

106
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,490
I had a very strict thing that I can 
imagine in my mind.

107
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:50,620
I don't know what most people,
for most guys,

108
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:52,870
what they have to think of when they 
watch pornography.

109
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,123
I had to imagine entire backstory 
because I had this issue with trust 

110
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:58,340
because of what happened.
I think,

111
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,750
okay,
where are we?

112
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,740
Why did we meet?
What's going to happen after like I.

113
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,130
So because of all that I've just sort of
been avoiding it.

114
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,453
Um,

115
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,410
well.
So let me ask you a question.

116
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:13,244
Like I'd been trying to figure out what 
reasonable guidelines might be with 

117
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:21,731
regards to initiating sexual activity 
with a new partner.

118
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:22,574
And it seems to me that you probably 
shouldn't initiate anything that you 

119
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:30,830
wouldn't talk to the person about 
because what that might mean is that you

120
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:34,070
don't know them well enough to go that 
far with them physically.

121
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,190
And there's dangers in that.
You outlined some of them,

122
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,980
you know,
I mean sex is powerful and it can,

123
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,510
especially when you're inexperienced,
it can hurt you and hurt can be,

124
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,543
you know,
long term or permanent and that's kind 

125
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,664
of what you're relating.
And so one of the things that I might 

126
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:57,740
suggest is that when you initiate the 
next relationship that you.

127
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,423
I mean,
I'm not saying that this is an easy 

128
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:02,450
thing to do because it's not,
but it's,

129
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,613
there's nothing wrong with not moving 
forward sexually until you've been able 

130
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:12,521
to discuss what your life personally in 
relationship to sexual behavior,

131
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:14,870
you know,
like because you might say,

132
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:15,704
well maybe you shouldn't be engaging in 
intimate behavior with a person before 

133
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:23,210
you can tell them the story about what 
happened to you and in the South Pacific

134
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:26,030
and lay out your personal history and be
comfortable with that.

135
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,323
You know,
that seems to me that sort of emotional 

136
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,950
intimacy seems to be the proper 
precursor to physical intimacy.

137
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,784
And I know that our culture has pushed 
really hard probably since about the 

138
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,950
year or since about the emergence of the
birth control pill.

139
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:40,963
It's pushed pretty hard on this idea 
that casual sex is first of all 

140
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:46,094
possible,
that it can be casual and also 

141
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:49,370
desirable,
but I think that that.

142
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,640
I think that that's a big mistake.
I don't believe either of those.

143
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:53,474
I don't think that there is such a thing
as casual sex and I don't think that 

144
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:56,534
it's desirable.
I think it causes people a lot more 

145
00:07:58,431 --> 00:07:59,690
trouble than they realize.
