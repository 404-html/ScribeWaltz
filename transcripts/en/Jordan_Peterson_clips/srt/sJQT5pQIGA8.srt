1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,490
How does it feel to be viewed as a 
father figure by many people who grew up

2
00:00:03,491 --> 00:00:04,870
without one?
Well,

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,350
I think it's an unbelievable honor.
How's that?

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:09,663
And that is really what I think.
It's a tremendous honor and I'm doing 

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,630
absolutely everything I can to be worthy
of that.

6
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:17,464
And I would like to say to all the 
people out there who grew up without a 

7
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:23,020
father,
that's really too bad because you need a

8
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:26,320
father there to encourage you.
That's what fathers do,

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,010
is they encourage,
they help make you courageous,

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,083
and if I can help people develop the 
capacity to be courageous and to learn 

11
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:38,290
to tell the truth and to be responsible,
then that's great.

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,380
I,
I can't imagine a better outcome for me.

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,030
And so if people are willing to help me 
play that role and to use what I've been

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,550
teaching,
to guide them in that manner,

15
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:49,384
then hooray.
I couldn't possibly imagine a better 

16
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:53,080
outcome than that.
So.
