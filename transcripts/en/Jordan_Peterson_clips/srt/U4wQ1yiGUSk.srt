1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:00,903
One of the things we don't understand 
very well from a political perspective 

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:08,890
is that conservatives and liberals are 
actually quite different people,

3
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:09,724
temperamentally,
and so the way they filter the world is 

4
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:13,354
different and so the world presents 
itself as a set of facts that are 

5
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:17,494
different for liberals and conservatives
and so it's not just a matter of 

6
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:22,360
opinion.
It's a matter of fundamental,

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,703
fundamental,
temperamental orientation and to 

8
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:28,450
understand that other people,
this is the diversity argument.

9
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:31,390
If you were really making a diversity 
argument that was real,

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,433
this is the argument you would make.
People are actually different and and 

11
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:36,904
you need to understand the differences 
because there's advantages and 

12
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:39,694
disadvantages to all of the differences 
and there's also advantages and 

13
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:44,560
disadvantages into how we interact with 
each other.

14
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:45,840
That's important.
People to know.

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,013
It's really useful to talk to someone 
who's different than you because they 

16
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:53,020
actually see a different world and if 
you listen to them,

17
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:56,320
they can give you some insight into that
world and that means that your world can

18
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:59,890
expand and maybe if you knew that they 
were actually different,

19
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:03,730
like biologically different,
you'd be more inclined to listen to them

20
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:04,810
because you wouldn't think that.

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,340
I mean obviously people are arbitrary 
and ignorant and malevolent at times.

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,170
That's.
Those are separate issues.

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,153
But apart from all that,
they're also very different from one 

24
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:15,094
another.
And if you listen to someone who's 

25
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:18,790
different from you,
they'll tell you things you don't know.

26
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:22,420
And that's really helpful.
Unless you would like to not know things

27
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:23,690
and then you run like,
you know,

28
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,090
face first into walls.
