1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,230
I think people get so used to sort of 
the to think of past pain that an almost

2
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:07,500
blurs out in their mind.
It's like that sound,

3
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:09,810
the ringing that eventually your brain 
stops processing,

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,853
but I think you have a very good rule of
thumb which is the 18 month rule and I 

5
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:15,294
wonder if you could help people 
understand that it is not a suffering 

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,033
that,
that you have to take with you like a 

7
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:20,430
ball and chain for the rest of your 
life.

8
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:21,264
There are ways to release it,
but it does involve circling back and 

9
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:24,594
processing it through.

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,291
Yes.
Well,

11
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:25,771
what?
Well,

12
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:28,290
let's define what processing means.
Okay,

13
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,124
so you know,
let's say let's say that you had a 

14
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:31,854
pretty painful history of being bullied 
when you were 13 and you're still 

15
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,860
carrying that with you.
You carry it with you and your posture.

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,250
You carry it with you in your 
assumptions about people.

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,510
This is all implicit,
right?

18
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:43,344
It's not explicit.
You carry it with you in the form of 

19
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:46,584
resentment and the and the questions 
about what it might have been and you 

20
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:52,950
carry it with you because you've been 
demeaned by it.

21
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,100
But you know,
you're not 13 anymore,

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,593
you're 40 and those,
those experiences are not transferable 

23
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:07,290
in any simple,
simple manner to your current reality.

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,150
So you go back and you think,
okay,

25
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:13,230
what happened?
What exactly happened and what what?

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,363
What happened means is what were the 
causal pathways that put me in that 

27
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:22,650
position of vulnerability and 
inferiority and you want to specify them

28
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:26,760
as carefully as possible because what 
the part of you that's hanging onto that

29
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:31,761
wants to know is have you changed enough
so that that won't happen again,

30
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,810
and if the answer to that is yes,
even through thinking you realize,

31
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:38,160
well,
I'm not that person anymore,

32
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:40,650
or you go back to the experience and you
figure out,

33
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:41,484
oh,
this is what I did and I could stop 

34
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:43,200
doing that.

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,033
Then the,
the IC hands of that traumatic 

36
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:49,490
experiment experience will release that.
You can.

37
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,440
You will be released from it because 
what your mind wants to know,

38
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:53,274
your unconscious mind,
let's say is have you resolved this 

39
00:01:55,921 --> 00:02:00,570
issue to the degree that it is unlikely 
that it will occur again and that's what

40
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:01,160
it means to you

41
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,570
processed it.
And this.

42
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:03,404
I think is really important for people 
to understand that memory stick until 

43
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:08,690
you gain security memories,
stick to,

44
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,533
uh,
alert you to dangerous that you're 

45
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:14,000
recreating by avoiding the history.
So if you will,

46
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,720
you're going to either end up usually in
the belief victim paradigm,

47
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,703
right?
You're either going to go out there and 

48
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:19,431
say,
well,

49
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,140
I'm going to get them before they get 
me,

50
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,990
or you're going to go out there with 
your sort of shuffling along,

51
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:25,430
staring at the sidewalk,
you know,

52
00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:26,264
slumped shoulders,
and you're going to be inviting more 

53
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:28,154
bullies into your life.
And so until you figure out the 

54
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:32,750
causality of how you ended up being 
bullied,

55
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,703
you're going to gravitate to either of 
those two poles as either a fight or 

56
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,364
flight mechanism.
But if you go back and process and 

57
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:39,681
figure out,
okay,

58
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:42,770
here's the steps that happened that 
ended up with me being bullied.

59
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:45,200
Now I know how to avoid the bullying 
situation.

60
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,320
Then that pain will recede.
It's there until you listen.

61
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:49,850
It speaks until you're safe.

62
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,840
So there's this great scene in this 
documentary called Crumb,

63
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,690
which is about the underground 
cartoonists Robert Crumb.

64
00:02:57,691 --> 00:02:58,230
It's,
it's,

65
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,470
it's the most brilliant documentary I've
ever seen and it's,

66
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:03,850
it's highly instructive.
That documentary.

67
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:04,684
It's about a terribly eatable family,
but it's also about the successful 

68
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:09,364
struggle of one of the brothers in the 
family who became a famous underground 

69
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:12,874
cartoonists to free himself from that 
and part of the documentary details his 

70
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:21,490
terrible experiences as a 13 to 17 year 
old with women.

71
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,623
And he was.
He was one of these people that Robert 

72
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,220
Crumb who was not at the bottom of the 
dominance hierarchy.

73
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,370
He was outside the dominance hierarchy 
in the land of absolute contempt.

74
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,353
And he made this card when he was about 
13 or 14 with a broken heart on it and 

75
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:39,544
described his realization that he was 
such an outsider that he would never be 

76
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:45,070
successful with girls,
you know,

77
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,270
or period.

78
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,103
But particularly with girls.
But then that freed him up and he 

79
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:53,140
started to cartoon more and draw more 
and listen to old music.

80
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:55,030
And he kind of developed his own 
pathway.

81
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,700
And then he became a very successful 
illustrator.

82
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,740
And then he became very successful with 
women.

83
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,820
And so,
but,

84
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,590
but what.
But he,

85
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,443
he drew this picture to illustrate what 
he was like when he was 13 and he is 

86
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:13,600
very self critical and he draws himself.
It's kind of hunched over thick glasses,

87
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,520
really skinny,
underdeveloped,

88
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,520
weak chin,
a bad attitude.

89
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,720
I'm poorly presented,
badly dressed like a walking,

90
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,600
a walking testament to resentment and 
weakness,

91
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,410
and it wasn't until he realized that,
that,

92
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,280
that he was playing that part and that 
that was also fueling his rejection.

93
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,970
Was He really able to to move towards 
overcoming it.

94
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:40,360
And so partly what you want to do is to 
go over your past and figure out,

95
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:41,194
okay,
what stupid things did I do or what in 

96
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:48,280
what manner was I insufficient so that 
this negative destiny was more likely to

97
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:49,114
visit me?

98
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,253
Now you don't assume that everything 
that happened to you was your fault or 

99
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:54,904
under your control because everything 
isn't your fault and everything isn't 

100
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:01,420
under your control,
but you do want to figure out,

101
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:02,254
okay,
well if I played some hand in this and 

102
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:05,524
that could be rectified,
well then I should figure out how to 

103
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:09,730
rectify it because then I won't be in 
this situation anymore.

104
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:10,564
And you know,
you talked about the bullied victim who 

105
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,990
invites more bullying.
It's like,

106
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:16,810
well,
if you've conducted yourself in a manner

107
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,180
such that you've attracted the attention
of bullies and you haven't stopped doing

108
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:23,014
that,
then you're still going to attract the 

109
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:25,294
attention of bullies.
And so your mind is very alert to such 

110
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,494
things.
It's always looking for where you're 

111
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:32,290
weak and vulnerable and warning you 
about it.

112
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,530
And it's just an alarm bell,
right?

113
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,940
It isn't necessarily a problem solving 
mechanism.

114
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:37,774
And so alarm bells might be going off in
your head all the time and that's very 

115
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:41,224
unpleasant.
But the difficult process of 

116
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:46,660
articulating it and thinking it through 
can free you from that.

117
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,720
And so that's what the past authoring 
program is for.
