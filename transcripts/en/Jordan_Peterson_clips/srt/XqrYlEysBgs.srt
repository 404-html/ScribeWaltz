1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,420
This was a statistic that just 
absolutely shocked and staggered me when

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:05,400
I went through the Intel intelligence 
literature,

3
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:06,234
so you know,
it is illegal in the United States to 

4
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:09,294
induct anybody who has an Iq of less 
than 83 and the reason for that is you 

5
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:14,214
know that the American armed forces have
been conducting intelligence research 

6
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:18,054
for like more than 100 years and that 
was partly because they needed a way of 

7
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:25,170
sorting people rapidly during times of 
military expansion during war time.

8
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:29,490
But it was also because Iq tests and 
especially in the early part of the 20th

9
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:30,324
century were used to identify,
let's say the deserving poor who could 

10
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:34,434
really benefit from additional 
educational attainment and advancement 

11
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:38,024
in the unit.
And the military was hoping to identify 

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,270
people from lower class strata that can 
be streamed into say,

13
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:47,660
officer training programs and so forth 
or,

14
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,460
or even skills training programs to.

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,413
To move people from the underclass into 
at least the working class and maybe 

16
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,180
above.
So they had a bloody stake in this man.

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,283
They wanted to find people,
they want it to sort them properly and 

18
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,470
they wanted to do social good when they 
weren't just trying to win a war,

19
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:07,320
let's say,
which often also is social good,

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,573
but what happened was that by,
I don't remember when this legislation 

21
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:11,970
was introduced,
but it wasn't.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,890
It was in the later part of the 20th 
century,

23
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,210
but there are basic finding.
Was that by say the 19 eighties,

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,540
they had determined that if you had an 
Iq of less than 83,

25
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,360
there was not a damn thing that the unit
that the army could do,

26
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:25,194
the armed forces could do to transform 
you into someone who could do something 

27
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:32,250
that was more productive than 
nonproductive,

28
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,653
and the terrible thing about that is 
that it's about 10 percent of the 

29
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:40,110
population and so they look at a 
statistic like that and you think,

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,690
oh my God,
you've got this,

31
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,040
this,
this,

32
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,973
this enterprise,
this massive enterprise that's 

33
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,880
chronically hungry for people.

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,080
Right?
It's always,

35
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:49,943
they're always looking for people who 
are really oriented towards taking 

36
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:55,830
people from the underclass and lower 
working class and pushing them up.

37
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:56,664
The societal strata and during war time 
there actually desperate to bring in 

38
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:00,954
recruits period and their conclusion is 
that 10 percent of the population can't 

39
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,783
be trained to do anything.
Anything sufficiently useful to make 

40
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:12,000
them militarily operable.
It's just.

41
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,013
I just read that my jaw just dropped.
It's like in the United States we have 

42
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:22,281
about 330 million people and because of 
the distribution,

43
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,900
the relatively normal distribution of Iq
scores about 16 percent of 85 or what?

44
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,640
They're not going to graduate school.
No,

45
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,010
it means that from,
from what I've read practically,

46
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:40,740
it means the wanderlust company has 
actually done a really.

47
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,230
They have a nice Iq tests from the 
commercial perspective,

48
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:45,690
you know,
it's actually psychometrically valid and

49
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:50,691
they've linked Iq levels to a job.
Specifically the job categories,

50
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:53,890
you know,
I know not a lot.

51
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,940
I was going to say is they're not only 
not going to graduate school,

52
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,520
they're not going to find a,
a stable

53
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,840
job that pays a livable wage.

54
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,290
Especially even given that so many of 
the service jobs now require fair,

55
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,650
high degree of computational savvy or 
leader built.

56
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,030
No,
I'm not computation,

57
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:17,680
but ability to interact with complex 
computational technology,

58
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,973
the typical till ladder at a checkout 
market or or the Mcdonald's because the 

59
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,603
dongles is actually very complicated,
is often far beyond the ability of 

60
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:28,984
people who are on the low end of the 
intelligence distribution and they 

61
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:33,340
claimed,
I think it was wonderlic,

62
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,580
although it might know it might've been.
It might've been hunt.

63
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,660
What's his name?
These ICU researcher.

64
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:40,494
Is it earl haunt?
I think possibly what he claimed that 

65
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,190
that if you have an Iq of below 90,
that it's.

66
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,053
It's difficult.
It's difficult for you to read well 

67
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:54,160
enough to translate what you're reading 
into action,

68
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,010
so you can't actually read instructions 
and follow them.

69
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,750
You don't have that level of literacy.

70
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,430
That's correct,
yeah.

71
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,430
I was going to say that in in the United
States,

72
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,300
this bottom 16 percent translates into 
51 million people,

73
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,710
including $13 million children who are 
in school.

74
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,950
Right.
This is a very difficult problem.

75
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:19,660
Now I knew earl hunter.
He passed away.

76
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,613
I knew him pretty well.
He also would say that there is this a 

77
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,903
cognitive segregation in society.
This is a point that Charles Murray 

78
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:35,880
makes an often asked,
you know,

79
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,723
when's the last time you had someone 
over for dinner who wasn't a college 

80
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:41,314
graduate?

81
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,573
Well that was something that Marie and 
Bernstein wrote about in their book the 

82
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:45,814
bell curve,
which really struck me because I read 

83
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:51,280
that book twice unlike most of the 
people criticized it and you know,

84
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,070
we're one of the things that they 
pointed out in there,

85
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:54,904
it was,
look the typically the typical educated 

86
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:03,091
person thinks that someone isn't very 
bright if they have an Iq of 150.

87
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,490
So you at graduate level,
Phd Level Research Institutions,

88
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:09,880
right?
Because 115,

89
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,980
there's as many people at 115 and above 
as there are at 85 and below.

90
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,180
And so it's a minority of the population
and that's the top 15 percent.

91
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,610
And you know,
that's,

92
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,950
that's the dollar undergraduate people 
have.

93
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,790
See I'm a clinical psychologist and I've
dealt with people who had,

94
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:28,624
I ranges in the low eighties and tried 
to find them jobs and tried to train 

95
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:32,611
them.
And I,

96
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:33,444
I have some real knowledge about the 
stunning gap between people at the low 

97
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,430
end of the ICU distribution and the high
end,

98
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:41,020
and it's,
it's no bloody wonder,

99
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:41,854
people hate Iq research and intelligence
research because it reveals a set of 

100
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:46,234
seriously,
a dismal facts about the incredible 

101
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:52,330
range of ability among human beings.

102
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,840
Well,
yes,

103
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,503
this is true.
And moreover I would add to this that 

104
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,913
people in universities,
professors and a couple of graduate 

105
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:05,780
students,
uh,

106
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,110
have a hard time understanding what the,
what everyday life is like.

107
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,720
If you have an Iq of 84,
85 and we're making your way,

108
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:20,000
you're living independently.
You were making your way in the world

109
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,570
five.
It is a challenge.

110
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,960
I mean,
just,

111
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,860
just barely begins to describe it.
I had a,

112
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,843
I had a client who,
he probably had an Iq of under 80 

113
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,910
nonverbal portion of it anyways.
And um,

114
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,890
he was indistinguishable in physical 
appearance from,

115
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,730
from let's say,
I hate to use the frame normal person,

116
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:44,564
but there's nothing more that marked him
out about particularly intellectually 

117
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:48,500
impaired,
you know.

118
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,200
And uh,
I tried at one point,

119
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,120
this is this,
this was so,

120
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:58,150
so telling to me I got him a volunteer 
job,

121
00:06:58,311 --> 00:06:59,144
which by the way is very difficult.
It's harder to get a volunteer job in a 

122
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:02,084
real job because you have to do police 
screening and all sorts of things and 

123
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:06,050
the selection process is just as 
extreme.

124
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,350
But I eventually ended up getting him a 
job at a bike store,

125
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,933
bike slash bookstore and at that place 
couldn't hold him once the subsidy 

126
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:16,370
program had expired.

127
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,203
And then I got him a job at a charity 
and his job was to fold letters into 

128
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:25,100
three so that they can be put into 
envelopes.

129
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,820
Well,
that sounds easy except that he also had

130
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:29,654
a bit of a motor tremor and you know,
it took me about 30 hours to train him 

131
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:34,544
to fold up a piece of paper with 
sufficient precision so that it can be 

132
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:43,250
put in an envelope rapidly so that the 
envelope wasn't so mangled that it would

133
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:45,260
get stuck in the automatic sorting 
machine.

134
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,360
How,
in other words,

135
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,193
high performance demands on him too.
He had to whip through those letters 

136
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:54,371
pretty quickly and then sometimes the 
letters would have a photograph appended

137
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:56,114
to them that was stapled on and they 
weren't always stapled on in the same 

138
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:00,044
place,
so then he had to calculate how to fold 

139
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:02,294
the paper over the photograph without 
bending the photograph in precise third 

140
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:07,634
so that would still fit in the envelope,
and then he had to separate the French 

141
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,440
letters from the English letters and 
associate them with the proper envelopes

142
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:18,390
and that level of complexity just did 
him in.

143
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:20,440
Let

144
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,090
me say two things.
One is I hope common sense and the other

145
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:25,924
is pretty provocative.
The common sense thing is we have to be 

146
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:29,884
very careful when we have these 
discussions not to devalue the human 

147
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:35,494
dignity of people who are in the upper 
end of the distribution and if there's 

148
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:41,344
one criticism that is fair is sometimes 
in these conversations it sounds like 

149
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,343
we're devaluing people at the lower end 
of the distribution and we have to be 

150
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:56,460
very careful that we don't do that.
A human has dignity

151
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,293
and Iq is not the most important thing 
that defines human beings even 

152
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,093
associated with wisdom.
It's not necessarily associated with 

153
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,374
truth or with courage or with many 
virtues that how did it all with being 

154
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:14,664
likable or on the psychometric 
psychometric relationship between 

155
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,010
intelligence and conscientiousness is 
zero.

156
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,830
Right?
We have to make that point.

157
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,910
Yes,
I.

158
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,840
I agree.
I agree.

159
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,903
I'm trying to make the point about how 
difficult it is for people who are on 

160
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,740
the low end of the cognitive spectrum to
survive in a,

161
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,910
in an increasingly complex,
cognitively sophisticated environment,

162
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,040
jobs are just disappearing.
