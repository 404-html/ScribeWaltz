1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,150
Where I went into a restaurant the other
day in Toronto when this kid came up and

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,043
he shook my hand and he said,
I just want you to know that since I'd 

3
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:07,794
been listening to you,
I've got three promotions at this 

4
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:11,550
restaurant.
And I said,

5
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:12,384
well,
you know,

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,930
good work man,
like way to be.

7
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:16,591
And he said,
yeah,

8
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:17,424
well I started coming in on time and I'm
working really hard and I'm trying to 

9
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:23,460
figure out how I can do a good job here 
instead of being above the job,

10
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:24,294
you know,
I'll take this until I get something 

11
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:26,910
better.
It's sort of beneath me.

12
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:28,800
It's like,
no,

13
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:30,090
probably not.
Actually.

14
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:30,924
It's not that easy to do most jobs.
It's actually hard to do most jobs 

15
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:35,094
especially to do them well and it turns 
out that the world is constituted if 

16
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,340
society is set up well,
that if you do a good job,

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,220
invisible doors open in front of you.

18
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,140
Because people,
and I know this,

19
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:46,974
I've had lots of contact with businesses
and academic institutions and like the 

20
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:55,941
people who run things competently are 
often but not always interested.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,800
Very interested in finding young people 
that they can mentor and move forward.

22
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:05,370
It's actually one of the pleasures of 
being competent than something.

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,960
And so if they see someone who's like 
going that extra mile,

24
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,453
you know,
busy people have lots of opportunities 

25
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:15,750
around them and they think,
oh,

26
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:17,760
I've got that opportunity,
I can't really do it,

27
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,770
but I can funnel it over to this kid 
here.

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,920
Like let's see how he or she does it,
you know?

29
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:23,700
And so he said,
yeah,

30
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,560
you want to try this.
And the person says,

31
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,730
well,
I don't have time.

32
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:27,564
It's like,
well,

33
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,780
okay,
but the smart kid says,

34
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,940
yeah,
yes,

35
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,440
yes,
I'll do that.

36
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:37,170
And then the person with opportunities,
thanks watches and thinks,

37
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:38,004
okay,
well let's,

38
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,650
you know a bit,
see if the person does it.

39
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,940
And if they do it,
it's like,

40
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:42,774
hey,
here's four more opportunities that I 

41
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:47,400
don't have time for is like bang.
