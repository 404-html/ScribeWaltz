1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,920
What advice would you give to someone 
looking to quit porn?

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,653
Well,
I gave some advice a little earlier 

3
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:09,140
about quitting alcohol.
You know,

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,740
and I would say it isn't that you're 
trying to quit porn.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,020
It's not the right way to think about 
it.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,273
The right way to think about it is that 
you're trying to figure out how to have 

7
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:21,410
a better life.
And so you have to figure out,

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,173
well,
I would say do the future authoring 

9
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:27,490
program and keep your porn addiction in 
mind.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,160
And think so in the first part of the 
future authoring program,

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,230
it asks you a bunch of questions about 
what your life could be like in three to

12
00:00:36,231 --> 00:00:37,064
five years if you took care of yourself 
like you were someone that you cared 

13
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,124
for.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,020
Um,
and

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,273
then it asks you questions about your 
friends and your family and your career 

16
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:50,940
and your time outside of work and your 
health and you know,

17
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:54,120
the important dimensions of life and it,
it asks you to spend,

18
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,683
um,

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,153
20 minutes writing about how good your 
life could be in three to five years if 

20
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:01,720
you got your act together and did what 
was good for you.

21
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:04,570
And then it asked you to write about the
hell you could be at if you didn't.

22
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,920
And so I would say you really need to do
that because porn isn't the issue.

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,950
The issue is that you're not living your
life the way you want to.

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,750
So you need a vision of life that's more
compelling than the porn.

25
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:19,090
And you need a counter vision to that 
frightens you.

26
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,643
You know,
because otherwise porn is obviously 

27
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:24,940
extraordinarily gratifying in the short 
term.

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,793
But,
but you seem to be suffering from the 

29
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:29,770
medium to longterm consequences of its 
use.

30
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,013
And so you need a story that you can 
tell yourself that's really deeply 

31
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:38,170
thought through about why this is not 
appropriate for you.

32
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,071
What's,
what.

33
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:39,904
It's how it's hurting you.
And how it's minimizing you would be 

34
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,143
perhaps making you embarrassed and 
ashamed and more socially isolated and 

35
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:46,804
all of that.
So I would say think about it as 

36
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,853
cleaning up your psyche and your 
behavior rather than merely started 

37
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,663
stopping,

38
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,933
wow,

39
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,943
stopping poor,
and you also might want to write down 

40
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,263
and you could do this in the negative 
vision part of the future of the 

41
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,693
program.
You got to write down everything bad 

42
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:05,884
that you think porn is doing to you 
because obviously you have some 

43
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:11,170
suspicions that this is not good for 
you,

44
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,450
right?
That it's that it's actually harming you

45
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:18,451
in some important way,
and so you need to be fully cognizant of

46
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:19,354
what those ways are and then take them 
seriously and decide if that's the 

47
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:26,410
pathway through life on which you wish 
to travel.

48
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,020
And so I up then I would also say good 
luck to you.

49
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:32,260
You know it's,
it's a very good idea to identify one of

50
00:02:32,261 --> 00:02:33,900
your weaknesses and work on it.
Done.

51
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,953
You can.
You can strengthen yourself 

52
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:37,050
substantially by doing that.
