1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,260
Little kids should be doing whatever 
they can that's productive and useful as

2
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:05,094
young as they can.
Like if you have a two year old is just 

3
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:07,854
toddling around,
you know you can get that two year old 

4
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:11,770
to set the table.
We used to have our kids do that.

5
00:00:11,771 --> 00:00:15,780
It's really funny to watch it because 
the table's like half above their heads.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,810
So you know,
you give the two year old and knife,

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,940
not a sharp one.
Obvious.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,940
That's a different cycle.
I can save that for next time.

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,751
Peterson.
Yeah,

10
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:26,130
exactly.
You know when you say,

11
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:26,964
okay,
go put this on the table now they can't 

12
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:32,010
exactly put it beside the plate because 
they can't see the damn plate,

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,160
but the kids are actually.
If you're careful with them and you,

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,240
you adjust your expectations to their 
level of developing expertise.

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,940
That's called the zone of proximal 
development.

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,330
By the way there they're more than happy
to,

17
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,813
to comply because it helps them develop 
and move forward and they have a really 

18
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:52,240
powerful instinct for them,
you know?

19
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,470
And with kids,
it's also interesting if you,

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,393
if you watch them very carefully,
you can see when they're ready for the 

21
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:58,880
next task,
you know,

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,930
and then also the kids,
you know,

23
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:01,764
people talk a lot about self esteem,
which is very badly conceptualized self 

24
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:06,234
esteem because it,
it'll come to me and you should feel 

25
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:09,450
good about yourself,
which I don't believe.

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,580
I think you should feel good about who 
you,

27
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,300
who you could be if you've got your act 
together and you shouldn't be feeling so

28
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:17,550
good about who you are now and your 
story state.

29
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:18,630
It's like,
what the hell,

30
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:19,860
man,
you're 17.

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,390
Don't be feeling too good about 
yourself.

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,793
Get the hell.
Get your act together and see what you 

33
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:27,660
could be and feel good about your 
trajectory.

34
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,270
That's way different,
but also your competence.

35
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:34,920
And so like even with little kids is 
they know they're being taken care of.

36
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,813
They have an existential debt to their 
parents is like if you allow them to be 

37
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:40,134
useful and encourage them to do things,
then they get to pay off that 

38
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:43,254
existential debt and then they can see 
that they're contributing members of 

39
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:48,480
even this small society and it's no lie.
