1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,060
Of course,
you know that nature was the philosopher

2
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:04,620
who announced the death of God,
right,

3
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:05,454
and who is a great,
great critic of Christianity at vicious 

4
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:10,770
critic of Institutional Christianity in 
the best sense,

5
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:13,860
you know,
and he announced the death of God and he

6
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:16,950
said that we'd never find enough water 
to wash away the blood.

7
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:17,784
It wasn't a triumphant proclamation even
though it's often read that way and 

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,830
niches conclusion from that,
from the death of God,

9
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:27,990
the fact that our ethical systems,
we're going to collapse.

10
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:30,390
When the foundation was pulled out from 
underneath him,

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,050
he believed that human beings would have
to find their own values to create their

12
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:34,884
own values,
and there's a problem with that because 

13
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:37,434
it doesn't seem.
This is something Carl young was very 

14
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,823
thorough in investigating,
doesn't really look like people are 

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,493
capable of creating their own values 
because you're not really capable of 

16
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:48,780
molding yourself just any old way.

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,690
You want to be like you have a nature 
that you have to contend with,

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:52,973
and so it isn't a matter of creating our
own values because we don't have that 

19
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:57,444
capacity.
It might be a matter of rediscovering 

20
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,440
those values,
which is what [inaudible] was attempting

21
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:03,530
to do now.
And,

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,633
and,
and so I think Nietzsche was actually 

23
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:08,610
profoundly wrong in that,
in that recommendation.

24
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:10,230
I think he was psychologically wrong.
Now,

25
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,610
you know,
there was [inaudible] wrote in many ways

26
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,450
in parallel to.
Nisha was a great influence on Ninja.

27
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:18,284
Their,
their lives parallel each other to a 

28
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:22,890
degree that's somewhat miraculous and in
some senses it's quite uncanny.

29
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,500
Dostoevsky was obviously a literary 
figure,

30
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:28,290
whether whereas nature was a 
philosopher,

31
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,163
a literary philosopher,
but still a philosopher and Dostoevsky 

32
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:34,620
wrestled with exactly the same problems 
that,

33
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,280
that nature wrestled with and,
but he did it in a different way.

34
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,263
He didn't literary manner and he has 
this great book and the brothers 

35
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:43,734
Karamazov.
And in that book there's a hero of the 

36
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:48,390
book is really Leo Show Who's a monastic
novitiate,

37
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,430
a very good guy,
kind of a,

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,290
not an intellect,
not an intellect,

39
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,170
but,
uh,

40
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,170
a person of great character,
you know,

41
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:56,380
and,
but he has a brother Ivan,

42
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,370
who's his older brother who a great 
intellect and,

43
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,900
and a very handsome soldier and a brave 
man.

44
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:04,710
And like Dostoyevsky's villains,
Ivan isn't exactly a villain,

45
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:05,544
but that's close enough.
Ivan or Dostoevsky makes his villains 

46
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:11,220
extraordinarily powerful.
So if Dostoevsky's trying to work out an

47
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,054
argument,
he,

48
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,860
he clothes the argument in the,
in the flesh of one of his characters,

49
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,933
and if it's an argument he doesn't agree
with and he makes that character as 

50
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:21,084
strong as he possibly can,
as strong and as attractive and 

51
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:24,960
intelligent as he possibly can.

52
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,793
And then he let him just have outer.
And so Ivan is constantly attacking Lee 

53
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,470
Osha and from every direction trying to 
knock him off his perch of faith,

54
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:36,260
let's say,
and the Osha Lee.

55
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,460
Osha can't address a single one of 
Ivan's criticisms and,

56
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,210
and he doesn't have the intellect for 
it.

57
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:43,000
And,
and,

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,760
and Ivan has a devastating intellect.
It's devastating to him himself as well.

59
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,270
What happens in the brothers Karamazov 
essentially is the daily.

60
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,020
Alicia continues to act out his 
commitment to the good,

61
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:56,760
let's say.
And in that manner,

62
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:57,594
he's triumphant.
It doesn't matter that he loses the 

63
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,350
arguments because the arguments aren't 
exactly the point.

64
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,580
The arguments in some sense are aside.
