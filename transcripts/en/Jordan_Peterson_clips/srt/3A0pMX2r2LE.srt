1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,923
If you're going to be an entrepreneur,
you almost have the opposite profile as 

2
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:04,464
a soldier,
you're very high in openness and you're 

3
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:07,434
lowering conscientiousness or at least 
conscientiousness is irrelevant and the 

4
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:11,604
reason for that seems to be that like if
you're an orderly person and you'd like 

5
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:15,294
to follow procedures and rules,
it's kind of hard for you to start a 

6
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:18,714
company because when you first start a 
company or engage in any other creative 

7
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:23,640
process,
because entrepreneurs turn out to be the

8
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:26,370
same as artists,
you kind of have to.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,370
You're not operating within a rule 
governed structure.

10
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:30,204
In fact,
there may be many times where you have 

11
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:36,381
to break a small rule to move properly 
at a higher level of analysis.

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,710
There is no algorithmic way of 
generating a new company,

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,910
right?
Obviously,

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,133
and so it's people who are very high in 
openness who happened to be good 

15
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:50,040
entrepreneurs and so this is something I
thought was extraordinarily cool because

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,030
we'd.

17
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,460
We'd also already known what predicts 
managerial,

18
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:58,461
administrative and academic ability and 
Iq is crucial for any complex jobs.

19
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:02,010
So we'll just leave that behind.
But what predicts academic ability?

20
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:02,844
For example,
at the University of Toronto is 

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,590
intelligence obviously,
but also conscientiousness,

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,920
the correlation between creativity and 
grades at the UFT is zero zero.

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,880
Right?
But it's not.

24
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:17,160
It's not surprising that the thing is,
you know,

25
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:17,994
it's easy to be cynical about that,
but one of the things you have to 

26
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:20,904
understand about creative people is that
they continually step outside of the 

27
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:27,240
domain of evaluation structures.
Right?

28
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:28,074
Because if you're going to say you're 
going to evaluate [inaudible] 

29
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,660
performance of 100 professors on their 
lecturing ability,

30
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:34,883
while you kind of have to measure what's
common across all the professors in 

31
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:40,500
order to come up with the standards for 
evaluation,

32
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,610
well that means you're not going to be 
able to use that structure to evaluate a

33
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:45,444
particularly creative professor because 
he or she is going to do something in a 

34
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:52,440
way that's so different that it won't 
show up on the evaluation measure.

35
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,780
And of course that's what happens in 
universities.

36
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,530
You know,
somebody sent me a couple of days ago,

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,393
somebody sent me an essay that they had 
written for their master's thesis that 

38
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:03,144
was wildly creative and they were 
basically told to leave the program and 

39
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,860
that they couldn't continue.
Not in a mean way.

40
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:09,694
They.
What happened was that what they were 

41
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:15,060
thinking was so outside of the 
conventions in the discipline is that no

42
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:17,040
one had any idea what to do with the 
essay.

43
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,160
So and then that's really the law of 
creative people,

44
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:20,994
right?
They're always stepping outside of 

45
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,773
evaluation structures and so it's not 
that surprising that the relationship 

46
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:29,370
between creativity and grades at the u 
of t is zero.

47
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,353
We found out as well by looking at 
graduate student performance across 

48
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:33,924
multiple institutions that there was a 
negative correlation between creativity 

49
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:40,350
and graduate school performance.
It wasn't even zero.

50
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,183
It was worse than negative.
Being creative was negative and you 

51
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:45,504
think,
well that could make you cynical as 

52
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:46,890
well,
but.

53
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,723
But you can't be cynical in that way 
because one of the things that happens 

54
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,004
in science is that science tends to 
progress incrementally rather than in 

55
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,074
great leaps now.
And then someone comes who blows the 

56
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:04,330
structure out of a science,
advances it ridiculously like Einstein,

57
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:06,700
but like most people aren't Einstein,
it may be,

58
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:10,720
thank God for that.
Most of the time you're in a discipline,

59
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:12,670
you,
you understand the discipline,

60
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,640
and then once you've developed 
understanding of the discipline,

61
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:16,474
you know what the next micro question is
that should be answered and part of the 

62
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:21,604
reason that science is so powerful is 
because it allows people who aren't 

63
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,930
genius level creatives to make real 
advances in the generation of knowledge.

64
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,550
One tiny micro step at a time.
It doesn't matter if there's 100,000

65
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:36,820
people doing it and each of them is 
making a micro step.

66
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,653
Man,
we're zipping along as fast as we 

67
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:39,304
possibly wanted zip along.
And so it turns out to be 

68
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:42,064
conscientiousness.
That's the excellent predictor of 

69
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:46,600
graduate student performance.
That's the best predictor for law.

70
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,940
It's the best predictor for managerial 
positions.

71
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:51,310
It's the best predictor for 
administrative positions.

72
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,060
Anything that has a structure of rules 
that needs to be applied,

73
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,060
conscientiousness is a great predictor.
So,

74
00:03:58,061 --> 00:03:58,894
but it's not good for predicting 
artistic ability or entrepreneurial 

75
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:03,250
ability.
And that's also really important because

76
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,323
one of the things,
this is partly why bureaucracies 

77
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:08,980
stultify right?
Because what happens is they,

78
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:09,843
as they develop,
they get chock full of conscientious 

79
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,470
people with a few psychopaths thrown in 
there just for good measure.

80
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,120
They get chocked full of conscientious 
people busily zooming,

81
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:19,954
efficiently down to a single track,
and then all of a sudden the landscape 

82
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:23,884
shifts and they're going very,
very efficiently in exactly the wrong 

83
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:29,320
direction and then the whole bloody 
thing falls apart.

84
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,333
So you need to have some creative wing 
nuts in your organization to come up 

85
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:38,860
with completely absurd ideas that might 
just on the off chance be true.

86
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,540
And so creativity is strange in that 
manner too because it's a high risk,

87
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,374
high return game.
You're a lot safer in your life to find 

88
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:50,830
a functioning entity and to operate as a
cog within it,

89
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,993
as long as the entity keeps functioning.
Because if you're creative and you go 

90
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:56,494
off on tangents all the time,
there's some probability that one of 

91
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:00,184
those tangents is going to be exactly 
what is needed at the time and you're 

92
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:04,960
going to become hyper successful.
As a consequence,

93
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,280
but there's much more probability that 
even though your,

94
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,600
some of your ideas might be highly 
valuable,

95
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,583
the probability that this is the right 
time and place for them is 

96
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:15,274
extraordinarily low,
so to produce a successful creative 

97
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:19,060
product,
for example,

98
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:19,894
in the marketplace,
you need a ridiculous combination of 

99
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,403
creativity so that you keep generating 
ideas and then a network around you of 

100
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:29,824
people who have skills that you don't 
and then the production of a of a 

101
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,350
product,
let's say whatever that happens to be,

102
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,363
that's actually in demand by the 
marketplace at exactly that moment and 

103
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,640
that someone else hasn't already done 
better.

104
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,060
So the sensible thing to tell anybody 
who wants to be creative is that stupid.

105
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
You shouldn't do it.
It's,

106
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:50,714
it's your probability of success is so 
low that it's better just to do 

107
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:55,744
something sensible,
but the problem with that is that 

108
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,333
creative people can't do that because 
they're creative and if they shut down 

109
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:02,234
their creativity,
it's like an extrovert who's gone to 

110
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:06,410
live in a.
In an isolated cell,

111
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,690
a creative person who isn't being 
creative.

112
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,090
They just.
They just wither and die,

113
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,860
so they're stuck with it.
So.

114
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,800
But it is a high risk,
high return strategy.
