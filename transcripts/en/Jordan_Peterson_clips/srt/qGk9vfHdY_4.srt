1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
One of the things that made marks wrong 
was Marx believed that capital would 

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,023
flow into the hands of fewer and fewer 
people and that the association between 

3
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:18,621
the rich and the poor would become more 
extreme as capitalism developed and like

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,610
so many things that mark said.
That's it's kind of true.

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,250
It's kind of true in that

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,673
the distribution of wealth and in fact 
the distribution of anything that's 

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,150
produced follows a peritoneal pattern 
and the prieto pattern basically is that

8
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,343
a small proportion of people end up with
a bulk of the goods and it isn't just 

9
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:41,304
money.
It's,

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,153
it's anything that people produce,
creatively ends up in that distribution 

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,413
and that's actually the economists 
called out the matthew principle and 

12
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:51,924
they take that from US statement in the 
New Testament and the statement is to 

13
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:57,720
those who have everything more will be 
given and from those who have nothing.

14
00:00:57,721 --> 00:00:58,554
Everything will be taken and it's a map 
of the manner in which the world 

15
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:03,744
manifests itself.
Where human creative production is 

16
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:07,194
involved in the map seems to indicate 
that as you start to produce and you're 

17
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:10,704
successful,
the probability that you will continue 

18
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:17,170
to be successful or accelerate increases
as you're successful and as you fail,

19
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:19,530
the probability that you will fail 
starts to accelerate.

20
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,510
So in your progress through life looks 
like this or like this,

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,673
something like that.
And the reason that Marx was right was 

22
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:33,420
because he noted that as a feature of 
the capitalist system.

23
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,463
The reason that he was wrong is that 
it's not a feature that's specific to a 

24
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:38,424
capitalist system.
It's a feature that's general to all 

25
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:45,540
systems of creative production that are 
known and so it's like a natural law and

26
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:46,374
it's enough of a natural law by the ways
that the distribution of wealth can be 

27
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:51,204
modeled by physical models using the 
same equations that govern the 

28
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,670
distribution of gas molecules in a 
vacuum.

29
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:57,923
So it's a really profound.
It's a fundamentally profound 

30
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:01,794
observation about the world way the 
world lays itself out and it's 

31
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,334
problematic because if resources accrue 
unfairly to a small minority of people 

32
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,070
and there's a natural law like element 
to that that has to be dealt with from a

33
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:23,930
social perspective because if the 
inequality becomes too extreme,

34
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,943
then the whole system will destabilize 
and so you can have an intelligent 

35
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,473
discussion about how to mitigate the 
effects of the transfer of creative 

36
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,120
production into the hands of a small 
number of people.

37
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,980
Now,
the other reason,

38
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,540
however,
having said that,

39
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,300
the other reason that Marx was wrong,
there's a number of them.

40
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,420
One is that even though

41
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,610
creative products end up in the hands of
a small number of people,

42
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:58,030
it's not the same people consistently 
across time.

43
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,810
It's the same of people and that's not 
the same thing.

44
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,213
You know,
like imagine that there's water going 

45
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:05,860
down a drain and you say,
well,

46
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:08,410
look at the spiral.
It's permanent.

47
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:08,921
You think,
well,

48
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:11,200
the spirals permanent,
but the water molecules aren't.

49
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:12,034
They're moving through it and it's the 
same in some sense with the prieto 

50
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,394
distribution is that there's a one 
percent and there's always a one 

51
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:19,720
percent,
but it's not the same people.

52
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,130
It's the stability of a diy differs from
culture to culture,

53
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:28,570
but there's a lot of movement in the 
upper one percent,

54
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:32,020
a tremendous amount of movement,
and one of the reasons for that movement

55
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:37,021
is that things get large and then they 
get too large and then they collapse,

56
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,513
and so in 2008,
when the politicians said too big to 

57
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:43,534
fail,
they got something truly backwards as 

58
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:49,070
far as I can tell,
and that was.

59
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,070
It was a reverse.
The statement was reversed.

60
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,830
It should have been so big it had to 
fail.
