1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
How does he become corrupt and for a 
person to avoid the dangers of the 

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,780
postmodern,
neo Marxist ideologies and not enroll?

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,003
Would you agree the same thing applies 
to the institute of marriage with laws 

4
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:15,681
as they are?
No,

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,323
I wouldn't say that.
I guess partly because I don't 

6
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:24,110
understand what the alternative is.
First,

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,953
I would say that to the degree that men 
are just your unjustly upset about the 

8
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:32,520
way the marriage laws are set up and I 
think they have reason to be concerned,

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,803
especially with regards to the custody 
of children and the probability of 

10
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:37,464
paying virtually endless alimony with 
unbelievably severe penalties for 

11
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,280
failure.
Um,

12
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,423
I think that it's incumbent on men to 
organize themselves politically and 

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,653
rectify that.
