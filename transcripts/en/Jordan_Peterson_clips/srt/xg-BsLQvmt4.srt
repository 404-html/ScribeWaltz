1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,860
If you're not united within yourself and
you need to be united in relationship to

2
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:06,720
a higher purpose to be united within 
yourself,

3
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:07,554
then you're weak and the world will take
you apart and and and the reason it 

4
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:15,030
takes you apart,
I think as partly because life is,

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,013
is rife with suffering and it certainly 
bounded by mortality and those are very 

6
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:20,304
grim fats and unless you have hammered 
yourself together to find a destiny 

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,210
that's of sufficient nobility so that,
that the so that those negative elements

8
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:31,044
become tolerable,
then the suffering will take you apart 

9
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:34,190
and,
and,

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,550
and,
and demolish you.

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,420
And so it's not optional.
This is you might say,

12
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:41,010
well,
what does that have to do with God?

13
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:43,500
And I suppose that depends on what 
you're,

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,630
what,
how you interpret God,

15
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:50,100
but it certainly at least has to do with
the finding of a transcendent purpose.

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,503
So,
and you do that through consultation 

17
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:53,940
with yourself.
You know,

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,783
and you're yourself,
and this is a kind of a way of looking 

19
00:00:57,301 --> 00:01:00,420
at things that,
that curl you can develop your self that

20
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:04,170
I'm talking about is the higher self.
That tells you,

21
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:05,004
for example,
when your pursuit of impulsive pleasure 

22
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:08,514
has demeaned you or or interfered with 
your proper motive being and people 

23
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:14,154
understand that experience very well.
You don't have to talk to someone very 

24
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,740
long until you can discover what they're
ashamed of.

25
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:20,574
For example,
like why be ashamed if you aren't doing 

26
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:26,520
something that demeans you.
Why have contempt for yourself if you're

27
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:27,354
not missing the mark and with and the 
fact that you have shame and self 

28
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:31,734
contempt.
He indicates that there's something in 

29
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:36,870
you that striving beyond what you're 
currently investigating and and for your

30
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,700
libertarian types,
like I would say,

31
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,780
look,
you don't have to Kowtow to an arbitrary

32
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:43,614
external authority,
although often there's use in that from 

33
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,124
a disciplinary perspective,
but I could say just as 

34
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,293
straightforwardly and usefully that your
viewers and listeners could merely stop 

35
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:00,300
doing what they know themselves to be 
wrong.

36
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,763
Forget about what anyone else thinks.
It's like you know when you've 

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,670
transgressed against your,
your being and we we could say,

38
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:09,930
well,
you have an ethical.

39
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:13,140
It's an ethical necessity to limit the 
transgressions,

40
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,910
transgressions that you can identify 
against the nature of your being,

41
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,460
and I don't see that that's a disputable
point.

42
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:22,800
Unless someone can step forward and 
claim.

43
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,260
While I never feel any shame and 
everything I do,

44
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:26,094
I believe to be 100 percent right.
It's like get away from that person 

45
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:30,720
unless they're the Buddha.
