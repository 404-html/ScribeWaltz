1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:00,903
It's really useful to understand that 
there are actual reasons why people see 

2
00:00:04,661 --> 00:00:05,494
the world differently and that you can't
just easily say that one is right and 

3
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:11,680
the other is wrong because the liberals 
are correct when it comes to borders,

4
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:14,710
that if you thicken them too much and 
diminish the information flow,

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:15,783
you risk making the society so static 
that any radical environmental 

6
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:21,820
transformation will sink it.
It's the case,

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:22,803
but the conservatives are right in that 
you pay a big price with regards to 

8
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:26,584
newcomers and new information with 
regards to risk to exposure to 

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,900
contaminating while to contamination 
period,

10
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:35,650
but also to contaminating ideas.
And so then I've always thought,

11
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:36,484
you know,
the,

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,400
the environment itself moves back and 
forth like a snake in some sense.

13
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:43,480
And what we're trying to do is stay on 
the center of its back.

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,940
And the only way we can do that is by 
people,

15
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,830
by having people pull to the right and 
say,

16
00:00:47,831 --> 00:00:48,520
be careful.

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,410
And people pull to the left and say,
well yeah,

18
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:55,411
but be open with that dialogue and the,
the exchange of information that,

19
00:00:55,631 --> 00:00:56,464
that dialogue allows,
we can maybe specify the center of that 

20
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:03,280
moving target and stay and stay well and
stay on the back.

21
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:04,040
Let's,
yeah.

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,873
Okay.
So that's a really complicated metaphor 

23
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:06,374
with the snake.
But I think it's a perfect way in to 

24
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:11,840
what's going on on campus and to why 
viewpoint diversity is so important.

25
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:14,720
Cause that's,
I agree exactly with what you just said.

26
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,853
And so what I,
the view that I've come to in studying 

27
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,290
moral psychology is that we is that 
humans are ultra social apes.

28
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,380
Um,
we,

29
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,380
we evolved to live in these small groups
that are fighting with each other.

30
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,663
Uh,
we evolve to have these low level 

31
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:36,140
animistic religions.
That's our steady state.

32
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:39,170
That's the way we were for at least a 
hundred thousand years are much more,

33
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,450
um,
probably closer to million in some form.

34
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,550
Um,
so that's sort of our design.

35
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,290
That's what we were designed for in a 
sense.

36
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,573
Um,
and in that sense were as individuals 

37
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,660
really kind of stupid tribal creatures 
designed to do post hoc reasoning.

38
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,913
Um,
but if you put us together in the right 

39
00:01:56,781 --> 00:01:59,690
way with the right checks,
with the right,

40
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,940
the right systems,
um,

41
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,180
the,
the whole can be vastly smarter than the

42
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,073
components that go into it,
which is true of the brain to the brain 

43
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,194
is composed of neurons.
Each neuron is really kind of stupid 

44
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:11,474
little switch,
but you put them together in the right 

45
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:14,660
way and you get something really 
brilliant.

46
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,610
And in the same way,
um,

47
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,473
I don't know all the history here,
but my understanding is that science 

48
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:20,654
begins or the culture of science,
the scientific revolution begins in 

49
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:28,850
Europe in the 17th century.
As you begin getting,

50
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,400
you get the printing press so people can
share their ideas,

51
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,460
but you get communities of people who 
are challenging each other's ideas.

52
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,713
And that's what makes it so brilliant is
that is that people have to do their 

53
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:39,734
best.
We're really bad at this confirming our 

54
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:41,924
own ideas.
It's very hard to make it very hard to 

55
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:44,054
do that.
But you put your ideas out there and 

56
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:47,720
then everyone else is motivated to 
challenge them.

57
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,330
And so if you put us together in the 
right way,

58
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,223
the truth comes out.
And so adversarial systems of law 

59
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,090
journalists know this.
They have to listen to both sides.

60
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,820
Scientists know this.
Social scientists should know this.

61
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,520
Okay,
what happened?

62
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,620
Well,
um,

63
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,513
the academy has,
has always leaned left in the 20th 

64
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:08,500
century,
but leaning isn't the problem.

65
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,940
So people think,
oh,

66
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:12,400
viewpoint diversity we need,
we need everybody.

67
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,960
We need Nazis.
We need every view.

68
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,550
No,
we don't need everybody.

69
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,960
What we need is no orthodoxy.
That's what's fatal orthodoxy.

70
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,010
So if you have a,
if you have to feel it like sociology or

71
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:26,320
social psychology in which it's two or 
three,

72
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,250
two,
one left to right,

73
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,383
that's totally fine with me,
that's totally fine because if someone 

74
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:35,200
makes some claim that's just like 
ideologically blind,

75
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,090
someone will say,
uh,

76
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,470
you know,
common sense,

77
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,260
other evidence that you've missed and 
then the system works.

78
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,843
But what,
what I learned when I started down this 

79
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,004
road in 2011,
I gave a talk at the big conference of 

80
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,214
social psychologists.
I gave a talk about this problem that 

81
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:51,304
we're losing our diversity,
that I could only find one conservative 

82
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:57,160
and the entire field and they gave a 
talk on this.

83
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,620
Um,
and um,

84
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,383
um,
and so what I've learned since then is 

85
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:09,001
that the ratio in psychology was between
two to one and four to one left,

86
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:11,290
right?
All the way up to the early nineties.

87
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,420
We've gathered together all of the 
studies we could find.

88
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,860
So all the,
up to the early nineties,

89
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,570
it's only three or four to one left to 
right,

90
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:18,360
which would be okay.
Um,

91
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,430
but then between 1995 or four and 2010,
it goes to a 14 to one.

92
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,223
Do you,
do you have any idea why and why that 

93
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:29,290
time?
Yes.

94
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,580
So,
um,

95
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,140
so you get the same story.

96
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,680
Whether you look at Republican,
Democrat ratios or liberal conservative,

97
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:36,880
they're,
they tell the same story.

98
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,163
So the two of the big things going on,
there are one is that the greatest 

99
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:43,420
generation,
which had a lot of Republicans,

100
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,420
um,
so a lot of men go off to World War II.

101
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,283
They are there on the Gi bill.
They entered the academy in the 1950s a 

102
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:52,750
lot of them are conservative or 
Republican.

103
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,520
Um,
so you have a lot of them.

104
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,653
But in the sixties and seventies,
one of the main reasons to go to Grad 

105
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:58,804
school and the social sciences is either
a to stay in school to escape the 

106
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:06,550
Vietnam war draft or be to fight for 
social justice and against racism.

107
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,970
So in sociology and psychology in 
particular in political science,

108
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:10,804
maybe,
I'm not sure you get a huge influx of 

109
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:16,570
left leaning people who are there to 
pursue social justice.

110
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,703
So you know,
the motives are fine and if it was 

111
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:24,250
balanced and be totally fine,
but as you get these young junior people

112
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:25,084
on the left come in in the 70s and 
eighties and then you get the older 

113
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:28,840
people that are more politically 
balanced,

114
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:30,280
retiring in the eighties and nineties.

115
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,170
By the time you get to the late 
nineties,

116
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,220
it's all baby boomers.
And so do you get a,

117
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,660
you get a positive feedback loop 
developing in there.

118
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:39,370
Like you said,
it's like three to one.

119
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:41,770
It's okay,
but maybe when it hits four to one,

120
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:43,700
it goes to like 20 to one,
then you stay.

121
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,680
Exactly.
So then,

122
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,870
so then you start getting hostile 
climate.

123
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,720
So I wrote a review paper on this with 
uh,

124
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,880
with Joe Duarte and Phil tetlock and 
lead Justin,

125
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,440
jared Crawford.
Um,

126
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,150
um,
and um,

127
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,830
um,
and we,

128
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,723
uh,
so we reviewed everything that we could 

129
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:03,950
find and we concluded that most of 
what's going on is self selection.

130
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,470
That is people on the left are more open
to experience.

131
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:08,690
They're always going to get self 
selection.

132
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,260
But then there's really good evidence 
that there's also hostile climate.

133
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,153
I mean it's,
it's undeniable now that if you are not 

134
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:15,974
on the left in a Grad program,
there's just constant little subtle or 

135
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:21,440
not so subtle reminders that you don't 
belong.

136
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,960
And look in the academy,
we're all about saying,

137
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,033
Hey,
if there are subtle hints here and 

138
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:27,620
there,
you can't succeed.

139
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,161
Right?
I mean,

140
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:31,610
that's what we do for a living is we say
that little things will stop people.

141
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:32,781
Um,
well,

142
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:35,450
little things are put in the way of 
anyone who doesn't fit politically.

143
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,640
Uh,
and so you do get hostile climate.

144
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,890
You do get over discrimination.
There's evidence of that.
