1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,610
Going to tell you a story from the 
Soviet Union,

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,040
it's Solzhenitsyn.
He introduces it with the whole from the

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:13,041
Russian poet laureate cost.
So sympathizer with cohesion,

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,800
construction,
grit and repression.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,180
Wring the neck of this gang.
Right?

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,570
That's nice.
Pole socialists and wonderful.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,310
Who was the gay?
That's the question.

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,303
As I said,
he has to make 66 million people died 

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,260
between 1970 and 1950.
Nine.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,273
Socialists are also estimated that 
substantially larger number of in 

11
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,850
Communist China.
No one really knows the staff's on map.

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:38,843
Now.
This is a debatable statistic as social 

13
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,960
next one.
Points out spoke business from the Gulag

14
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:43,794
archipelago as soon as the official 
statistics are released to revise their 

15
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:52,260
estimates.
This includes,

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,333
for example,
separate millions billion hasn't pushed 

17
00:00:56,581 --> 00:01:01,050
into the Tundra forced relocation at 
nearly $26 million trainings.

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,320
We've famines in 1930.
Second preview story.

19
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,923
So this is the situation.
So I'll tell you a little bit about his 

20
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:20,970
life story.
It was a three volume.

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,953
The second volume of which you will read
a story about blue light system of 

22
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:34,530
forced labor camps set up in the Soviet 
Union.

23
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,930
Soon after Lennon died.
In fact,

24
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,853
yes,
some of them were set up before he died 

25
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,523
and upon which the Soviet economy brand 
for much of what constituted it's nets 

26
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,220
and started his travels through the 
gulag originally as a Russian front line

27
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:53,914
soldier storing sense thrown into a 
German prisoner of war camp and when he 

28
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:04,941
was repatriated to the Soviet Union 
styling through later in a concentration

29
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:09,120
camp and the reason why is as he did 
with all of the return Russian prisoners

30
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:09,954
of war who were treated by the week 
terribly in the German prisoners of war 

31
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:14,274
camps because Stalin refused to sign the
Geneva Convention on the treatment of 

32
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:17,550
prisoners.

33
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,860
So not only were they in prisoners of 
war camps,

34
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,873
which was miserable enough that they 
were starved to the degree that the 

35
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,870
other ally prisoners used to give them 
food.

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,590
They didn't have much food themselves.
So he was a front line soldier.

37
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:32,424
Then he got thrown into German prisoner 
of war camp and then when he finally 

38
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:35,574
returned to Russia,
tell him through when it comes to 

39
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:38,064
training camp.
And the reason for that was that the 

40
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:42,354
Russians who were in German prisoners of
war camp had been contaminated by their 

41
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:50,010
exposure to western ideas and that was 
his rationale.

42
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,593
So anyways,
that he's spent a decade and a half of 

43
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:54,684
their boats in concentration camps,
but when he got out and developed 

44
00:02:56,581 --> 00:03:01,090
stomach cancer.
So that's a brief summary of some of the

45
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:03,090
highlights of his life.
Okay.

46
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,933
In this scene,
he's being transported from one camp to 

47
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:11,521
another rail car and it's been roughly 
outfitted for transporting human beings.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,600
He's sitting with a friend that he calls
panic.

49
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,483
I'm just going to read you this story.
My friend Pat and I are lying on the 

50
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,210
Middle Shelf of a stall up into cattle 
cars.

51
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:23,044
Basically they're refitted for fema 
transport and have set ourselves up 

52
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:28,480
constantly talk to our assault herring 
in her pocket.

53
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,820
So we don't need water.
I can go to sleep,

54
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,460
but at some station or other,
they shoved into our compartment.

55
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,383
A Marxist scholar.
We can tell this from his guilty and 

56
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,240
spectacles.
He doesn't hide the fact.

57
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,980
So He's been arrested.
He's a devout communist,

58
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,820
been arrested by the Columbias.
He doesn't hide the fact.

59
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:51,100
He's a former professor of the communist
academy.

60
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,290
We have down in the square,
cut out from his very first words.

61
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,124
We see that comedians impenetrable.
We have been serving time for a very 

62
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:06,220
long time and have a long time lift 
serve and we value of Mary joke.

63
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,993
We'd been fun.
There's ample space left in the 

64
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:12,784
compartment,
so we exchanged places with someone in 

65
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,413
crown.
Ian.

66
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,710
Hello?
Hello.

67
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,390
You know,
too crowded.

68
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,010
No,
it's all right.

69
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,060
Have you been in the jug a long time?
Long enough?

70
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,810
Are you past the halfway mark?
Just look over there.

71
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:34,680
How poverty stricken or villages are?
Straw thatch,

72
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,673
crooked hugs.
That's an inheritance Harrington's from 

73
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:44,260
the czarist regime.
What we've already had 30 Soviet years.

74
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,230
That's an insignificant period.
Historically.

75
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,920
It's terrible that the collective 
farmers are starving at older.

76
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,810
Just ask any collective farmer in our 
compartment,

77
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,320
put everyone in jail is the bitter and 
prejudice,

78
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:08,190
but I've seen collective farms myself.
That means they were on characteristic.

79
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,850
The goatee had never been in any way 
simpler.

80
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,390
Just ask the old folks desire.
They were well Fed,

81
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,230
well upload,
and they used to have many holidays.

82
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,053
I'm not even going to ask.
It's a subjective trait of human memory 

83
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:28,564
to praise everything past the cow that 
died is the one that gave twice the 

84
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:34,780
milk.
Sometimes even say,

85
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,580
and our people don't like qualities.
They like to work.

86
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,790
Why is there a shortage of brand in many
cities when right before the war,

87
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,090
for example,
not true before the war,

88
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,350
everything.
In fact,

89
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,190
he worked at.
Listen at that time in all the cities on

90
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:55,024
the pool guy,
there were accused of thousands of 

91
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:59,900
people,
a local failure in supply.

92
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,090
More likely your memory's failing you,
but there is a shortage now.

93
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,223
Old Wives Tales,
we hear it from seven to 8 billion 

94
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:12,300
bushels of grain.
The grain is rotten,

95
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,250
not so.
We've been very successful in developing

96
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,084
new species and so forth.
He's in her term of speaks in the 

97
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:23,234
language which requires no effort of the
mining and arguing with him is like 

98
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:30,620
walking through a desert.
It's about people like that,

99
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:32,870
but they say he made the rounds of all 
the blocks,

100
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:33,704
miss and came home unsure when they 
write in their obituaries perished 

101
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,960
tragically during the period of the 
stout on this cult,

102
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,453
it should be corrected to read.
Parish comically had worked out 

103
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,400
differently.
We would have never learned what a dry,

104
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:53,210
insignificant little man he really was.
We would have respectfully made his name

105
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:54,660
in the newspaper.
We would have.

106
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,693
He would have become a people's 
commissar or even venture to represent 

107
00:06:58,311 --> 00:06:59,360
all of Russia abroad.

108
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,143
To argue with him was useless.
It was much more interested in playing 

109
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,340
with it.
Not a chess,

110
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,433
but at the game really is such a game.
It's very simple game play off to him a 

111
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:13,994
couple of times or so.
Use some of his own pet words and 

112
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:17,684
phrases like that phrase growing 
accustomed to find all around who were 

113
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:22,434
in a.
he's become weary of star like it 

114
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:25,584
doesn't mind to tell his stories because
all of them will be twisted and thrown 

115
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:31,700
right back into space,
but if he takes you for one of his own,

116
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,983
he will quite disclose to you.
What are you seeing that the station 

117
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,490
people are passing by?
Talking,

118
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,110
laughing.
Life goes on.

119
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,680
The party is providing leadership.
People are being moved from job to job.

120
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,533
You and I are languishing in prison.
There are only a handful of us and we 

121
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:50,114
must write and write petitions,
begging a review of our cases being a 

122
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,220
part or he will tell you something 
interesting in the Communist Academy,

123
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,860
they just started to devour one cobra.

124
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,860
We decided he wasn't going to Jannie 
with one of our own.

125
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,303
Somehow they could manage it.
There are no errors and his assets and 

126
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,110
his biography was clean and all of a 
sudden going through the archives,

127
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,973
what I find,
they ran across an old brochure written 

128
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:21,880
by his comrade in which Bladimir Lennon 
himself.

129
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,773
He held in his hands and in the margin 
of which he had written in his own 

130
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,090
handwriting.
The notation as an economist is shit,

131
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,310
well now you understand our.
Anything smiled eventually,

132
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,623
but after that it's no trouble at all to
make short work of that month we foster 

133
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,980
he was expelled from the academy in 
deprived to the scholar,

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,100
a communist professor.
This exchange,

135
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,993
he doesn't think.
It doesn't have to think because he has 

136
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:53,710
an ideological system worked out.

137
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,723
He won't admit any evidence whatsoever 
exists to suggest some of these 

138
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:06,900
presuppositions are wrong for every bit 
of evidence that exists.

139
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,763
There is a counter argument that 
justifies it or excuse it or makes it 

140
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,560
disappear in some way.
That's the first part.

141
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,740
The second part of the story is that 
being like this,

142
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,960
he's also extraordinarily clannish in 
this sense.

143
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,253
Can you tell us a brief story about 
being in the academy where everyone 

144
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:29,874
shares that you Ologie and finding 
outside so that you can essentially 

145
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,313
destroy their specific reasons why the 
two halves of that narrative who stuck 

146
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,413
together because the first attitude 
leads an exorbitant to the second 

147
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:51,630
attitude to say the adoption of 
authoritarian ideology,

148
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,150
which is basically the presumption of 
innocence.

149
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,603
If your Nav along,
you think that what you think is the 

150
00:09:58,111 --> 00:09:58,944
right thing thing,
there isn't anything else that needs to 

151
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:01,440
be thought.

152
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,970
It's you that has the answer.
Now,

153
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:06,360
you might go to you.
You might think that it's your leader or

154
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:07,194
the ideology in and of itself,
but what it is you're the one that's in 

155
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:10,044
possession of the truth and every fact 
that might exist to dispute that is 

156
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,703
eliminated.
The problem with the fact is that 

157
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,570
sometimes they come in and body forms,
which is the same.

158
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,730
We tend to think of ideas as 
disembodied,

159
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,710
abstracted entities of truth of the 
matter is that ideas are representations

160
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:33,540
of human patterns of action and 
sometimes the enemy idea is actually the

161
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,374
enemy and there's very little difference
from the practical perspective between 

162
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,290
repressing thoughts that are 
uncomfortable and repressing.

163
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,950
People whose viewpoints or even styles 
of existence are equal.
