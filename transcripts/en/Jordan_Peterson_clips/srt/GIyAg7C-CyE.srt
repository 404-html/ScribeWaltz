1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,013
Where are you living right now?
I'm close to chilliwack in British 

2
00:00:03,361 --> 00:00:05,730
Columbia.
Are there speed dating,

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,683
speed dating all available there?
I don't know if there's services like 

4
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:11,004
that,
but I know a lot of people are using 

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,493
apps on your phone like tinder.
One of the things I like about speed 

6
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:17,454
dating,
like at least once is because it gives 

7
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:24,480
you a chance to talk to a very large 
number of women very rapidly.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,321
Well,
first of all,

9
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:27,210
that's a good way of it's exposure,
right?

10
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:30,000
It's a good way of overcoming that fear 
of initial contact,

11
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:30,834
but I think it also introduces you in a 
very blunt way to the diversity of 

12
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,790
personality,
right?

13
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:38,970
Because what you'll find if you go on a 
speed dating,

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,250
uh,
what retreat,

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,683
um,
is that there'll be nothing between you 

16
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:47,490
and the girl.
In many cases there'll be something,

17
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:49,740
there are sometimes,
sometimes that's okay.

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,540
You know,
you don't have to be attracted,

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,793
attracted to or attracted to anyone.
Everyone forcing exposure to that wide 

20
00:00:56,701 --> 00:00:57,534
variety of experience in a short period 
of time can be a good way of overcoming 

21
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,823
your fear.
And a lot of that's just an experience 

22
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:04,890
that fear too,
right?

23
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:06,690
So you got to figure out how to overcome
that.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,150
And then I would say with apps like 
tinder,

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,763
it's trickier because the degree to 
which sexual activity is implied in the 

26
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:16,820
initial meeting,
you know,

27
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,320
in the initial agreement to hook up is 
unclear,

28
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:22,080
but it might be worthwhile just to make 
a rule for yourself,

29
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:23,240
which is that,
you know,

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,083
you'll go on 25 tinder dates but you 
won't engage in any physical contact 

31
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,620
because it'll get you,
it'll,

32
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,500
it'll solve that problem for you,
you know what I mean?

33
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:34,830
And then you can concentrate on the 
conversation and you can concentrate on,

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,150
on overcoming this inexperienced that 
you have,

35
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:39,984
that's,
that's,

36
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,480
that's interfering with your progress 
forward.

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,060
But that good a rule like that just 
makes it simple.

38
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,940
No.
And you need rules like that.

39
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,710
And you know,
you probably know this,

40
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:50,544
but maybe you don't mean your experience
with regards to being avoidant and 

41
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,270
afraid of contact with women is by no 
means rare.

42
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,430
It's unbelievably common among young 
men.

43
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:05,490
And I think it is exacerbated by the 
factors that you just described,

44
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:06,324
which is that you were taught,
young men are taught in particular that 

45
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,004
any show of even confidence on their 
part might be interpreted as part of 

46
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:18,150
this toxic masculinity.
And I think that,

47
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,853
well that's a,
that's something that would have to be 

48
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:22,284
unpacked for hours.
I mean what I would say is that women 

49
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:28,290
generally like men who have power but 
don't need to use it.

50
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,990
It's something like that.
And women who are,

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,033
who are uncertain and unsettled in the 
relationships with men would rather for 

52
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:39,000
their own safety that all men be 
rendered powerless.

53
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,480
But that's not helpful because it 
destroys erotic attraction.

54
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:44,940
And then all that happens is that men,
dap useless.

55
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,400
So it's not a solution,
you know,

56
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,150
like to destroy someone's power is no 
solution to taming them.

57
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,090
Right?
You want someone powerful but civilized,

58
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,880
not someone we so weak,
they can't do anything wrong.

59
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,463
And I think the message that young men 
get a lot in our society is you should 

60
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,880
be so weak that you can't do anything 
wrong.

61
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,240
And that's a really bad message.
It doesn't do anyone any good.

62
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,411
Yeah,
I've,

63
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:09,244
I've been seeing that like it seems like
women are being told to be more 

64
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:13,224
masculine and that if it's a negative 
thing for women to be feminine and 

65
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,840
negative for men to be masculine.
And even in,

66
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:21,630
in,
in Brampton where I was living,

67
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,350
I saw these posters around the mall 
saying,

68
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,690
who says women can't be leaders?

69
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,820
What's,
what's wrong with throwing like a girl?

70
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:33,180
And because it was being pushed on me so
much,

71
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:37,620
I felt like I was just accepting it,
but now I've sort of seen through that.

72
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,420
But yeah,
I'm going to use it.

73
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:41,190
I think that's great advice that you 
just gave a minute.

74
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:41,981
Yeah.
As well.

75
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:46,170
We also have to account for the stunning
popularity of 50 shades of gray.

76
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,623
You know,
there's all this surface talk about 

77
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,000
about toxic masculinity and the,
you know,

78
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:52,843
the overbearing rape culture that's 
characteristic of men and that the 

79
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,930
attempt to,
um,

80
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,423
what would you say,
I suppose castrate would be the wrong 

81
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:04,420
word,
but maybe I'll use it anyways.

82
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:05,254
But then there's this underground desire
that's manifest in the attraction of 

83
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,030
that sort of literature.
I mean,

84
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:10,864
that was the fastest selling book in 
human history and so there's really 

85
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:15,064
something to be said about that and the 
fact that those two things can coexist 

86
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:18,724
at the same time,
in the same culture is an indication of 

87
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:21,334
just how,
how much conversation there needs to be 

88
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:25,234
about what the proper role of 
masculinity and femininity as and also 

89
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,720
how to organize sexual behavior so that 
people are not pathologized by it.

90
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:35,723
You know,
it's so interesting to me to watch 

91
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:38,290
what's happening on the campuses 
because,

92
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,130
um,
and,

93
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,100
and that's emblematic of what happens in
the broader world.

94
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:42,934
I mean,
at the same time we have discussions 

95
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:48,670
about how absolutely every form of 
sexual desire and behavior whatsoever is

96
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:53,200
entirely permissible.
We have the increasing multiplication of

97
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:57,340
regulations about every single aspect of
any sexual interaction between a man and

98
00:04:57,341 --> 00:05:00,400
a woman.
I mean those two things.

99
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,253
The fact that those two things are 
happening at the same time means that 

100
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:06,060
something is wrong.
I mean,

101
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,903
maybe we should back off on the idea 
that absolutely every form of sexual 

102
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:11,014
interaction whatsoever is permissible 
and desirable and simultaneously back 

103
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,814
off on the increasing enclosure of every
of every physical interaction in a web 

104
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,054
of of laws and regulations,
most of which are going to be 

105
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,650
counterproductive and caused all sorts 
of trouble.
