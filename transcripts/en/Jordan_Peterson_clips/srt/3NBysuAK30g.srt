1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,580
Imagine that you're looking for a stable
partner,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,440
right,
so you might think,

3
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:06,810
well,
what do you want in a stable partner,

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:07,883
and at least in principle,
one of the things you don't want is too 

5
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:16,020
much mismatch between you and that 
person on the five fundamental dementia.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:16,883
So for example,
if you're really extroverted and you 

7
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:20,184
have a really introverted partner,
you're going to engage in continual 

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,623
conflict about how much social activity 
the two of you should what subject 

9
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:29,760
yourself to.
And it's very,

10
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:34,761
very difficult for people who broadly 
differ widely differ on those dimensions

11
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:38,340
to come to consensus because it's not 
just a matter of opinion,

12
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:40,050
right?
It's really a matter of different.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,280
If you're looking at extremes of really 
different types of people,

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,323
and the thing about introverts is they 
just don't enjoy large scale social 

15
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:50,550
interaction.
That much one on one,

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,393
they're often fine,
but in a group they don't like that and 

17
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:53,280
they.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,680
It tires them out.
Whereas a real extrovert,

19
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:56,514
it's like you isolate them and they just
wither on the vine because a huge part 

20
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,043
of what actually motivates them in a 
positive way is tangled up with social 

21
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:08,160
interaction.
And so if you're an agreeable person and

22
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:10,290
you have a particularly disagreeable 
partner,

23
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,124
you're also going to run into problems 
because the agreeable person will say 

24
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:14,664
whatever you want,
whenever and the agreeable or 

25
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,750
disagreeable person will say,
well,

26
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:19,584
I'd like to know what the hell you want 
for a change and be much more harsh and 

27
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:23,634
much more demanding in the situation and
the agreeable person is going to find 

28
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:29,370
the disagreeable person harsh and 
unpleasant,

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,990
and the disagreeable person who's going 
to find the agreeable person wishy washy

30
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:36,330
and unable to stand up for themselves.
And again,

31
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:37,164
that's a,
that's actually one of the primary 

32
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:39,114
sources of tension between men and women
because women tend to be higher in 

33
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,140
agreeableness than men.

34
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,510
It's about half a standard deviation,
which is quite,

35
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,200
quite,
uh,

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,033
quite a,
quite a large difference by 

37
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,990
psychological standards.
What that means fundamentally,

38
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:56,350
just so you have some sense of how large
a fact that is,

39
00:01:56,351 --> 00:02:00,240
is that if you have a group of men and 
women and you pick out random pairs,

40
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,110
the woman is going to be more agreeable 
than the man 60 percent of the time.

41
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,510
So that's not an overwhelming 
proportion,

42
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,523
but it's reliable and it's quite.
It's quite large by psychological 

43
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:10,794
standards.
So there's the problem with 

44
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,450
agreeableness with conscientiousness.
Well,

45
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,643
if you're conscientious,
you're industrious and orderly and 

46
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,323
orderly.
People seem to be sensitive to 

47
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,184
discussed,
which is something we'll talk about in 

48
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,870
detail later.
We've had a hard time specifying exactly

49
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,140
what makes industrious people 
industrious because it's hard to come up

50
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:34,380
with an animal model for that sort of 
thing and there's no theoretical model,

51
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,880
but our latest idea is that it's not my 
idea.

52
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,620
It's actually the idea of my graduate 
student,

53
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:41,454
Christine Brophy,
is that industrious people find it 

54
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,510
unpleasant and unsettling to to not be 
doing something so it isn't so much that

55
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,170
industriousness makes them happy or 
fills them with positive emotion.

56
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,033
That would be more extroversion because 
extroversion is the positive emotion 

57
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:00,010
dimension.
It's an industrious.

58
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:03,310
People can't stand sitting around doing 
nothing.

59
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,580
And you know,
this is speculation,

60
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:07,414
but you know,
human beings are obviously always 

61
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:10,174
engaged in the exchange of labor,
especially the reciprocal exchange of 

62
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:13,984
labor.
And you can imagine that in a community 

63
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:20,470
where everyone knows everyone,
the people who work hard are going to be

64
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:24,040
pretty irritated on a fairly chronic 
basis with the people who are completely

65
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:24,874
unproductive.
And my suspicions are that plenty of 

66
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:30,520
people who were completely unproductive 
in the history of,

67
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,413
of our,
of the evolution of our species were 

68
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:36,880
wiped out by people who were unhappy 
with their lack of productivity.

69
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,713
And so I think generally speaking,
human beings have this sense of ethical 

70
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:42,574
obligation with regards to one another 
to share labor and people who are 

71
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:47,344
conscientious really,
really feel that so they feel bad if 

72
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:54,460
they're not busily working on something 
that's productive all the time.

73
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,700
And so the advantage to being with 
someone conscientious is,

74
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:58,900
well,
they're going to work like mad,

75
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:01,900
but the disadvantages there,
they're going to work like mad.

76
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,300
So you know,
if you're looking for a partner that you

77
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:05,134
want to relax with or have fun with or 
who isn't uptight than a conscientious 

78
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:10,360
person is probably not a very good 
choice.

79
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,523
On the other hand,
if you're a conscientious person and 

80
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:15,880
you're living with someone who's really 
unconscientious,

81
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,430
that's good because they might be able 
to help you relax,

82
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:19,264
but you're not going to be happy with it
because they don't work nearly as hard 

83
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:23,620
as you do,
but even worse on the orderly dimension,

84
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,933
you know some of you have had roommates 
and maybe you're more orderly than your 

85
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,660
roommate.

86
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,493
What does it mean means you're annoyed 
by mess before they are and you don't 

87
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:36,034
have to be annoyed by mess much before 
you're less orderly roommate for you to 

88
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,800
be the one that's always running around 
picking things up.

89
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,173
And so actually one of the things that's
emerged from the psychometric analysis 

90
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:46,924
is that women are slightly more orderly 
than men and I suspect that has 

91
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:52,780
something to do with the UN.
What would you call it?

92
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:57,620
Inequitable distribution of housework.
Because even if you're imagine that your

93
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,473
proclivity is to be triggered by 
disorder 25 seconds before your 

94
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:03,190
partners.
Well,

95
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,413
you're going to end up.
It doesn't take much difference for you 

96
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:08,620
to be the one that's always concerned 
about the mess first.

97
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,770
So anyways,
and so if you're a really orderly person

98
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:15,340
and you live with a disorderly person,
well good luck getting along with them.

99
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,340
They're going to regard you as like 
uptight and,

100
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,480
and,
uh,

101
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,180
uh,
over concerned with details and,

102
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,373
and,
uh,

103
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,600
and well,
and unwilling to relax,

104
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:26,440
that's for sure.

105
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,200
And there are going to regard you as 
well.

106
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,830
Just a bloody mess and how can anyone 
possibly live with someone like you.

107
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,053
And so,
so another reason why it's useful to 

108
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:37,204
understand your personality is because I
think it gives you a better crack at 

109
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:44,290
finding someone that you can actually 
live with over the long run.

110
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,124
And we don't know what the optimal.
I don't think you want to live with 

111
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:51,520
someone who is exactly like you because 
then both of you have the same strengths

112
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:53,710
and weaknesses and there's a bit of a 
problem there,

113
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:54,544
right?
Because maybe an agreeable person can 

114
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:57,454
use a of a disagreeable person around 
them to balance each other out and vice 

115
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:01,184
versa.
Right?

116
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,610
So we don't understand the optimal 
balance for,

117
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,030
for,
for longterm thriving in a relationship.

118
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:08,864
But I think we do understand the fact 
that if you're too different in your 

119
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:13,520
traits,
that those,

120
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:18,260
that where you're different is going to 
constitute a chronic source of conflict.
