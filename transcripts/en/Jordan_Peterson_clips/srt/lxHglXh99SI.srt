1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,120
It seems indisputable.
I would say that the Canadian healthcare

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,503
system is preferable to the American 
healthcare system except at the very 

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,490
highest end and there's a couple of 
reasons for that that would even perhaps

4
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:15,324
appeal to conservatives.
One is the amount of administrative 

5
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:19,674
overhead that spent by Canadian health 
institutions as far less in Canada than 

6
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:23,964
it is in the US,
partly because hospitals don't have to 

7
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:26,934
collect money so they don't spend 30 
percent of their intake on on the 

8
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:32,334
financial end of the equation,
which is approximately the case in the 

9
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:35,484
u.
s and everyone has access to healthcare 

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,233
in Canada and because of that,
our rate of individual entrepreneurship 

11
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:42,864
is higher in Canada than it is in the US
and that's because because people don't 

12
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:49,090
have to worry about losing their 
healthcare.

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,943
If they switched jobs,
they can switch jobs more easily and 

14
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:52,854
they can also take risks if they have a 
family that can take entrepreneurial 

15
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:59,250
risks without putting all the health of 
their entire family at stake.

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,383
So these things can't be broken down 
really simply into right wing versus 

17
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:05,960
left wing issues.
Right there.

18
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,180
Too complicated.
But the overall point is that Canada has

19
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:10,014
done a very good job of having that 
conversation even are socialists are 

20
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:18,960
basically fiscally conservative,
right?

21
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:20,490
Although they're not socially 
conservative,

22
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,070
but there,
there,

23
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,720
there are signs of the kind of 
polarization in Canada that,

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,220
that that's really plaguing the United 
States.

25
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:31,840
And of course that would be,
that's not good for the US.

26
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,900
It's not good for Europe where it's also
happening,

27
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:36,960
but it's also not good for our country 
and I don't want that to happen.

28
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:42,410
So that's partly why I've been objecting
to the more ill advised in radical moves

29
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:46,890
that the so called liberals have been 
managing over the last few years.
