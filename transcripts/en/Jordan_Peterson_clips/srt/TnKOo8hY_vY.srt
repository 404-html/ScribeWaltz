1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
It's very necessary for people at some 
point in their life to dedicate 

2
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:05,670
themselves to a single game of some 
sort,

3
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:07,320
which is kind of what you're doing in 
university,

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,343
you know you have to become one thing at
some point in your life and the 

5
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:12,744
sacrifice of course is that you give up 
all the other things that you could 

6
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:16,500
become,
but the.

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,453
You don't really have a choice because 
if you don't decide voluntarily to 

8
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,180
become one thing,
you know,

9
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:22,014
to become a,
a disciplined adherent of some specific 

10
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:30,141
practice or profession or viewpoint,
then you risk just aging chaotically and

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,393
you don't get away with not aging,
so you might as well age into something 

12
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:36,324
that's.
That's actually something rather than 

13
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:40,710
just remaining or then just becoming an 
old child,

14
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:43,860
which is really not a not a good thing.
It's not a good thing to see.

15
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:46,290
Especially by the time people hit about 
40.

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,120
It's not.
It's not.

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,433
It's not pretty for them or anyone else.
And even at 30 it's getting pretty old 

18
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:54,180
at that point.
40.

19
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:57,780
It's like it's almost a repairable at 40
and the reason for that is you run,

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,600
you start running out of opportunities 
when you're young and stupid.

21
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:02,670
People don't care because they think,
well,

22
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,020
you know,
whatever.

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:04,973
You've got decades of of,
of possibility still ready to unfold in 

24
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:10,764
you,
but if you're in the same unspecified 

25
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:16,350
position at 40,
people are much less forgiving.

26
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,193
Especially because if they're going to 
hire someone who doesn't know what's 

27
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:20,724
going on or or employ them or or sorry 
or engage them in some sort of 

28
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:24,444
productive activity,
they might as well take a chance on 

29
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:26,844
someone young and full of potential 
rather than someone who's really lived 

30
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:32,550
more than half of their life already.
Because of course you have,

31
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,540
by the time you're 40.
