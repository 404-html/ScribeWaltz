1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,303
So the temporary victory,
it's also something really good to know 

2
00:00:04,251 --> 00:00:05,084
about marriage.
It's like you can never win an argument 

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:07,874
with your wife,
like you could if you only lived with 

4
00:00:09,681 --> 00:00:11,150
her for one day.
Right?

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,690
It's like I wanna see you later.
It's like,

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,121
no,
no,

7
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:16,430
she's there the next day.
And then she's been,

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,710
she does.
She does remember that.

9
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:20,690
Yeah,
maybe even more than you remember it,

10
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,823
you know.
And it also might be that she was right 

11
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:25,760
and you just out argued her.
So.

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,210
And that's something that's really worth
knowing too because sometimes you know,

13
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:30,044
you'll have an argument with,
well let's say with your wife and she's 

14
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,300
got something to say and it's not very 
well articulated.

15
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,080
Same could be true for you.
And so you can just brush it aside,

16
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,363
but you don't want to brush it aside 
because maybe there's something there 

17
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,830
and if you don't address it then it's 
not like it's gonna go away,

18
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:46,100
man.

19
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,933
It's going to grow.
So maybe you have to help her formulate 

20
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:50,324
her argument,
which is really annoying because you 

21
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,700
want to win and you have in this 
dispute,

22
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,160
I want to win.
So like,

23
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,280
well,
you're not winning that game.

24
00:00:58,281 --> 00:01:00,050
You're winning the game.
Well,

25
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:00,884
I think about it as the game of games.
You want to win the set of games that 

26
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:06,470
stretch across time,
the long war.

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,281
Yeah,
that's right.

28
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:09,320
Exactly where that little battles 
knocking,

29
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:13,130
no matter and in fact you should not try
and be right.

30
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,290
If you're right,
everybody knows it's fine,

31
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,960
but there's the worst thing to do is rub
it in and say,

32
00:01:17,961 --> 00:01:20,030
I'm right and you're wrong.
Yeah.

33
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,090
You do that 100 times and then like,
well you're the,

34
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,600
you're the winner and she's the loser.
And then that's great because now you're

35
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:28,580
married to a loser.
I mean,

36
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:29,930
you know,
that's.

37
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,120
If you do that 100,000
times,

38
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:35,270
then your marriage is over and then and 
then there'll be hell to pay.

39
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,710
You can be sure of that.
