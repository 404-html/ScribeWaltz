Can I ask your thoughts on Brexit?
Yes,

2
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:02,874
you can have my thoughts on brexit and 
the other day I was doing a lecture on 

3
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:09,450
the on the stories in genesis and one of
the stories that I analyze briefly,

4
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:10,284
and this will be posted very soon is the
story of the Tower of Babel and I've 

5
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:15,384
been very curious about that story.
It comes after Noah's flood myth in 

6
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:19,044
genesis.
What happens is that human beings get 

7
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:22,314
together and they decide to build a 
massive building and the human beings 

8
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:28,254
that are building that building all 
speak in one voice and they have this 

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,010
grand vision which you might regard as a
utopian vision,

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,053
which is what I think it is,
that they can build a building so high 

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,163
that within it everyone will speak the 
same language and it will reach all the 

12
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:46,500
way to have it,
and so you could see it in some sense as

13
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:48,900
an attempt to usurp the transcendent.

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,063
I kind of read it as an an early 
precursor of the story that Milton told 

15
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:54,990
and paradise lost.
Where Satan,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,980
who's God's highest heavenly angel and 
perhaps and who's Lucifer?

17
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,490
The brightest light in the psychic 
hierarchy you might say,

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,260
and the spirit of untrammeled 
rationality decides that he can wage war

19
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:08,094
in heaven and overcome God,
overcome the ultimate in the 

20
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:11,904
transcendent value,
and I read that as a cautionary tale 

21
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:15,054
about the pride that goes along with 
intellectual presupposition in the same 

22
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:22,410
pride that produced the totalitarian 
states of the 20th century.

23
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,150
What happens with the Tower of Babel is 
that human beings start to build this,

24
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,103
a unitary homogenous structure who's 
pinnacle will reach into God's heavenly 

25
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:34,314
domain,
perhaps thereby taking the place of the 

26
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,124
transcendent.
God gets wind of that and goes to earth 

27
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,510
and takes the people or or transforms 
the people who are,

28
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,503
who are building them.
