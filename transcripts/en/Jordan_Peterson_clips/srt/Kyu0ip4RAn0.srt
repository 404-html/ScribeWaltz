1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,760
At some point we weren't linguistic 
creatures at all,

2
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:03,594
right?
We separated from the common ancestors 

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,510
between us and chimpanzees about 6 
million years ago.

4
00:00:08,511 --> 00:00:13,020
And sometime during that 6 million year 
process we started to be able to imitate

5
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:13,854
ourselves first and then represent 
ourselves in image and action and then 

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,210
only after that to start to articulate 
ourselves.

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,250
So a lot of the knowledge that we have 
is grounded in our embodiment,

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,143
but also in the shaping of that 
embodiment across extraordinary long 

9
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:35,070
periods of time.
So like there's an implicit way of being

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,500
in your form,
in your embodied form,

11
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:38,334
but more importantly,
there's an implicit way of being that's 

12
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:41,634
a consequence of the fact that we've 
existed within hierarchical social 

13
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:47,304
structures for far longer than we were 
even sharing a common ancestor say with 

14
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:55,920
great apes.
So that's for maybe hundreds of millions

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,200
of years with regards to being embedded 
in a hierarchy.

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,210
So then the question is something like,
well,

17
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,190
for embedded in the hierarchy,
and we have been forever,

18
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,040
that's about 350 million years.
By the way,

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,660
is there a set of attributes that tends 
reliably to move you up the hierarchy?

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,390
Because if there is,
you see being going up,

21
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:19,350
the hierarchy increases the probability 
of reproductive success.

22
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,933
So there's actually nothing more 
important to determine over the course 

23
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:28,131
of 350 million years inside a hierarchy.
Then how it is that you ratchet yourself

24
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:29,844
up the hierarchy reliably,
and you could think about that in some 

25
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:33,294
sense as the source of ideals here.
Here's a kind of a concrete way of 

26
00:01:37,771 --> 00:01:39,300
thinking about that.
You know,

27
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:42,540
if you get a hundred men together,
they're going to,

28
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,560
they're going to organize themselves 
into a hierarchical structure.

29
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,663
They have to,
or they're going to stay chaotic and 

30
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:50,580
fight that.
That's the other alternative.

31
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,560
And so,
but the way that,

32
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,310
that,
that the people who are going to rise to

33
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:57,144
the top,
they might rise to the top because of 

34
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,140
their sheer physical prowess and power.

35
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,303
But they also might rise to the top 
because they're very competent at 

36
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,424
certain things.
And it's as if all the men are going to 

37
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:08,184
get together and vote.
And maybe that would actually happen to 

38
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:11,724
determine who best embodies the spirit 
of the group and who should be granted 

39
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:17,370
leadership.
And in an evolutionary context,

40
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,204
by the way,
that would also help ensure that that 

41
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:23,520
person would propagate their genes into 
the next generation.

42
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:26,490
And it's not a trivial effect,
especially among men.

43
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:28,710
It's a big effect because roughly 
speaking,

44
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:32,490
half half of all men or are not 
reproductively successful.

45
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:34,680
So there's a wicked,
there's a wicked,

46
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,730
uh,
calling,

47
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,810
let's say among men.
While you can see this among chimpanzees

48
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:42,030
as well,
they have dominance hierarchies.

49
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,240
Some sort of chimps rise to the top.
And you might think,

50
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:45,811
well,
that's the,

51
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:48,480
like caveman chimp who's best at 
pounding out all the,

52
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,620
all the rivals.

53
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,453
But it turns out that that's not exactly
the case in France to wall has done a 

54
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:54,294
very good job of detailing this with his
work on chimpanzees in particular and 

55
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:02,541
he's found that the power hungry tyrant 
sort of chimp can rule for a while,

56
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:03,604
but he tends to have a very unstable 
kingdom and the reason for that is is 

57
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,910
it's not very good at mutually grooming 
is not good.

58
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:10,744
It's socially connecting with other 
males and he isn't popular among the 

59
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:17,680
females and doesn't attend to the,
to the young essentially.

60
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,260
And so what happens is even if he's like
the meanest,

61
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:24,490
toughest guy on the block to subordinate
chimps team up,

62
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,980
they make friends,
they groom each other and they have each

63
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:27,814
other's backs and in a one day he's 
having an off day because he ate too 

64
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:34,450
many fermented bananas the night before 
and like they just tear them into pieces

65
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,260
and chimps are unbelievably strong and 
unbelievably brutal.

66
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,393
They seem to have absolutely no internal
regulation whatsoever of their 

67
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:44,154
aggression.
That all seems to be manifested outside 

68
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:48,010
in terms of dominance,
hierarchy,

69
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:48,844
control.
And we know that because they go on 

70
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:50,944
raiding parties into other chimp 
territories and when they find chimps 

71
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:57,190
that aren't part of their hierarchy,
they just ripped them into pieces.

72
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,960
And so that's a scary thing if you think
about our similarity with chimpanzees,

73
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:04,960
cause we like to think we have internal 
controls over our aggression,

74
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,660
but it's not so bloody obvious,
I can tell you that.

75
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,943
Anyways,
what the wall found was that it's 

76
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:13,360
actually chimps that are more,
um,

77
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,420
you might say humane,
although Champaign,

78
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,280
I dunno what the equivalent is,
let's say humane that managed to produce

79
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,660
hierarchies that are more stable and 
actually managed to stay alive on top of

80
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:26,494
them for much longer periods of time.
And he thinks about that as the 

81
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:31,660
emergence of an implicit morality,
right?

82
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,300
So morality that's acted out.
So then you think,

83
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:34,960
well,
there,

84
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,510
there are different ways of climbing up 
a hierarchy.

85
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,350
There are worse and better ways.
The better ways allow you to live longer

86
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:42,184
in a more stable hierarchy.
And the evolutionary payoff for that is 

87
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:47,410
that you leave more,
more descendants.

88
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,543
And so the hierarchy itself becomes a 
very powerful shaping mechanism that 

89
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:53,224
determines how it is that people are 
going to adapt because it's the primary 

90
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:59,320
method of selection.
So there's an ethic in there.

91
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,110
There's an ethic that emerges from the 
social interactions,

92
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:05,860
but that's rapidly transformed into a 
biological selection device.

93
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,143
And so were selected.
And that's especially true among human 

94
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:14,641
beings because with chimps,
the females are indiscriminant maters,

95
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,580
which is to say that a female champion 
heat,

96
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:19,414
we'll meet with any mail chimp.
Now the dominant males chase the 

97
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:24,394
subordinate males away.
So there's still more likely to leave 

98
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:27,700
offspring than the subordinates.

99
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,030
But it's not because of the females,
but human females are different.

100
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,010
Human females exert choice and quite 
brutal choice.

101
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:38,260
You might put it that way.
They're very choosy.

102
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:42,010
And it's one of the things that seems to
have distinguished us from chimpanzees.

103
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:42,844
And what roughly seems to happen is that
the male dominance hierarchy elects men 

104
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,930
to the higher say rungs of the 
hierarchy.

105
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:50,764
And then the females peel from the top.
And so that means that what you can say 

106
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:58,760
is that human beings are the consequence
of intense male dominance competition.

107
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,360
It's not necessarily dominance,
but it's competition for the upper rungs

108
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,150
of the hierarchy mediated by female 
selection.
