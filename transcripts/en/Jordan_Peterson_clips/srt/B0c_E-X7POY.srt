1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,480
To tap into the dopaminergic system,
you said you needed to value goal.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,700
Is there any way to tap into the opioid 
system?

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,840
I want to be more connected to people,
but part of me can't get myself to care.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,690
Okay.
Well one of the things that that,

5
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:14,970
so maybe you're a little bit on the 
disagreeable side,

6
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:15,804
that's a possibility.
There's some interesting clinical 

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,403
evidence that suggests that one of the 
things that disagreeable people can do 

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,693
in order to facilitate their 
interactions with other people is to do 

9
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:27,594
people favorites.
And so what you might say is that you 

10
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:31,194
could start by acting like you care and 
then maybe you could learn how to care 

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,500
through doing that.
So maybe you could say,

12
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:38,334
well,
I'm going to do something nice for 

13
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:42,650
someone once every two days for a month 
and,

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,790
and think about it a little bit and see 
what,

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,690
see if that changes you.
Because you know,

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,533
sometimes you think yourself into change
and sometimes you act yourself into 

17
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:52,614
changing your thoughts.
And so that's what I would start by 

18
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:56,994
doing.
Um,

19
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,373
and you know,
you could also be more connected to 

20
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:04,470
people regardless of whether you care,
you know,

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,333
let's say that it would take you six 
months of practice or even a year of 

22
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,563
practice.
