1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,133
Question,
how is capitalism compatible with your 

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:03,654
definition of good if it requires ever 
increasing use of the finite resources 

3
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:10,380
of the planet,
where once depleted would mean our end?

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,513
Well,
I would say capitalism isn't compatible 

5
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:14,394
with my definition of good if it 
requires every increasing uses of the 

6
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:21,630
finite resources of the planet,
but that's by no means self evident even

7
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:23,910
though the Scuttlebutt,
let's say,

8
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:24,744
especially among the environmentalist 
oriented types who might have some 

9
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:29,700
sympathy for,
by the way,

10
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:31,740
especially with regards to ocean 
depletion.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,083
Um,
there's a huge argument and there has 

12
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,034
been for many,
many years between the economists and 

13
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,090
the biologists and this is a really 
important thing to know.

14
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:43,770
And The economist point out that human 
ingenuity is such that we're continually

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,270
able to make more with less.
And certainly over the last well,

16
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:52,560
500 years that the,
especially in the last 150 years,

17
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:54,120
that's just absolutely evident.

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,953
You know,
like people say we're going to run out 

19
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:57,084
of energy.
And I think that's absolutely 

20
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:59,230
preposterous.
It's like it's,

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,680
it's crazy as thinking we're going to 
run out of mattered.

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,903
I mean,
we're going through a bit of a 

23
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:04,914
bottleneck right now because you know 
the population is going to increase to 

24
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:09,810
about 9 billion and then it's going to 
decrease.

25
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,510
That's,
that's the most reliable projections and

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,320
9 billion isn't the law more than we 
have now and you know,

27
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,400
there's going to be some environmental 
disruption as a consequence of that,

28
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:21,234
but I don't think there's any reason to 
assume that all that capitalism 

29
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:28,470
necessarily requires ever increasing use
of the finite resources of the planet.

30
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,663
It's also not obvious to what degree the
resources of the planet are actually 

31
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,110
finite because we,
we can continually think up new uses for

32
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:39,930
things that nobody thought had any use 
at all.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,833
So it depends to some degree on whether 
or not you're willing to bet on human 

34
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:49,251
imaginativeness or you're going to be a 
male Uzi and pessimist.

35
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:51,960
And I'm not saying that there are 
reasons for both.

36
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:52,794
I'm just saying that it is by no means 
self evident that things are getting 

37
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:56,970
worse.
You know,

38
00:01:56,971 --> 00:01:59,520
like I can give you an example.
So,

39
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,290
you know,
in the last,

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,513
in the last 15 years,
the millennium goal for the UN was to 

41
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:08,340
have world poverty,
like absolute poverty,

42
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:09,174
so that's less than a dollar 50 a day by
50 percent within 15 years that was 

43
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:13,794
actually reached ahead of schedule and 
we've lifted hundreds of millions of 

44
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,650
people into the middleclass over the 
last 30 years.

45
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:20,484
And so there is an increasing inequality
in the west because the working classes 

46
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,650
taken the brunt of that say that 
redistribution to third world countries.

47
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:30,030
But by the same token,
you know,

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,193
there's no starvation in the world 
anymore except really for reasons of 

49
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,970
misdistribution and,
and,

50
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,980
and,
and political purpose.

51
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,550
And people are becoming richer and more 
educated all the time.

52
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,413
And you know,
when we are waking up to our planetary 

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,473
responsibilities,
once people stopped starving to death 

54
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,730
and having to burn like dirt and,
and eat,

55
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,853
you know,
substandard food that they've scraped 

56
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:56,190
out into the Brown.
They do start to turn their attention to

57
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:58,620
things that might be more aesthetic.
And so look,

58
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,790
I don't think any reason to be 
pessimistic,

59
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,953
not fundamental.
And I guess the reason that capitalism 

60
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:07,200
is compatible with my definition of 
good,

61
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,223
I wouldn't say that exactly.
I would say that I don't see an 

62
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:11,854
alternative that has manifested itself 
that doesn't have far more negative 

63
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:17,110
consequences.
You know,

64
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:19,600
it's sort of a minimal pessimism issue.
It's like,

65
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,553
well this is the best devil that we have
and I do believe it is because the 

66
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,300
successful societies,
by any stretch of the imagination,

67
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:32,740
by virtually any metric are the 
capitalist societies.

68
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,360
It's certainly the case,
for example,

69
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:38,410
that the Soviet Union demolished far 
more of its natural resources.

70
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:43,411
Too Far less a productive consequence 
than the west did hearsay evidence.

71
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,203
There's suggestions that between 10 and 
15 percent of the total area of the 

72
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,400
Soviet Union has been rendered more or 
less permanently uninhabitable.

73
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,370
So the question is,
compared to what.
