1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,953
What is your advice for finding a sane 
sound therapist and do you think a 

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,873
fruitful psychotherapeutic relationship 
requires a therapist to have specific 

3
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:09,714
temperamental compatibility or even 
literacy and interests that align with 

4
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:15,360
the patient?
Well,

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,283
I would say with regards to finding a 
sane and sound therapists there some 

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,450
practical things you can do.
Um,

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:22,763
I guess this is more relevant if you 
live in North America and I'm not sure 

8
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:28,080
exactly what the training requirements 
are in other places in the world,

9
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:33,081
but your best bet I would say is to find
someone who is appropriately trained and

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,463
I would regard someone who's 
appropriately trained as a 

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,343
psychotherapist to be someone who's.
I think you're safer if you go with 

12
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,624
someone who's trained at one of the big 
research schools and you have a 

13
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:45,624
therapist who's well versed in 
psychotherapeutic practice but who's 

14
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:50,394
also sufficiently educated 
scientifically to be able to understand 

15
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:56,850
the scientific literature and you can be
pretty certain of that.

16
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:02,330
If you find a therapist who's got their 
phd rather than us id.

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,810
Not that there's anything necessarily 
wrong with ids.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,410
If they had received their phd from an 
American Psychological Association,

19
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:11,244
Approved School of Clinical Psychology,
and those schools operate under what's 

20
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:18,660
called the bolder model,
and the boulder model is promotes,

21
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,700
um,
science,

22
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:21,534
science practitioner as,
as the optimal ideal combination for a 

23
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,230
psychotherapist.
So someone who's trained,

24
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:31,140
psychotherapeutic,
but also has research experience and can

25
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:35,430
understand the relevant scientific 
literature as it pertains to,

26
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,120
to mental health.
So that would be the first thing.

27
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,150
The second thing I would say is,
um,

28
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,190
well go to see a psychotherapist once 
and maybe go to see a couple of them and

29
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,460
find someone that listens to you because
the psychotherapist shouldn't be someone

30
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:57,300
who solves your problems for you or 
offers even really offers you advice.

31
00:01:57,301 --> 00:01:59,070
Although sometimes that can be helpful.

32
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,413
Really what the psychotherapists should 
do is be someone who can help you 

33
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,164
understand what problem it is that 
you're facing so that that can be 

34
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:11,490
delineated properly to help you 
articulate what it is that you want.

35
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:13,700
So what your vision of mental health 
might be in,

36
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,080
and what you'd like to attain in 
psychotherapy.

37
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,380
And then who helps you strategize 
towards that end.

38
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,650
And so you want someone who will really 
listen to you,

39
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,440
that you feel comfortable telling the 
truth too,

40
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,410
because that's also incredibly 
important.

41
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,570
If you can't tell you a psychotherapist 
the truth,

42
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,433
then you're not going to get anywhere 
therapy because you won't be able to 

43
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,750
actually outline the nature of your 
fundamental problems.

44
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,153
So that's vital.
And go see someone and see if you're 

45
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:44,720
happy with the way that you're 
interacting with them.

46
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,790
That's the most relevant issue.
So that's the first question.

47
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,733
Now the next one was,
do I think a fruitful psychotherapeutic 

48
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,690
relationship requires the therapists to 
have specific,

49
00:02:57,691 --> 00:02:58,524
temperamental compatibility or even 
literacy and interests that align with 

50
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,314
the patient.
I think it's difficult to work with the 

51
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:06,940
therapist who is less intelligent than 
you are.

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,810
That's kind of a rough way of 
conceptualizing it,

53
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:11,644
but a lot of what a therapist does is 
help you strategize and the person has 

54
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:18,340
to be able to think analytically and 
probably at least to some degree,

55
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:22,180
to the same with the same degree of 
complexity that you're capable of.

56
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,860
It's not necessarily a good idea to be 
able to think your,

57
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,133
your therapist.
So was there ever a time when you saw a 

58
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:31,810
therapist of some kind.
