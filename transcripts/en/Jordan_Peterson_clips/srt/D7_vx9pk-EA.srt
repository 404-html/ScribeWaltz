1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,010
To what extent do you believe that 
discourse with moderate Muslims can lead

2
00:00:03,011 --> 00:00:03,844
to reform of the ideology such that the 
gap between Islamic and Western beliefs 

3
00:00:07,781 --> 00:00:09,400
can be bridged?
Well,

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,383
I guess we're going to find out about 
that because that's one of the things I 

5
00:00:12,131 --> 00:00:13,750
want to do over the next couple of 
years.

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,670
Um,
as far as I can tell,

7
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:18,670
there's only three states of being there
is tyranny,

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,990
there's slavery and there's negotiation 
and you know,

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,720
tyranny,
tyranny and slavery are forms of war.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,793
So we either enter into discourse and 
hopefully with the moderate Muslims or 

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,760
we're the tyrants or they're the tyrants
and we're the slaves,

12
00:00:33,761 --> 00:00:35,950
or they're the slaves.
And then there's war.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,993
And so we bloody well better have 
discourse because war is what happens 

14
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:42,940
when discourse fails.
And you know,

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,070
we actually,
in some ways,

16
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,580
we can't really go to war anymore 
because we're so armed.

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,560
And increasingly that's also the case in
the Muslim world.

18
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:54,610
I mean,
look at Pakistan,

19
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:55,444
it's,
it's developing a pretty decent nuclear 

20
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:58,230
arm.
Our movement of nuclear,

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,310
a deterrent,
let's say,

22
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:01,144
which is quite terrifying because 
Pakistan is one unstable and dangerous 

23
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:05,980
place.
But I mean,

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,873
what are you going to do?
You're going to go to war with people 

25
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:09,400
who have hydrogen bombs.
It's like,

26
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:12,520
that's not gonna work out very well.
So we bloody well better learn to talk.

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,670
And so I'm hoping,
you know,

28
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,830
I'm doing this biblical series,
which some of you may be no,

29
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,900
but in parallel without,
I'm doing,

30
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,380
I want to do a very long series of 
discussions with moderate Muslims,

31
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,350
theological,
philosophical,

32
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:27,184
political,
practical to see if the gap between 

33
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:32,410
Islamic and western beliefs can be 
bridged.

34
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,740
I better be able to be bridged because 
we're on the same planet man.

35
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,480
And there's lots of both of us.

36
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,313
So,
um,

37
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,630
capitulation on either side,
it isn't going to work.

38
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,340
And,
and like blind ignorance of the,

39
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,293
of the dangers,
mutual dangers that our society's post 

40
00:01:48,311 --> 00:01:49,144
to one another.
I mean,

41
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,193
to the degree that Islam,
Islamic societies are functional 

42
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:53,884
traditional societies,
they're threatened in that functional 

43
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:58,084
traditionalism by radical western 
technological and philosophical 

44
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:05,380
revolution,
just like worth threatened as Westerners

45
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:08,890
ourselves by our own technological and 
philosophical,

46
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:13,891
revolutionary nature discourse,
truthful discourse,

47
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,060
man.
That's,

48
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,200
that's the hope for the salvation of the
world.

49
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,570
And so hopefully we'll put it into 
practice.

50
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:20,404
I've,
I've met a number of moderate Muslims 

51
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:22,894
already in Canada who are extremely 
interested in this sort of thing and 

52
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:27,340
some in the u s as well.
And so I think that,

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,170
well,
you know,

54
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,970
it's worth a try,
man.

55
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,383
So.
