1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,730
The system is rigged against you.
Okay,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,230
you're going to die.
You're going to be ill like it's rough,

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,093
man.
Now you don't want to lay that at the 

4
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:13,020
feet of the social structure because the
social structure,

5
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:15,570
at least in part,
is trying to have you not die,

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:16,771
right?
I mean,

7
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:17,604
that's why we have walls and electricity
and all of that and works pretty damn 

8
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,024
well.
You know you're probably going to live 

9
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:22,464
till you're 80 and the only reason 
you're not going to live longer is 

10
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,480
because we can't figure out how to get 
you to live longer.

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,520
That's why you're not going to starve to
death.

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,800
Wild animals aren't gonna tear you in 
pieces.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,990
Tyrants aren't going to rip you from 
limb to limb.

14
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:34,824
It's like these are good things.
Now you still got a big problem because 

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,010
the cosmic system is rigged against you 
in a sense,

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,350
but okay,
so fine.

17
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,880
What do you mean by that?
The off,

18
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,590
you know you're vulnerable and,
and,

19
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:47,424
and,
and,

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,490
and,
and you can be broken and you will be in

21
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:54,090
many ways,
but you can't blame someone for that.

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,940
It's just,
that's the structure of reality.

23
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:58,320
Okay,
so what do you do about that?

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,910
Well,
as far as I can tell,

25
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,120
and I've always looked as a psychologist
for optimistic ideas and and I'm not,

26
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,463
it's not.
I'm not an easy sell with regards to 

27
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:13,590
optimistic ideas,
especially because of my basic belief in

28
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:14,800
the idea that,
you know,

29
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,070
the most profound truth is that life is 
suffering.

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,031
So okay,
fine.

31
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:21,090
Life is suffering.
You can't blame that on anyone.

32
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,680
All right,
so what do you do about it?

33
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,700
Well,
maybe nothing,

34
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,340
maybe nothing.
Maybe the jigs up,

35
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,360
it's hopeless,
you know,

36
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,970
but maybe that's not right.
Maybe here's something.

37
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,420
What do you have against the suffering 
and the malevolence.

38
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,780
Let's say you have possibility.
You have potential in front of you,

39
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,350
inside of you even whatever that means.
So here's the question,

40
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,813
what would your life be like if you made
use of all the potential that you were 

41
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:46,674
offered?
That's the optimistic question because 

42
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,730
you can test it out.
Say,

43
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:52,120
okay,
well I'll just try that for a year.

44
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,280
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna.

45
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,133
Do the best I can at everything that 
offers itself to me just as an 

46
00:01:58,021 --> 00:01:59,910
experiment and then I'm going to see,
well,

47
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:03,180
is my life better or as my life worse?
It's like you try it for a year.

48
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:03,980
You think,
Huh?

49
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,390
So actually better.
My friendships are better.

50
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:07,680
My family's better.
I'm,

51
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,380
I'm less anxious.
I'm more positively oriented.

52
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:13,260
I'm less resentful and bitter and 
jealous and angry,

53
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,880
you know?
I'm more physically healthy.

54
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:16,050
It's like,
Hey,

55
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,060
great,
and you still,

56
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:19,170
you're not that good at it.

57
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,720
So what happens if you did that for five
years?

58
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,540
That's a good addiction.
It's an addiction.

59
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,350
It's an addiction to possibility.
And then it's also an exponential thing.

60
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:29,184
And this is actually technically true.
We know this beyond a shadow of the 

61
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:32,244
doubt.
There's this principle that economists 

62
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:34,974
talk about.
They often call it the matthew 

63
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:38,460
principle,
which is based on a statement in the new

64
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:41,880
testament from those who have 
everything.

65
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,270
No.
Yeah.

66
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,153
Uh,
to those who have everything more will 

67
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:47,010
be given.
And from those who have nothing,

68
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:50,160
everything will be taken.
It's really a vicious statement.

69
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,540
But what it means is as you go downhill,
you go downhill faster and faster,

70
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,670
and people know that.
It's like it isn't linear,

71
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:58,410
man.
It's exponential.

72
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,360
You do one thing stupid.
Then two stupid things happen.

73
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:04,750
Then for stupid things happen and as you
know before you know it,

74
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,883
you're done.

75
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,873
But the reverse of that is also true.
You do one good thing and then you get 

76
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,940
to opportunities and you fix them up and
you get four,

77
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,893
and this is how the world works.
It's a fundamental economic principle 

78
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,020
and you see because of that,
that a small proportion of people have,

79
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:23,500
most of the gains accrue to them and 
they're the ones they're healthy.

80
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,330
That's luck often,
you know,

81
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,523
they didn't get run over by a bus,
like there's lots of arbitrary things 

82
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:31,510
about life that have to go right.
But after that,

83
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,583
it's like those are also people who are 
capitalizing on what they're being 

84
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:38,170
offered without bitterness or 
resentment.

85
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,710
And then maybe it won't work for you,
but you don't have a better.

86
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,420
You don't have a better plan in that.
