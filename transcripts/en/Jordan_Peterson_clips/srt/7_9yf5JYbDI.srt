1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,480
Your authentic leftism is populist.
Okay.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,000
It is based in working class style,
working class language,

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:07,893
working class,
direct emotion and an openness and 

4
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:11,860
brushing some speech.
Okay.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,873
Not this fancy,
contorted jargon of the pseudo leftist 

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,310
of academe who are frauds.
These people,

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,263
these people who managed to manage to 
rise to the top and ended at Berkeley 

8
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:24,340
and Harvard and Princeton.
Okay.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,960
You have any of these people are 
radical.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,480
They are career people.
Their corporate types.

11
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:29,314
Okay.
Then who like who succeeded in and they 

12
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:31,384
love the institutional context.
They know how to manipulate the 

13
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:36,360
bureaucracy which has totally invaded in
usurped.

14
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,680
Okay.
The or they have an academe everywhere.

15
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:41,140
Okay.
These people are company poor players.

16
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,000
They could have done well in any,
any field,

17
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,310
and then they,
they love to sit in endless committees.

18
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,680
They love bureaucratic regulation and so
on.

19
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,560
There's not one,
not one leftist.

20
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,393
Okay.
And American academe raised his or her 

21
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:53,944
voice against obscene growth.
Growth of tuition costs which have 

22
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:59,920
bankrupted a whole generation of young 
people.

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,510
Not,
not one voice.

24
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,910
Okay.
To challenge that.

25
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,350
That invasion by the bureaucrats.
Okay.

26
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,900
Actual fascist bureaucrats.
Okay.

27
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,190
Well,
if whoever added the cancerous,

28
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,610
okay,
there's so many of them can.

29
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:15,340
If they told the faculty have completely
lost any power in American academia.

30
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,203
Okay.
It's us.

31
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,133
It's a scandal.
What has happened and they deserve the 

32
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:21,160
president's servitude that they're in 
right now.

33
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:22,450
Okay.
Because they never protested.

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,180
When I.
my first job at Bennington College,

35
00:01:25,181 --> 00:01:26,014
1976.
I was there when there was an uprising 

36
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:28,864
by the faculty against encroachment,
by the board of trustees and the 

37
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:32,104
president.
Okay.

38
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,700
And it was a huge thing.
It was,

39
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,553
it was.
It was reported on the New York Times 

40
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:36,430
and so on.
And we.

41
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,293
And we pushed that president out and,
and there's not been a single uprising 

42
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:42,490
of mankind against,
against encroachment,

43
00:01:42,491 --> 00:01:45,910
by the trustees and by the 
administrations and all these decades.

44
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:47,650
Okay.
Passive slaves.

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,630
Slaves.
They deserve their slavery.

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,330
Yup.
I couldn't agree more.

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,230
I thought the same thing about 
university professors for a long time is

48
00:01:56,231 --> 00:02:00,130
that they get exactly what they deserve 
because they never stand up and say no.

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,210
And the fact that in the United States,
it's not quite as bad in Canada,

50
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:07,690
I wouldn't say,
but the fact that the students have been

51
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,703
essentially handed a bill of indentured 
servitude here for the student loans is 

52
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:13,660
absolutely beyond comprehension.
You know,

53
00:02:13,661 --> 00:02:14,494
it seems to me that the bureaucracy has 
basically conspired to determine how to 

54
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:21,490
pick the pockets of the students' future
earnings.

55
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:22,324
Right?
And they do that by offering them an 

56
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:26,560
extended adolescence with no quality 
control,

57
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,290
something like that.
So it's a real bargain with the devil.
