1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,953
What do we do with once our ego is 
helped us climb in the dominance 

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:04,314
hierarchy is secure a bait?
Why then should we keep looking for a 

3
00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:10,080
mate and how to curtail that instinct?
Well,

4
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:12,220
I think part of the way that you 
curtailed headings,

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,123
instinct is that you have,
you have this sort of life that you 

6
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:17,700
would have with a mate.
The question is,

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,553
you know,
what's the purpose of pair bonding and 

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,250
one of the fundamental purposes of pair 
bonding.

9
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:24,084
Well there's a couple.
One is that it solves the sexual access 

10
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:27,174
problems so that you don't have to 
continue to obsess about who you're 

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,820
going to be with him and,
and,

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,560
and,
and where,

13
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:35,394
and how.
And so you can get on with other 

14
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:38,940
elements of your life.
But I mean with,

15
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,530
with your mate,
you have to decide,

16
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:41,364
well,
what does it mean that you're not 

17
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,743
together?

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,760
You know,
your companionship.

19
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:47,730
Obviously in friendship and their shared
interests,

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,850
you have to decide what they are.
And I would say that you should continue

21
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:51,684
dating your,
your partner at least once a week or 

22
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:57,570
perhaps twice a week because otherwise 
the romance goes out of your life.

23
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,703
But then also you have to decide about 
children and eventually about trench 

24
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:03,344
Hildrun because you know you're going to
get old and you're going to get older 

25
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:10,560
and more mature and children are a huge 
part of life and they get a bad rap,

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,050
which is really unfortunate because,
you know,

27
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,600
maybe I'm,
I'm different in this regard.

28
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,493
Perhaps I am to some degree,
but I never regretted having kids for 

29
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:19,914
even one second because they're so mean.
All of a sudden you have an intimate 

30
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:24,864
relationship with new people that is as 
close as any relationship that you've 

31
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,004
ever had.
You have the opportunity to make that 

32
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:34,050
relationship as pristine as you possibly
can mean.

33
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,180
It can be a lot of catastrophe involved 
in it.

34
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,343
But it's a great opportunity and there's
just nothing wrong with having some 

35
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:41,910
additional people that love you.
You know.

36
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,133
And so what you do is you turn your 
attention to the issues of maturity in 

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,833
your junior year.
Attention away from the issues of being 

38
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:51,654
a juvenile,
and you do that partly by knowing that 

39
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,460
it's actually better to do so.
You know,

40
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:59,550
there's nothing more observed at the 40 
year old 20 year old.

41
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,693
It gets ugly and there's something like 
there's something like spoiled milk 

42
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:05,174
bone,
it goes off and you have to gracefully 

43
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:09,264
accept the challenges of each stage of 
life and things work a lot better when 

44
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:14,850
you do that much,
much better.

45
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:15,684
And you also have to,
I would say we're calling it perfect 

46
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:22,680
your sex life with your partner and 
express what you need and want and teach

47
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:25,950
each other what's necessary to keep 
things exciting and,

48
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,570
and,
and new.

49
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,303
It's not an easy thing to do,
but it's very much worthwhile because 

50
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:32,724
then you can combine sexual excitement 
with intimacy and there's no better 

51
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:38,160
combination than that,
so,

52
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,350
and love,
but it can all be nested,

53
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:42,310
up inside love inside.
You know,

54
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,960
a destiny that's intertwined together.
That's the best you've got,

55
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:46,920
man.
That's,

56
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,110
that's,
that's what life has to offer.

57
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,370
And so,
um,

58
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,703
that's what you do is you accept the 
responsibility of the next stage of 

59
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:57,840
life.
And you don't mourn the past.

60
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,360
I suppose that also means that when 
you're young,

61
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:03,270
you do what young people do and so that 
you don't want to do it again.

62
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,673
So.
