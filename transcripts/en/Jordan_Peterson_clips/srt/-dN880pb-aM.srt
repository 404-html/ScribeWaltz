1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,100
Well,
think of reward as what happens with you

2
00:00:03,101 --> 00:00:05,530
achieved something,
but that's not exactly right.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,393
Not with human beings.
Most of the time we feel reward when or 

4
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:12,190
so engagement and,
and,

5
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:12,680
and,
and,

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,480
and,
and,

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,313
and positive the positive desire to move
forward in life when there's evidence 

8
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:22,000
that we're moving towards a valuable 
goal.

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,890
So we're making progress.
It's like,

10
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:25,180
yes,
we're making progress.

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,890
There's a real neurochemical kick that 
comes along with that.

12
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,670
The same system that cocaine effects and
amphetamines.

13
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:34,780
And so with rats for example,
you can get wrapped hooked on cocaine if

14
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:39,610
they're alone in a cage and they'll self
administer cocaine until basically until

15
00:00:39,611 --> 00:00:42,520
they die.
But if they're doing rat things with the

16
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:43,354
route buddies,
like they're not that interested in 

17
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:46,090
cocaine.
So,

18
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,583
so,
and the reason I'm saying that is 

19
00:00:48,461 --> 00:00:51,790
because like a rat who's out with his 
rat buddies doing rat things gets enough

20
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:52,600
reward from that.

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,433
So the drugs aren't that attractive.
So part of the reason that people take 

22
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:58,893
drugs like cocaine is because they're 
not doing enough things that are deeply 

23
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,320
meaningful,
you know?

24
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:03,154
And so,
but you don't get meaning unless he got 

25
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:08,470
a name because you're.
Your nervous system is wired to give you

26
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:11,830
a pat on the back when you're making 
progress towards your aim.

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,820
Well,
so you've got to have an aim and the aim

28
00:01:15,821 --> 00:01:18,460
should be high because otherwise why 
bother with it,

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,833
but it should also be broken down into 
steps that you have a reasonably high 

30
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:25,720
probability of attaining.
You know,

31
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:27,220
with a kid you want to say,
well,

32
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,120
you're trying to get your kid to develop
you.

33
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,333
You don't give them an impossible task.
You give them a task that's slightly 

34
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,920
harder than that,
which they can already do.

35
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,290
Right?
And so they're engaged by that.

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,420
Maybe they're a little anxious about it,
but they master it and they've.

37
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,600
They've expanded their domain of 
competence.

38
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:47,080
It's no game.
It's a big deal to do that and that kids

39
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:47,914
love that,
that that's where you learn in that 

40
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:50,044
zone.
You know where you're pushing yourself 

41
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:52,690
just a little bit beyond where you are.
