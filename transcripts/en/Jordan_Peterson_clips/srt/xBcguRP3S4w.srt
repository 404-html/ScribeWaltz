1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,013
We're trying to study political 
correctness and so what the first thing 

2
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:06,420
we're trying to figure out was is there 
even such a thing?

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,930
Because if you,
if you look at the political dialogue,

4
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:10,764
what you find is that people on the side
of the political spectrum who have been 

5
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:14,874
defined as politically correct tend to 
say that it doesn't exist and that that 

6
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:18,384
category is just a pejorative term that 
was invented by people who hold 

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,690
alternative political opinions.
And so the first question is,

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,050
well,
what do you mean some does it exist?

9
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:30,540
What do you mean by exist?
What?

10
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,390
How do you tell if a psychological 
concept is real?

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,280
Like his anger is anger or something 
that exists objectively.

12
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,950
Is it done an objective phenomena?
Well,

13
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:43,320
it's not that easy to determine.
You say,

14
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:44,440
well,
we,

15
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,520
we act like it is and we understand what
anger means,

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,583
but no one goes along round in the world
and says anger without saying anything 

17
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:53,430
else or you'd run away from them.

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,140
You know,
what they do is they,

19
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,063
they,
they placed the word anger into a 

20
00:00:58,111 --> 00:00:58,944
sentence and place the sentence within a
conversation and they enable you to 

21
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:04,950
infer exactly what they mean by the word
anger,

22
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:07,530
by listening to the surrounding context.
Right?

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,673
And,
and if you're going to turn that into 

24
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:10,554
something like an objective term,
what you do is you pull out the term 

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,890
anger and then you make the hypothesis 
that it represents something real in the

26
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:17,724
objective world,
but it's not that easy to determine if 

27
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:20,904
something does exist,
especially if it's a psychological 

28
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:26,550
phenomena in the real world.
What do you mean by exist?

29
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,400
That's the problem of construct 
validation.

30
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:30,234
Okay,
so that's another term you really need 

31
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:33,540
to know if you're interested in 
experimental psychology,

32
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,613
especially on the personality and a 
construct is a representation of 

33
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:42,090
something psychological that 
hypothetically exists.

34
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:42,924
Objectively,
how do you establish its existence 

35
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:45,450
objectively?

36
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,310
Well?
Does fear exist?

37
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,003
No.
Does you have the problem with all the 

38
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:53,280
emotional terms?
Does joy exist to surprise exist?

39
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,800
Does embarrassment exist?
Does guilt exist?

40
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,920
Shame?
How are they related to one another?

41
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,190
Guilt and shame,
for example,

42
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:01,290
seem quite similar to one another,
right,

43
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:04,550
and pain and fear and anger all seem to 
share the,

44
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,820
the,
the,

45
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:10,440
the attribute of unpleasant to negative 
emotions and so how similar,

46
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,750
how something,
if something exists,

47
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:13,584
it should be the same as some things and
different from other things and that's 

48
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:20,940
part of construct validation as well to 
specify how the construct is the same as

49
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,110
some things and different from others.
Anger should be reliably distinguishable

50
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,820
from joy,
for example,

51
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:27,654
because otherwise they're not different 
and anger and fear should be somewhat 

52
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:33,030
the same if they're both negative 
emotions.

53
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,960
So it's extraordinarily complex to,
to,

54
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,470
to validate a construct.

55
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,543
And so here,
here's what we did with political 

56
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:40,830
correctness.
It's,

57
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,683
and it's.
The reason I'm using the political 

58
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:43,614
examples is because that's an obvious 
place where self serving bias can enter 

59
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:51,030
the scientific arena.
Right?

60
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,163
So if I wanted to make a point about 
political correctness or if I wanted to 

61
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:57,174
make a point about right wing fascism,
I could build my biases into the 

62
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:04,420
measurement instruments accidentally and
then they would produce as output what I

63
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:05,254
put into them as input.
And I want to protect myself against 

64
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:10,390
that if I actually want to do this 
scientific investigation properly.

65
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,463
So what we did when we started to 
construct our measures of political 

66
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,963
correctness was employ a number of 
people to go through as many news 

67
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:26,151
sources as they could get their hands on
to identify any attitude or behavior,

68
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,633
some roughly that that had been 
described by anyone at all as 

69
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:32,410
potentially politically correct.

70
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,280
So it was kind of agnostic and we're 
trying to do it as randomly as possible,

71
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:37,114
you know,
to get as many new sources as we 

72
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:43,051
possibly could so that we were sampling 
across the environment without bias.

73
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,220
Okay.
So then we came up with,

74
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:47,380
I don't remember how many,
couple hundred,

75
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,323
maybe more a couple hundred items that 
were roughly indicative of what you 

76
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,820
might describe as political correctness,
but that's not good enough,

77
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:55,654
right?
Because just because you have this 

78
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:57,334
random assemblage of items doesn't 
indicate at all that they're all 

79
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:04,690
measuring something that was similar,
but that's just implicit.

80
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:05,524
They're all cold political correctness,
but you don't know if those attitudes 

81
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:08,884
covariate.
And what that means is if you held one 

82
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,034
attitude of that list,
were you more likely to hold another or 

83
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:16,600
multiple others?
Right?

84
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:21,280
So is the conditional probability of 
holding multiple items?

85
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,850
Is there a high probability of holding 
true multiple items simultaneously while

86
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,110
you figure that out with factor 
analysis?

87
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,943
So what we did is we turned that into a 
questionnaire using different question 

88
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:33,604
types and we administered it to several 
hundred people and we did a factor 

89
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:37,744
analysis and we found actually that 
there was such a thing as political 

90
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:43,060
correctness because the questions 
clumped together,

91
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,000
people would reliably answered them in a
pattern manner,

92
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,730
but that there were actually two 
dimensions that were quite separate.

93
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,040
So there isn't one political 
correctness.

94
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:51,874
There seems to be two.
And then we looked at the personality 

95
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,294
predictors in the ICU predictors and a 
variety of other predictors that would 

96
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:59,134
enable us to come to some understanding 
of the temperamental proclivity towards 

97
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:05,950
those political attitudes,
if any.

98
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,160
We knew already that political 
conservatives tended to be low in trade,

99
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:15,160
openness.
That's the creativity dimension and high

100
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:15,994
in trait conscientiousness.
Whereas political liberals tended to be 

101
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:22,030
high in trait,
openness and low in conscientiousness,

102
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,200
and so one of the things that's 
extraordinarily interesting to know from

103
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,034
the big five perspective is that your 
political proclivities are very 

104
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,410
powerfully influenced by your 
temperament.

105
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,543
And so one of the things you can think 
about with regards to ongoing political 

106
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:37,024
discussions in the real world is that 
those discussions are actually attempts 

107
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:43,390
by people of different temperaments.
One,

108
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:47,680
to impose their temperamental viewpoints
on the world and to,

109
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,693
to engage in a dialogue with people who 
are actually quite different than they 

110
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:52,354
are.
