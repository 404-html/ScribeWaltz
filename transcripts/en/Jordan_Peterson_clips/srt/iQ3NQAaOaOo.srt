1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,560
It's useful to talk to people that you 
don't agree with and it's.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,423
It's useful for a variety of reasons.
One is that a lot of what determines 

3
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:09,684
your political orientation is biological
temperament far more than people 

4
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:16,860
realize.
So for example,

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,030
left leaning people liberals,
let's say,

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,520
although that's kind of Miss Misnomer,
but we'll keep with the terminology.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,890
Liberals are high in a trait called 
openness,

8
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:32,970
which is one of the big five personality
traits and it's associated with interest

9
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:35,610
in abstraction and interest in 
aesthetics.

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,983
It's the best predictor of liberal 
political leaning and they're low in 

11
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:41,184
trait conscientiousness,
which is due to fullness and and 

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,850
orderliness in particular.
Whereas the conservatives,

13
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:47,684
so the opposite.
They're high in conscientiousness there 

14
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:49,944
due to full in orderly and they're low 
in openness and that makes them really 

15
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:53,874
good.
Managers and administers ministers and 

16
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:56,424
often businessmen but not very good 
entrepreneurs because entrepreneurs are 

17
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:00,474
almost all drawn from the liberal types 
and so these are really fundamental 

18
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,070
fundamentally biologically predicated 
differences.

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,190
And there you might think about them as 
different sets of,

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,173
of,
of opportunities and limitations and 

21
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:15,444
certainly different ways of screening 
the world and each of those different 

22
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:21,930
temperamental types needs the other 
type.

23
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,630
So economically speaking,
for example,

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,793
we need liberals to start businesses and
we need conservatives to run them and 

25
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:33,600
the conservatives are too conservative,
so if they are running businesses,

26
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:35,400
they have a bitch of a time with 
innovation.

27
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,493
Whereas the liberals are really good at 
generating new ideas and and moving 

28
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:41,394
laterally,
but they're not very good at the level 

29
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:43,554
of detail and implementation.
And so if you start understanding that 

30
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,440
the person.
This is a diversity issue,

31
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:50,274
let's call this a diversity issue,
if you start understanding that the 

32
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:56,850
person that you're talking to doesn't 
share your political views,

33
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,160
isn't stupid,
that's the first thing necessarily.

34
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:04,350
They might be,
but so might you be no,

35
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:05,184
stupidity isn't the differences in 
intelligence are not the prime 

36
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:10,770
determinant of differences in political 
belief.

37
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,580
All right?
So you might be talking to someone who's

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,130
more conscientious and less creative 
than you.

39
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:18,930
If you're,
if you happen to be a liberal,

40
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,943
but that doesn't mean that that person's
perspective is not valid and it doesn't 

41
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:27,060
mean that they wouldn't outperform you 
in some domains because they would.

42
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,800
So one thing to remember is people 
actually do see the world differently.

43
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:32,634
It's not merely that they,
that they're possessed of ill informed 

44
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:39,720
opinions.
So you have to first of all,

45
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:41,250
stretch out your hand and say,
look,

46
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:41,791
you know,
like,

47
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,190
I,
I get that you see the world differently

48
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:47,850
than me and I also understand that 
there's a place for you and to place for

49
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:49,950
me even though that isn't the same 
place.

50
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,490
And then it's necessary to also remember
that,

51
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,413
well,
do you want to talk to people or do you 

52
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:56,430
want it?
Do you want to fight with them?

53
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,330
Because fighting is not pleasant and it 
goes very dark places very,

54
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:03,550
very rapidly.
And so,

55
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,040
you know,
the last time I was down in Boston,

56
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:11,041
I talked to an old friend of mine and 
this person went on a relatively,

57
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,140
um,
solid and strong and relatively personal

58
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:20,044
critique of,
of trump supporters calling them ill 

59
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:25,120
informed and stupid.
And you know,

60
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,760
and insulting and insulting 
characterization.

61
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:28,594
And I thought,
well it was surprising to me because 

62
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,254
this was a reasonable person and I think
it was an indication of the 

63
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:36,760
polarization,
but you know,

64
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,470
you can't throw away 50 percent of the 
population like that.

65
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,650
It's not reasonable.
And it's the same on the right.

66
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:46,750
The Conservatives can't do it to the 
liberals either.

67
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:47,584
I mean,
right now I think that the radical left 

68
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,300
totalitarian proclivity is a much 
greater danger than radical right?

69
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,170
Totalitarian proclivity,
especially on the university campuses.

70
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,540
And so I've been mostly speaking out 
about the,

71
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,433
about the leftwing radicals.
It could've just as easily been the 

72
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:06,400
reverse case.
It just doesn't happen to me.

73
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,730
But you.
The whole point of the,

74
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,713
of a democracy is to continue the 
dialogue between people of different 

75
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:18,010
temperamental types so that we don't 
move so far to the right,

76
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:18,844
that everything becomes encapsulated in 
stone and doesn't move or so far to the 

77
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:27,910
left and everything dissolves in a kind 
of a mealy mouth chaos.

78
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,860
And the only way that you can,
you can navigate between those two shows

79
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,720
is by,
is through discussion,

80
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:37,510
which is why free speech is such an 
important value.

81
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,613
It's the thing that keeps the 
temperamental types from being at each 

82
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:42,730
other's throats,
just like in a marriage,

83
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:43,564
you know,
because there's differences in the 

84
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,184
marriage.
If you can't talk you either you're 

85
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:52,411
either subservient or you fight.
Well that's no good.

86
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,943
So.
So part of it is have some respect for 

87
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,144
people that are different than you,
which is of course what the radical 

88
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:00,724
leftists are saying,
but they don't identify the real 

89
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:03,334
differences.
