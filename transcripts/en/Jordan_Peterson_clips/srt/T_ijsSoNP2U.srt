1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,590
No,
you saw the same thing with social knits

2
00:00:02,591 --> 00:00:03,424
and his description of the gulags 
because they were running in large part 

3
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:06,384
by the inmates,
but I think that that's a really good 

4
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:10,380
metaphor for totalitarian states in 
general,

5
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:11,214
you know,
because we like to think that a 

6
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,970
totalitarian state is made up of 
innocent,

7
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:18,360
oppressed individuals who are under the 
thumb of a,

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,553
uh,
an evil tyrant and that all of the 

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,060
catastrophes are cascading from the top 
down.

10
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:24,894
But I don't think that that's true.
I think that it's more like a 

11
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:30,720
holographic structure where the tyranny 
exists at every single level.

12
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:31,554
So it exists psychologically and it 
exists within the family and it exists 

13
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:37,770
within the mid level organizations.
And so,

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,031
well,
you know,

15
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:39,864
when eastern Germany for example,
one out of every three people was a 

16
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:43,134
government informer.
So what that meant is if you had a 

17
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:46,344
family of six people,
that two of them you couldn't trust and 

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,880
you can't,
you can't just say that.

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,070
That's a consequence of the top down 
structure.

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,233
It.
Tyranny is something that exists 

21
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:56,700
everywhere simultaneously.
Once it,

22
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,140
once it gets a grip and it's easy for 
people to say things like,

23
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:01,974
well,
I was just following orders and you 

24
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:04,224
know,
I'm not,

25
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,453
I'm not trying to put myself in a 
position where I'm claiming that if I 

26
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:09,984
was in that position,
I wouldn't have followed orders in the 

27
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:12,211
same way.
I mean,

28
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:14,070
God only knows until you get there.
Right?

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,200
That's for sure.
But,

30
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,910
but what that did to me was focused my 
attention more and more on,

31
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,223
on,
uh,

32
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,870
the necessity of individual 
responsibility.

33
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:25,704
I thought if it was individuals in the 
final analysis who were responsible for 

34
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:29,334
the great evils of the 20th century,
which I think is a reasonable way of 

35
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,503
conceptualizing it,
then it might be individuals who could 

36
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:36,923
be responsible for whatever good there 
might be in mankind that could help us 

37
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:43,230
avoid those situations in the future.

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,633
And I thought of that as an alternative 
in some sense to nihilistic disbelief 

39
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:51,750
and ideological possession,
you know,

40
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,940
because if your group identity is too 
tight,

41
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,530
then you start acting like they like,
they a,

42
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,523
like,
like a,

43
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,500
like a cog in a mob.
Not so very bad thing.

44
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:03,900
But then if your group identity 
disappears completely,

45
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:07,650
well then you're left alone and bereft,
and so those are bad alternatives,

46
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:08,484
right?
You're sort of damned if you do and 

47
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:11,400
damned if you don't.
And it it was.

48
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,293
It was very difficult to understand that
there might be a third path between 

49
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:16,990
those two.
I couldn't see the,

50
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,090
the existence of anything because people
need belief systems in order to exist,

51
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:22,944
right?
To maintain psychological stability and 

52
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:25,164
domain.
So maintain sociological stability as 

53
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:29,490
well.
But then if the beliefs get too rigid,

54
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:33,090
then they turn into a raging 
totalitarian mob.

55
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,480
So maybe you let that go because you 
don't want to play that game,

56
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:38,880
but then you dissolve because you have 
no identity.

57
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,190
That's not,
that's not acceptable either.

58
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,293
When I first laid that out,
that clearly it was really hard on me 

59
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:48,300
because I couldn't see a third path to 
that.

60
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,643
But then I started to realize,
and this was a consequence of reading 

61
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:54,450
the sorts of things that we already 
talked about,

62
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:55,284
but also starting to understand the 
underlying structure of mythology and 

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,200
what a heroic path man essentially.
And that meant adoption of supreme moral

64
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:07,890
responsibility as an individual.
Now there's,

65
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,240
there's this,
there's this idea in the new testament,

66
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:12,070
which is a really interesting idea.
You know,

67
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,980
it's,
it's one of these bottomless ideas and I

68
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:15,814
mean that literally you could study it 
forever and never get to the bottom of 

69
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:19,324
it.
And the idea is that Christ is the 

70
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:26,440
person who takes the sins of mankind on 
himself and there's something redemptive

71
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:27,274
about that.

72
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,173
And that's actually a really dark idea 
because what it means as far as I can 

73
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:32,734
tell what it means,
at least what it means psychologically 

74
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,790
is that when you read these terrible 
things,

75
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,760
you have to understand that you're 
reading about you.

76
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,250
If you don't understand that you're 
reading about you,

77
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:44,350
then you don't actually understand the 
stories,

78
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,110
you know,
because you put yourself in the position

79
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:47,944
where you're automatically the good 
person who would never do anything like 

80
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:52,480
that.
And then these other people are,

81
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,430
while they're devils in some sense,
right?

82
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,550
And it's very easy for people to make 
that division,

83
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,773
but it's a horrific realization when you
think that that devil that you see 

84
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,380
outside is the same thing that's inside 
and that you don't know until you're put

85
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:07,240
in a situation like that what you might 
do.

86
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,630
And then it's even worse because if you 
look at the historical evidence,

87
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,370
you know,
um,

88
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,943
it's,
it was ordinary people in some sense 

89
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,570
that produced the catastrophes of Nazi 
Germany and the Soviet Union and China.

90
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,250
I mean,
they might not have originated it,

91
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:29,670
but they certainly had the option to say
no at different parts of different steps

92
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,140
along the way.
And they didn't,

93
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,300
you know.
And these things do happen.

94
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:35,134
One horrible thing at a time.
There's this great book called ordinary 

95
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:38,650
men,
um,

96
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,170
which,
which describes the descent of,

97
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,030
of a German police force from ordinary 
bourgeois middleclass men.

98
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:46,864
Essentially just ordinary policemen who 
actually were raised before the Hitler 

99
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:52,480
youth.
They weren't indoctrinated,

100
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,920
you know,
as young people.

101
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,870
Um,
and they were,

102
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,853
they were brought into Poland to sort of
mock pop after the Germans had walked 

103
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:03,070
through.
And it describes how they descended into

104
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:05,040
the sort of people who would take naked 
women out,

105
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,913
naked,
prayed pregnant women out into the 

106
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,040
middle of fields and shoot them in the 
back of the head.

107
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:13,000
And what's horrifying about the book is 
that the author,

108
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,743
I'm Browning a details,
the stages by which this occurred and 

109
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,610
it's,
it's all,

110
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:22,444
for example,
the commander of this unit told the man 

111
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:29,170
that they were going to have to do 
terrible things,

112
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,330
but that they could go home if they 
wanted to.

113
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,400
And then you think,
well there's a,

114
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,190
there's an out but,
but then if you really think about it,

115
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:37,024
you think,
well,

116
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,303
there are tight tightly knit cause a 
military organization and one of the 

117
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:44,980
natural thoughts under that circumstance
would be,

118
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,980
well,
I'm not going to leave my comrades to do

119
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:48,814
all the dirty work.
That would just be a matter of 

120
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:52,690
cowardice.
And so you can see that you know that,

121
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:55,750
that there's an ethical requirement that
would keep you there to begin with.

122
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:57,090
And then they were,
you're,

123
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,180
you're,
you're doing what you just said.

124
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,420
Which is taking the burden of this 
sinful activity on yourself.

125
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,970
If you let everyone else do it,
then you're not,

126
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,800
you're not acting heroically.
Right?

127
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:07,863
And,
and so it was easy for the men to get 

128
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,773
entrapped into that and then you know,
the requirements for their horrific 

129
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:15,434
action kept ramping up and like each 
time the accepted the requirement of 

130
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:19,454
doing one horrific thing,
the probability that they would accept 

131
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,020
the next requirement increased.

132
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,003
And what is also really interesting 
about that book of ordinary men is that 

133
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,180
it's not like these men didn't suffer 
like they were suffering terribly.

134
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:34,130
They were physically ill,
they were vomiting,

135
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:34,964
they were,
they were tearing themselves apart 

136
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,460
psychologically,
you know,

137
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,580
but they didn't quit.
So that's a,

138
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,880
that's a great book because if you want 
to know how you walk down the how you,

139
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,740
how you can be enticed to walk down a 
terrible path.

140
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,040
That's the book to read.
And it's very frightening because if you

141
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,960
read it properly,
then you know,

142
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,850
you have to read it again,
as I said,

143
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:58,850
is if you're one of the people to whom 
this is happening,

144
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,740
not the victim,
but the oppressor,

145
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,630
you know,
and I mean,

146
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,060
you can also read it as the victim.
That's fair enough.

147
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,200
But,
but it's ordinary people who participate

148
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:10,490
in these things.
And that's very,

149
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:11,750
very terrifying thought.
