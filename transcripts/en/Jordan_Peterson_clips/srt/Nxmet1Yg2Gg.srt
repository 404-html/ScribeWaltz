1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,070
One of the natural response to what you 
said,

2
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:03,180
would it be okay?
Well,

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,550
the,
the priorities are,

4
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:06,384
it's a rigged game because only when 
there are the ones who are able to 

5
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:09,450
procreate.
So what do we answer to that?

6
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:10,830
Of course,
it's a rigged game.

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,233
Obviously it's a rigged game.
Women have complicated lives and the 

8
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:16,620
pill has made them more complicate.
Well,

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,513
that's not,
I wouldn't say that exactly because you 

10
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:20,424
know,
a hundred years in 1895 the average 

11
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:25,800
person in the western world lived on $1 
a day in today's money.

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,350
Okay.
So those people worked so hard at,

13
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:31,740
slaved away to such a degree that you 
can't even imagine it and all their kids

14
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:33,030
die.
Right?

15
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:38,031
So the death rate among kids below five 
is beyond comprehension.

16
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:40,780
And so like women have terrible time of 
timber.

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,850
Well,
so with men,

18
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,770
they got to be coal miners and soldiers.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,960
Cause now that wasn't exactly 
entertaining,

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,420
you know,
so life was very,

21
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:49,141
very,
very,

22
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:49,974
very,
very hard before we got rich and we're 

23
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:54,060
rich.
Even those of you who are in this class,

24
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,320
you think you're poor.
It's like,

25
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,730
oh no,
you're not.

26
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,773
You're in the top one 10th of 1% by 
historical standards and probably there 

27
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,020
by her and world's standards as well.
Of course,

28
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:04,854
you could just compare yourself to the 
few people to Richard than you and feel 

29
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:07,824
sorry for yourself.
But that's a pretty pathetic in my 

30
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:11,580
estimation.
So it's in,

31
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:15,300
it's certainly historically uninformed.
So yeah,

32
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:18,300
women have it rough obviously.
Now there's,

33
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,300
there's other things to consider.
You do live eight years longer,

34
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,140
so that's not trivial.
Testosterone kills men.

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,810
That's basically why men die earlier,
you know,

36
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:30,390
and men are much more likely to be 
killed and dangerous jobs.

37
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:32,070
They do almost all the dangerous jobs.

38
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,270
They do almost all the outside work.
And there's lots of reasons that men get

39
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:38,910
paid more than women that have nothing 
to do with prejudice.

40
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,133
It's because they take awful,
horrible jobs like working in the oil 

41
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:45,980
rates in northern Alberta when it's 
bloody 40 below and come out at,

42
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,460
you know of that after five years with 
two or three fingers missing and,

43
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,483
and all warped up because you really 
want to wrestle pipe when it's 40 below 

44
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,070
and it's filthy with a bunch of ordinary
men who are hung over beyond belief.

45
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,450
It's like that's not very entertaining.
So yeah,

46
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:04,284
I mean each gender,
each sex has its own unfairness to deal 

47
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:10,350
with.
But to think of that as a consequence of

48
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:12,600
the social structure,
it's like come on,

49
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,570
really.
What about nature itself?

50
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,063
And this is something,
this is something that seems to be 

51
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:21,960
completely invisible on the left side of
the political spectrum.

52
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,303
So like of course you're a bloody 
oppressed and your life is full of 

53
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:26,004
suffering obviously.
But to think about that as a direct 

54
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:31,800
consequence of unjust social structures 
is just moronic.

55
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:34,440
It's like that's part of the reason,
a small part.

56
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:35,274
But look where you're sitting people,
it's pretty warm in here and you're so 

57
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:41,010
privileged.
You could come here and Saturday morning

58
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:45,210
and listen to an intellectual lecture.
It's like you should be happy about that

59
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:46,044
because by historical standards,
you should be out lifting rocks in your 

60
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:53,670
skeletal form about five foot three with
no teeth.

61
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,070
So have cougars,
cougars alliance.

62
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,973
Yeah,
exactly.

63
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,330
You know,
there's no gratitude.

64
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:02,164
That's the thing.
There's no gratitude for what our 

65
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:04,740
society is capable of doing.
