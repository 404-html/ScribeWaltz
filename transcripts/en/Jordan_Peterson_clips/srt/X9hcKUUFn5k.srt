1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
Well,
a subset of males are are biologically 

2
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:04,284
hyper aggressive.
You can identify them at two years of 

3
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:06,924
age and they are the kids.
If you put a bunch of two year olds 

4
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:09,990
together,
there's a small subset.

5
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:10,824
They're almost all males,
about five percent of males who will 

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,290
kick hit bite and steel.
Okay.

7
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,300
So that's their biological programming,
let's say.

8
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:19,134
But the vast majority of them are 
socialized by the time they're four 

9
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:24,660
years old.
So that's amazing.

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,531
Yeah,
sure.

11
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:27,070
Absolutely.
Absolutely it is.

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:27,900
Yeah,
absolutely.

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,630
Yeah.
And the thing about about boys like that

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,530
is that if you socialize them properly,
it's quite a bit of work because they're

15
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:36,330
very combative.
My son was like that.

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,583
And if you socialize them properly,
then they can become unbelievably 

17
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:42,360
useful.
They're courageous,

18
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:43,530
they're forthright,
they're,

19
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,580
they're,
they're,

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,250
they're not going to back down from a 
challenge.

21
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,143
There's all sorts of massive utility in 
that and that's this proper interplay 

22
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:53,220
between the biological circuitry and the
socialization.

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,160
But you know,
and,

24
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:57,180
and with James Demaurice memo,
you know,

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,253
he,
he was,

26
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,830
he's been accused of taking a biological
essential list route,

27
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:04,530
which is not true.
One of the things James said is,

28
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,980
look,
there's credible evidence that there are

29
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:08,814
biologically mediated differences 
between men and women at the level of 

30
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:12,054
temperament and interest that are 
actually large and profound and I would 

31
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:20,181
say the science on that is sufficiently 
settled so that someone can come out and

32
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:24,720
say that scientifically credible.
Now that doesn't mean it's right because

33
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:25,554
the scientists could be wrong,
but what you can say is that what James 

34
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,480
Damore said was scientifically 
uninformed.

35
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,330
It was scientifically informed,
but he also said,

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,880
look,
let's make the assumption.

37
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,043
I'm paraphrasing slightly,
but let's make the assumption that we 

38
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:39,870
want to,
as a society,

39
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:44,820
we want to extract maximum useful 
economic value from talented people.

40
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,253
So one of the things we want to do is if
some of those people are women and some 

41
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:49,344
of them are men,
we want to understand the actual 

42
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:54,510
differences between women and men so 
that we can set up the workplace so that

43
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,583
both women and men can contribute to the
maximum economically so that they can 

44
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:01,230
benefit as individuals and everybody can
benefit socially.

45
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,490
So you can use the biological.
So I mean,

46
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,870
for example,
one of the things,

47
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,500
here's,
here's a biological problem,

48
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,330
on average women are more agreeable than
men and I think that's because agreeable

49
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,164
people are self sacrificing and I think 
as a woman you need to be wired to be 

50
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:20,040
self sacrificing or you won't be able to
tolerate taking care of infants.

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,140
That's my sense of it.
Okay.

52
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,820
Now there's some problems with that.
It's like,

53
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,300
let's say that a huge part of female 
wiring is,

54
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,223
is tilted in the direction of the 
necessity of self sacrifice for infant 

55
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:31,410
care.
Okay.

56
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:35,420
That doesn't equip women very well for 
dealing with aggressive meant because of

57
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,860
aggressive men and infants are not the 
same creatures.

58
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,530
So women play a pay,
a price beat,

59
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,800
being optimized to some degree for 
infant care.

60
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:46,480
They pay a price that they're less,
uh,

61
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,320
what would you call prepared?
That's one way of thinking about it.

62
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,040
Indeed with dealing with hyper 
aggressive and competitive meant.

63
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,443
Well,
one of the consequences of that is that 

64
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,330
agreeable people don't make as much 
money.

65
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,560
And the reason for that is to make 
money.

66
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:00,394
You actually have to be disagreeable 
because you have to go to your boss and 

67
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,124
say,
give me some bloody money or something 

68
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:07,810
you don't like will happen to you.
You have to leave.

69
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,640
You have to be able to fight

70
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,980
for an idea too.
But so there is something that,

71
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,320
this is a perfect test case.
So biologically speaking,

72
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,543
there's a very good reason for certain 
kinds of wisdom to be biased in the 

73
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:24,750
direction of manifesting in females,
females,

74
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,733
because they have the capacity to have 
fewer offspring in a lifetime than 

75
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:30,480
males,
uh,

76
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,970
are,
uh,

77
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,840
obligated,
as you say,

78
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,990
to,
um,

79
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,263
to care in a particular way.
And the fact that care and human beings 

80
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:43,290
take so many years has resulted in 
menopause emerging and menopause.

81
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,350
Essentially when a woman is done 
producing new offspring,

82
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,180
her interests in,
uh,

83
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,560
her evolutionary interest,
which in this case I think our honorable

84
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,573
becomes synonymous with the lineage,
the population because her offspring 

85
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,800
will either do well or do poorly based 
on the population that they're in.

86
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,030
So women have a kind of farsightedness 
about lineage.

87
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:07,950
And I don't think it has anything to do 
with human women.

88
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,690
Actually,
this is a trait that we can see,

89
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,370
uh,
in females,

90
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,560
uh,
of other species,

91
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,940
so it's an ancient thing,
whereas males are high variance.

92
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,600
That is to say a male can have many 
offspring in a lifetime.

93
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,640
Many males have no offspring in a 
lifetime.

94
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:24,474
And that high variance means that to the
extent that there's wisdom that 

95
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:30,660
surrounds risk taking,
that has traveled historically,

96
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,460
uh,
along the male path.

97
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,503
Now in modern times,
there's no reason that we can't look at 

98
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:39,330
these two kinds of wisdom and 
democratize them both,

99
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,333
right?
The fact is there's no reason if you're 

100
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:43,194
born female,
that you can't tune into what has 

101
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:49,320
historically been a male biased wisdom 
and take advantage of that.

102
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:52,530
And we should be encouraging this.
There's no reason that people have to.

103
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,863
The problem is,
is that we can't actually have a 

104
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:57,930
reasonable discussion about it because,
you know,

105
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,180
the discussion is often for stalled by 
the claim that,

106
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,040
well,
men and women are exactly the same.

107
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,550
It's like,
it's,

108
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,810
that's not a helpful discussion.
And you know,

109
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,530
with the agreeableness issue,
I don't know exactly what should be done

110
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:08,364
about that.
But one of the consequences of it is is 

111
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:13,710
that there's many reasons why,
why the pay,

112
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,663
there's pay differential between men and
women and the issue itself is very 

113
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:17,514
complex,
but we do know that agreeable people 

114
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,973
overall make less money in the same 
positions and it's because they don't 

115
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:26,580
negotiate on their own behalf very well.
Now it's conceivable that you could have

116
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:27,414
an intelligent public policy or 
corporate policy discussion about what 

117
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:32,010
to do about that.
Like maybe,

118
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,873
maybe the rule is something like you 
review male salaries once a year and 

119
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,320
female salaries every eight months or 
something like that.

120
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:42,030
You know,
and I'm not saying that's a good idea.

121
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:44,610
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying that if you,

122
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,250
if you take the facts on the ground into
account,

123
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,250
there are ways that you might be able to
use them so that you could,

124
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,353
and I'm not gonna say level the playing 
field because I think that's an 

125
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:56,790
appalling phrase,
but maximize the possibility of economic

126
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,213
across the genders,
which is obviously in everyone's best 

127
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:01,004
interest.
