1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,143
Could you please offer advice for 
individuals with high intelligence but 

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:04,294
low extroversion and low agreeableness 
and making and maintaining social 

3
00:00:06,851 --> 00:00:11,050
connections and friendships?
Well,

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,030
I would.
That's Roger,

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,040
Roger.
I would say make a plan.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,373
Again,

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,790
spend some time on it weekly.
Go to things like meetups.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,270
There's a site called meetup.com.
That's a good place to meet people.

9
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:29,790
Do whatever you have to to meet people.
Take a course,

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,110
strike up a conversation and ask 
questions and listen.

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,810
That's particularly good if you're low 
in agreeableness,

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,600
um,
people really like to be listened to.

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,540
You don't want to pester them with 
questions too badly,

14
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,374
but you can get an awful long ways by 
listening to people and asking them 

15
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,124
questions people hardly ever get 
listened to and they're so damn happy 

16
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:52,510
when you do it that,
um,

17
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,010
that,
that they're likely to open themselves.
