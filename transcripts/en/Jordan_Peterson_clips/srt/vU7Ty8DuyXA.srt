1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,900
Alright,
so now we have something interesting and

2
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:04,734
unexpected.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,800
Close this off with the floor is yours,
Dr Peterson.

4
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:15,091
I'd like to say thank you for making 
your videos available online.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,360
They had a great effect on me over the 
last year.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,473
Actually found them a few years ago,
but sometime around July or August of 

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,900
last year,
I got hooked.

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,523
I would wake up at like 5:00
AM in the morning to watch your maps of 

9
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:34,840
meaning releases the new ones,
the old ones,

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,790
etc.
Etc.

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,123
Um,
I found mysElf inspired by both the 

12
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:41,554
academic and technicals a material as 
well as what I might term the more 

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,653
fatherly directives or wisdom.
I shared this with my family and my 

14
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:53,800
friends as well as my girlfriend.
She's here tonight as well.

15
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,720
She's been following the biblical 
series.

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,613
Well,
what I'd like to say is thank yoU for 

17
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:00,804
inspiring me to stand up and face 
something that I've been afraid of all 

18
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:07,194
my adult life.
And thank you for granting me the 

19
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:13,770
permission to ask this question here.
It's actually for my girlfriend.

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,300
Will you please stand up?
So some might say,

21
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,880
gIven that we are a couple of primates 
full of snakes,

22
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:30,010
it's pretty miraculous that we haven't 
killed each other,

23
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,303
but

24
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,803
I think you're pretty great.
We've been talking about commitment and 

25
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,853
I think I'm ready now.
I'm ready to commit to a life with you 

26
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,510
of sorting ourselves out.
I'd like to clean some rooms with you.

27
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,450
And even as scary as the shackles of 
marriage have been made to seem to us,

28
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,013
um,

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,590
I'm thinking about forever and simply in
my,

30
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,010
in my words,
I love you dearly.

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,850
You feel like home.
I never want to lose the will.

32
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:23,770
You marry me.
And if you want to come here,

33
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,430
thank you.

34
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,560
So you're seeing,
you're going to shackle yourself to me.

35
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:52,561
I'd never run away then I shall suffer 
the rest of my life with you.
