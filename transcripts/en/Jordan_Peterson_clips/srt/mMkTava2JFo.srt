1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,150
No.
What,

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,133
what women want are dangerous men who 
are civilized and they want to help 

3
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:07,384
civilize them.

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,260
Beauty and the beast.
So,

5
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,094
you know,
I'll tell you a funny story and only 

6
00:00:13,271 --> 00:00:16,000
engineers could have come up with this 
because they are the only ones that have

7
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:16,834
the unparalleled blindness to social 
convention that would allow them to 

8
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:23,530
discover it.
So the Google engineers,

9
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:26,050
I like engineers by the way,
cause they're very straight forward.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:26,973
The Google engineers wrote a book a 
while back called a billion wicked 

11
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:32,530
thoughts,
which was a study of Internet searches,

12
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,453
billions of them literally.
And they were looking a lot at 

13
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:36,184
pornography use and well there's lots of
knowing about male pornography use 

14
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:41,020
partly and it's easy to understand.
I mean,

15
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,070
males are,
you know,

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,113
pretty visually oriented and what 
attracts them to pornography is fairly 

17
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:48,100
straight forward.
Um,

18
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,490
you can tell that if you look at 
graffiti and a men's washroom,

19
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:54,430
you know,
it's like two circles and a triangle and

20
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:56,500
the men are absolutely transfixed.

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,580
Bye.
[inaudible].

22
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,843
So

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,250
for women,
the story is more complex.

24
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:15,084
They use pornography too.
But it tends to be literary because 

25
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:19,480
women tend to like words more than they 
like visual stimuli.

26
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:23,840
And so the Google guys tried to track 
down the archetipal structure of all,

27
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,460
they didn't use those words of female 
pornography use.

28
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,294
And so some of you know,
how many of you know what a Harlequin 

29
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,540
Romances.
Okay,

30
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,350
good.
So those are archetypal stories,

31
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:36,330
right?
That's the taming of the wild man.

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,330
Essentially by the,
by the desirable and virgin a woman.

33
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:43,350
And if you think women don't want that,
then you better bloody well come up with

34
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:46,560
an explanation for 50 shades of grey.
Right?

35
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:47,394
Which is the most,
the most rapid selling novel in human 

36
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:52,560
history and,
and merged at exactly the same time that

37
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:55,820
all of this noise about the lack of the 
absence of gender roles is,

38
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:56,820
is being produced.

39
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,720
You know,
on Mohs.

40
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,170
It's like perfect female fantasy.
It's exactly Arkan typically correct.

41
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:02,004
It's beauty and the beast.
So what they do go guys showed was the 

42
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:06,354
structure of beauty and the beast,
although they didn't use that as a 

43
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:12,150
reference that the female pornographic 
fantasy was wild guy.

44
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,590
Um,
you know,

45
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,500
somewhat careless about the wants and 
desires of others,

46
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,300
attractive to everyone.
Therefore,

47
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,134
High Status Tamed by the Magic of a 
single woman and brought into a 

48
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:23,970
relationship with her.
Okay,

49
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:25,530
so,
but here's the comical part.

50
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:27,030
This just made me laugh,
man.

51
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:27,864
It was like,
why were the five categories of most 

52
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:34,470
desirable male entity used most broadly 
and female pornography?

53
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,210
Oh,
it's so embarrassing.

54
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:37,560
Women,
you have to cover your head.

55
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:40,350
Well,
I say this because vampire,

56
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,850
we're wolf billionaire surgeon and 
pirate.
