1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,030
I already have trouble regulating my 
emotions.

2
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:03,864
I have a suspicion it's to do with the 
fact that I'm 90 percentile and 

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,313
openness,
conscientiousness and neuroticism and 

4
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:12,960
second percentile in agreeableness and 
extroversion.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,900
Any tips on dealing with that?
Yeah,

6
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:16,734
well,
if you're really high in openness and 

7
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:23,220
you're really high in neuroticism,
that can be a rough combination.

8
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:25,320
The conscientiousness should actually 
help without,

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,540
although it might make you a bit 
perfectionistic.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,633
The problem with being high in openness 
which is creativity and interest in 

11
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:33,384
ideas and high in neuroticism,
which is tendency towards anxiety and 

12
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:37,314
emotional pain,
is that like open people like to break 

13
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:40,704
open boxes,
conceptual boxes and see what's inside 

14
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:44,094
like Pandora's box,
but people are high in neuroticism or 

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,800
are more likely to respond negatively to
complexity and uncertainty and if you're

16
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:53,394
an open person and you're always 
thinking up new things you you tend to 

17
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,373
saw off the branch that you're sitting 
on on a regular basis and that can be 

18
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:03,660
pretty destabilizing.

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,630
Any tips on dealing with that?
Well,

20
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,523
I would repeat what I said earlier.
I think that one of the things that you 

21
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:15,561
do if you're high in anxiety is to 
stabilize your sleep wake cycles,

22
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,183
so get up at the same time,
go to bed at the same time and eat at 

23
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:20,814
the same time.
Make sure that you eat breakfast and a 

24
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:23,544
big breakfast too.
That's heavy on fat and protein because 

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,450
if you're hungry and then you stress 
yourself,

26
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:32,070
especially if you're high in 
neuroticism,

27
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:32,904
you destabilize your,
your insulin production system and it 

28
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:38,060
will restabilize till you go to sleep 
again.

29
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:38,894
So I would say like two things.
One is have a big breakfast and then 

30
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:46,020
also if you're feeling particularly 
anxious,

31
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:46,854
try eating something,
not carbohydrates and see if that helps 

32
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,023
because you.
You might be somewhat permanently 

33
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:58,410
dysregulated in your insulin,
stress-related insulin production.

34
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,273
That would be worth trying.
I would also say that you should shield 

35
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:06,771
yourself to some degree from news 
sources and sources of bad news,

36
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:12,021
especially catastrophic news because 
most of it isn't news.

37
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,910
It's the repetition of things that we 
already know full well,

38
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:15,744
and there's reason to protect yourself 
from an onslaught of negative 

39
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:20,874
information,
especially when it's not really 

40
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:23,160
necessary for you.
I mean,

41
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,290
I don't think you should bury your head 
in the sand,

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,860
but constant exposure to the 
catastrophes of the world,

43
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,753
especially when there's nothing that you
can do about those catastrophes even 

44
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:38,250
hypothetically,
is something that can really destabilize

45
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:39,084
people.
I often tell people in my clinical 

46
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:41,710
practice,
um,

47
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,740
which isn't operating right now by the 
way,

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,913
um,
to shield themselves from news reports 

49
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:50,490
because it's just too much.
If you're depressed and anxious,

50
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:53,280
it's just not something that you need.
It's not helpful to you.

51
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,090
Second percentile in agreeableness and 
extroversion.

52
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,493
Well know one of the things that you can
do if you're that low in agreeableness 

53
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,440
that shouldn't disregulate your 
emotions,

54
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,274
but it might interfere with your 
relationships with other people you 

55
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:11,560
know,
because you might be a little bit harder

56
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:12,394
to.
You might take other people's feelings 

57
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,040
into consideration less than might be 
good for you.

58
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,210
One of the things that people who are 
low in agreeableness can do is to try to

59
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:25,720
think of things they could do for other 
people and make that a practice.

60
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:26,883
You know,
like maybe once a week you could 

61
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,190
consciously do someone a favor or give 
someone a gift,

62
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:35,440
something like that.
And practice being,

63
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,080
um,
what would you call it,

64
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,390
compassionate and polite,
you know,

65
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,870
that'll expand your personality rather 
than transforming it.

66
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:46,690
So then maybe you could have the 
advantages of being disagreeable,

67
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:50,050
which means you're tough minded and 
skeptical and competitive and,

68
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,740
and those can all be really good things,
but it would be nice to be able to leave

69
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:55,574
it out a little bit with some,
with the ability to take other people's 

70
00:03:58,391 --> 00:04:00,850
perspectives a bit more and to take them
into account.

71
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,691
And then,
you know,

72
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:02,524
if your relationships improve,
that can also improve your emotional 

73
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:05,854
stability because one of the ways that 
people regulate their anxieties by 

74
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:11,590
having people around them that they get 
along with.

75
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,050
Because you know,
if you're,

76
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,430
if the upset people,
then they upset you.

77
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:16,264
And especially if you're high in 
neuroticism and that can increase your 

78
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:21,370
anxiety.
And your pain.

79
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,653
So.
