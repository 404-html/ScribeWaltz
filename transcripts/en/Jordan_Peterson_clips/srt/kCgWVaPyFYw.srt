1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,910
Do you plan your day much or your time 
generally?

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,890
Does this lead to higher productivity?
Yes,

3
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:05,724
I planned my day obsessively.
My calendar is always absolutely full 

4
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:11,970
and often weeks in advance and my plan 
in the morning,

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,013
especially when I'm on top of things and
I plan each hour and I probably plan 

6
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:22,200
each minute and yes,
it leads to way higher productivity.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,243
You know you,
you decide what your goals are going to 

8
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:26,820
be.
You place them in the calendar.

9
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:29,910
Use the calendar as your friend day 
because what you want to do.
