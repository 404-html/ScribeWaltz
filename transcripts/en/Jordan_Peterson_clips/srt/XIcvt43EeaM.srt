1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,933
Yeah,
well a few tyrannized people badly 

2
00:00:02,291 --> 00:00:04,330
enough,
they'll actually hurt themselves to hurt

3
00:00:04,331 --> 00:00:05,164
you so you know,
they're willing to take a willing to 

4
00:00:07,901 --> 00:00:11,170
take a hit to reclaim justice,
let's say.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,180
So yeah,
that's really worth knowing.

6
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:17,020
And so one of the things that John 
Piaget pointed out and because he was,

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,213
he's a very interesting psychologist and
he's never taught properly because you 

8
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,024
know,
most of these great thinkers were very 

9
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:26,314
strange people and the strangeness Gets 
Edited Out of their stories and it's 

10
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:30,154
really too bad because they're way more 
interesting when you know how strange 

11
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,124
they were and so piaget was obsessed 
with the disjunction between religion 

12
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:42,421
and science and his goal as a thinker 
was to reconcile the two.

13
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,720
And so to some degree he was looking for
a biological basis of morality.

14
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:47,554
That might be one way of thinking about 
it or at least to reconcile the idea of 

15
00:00:49,961 --> 00:00:52,480
a biological substrate with an emergent 
morality.

16
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,430
And one of the things he said is,
okay,

17
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:56,620
imagine two systems.
All right,

18
00:00:56,621 --> 00:00:59,650
so both systems are moving towards a 
goal,

19
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,543
any old arbitrary goal and in one system
the the people within it are acting 

20
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:06,754
under compulsion and in the other system
that people within it are acting 

21
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:11,134
voluntarily said the people who are 
acting voluntarily will defeat the 

22
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:17,980
people acting under compulsion because 
in order to use compulsion,

23
00:01:17,981 --> 00:01:18,814
you have to spend a fair bit of time and
energy on force and so it makes you 

24
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:25,264
inefficient.
Whereas if everybody is together on the 

25
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,170
project,
then they'll.

26
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,820
You don't have to spend any time on 
compulsion because people are compelling

27
00:01:33,821 --> 00:01:37,090
themselves and so that's what he called 
an equilibrium state.

28
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,190
So in equilibrium state was,
well,

29
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:42,700
we sit down and we have a negotiation.
That's a real negotiation.

30
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:45,070
So it,
it has to be honest and we say,

31
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,070
okay,
well what the hell are we doing?

32
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,123
And everyone hash that out and we decide
what we're doing and then we decide how 

33
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:56,470
that would be good for all of us,
but each of us singularly as well.

34
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,810
So if you've got your family put 
together property,

35
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,003
then the whole family moves together,
but everybody inside moves ahead as 

36
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:03,844
well,
and so then everybody's pushing in the 

37
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:06,281
same,
you know,

38
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:07,114
you know how it is in a negotiation.
You actually want your interests to 

39
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:11,314
align with the interests of the other 
person because then you don't have to 

40
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:14,404
worry about the integrity of the deal.
It's like everybody has reasons to keep 

41
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:19,900
it,
to keep it thriving,

42
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:20,734
and the idea that capitalism in somehow 
is somehow is predicated on the tyranny 

43
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:26,284
of the people at the,
at the pinnacle that happens when it 

44
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:29,614
gets corrupt,
but it doesn't happen at all when it's 

45
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:36,241
working properly because deals that 
aren't based on mutual self interest and

46
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:38,134
group interests simultaneously have to 
be enforced usually with lawyers and 

47
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:42,520
then you're done,
right?

48
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,930
You're done.
At that point.
