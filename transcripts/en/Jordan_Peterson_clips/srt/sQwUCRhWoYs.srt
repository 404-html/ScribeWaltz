1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,130
Let me tell you something I learned 
about Hitler,

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,850
which really I haven't recovered from my
shock from this,

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,270
so we've been looking at the 
relationship between political belief in

4
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:10,800
personality.
Okay,

5
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:13,650
and your political belief is strongly 
determined by your temperament.

6
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:16,860
So liberal left types are high in trait,
openness,

7
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:18,840
that's creativity and low in 
conscientiousness,

8
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:19,674
but you can fragment conscientiousness 
up into industriousness and orderliness 

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,770
and the real predictor for conservatism 
is an orderliness,

10
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:27,840
not industriousness,
and you might think,

11
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:30,180
well that's no surprise,
right wingers are more orderly,

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,400
hence Hitler's call for order,
let's say,

13
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:37,320
but it's one thing to to to posit that 
and another thing to measure it.

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,403
Now it's measurable and it appears that 
orderliness is associated with 

15
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:46,140
sensitivity to discussed and this is 
actually a really big deal.

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,750
It's a really big deal.
So there's a paper that was published in

17
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:49,584
Plos one about three years ago looking 
at the relationship between the 

18
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:53,814
prevalence of infectious diseases and 
authoritarian political attitudes and 

19
00:00:57,001 --> 00:01:00,990
they did it country by country and then 
within countries by state or province,

20
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,213
and the correlation between the 
prevalence of infectious diseases and 

21
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:07,380
authoritarian slash right wing political
beliefs.

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,810
At the local individual level was point 
six,

23
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,810
and so I want to take this apart a 
little bit.

24
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,860
Okay,
so the idea is that this is part of what

25
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:17,694
you might describe as the extended 
behavioral immune system and one of the 

26
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:21,294
problems with the interactions between 
groups of human beings in our 

27
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,850
evolutionary past was,
well exactly what happened to the native

28
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:27,684
Americans is you know,
they came out and shook hands with the 

29
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:32,610
Spanish can keystone doors and then 
within a couple of generations,

30
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:35,880
90 percent of them were dead of smallpox
and measles and mumps.

31
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:36,714
And so it's been a truism in our 
evolutionary past that if you meet a 

32
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,950
group of isolated,
if you're a group of isolated humans and

33
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:46,860
you meet another group of isolated 
humans and you trade pathogens,

34
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,723
there's a real possibility that you and 
everyone you know are going to be dead 

35
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:51,324
in no time flat.
And so we have a disgust mechanism that 

36
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,900
that produces this implicit,
let's call it racist,

37
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,320
racial and ethnic bias.

38
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,900
That is part and parcel of the human 
cognitive landscape.

39
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:04,734
But the problem with that is that it's 
rooted in a disgust mechanism that 

40
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:09,240
actually serve as a protective function.
Now,

41
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,253
when I was sorting this out,
I was reading Hitler's table talk and 

42
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:14,790
Hitler's table talk is a very 
interesting book.

43
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:15,624
It's a book,
a book of his spontaneous mealtime 

44
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:19,164
utterances from 1939 to 1942.
And I went through with this new 

45
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:24,024
knowledge because people think of 
conservatives as like or fascist as 

46
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:29,100
afraid of those who are different.
They're not afraid,

47
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,790
they're disgusted and that's not the 
same thing because you burn things,

48
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:33,624
you're disgusted by.
And so it was terrifying to me to read 

49
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:38,790
it because then I also thought,
oh well disgust,

50
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,624
sensitivity is associated with 
orderliness and you need order in a 

51
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:43,074
society in order to maintain it.
And the Germans are very orderly and 

52
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:47,850
that was actually a canonical part of 
their civilization.

53
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:48,684
And part of actually what makes them 
great and powerful and that just had to 

54
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:56,040
tilt a little farther than necessary.
And all of a sudden everything needed to

55
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,780
be get cleaned.
And you know,

56
00:02:57,781 --> 00:03:00,250
Hitler talked about cleanliness all the 
time and he actually meant

57
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,650
that.
And so this thing that's emerging,

58
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:04,600
you know,
you talked about its biological basis,

59
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,550
it's evolutionary basis.
It is,

60
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:07,384
it's part of this deeply rooted disgust 
system that protects us from dangerous 

61
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:11,794
pathogens that can manifest itself in 
and does manifest itself in the 

62
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,540
political realm.
It's not good.

63
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,200
So I don't know exactly how to tease 
this apart,

64
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,034
but I agree with your point about 
there's an actual danger when 

65
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:24,334
populations meet like a literal pathogen
danger and that that is liable to have 

66
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:32,590
produced a certain instinctive fear of,
of the other,

67
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,050
which doesn't have to be limited to that
one thing,

68
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:35,884
but that's enough to generate a 
selective force that would cause a 

69
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:42,550
certain reluctance to meet.
But I want,

70
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,413
I want to point out that at least in the
West and probably universally human 

71
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:48,184
beings when they go to war,
tend to dehumanize the other population 

72
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,923
and you know,
so of course calling the other 

73
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,670
population,
subhuman,

74
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,250
vermin,
whatever it is that,

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,433
that human beings do.

76
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,483
And my concern is that we are doing 
exactly this with the Nazis are defacto 

77
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,230
Nazis who were showing up,
uh,

78
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,470
on,
uh,

79
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,363
on our screens at this point that what 
we are doing is we are comforting 

80
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:13,690
ourselves by saying,
well,

81
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:17,140
that's a small outbreak of something 
that makes these people subhuman,

82
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,510
justifies punching them or whatever.
And you know,

83
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:20,344
I'm not squeamish about there being a 
right to violence when somebody is 

84
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,150
threatening a way of life.
So it's not that.

85
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:28,984
But my concern is that if you take the 
pathogen model and you imagine that all 

86
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:37,090
those folks who showed up in 
Charlottesville that that is a contagion

87
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,983
and it needs to be isolated,
then you will have the sense that as 

88
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:40,954
long as you do that,
it's not going to show up somewhere 

89
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:44,560
else.
Whereas,

90
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:45,963
which I think the,
the actual hazard is that that's 

91
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,124
actually a latent program that has 
served populations in past 

92
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:56,350
circumstances.
It's indefensible,

93
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,243
but it has served populations and the 
populations that we come from have it 

94
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:04,510
therefore on reserve.
And when certain characteristics show up

95
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:07,120
in the environment,
that program can emerge.

96
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,940
And so my concern is that that's where 
we are in history,

97
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:13,120
can't be isolated as a phenomena that's 
associated with the other.
