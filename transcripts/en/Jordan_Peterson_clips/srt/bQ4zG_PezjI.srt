1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
I've dealt with lots of strange people 
in my life if I'm a clinical 

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:05,640
psychologist,
and that isn't to say that everyone that

3
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:07,980
I've dealt with with strange because 
that's not the case,

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,820
but I have encountered some very strange
people and you know,

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,310
the way to deal with strange people is 
to.

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,610
You never lie to a strange person.
That's the thing.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,073
Especially if they're paranoid,
you never lie to someone who's paranoid 

8
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:26,400
it.
It will come back to bite you.

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,780
And if you're in an extreme situation 
with someone who's very unpredictable,

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,120
the only thing you have that works is 
the truth that works.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,150
I'll tell you a little story.
This is in my book.

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,643
So I had this landlord in Montreal.
He lived next door to me and he was an 

13
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:43,974
ex hell's angels biker.
He'd spent a lot of time in prison and 

14
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:47,784
his wife had borderline personality 
disorder and she committed suicide when 

15
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:51,444
I lived there.

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,080
And he's a rough guy and he was at 
Quebec Quebecois and he spoke ul,

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,410
which I could hardly understand.
And,

18
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:00,870
uh,
he didn't really know what to make of me

19
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:02,370
and I didn't really know what to make of
him,

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,530
um,
but we got along,

21
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,450
you know,
I was very careful talking to him as,

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,370
as you might imagine,
but what I was,

23
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,720
it was very unwieldy.
We went over,

24
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,340
my wife and I went over there and we had
a spaghetti dinner one night and we sort

25
00:01:16,341 --> 00:01:17,174
of communicated and I bought a poster 
from him because he made these wooden 

26
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:22,110
posters that had neon on them and that's
how he made a living.

27
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:24,600
He'd kind of trained himself to be a bit
of an electronics guy.

28
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:25,434
And so we made these things and he was 
trying to quit drinking and we talked 

29
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:29,040
about that.
He was a lot older than me.

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,680
He was like 20 years older than me.
I was about 25 at this point.

31
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,880
And uh,
we got along pretty well.

32
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,920
But every now and then he'd go out and 
get a drink and he could really drink,

33
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:41,754
you know,
like he was one of these guys who could 

34
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:44,400
drink like 60 beer and you think,
well,

35
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:46,350
no one can drink that much.
And you're wrong,

36
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,550
I studied alcohol for like 10 years,
some of my subjects,

37
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:51,384
father's drank 40 ounces of vodka a day 
and had been doing it for 20 years so 

38
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:56,610
you can drink a lot and he could drink a
lot.

39
00:01:56,611 --> 00:01:58,230
And what would happen?
He was trying to,

40
00:01:58,231 --> 00:01:59,064
not drink,
but he'd go out and go on a binge and 

41
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:00,924
then he'd be gone for like three days 
and he drink up all his money and then 

42
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,563
we'd hear him out in the backyard 
howling at the moon with this little 

43
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,070
little ugly dog he had,
you know,

44
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,710
and he'd held and the dog would howl and
he'd howl and the dog would howl and,

45
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,020
and it was a rather unsettling and made 
my wife nervous.

46
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,373
And,
and,

47
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,210
and uh,
but worse,

48
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:24,721
you know,
now.

49
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:27,940
And then he'd come to the door at like 
three in the morning,

50
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:28,774
hey,
and he'd knock on the door and he'd be 

51
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:30,984
standing there.
And I don't know how much experience 

52
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:37,410
you've had with rough guys who are 
alcoholic and who are drunk,

53
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:38,244
but it's.
They can be upright and unconscious at 

54
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:45,054
the same time.
And so that was the state that he was 

55
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:47,030
in,
you know,

56
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,863
he'd be just swaying and he'd asked me 
if I would like to buy his toaster or 

57
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:55,320
his microwave because he needed some 
money to keep drinking and you know,

58
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:58,230
I didn't really want to buy his toaster,
whereas microwave.

59
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:03,231
But when the x Hell's Angel Jew,
all speaking 60 beard,

60
00:03:03,631 --> 00:03:04,464
drunk Quebecois biker shows up at your 
door at three in the morning and offers 

61
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:10,780
you to sell offers to sell you his 
microwave.

62
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,950
The easiest thing is to say I really 
need a microwave.

63
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,970
So,
so,

64
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:21,804
you know,
I bought the microwave and toaster and 

65
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,550
some other things.
But then.

66
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,430
But then my wife talked to me and she 
liked my landlord,

67
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:35,650
you know,
even though she was afraid of him,

68
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:39,270
she liked him and she said,
you can't buy any more,

69
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,670
any more appliances because it's not 
good for him.

70
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,130
And I thought,
Huh,

71
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,490
that's an interesting problem.
You know,

72
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,530
so what the hell am I going to do about 
this?

73
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,364
Because no,
I don't want to buy your microwave just 

74
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:56,080
doesn't seem to be the right answer at 
three in the morning.

75
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,333
So.
So one time he took me out on his 

76
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,240
sevenfifty Honda and he put me on the 
back of it.

77
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,103
He wanted to show me his layer,
I guess his hangouts and I got his 

78
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:10,120
wife's helmet on,
but it didn't fit it just sit on the top

79
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:15,121
of my head and he said,
I go to the bike and he said if the cops

80
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,560
chase us,
we're not stopping.

81
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,910
And then away we went and we went to 
these,

82
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:24,480
like these bars downtown on sending the 
wrong.

83
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,330
They were very rough places and you got 
into like four fights that night because

84
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,830
he was a rough guy,
you know,

85
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:30,664
and these kind of punk guys would come 
up to them and sort of challenge them 

86
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:34,264
and act stupidly around him.
And he was very skeptical and if you 

87
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:39,070
were acting stupidly around him for any 
length of time,

88
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,920
he just hit you because he felt that 
that's what you deserved.

89
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:43,820
And perhaps he was right,
you know,

90
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,683
so.
So I had a firsthand opportunity to 

91
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:48,910
observe him.
So anyways,

92
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:49,744
he sure enough,
about a week or two after we had this 

93
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,670
conversation,
he showed up at the door,

94
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,361
knock,
knock,

95
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,194
knock,
you know,

96
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,740
open the door,
standing there with his eyes,

97
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,430
half closed and he was swaying and he 
had,

98
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,500
I don't remember what the appliance was 
this time,

99
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,040
but he wanted to sell it to me and I 
said,

100
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,470
I'm not Paul.

101
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,120
I can buy this.
I'm not going to buy this because I know

102
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,900
you're trying to quit drinking and if I 
give you this money then you're going to

103
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,090
go and drink it up and it's not going to
be good for you.

104
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:21,924
And what else did I tell them?
I think I told him as well that this 

105
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:28,464
whole thing of him coming to my house at
like two in the morning was scaring my 

106
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:34,650
wife who he liked and that it had to 
stop and believe me,

107
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:35,484
man,
I was thinking about what I was saying 

108
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,483
because he was watching me like a rough 
guy watches you and a rough guy watches 

109
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:43,644
you like this.
He thinks if you say one thing that 

110
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:51,300
indicates contempt,
you're going to bloody well paid for it.

111
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,760
And so I was finding my words like,
you know,

112
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,080
I was crossing a swamp and trying to 
look for the,

113
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,180
for the rocks underneath the surface.

114
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,420
And I said what I had to say very,
very carefully.

115
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,523
And he looked at me for about 15 seconds
and that's a long time to be locked out 

116
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,523
at three in the morning and he left and 
he never came back to sell me anything 

117
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:17,690
again.
And we got along fine.

118
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,303
But that's a good illustration of this 
issue with regards to truth and success 

119
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:30,290
in the strange land.
Because I was in the strange land when I

120
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:35,150
was talking to my neighbor,
my landlord than.

121
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,040
And I managed to say what was true 
carefully enough.

122
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:40,874
So despite the fact that he was a very 
violent person and that he was a very 

123
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:45,944
intoxicated person.
And then he had every reason to be 

124
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:49,184
suspicious of me and we couldn't 
communicate very well and I didn't do 

125
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:53,234
what he wanted.
That he took it and he left and there 

126
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:02,270
was no problem.
And life went on just fine after that.

127
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:08,170
And so we don't want to underestimate 
the utility of establishing this bounded

128
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:15,461
relationship with the ideal and 
attempting to live with some nobility in

129
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:20,570
truth will aiming at the highest ideal.
There's nothing about that.

130
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,880
That's anything but strengthening and 
positive,

131
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,393
and it's exactly what you need to set 
against the catastrophe and uncertainty 

132
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:33,944
of life.
