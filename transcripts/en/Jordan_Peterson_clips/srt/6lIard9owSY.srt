1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
And the sons of Noah,
they went forth of the Ark were shem and

2
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:07,950
ham and Japheth and ham is the father of
Canaan.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,750
These are the three sons of Noah and of 
them was the whole earth.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,960
Overspread and Noah began to be a hud,
husbands men,

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,940
and he planted a vineyard and he drank 
of the wine and was drunk,

6
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:24,210
and he was uncovered within his tent and
Ham.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,103
The father of Canaan saw the nakedness 
of his father and told his two brethren 

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,180
without friends,
Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid

9
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:34,014
upon both their shoulders and went 
backward and covered the nakedness of 

10
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:37,284
their father.
And their faces were backward and they 

11
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:39,714
saw not their father's nakedness.
And Noah awoke from his wine and knew 

12
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:46,230
what his younger son had done unto him.
And he said,

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,870
curse it to be Canaan.
A servant of servants,

14
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:53,450
shall he be unto his brethren.
And he said,

15
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:55,850
blessed shall be the Lord God of 
chairman.

16
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:59,360
Canaan shall be his servant and God 
shall enlarge Japheth.

17
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:02,690
And he shall dwell in the tents of Shem 
and Canaan be his servant.

18
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,723
And no one lived after the flood,
350 years and all the days of Noah were 

19
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:09,470
950 years and he died

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,930
and the whole earth was of one language 
and of one speech.

21
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,140
Okay.
So I remember thinking about this story,

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,750
it's got to be 30 years ago

23
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,230
and I think the meaning of the story 
stood out for me.

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,070
Sometimes when you read complicated 
material,

25
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:33,904
sometimes a piece of it will stand out.
It's for some reason it's like it 

26
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,743
glitters.
I suppose that might be one way of 

27
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,190
thinking about it.
It's it,

28
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,213
it,
you're in sync with it and you can 

29
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:45,730
understand what it means.
I've really experienced that reading the

30
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,550
Tao Te Ching,
which is document I would really like to

31
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:52,480
do a lecture on at some point because 
some of the verses I don't understand,

32
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:54,640
but others stand right out and I can 
understand them.

33
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:57,430
And I think I understood what this part 
of the story of no amount.

34
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:59,260
And I think it means,
you know,

35
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,800
we talked a little bit about what 
nakedness meant in the story of Adam and

36
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:03,634
eve.
And the idea essentially was that to 

37
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:10,360
know yourself naked is to become aware 
of your vulnerability,

38
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,593
the physical,
your physical boundaries in time and 

39
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:15,730
space,
and your,

40
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,120
your,
your physiological,

41
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,433
your fundamental physiological 
insufficiencies as they make might be 

42
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:24,340
judged by others.

43
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,173
So there's biological insufficiency 
that's sort of built into you because 

44
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:28,444
you're a fragile mortal,
vulnerable half insane creature and 

45
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,760
that's,
that's just an existential truth.

46
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:38,110
And then of course,
even merely as a human being,

47
00:02:38,111 --> 00:02:38,944
even with all those faults,
there are faults that you have that are 

48
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:45,160
particular to you that might be judged 
harshly by the group while might be,

49
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:47,920
we'll definitely be judged harshly by 
the group.

50
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,470
And so to become aware of your nakedness
is to become self conscious and,

51
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,640
and to,
and to,

52
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,670
to know your limits and to know your 
vulnerability.

53
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:59,671
And that's what is revealed to when he 
comes across his father naked.

54
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:03,160
It's.
So the question is,

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,250
what does it mean to see your father 
naked?

56
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:07,923
And it seems to me,
and especially in an inappropriate 

57
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:10,630
manner like this,
it,

58
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:11,903
it,
it,

59
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,880
it's,
it's,

60
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,773
it's as if ham,
he does the same thing that happens in 

61
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:19,954
the Mesopotamian creation myth when when
timeout an absolute give rise to the 

62
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:25,024
first God's there,
they're the father of the eventual 

63
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,053
deity,
of,

64
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,120
of redemption,
Marduk there are very careless and noisy

65
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:34,954
and the kill app,
their father and attempt to inhabit his 

66
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:38,740
corpse.

67
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,573
And that makes timeout enraged.
And so she bursts forth from the 

68
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:45,100
darkness to,
to do the men.

69
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:49,060
It's like a precursor to the flood story
or an analog to the flood story.

70
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,930
And I see the same thing happening here 
with him is that he's,

71
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,960
he's insufficiently respectful of his 
father.

72
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,350
And the question is exactly what does 
the farther represent.

73
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:00,250
And you can say,
well there's,

74
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,413
there's,
there's the father that you have and 

75
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,930
that's a human being.
That's,

76
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:07,300
that's a man like other men,
a man among men.

77
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,810
But then there's the father as such.
And that's the spirit of the father.

78
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:14,830
And in so far as you have a father,
you have both at the same time.

79
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:19,420
You have the personal father that's a 
man among other men,

80
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,980
just like anyone else,
there's father,

81
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:23,890
but in so far as that man is your 
father,

82
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:24,724
that means that he's something different
than just another person and what he is 

83
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:33,121
is the incarnation of the spirit of the 
father and to see that,

84
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,350
to take it to what to disrespect that 
carelessly.

85
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,810
Maybe even like no,
it makes a mistake,

86
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:41,644
right?
He produces wine and gets himself drunk 

87
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:45,940
and you might say,
well,

88
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,580
you know,
if he sprawled out there for everyone to

89
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:49,414
see,
it's hardly hams fault if he stumbles 

90
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:51,334
across it,
but the book is laying out a danger and 

91
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,370
the danger is that,
well,

92
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,233
maybe you catch your father at his most 
vulnerable moment and if you're 

93
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,523
disrespectful then you transgress 
against the spirit of the father and if 

94
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:10,870
you transgress against the spirit of 
father and lose the spirit of the father

95
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:13,090
and lose respect for the spirit of the 
father,

96
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,440
then that is likely to transform you 
into a slave.

97
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,580
That's a very interesting idea and I 
think it's particularly interesting.

98
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,490
Maybe not particularly interesting,
but it's.

99
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,683
It's particularly Germane.
I think to our current cultural 

100
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:28,834
situation,
because I think that were pushed 

101
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,920
constantly to see the nakedness of our 
father,

102
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:34,754
so to speak,
because of the intense criticism that's 

103
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,630
directed towards our culture and the 
patriarchal culture,

104
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:44,464
so to speak.

105
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:45,963
We're constantly exposing its weaknesses
and vulnerabilities and let's say 

106
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:53,050
nakedness and there's nothing wrong with
criticism,

107
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:53,884
but the thing about criticism is the 
purpose of criticism is to separate the 

108
00:05:57,081 --> 00:05:57,914
wheat from the chaff.
It's not the burn everything to the 

109
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:01,190
ground,
right?

110
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:02,030
It's to say,
well,

111
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,750
we're going to carefully look at this.
We're going to carefully differentiate.

112
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:08,570
We're going to keep what's good and 
we're gonna move away from what's bad,

113
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:12,380
but the point of the criticism isn't to 
identify everything is bad.

114
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:13,214
It's two separate.
What's good from what's bad so that you 

115
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:16,394
can retain what's good and move towards 
it and to be careless at that is deadly 

116
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:25,190
because you inhabited by the spirit of 
the father.

117
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,053
Right?
In so far as you're a cultural 

118
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:29,140
construction,
which of course is something that the.

119
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,383
That the postmodern,
Neo Marxists are absolutely in phatic 

120
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:36,110
about.
You're a cultural construction in so far

121
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:36,944
as you're a cultural construction than 
your inhabited by the spirit of the 

122
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,124
father and to be disrespectful towards 
that means to undermine the very 

123
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:47,480
structure that makes you not all of what
you are.

124
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,610
Certainly certainly not all of what you 
are,

125
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:50,444
but a good portion of what you are in so
far as you're a socialized cultural 

126
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:54,854
entity and if you pull out the.
If you pull the foundation out from 

127
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:01,460
underneath that,
what do you have left?

128
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,750
You can hardly manage on your own.
You know,

129
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,683
it's just not possible.
You're a cultural creation and so hamm 

130
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:11,114
makes this desperate error and is 
careless about exposing himself to the 

131
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:19,850
vulnerability of his father.
Something like that.

132
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:20,684
He does it without sufficient respect 
and the judgment is that not only will 

133
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:29,300
he be a slave but so will all of his 
descendants and he's contrasted with the

134
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:30,134
other two sons who I suppose are willing
to give their father the benefit of the 

135
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:35,750
doubt.
Something like that.

136
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,630
And so when they see him in a 
compromising position,

137
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,100
they handle it with respect and,
and,

138
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,480
and don't capitalize on it.
And maybe that makes them strong.

139
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,853
That's what it seems to me.
And so I think that's what that story 

140
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:52,244
means.
