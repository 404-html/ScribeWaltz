1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,923
I've been telling people online in 
various ways in the lectures that they 

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:04,584
should start fixing up the world by 
cleaning up the room and I wanted to 

3
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:11,760
just elaborate on that a little bit 
before I get back to the lecture itself.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,170
So I'd say it's become this Internet 
weird Internet meme,

5
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:18,150
you know,
and,

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,270
and,
and it's a joke and good.

7
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,104
It's a jewel.
I really happy about the fact that so 

8
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:24,954
much of this has got the leaving of 
humor and it's really important because 

9
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:30,420
that's what stops things from 
degenerating into,

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,733
into conflict humor.
And I was thinking about this idea of 

11
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:35,574
cleaning up your room in relationship to
the mustard seed idea and you see the 

12
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:39,534
thing about cleaning up your room.
This is also something I learned from 

13
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:46,050
Carl young and his studies on alchemy 
because for young,

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,260
when the alchemist was attempting to 
make the philosopher's stone,

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,290
he was not only engaged in the 
transformation of the material world,

16
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:57,291
but he was engaged in a process of self 
transformation that occurred at the same

17
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:58,980
time as the chemical transformation.

18
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,990
So it was a psychological work in some 
sense.

19
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,063
Let's say you want to sort out your room
and beautified because the beauty is 

20
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:05,544
also important and let's say that all 
you have is just a little room like 

21
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:08,754
you're not rich,
you're poor and you don't have any 

22
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:11,730
power.
That's another thing,

23
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:15,120
but you've got your damn room and you've
got this space right in front of you.

24
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:15,954
You know that,
that that's a part of the cosmos that 

25
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:20,430
you can come to grips with and you might
think,

26
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:21,264
well,
what's there in front of you right in 

27
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:23,004
front of you?
And the answer to that is it depends on 

28
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:25,314
how open your eyes are.
That's the proper answer because you 

29
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:30,240
could say,
and William Blake said this,

30
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,103
for example,
Aldous Huxley made comments that were 

31
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:35,220
very similar that in a transcendent 
state,

32
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,920
you can see infinity in the finite and 
you might say,

33
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:38,754
well,
you can say if you can see infinity in 

34
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:42,060
what you have within your grasp.

35
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,710
If you look and you could save,
maybe that's the case with your room and

36
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,150
so you want to clean up your room.
Well,

37
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,710
okay,
how do you do that?

38
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:51,090
Exactly?
Well,

39
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:51,924
a room,
his room is a place to sleep and so if 

40
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:55,344
you set your room up properly,
then you figure out how to sleep and 

41
00:01:57,271 --> 00:01:58,104
when you should sleep and how you should
sleep and then you figure out when you 

42
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:01,674
should wake up and then you figure out,
well what clothes you should wear 

43
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,520
because they have to be arranged 
properly in your dresser.

44
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:07,350
And then you have to have some place to 
put your clothes.

45
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:08,520
And if you're going to have some 
clothes,

46
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:09,410
you have to figure out what you're 
gonna.

47
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,730
Wear those clothes to do.
Right,

48
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,683
and then that means you have to figure 
out what you're going to do and then 

49
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:15,354
your room has to serve that purpose 
because otherwise it doesn't set up 

50
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:18,150
properly.

51
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,170
And if it doesn't set up,
if it doesn't serve your purposes,

52
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,930
you will be unhappy and not happy in the
room.

53
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:29,931
Because the way that we perceive the 
world is as a place to move from point a

54
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:31,164
to point B in.
And then if the place that we're in 

55
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:37,080
facilitates that movement,
then we're happy to be there.

56
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,160
And if the place that we're in serves as
an obstacle to that movement,

57
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,000
then we're unhappy to be there.
And so what it means to set up your room

58
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:48,030
is that you have to have somewhere to go
that's worthwhile,

59
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:48,864
or you can set up your room and your 
room has to be set up to facilitate 

60
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,490
that.
And then the next thing is,

61
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:55,290
well,
maybe you have to make it beautiful,

62
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,580
but that's not easy,
right?

63
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:59,100
That means you have to have some taste 
and that doesn't.

64
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,100
You have to have money.

65
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,730
It doesn't.
Because you can be garish with money and

66
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:04,564
you can be tasteful with nothing.
All you need is taste and taste beats 

67
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:09,820
money.
When it comes to beautifying things,

68
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:11,830
you know,
I mean not that money is trivial because

69
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:13,420
it's not.
The taste is crucial.

70
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:14,254
And people who are very artistically 
oriented can make beautiful things out 

71
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:19,660
of virtually nothing.
And not only that,

72
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:22,810
the literature suggests that if you're 
going to make beautiful things,

73
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,290
putting real constraints on,
on what you allow yourself to do,

74
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,290
facilitates creativity instead of 
interfering with it.

75
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,320
Because let's say you have to make 
something out of nothing,

76
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,930
right?
Which I suppose would be a Godly Act,

77
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:35,764
right?
You have to make something out of 

78
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:37,594
nothing.
You have to be creative in order to do 

79
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:39,934
that,
and so then to beautify your room means 

80
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:43,834
that you also have to develop your 
capacity to be creative and so then you 

81
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:47,254
can make your room shine,
but then what will happen is that if 

82
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:53,950
your family isn't together,
they will interfere with that.

83
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,933
You'll interfere with that because you 
won't have the discipline to do it 

84
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:59,470
properly,
but then when you start building this,

85
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,070
this,
this little microcosm of perfection with

86
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:03,904
what you have at hand and it'll evoke 
all the pathologies of everyone in your 

87
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,190
household,
but wonder what the hell you're up to in

88
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:12,520
there and they won't necessarily be 
happy because if you're.

89
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,740
If they're in a lowly place,
let's say,

90
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:16,750
and so are you and you're trying to move
out of that,

91
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,793
then the higher you move out of that,
the more the place they're in looks bad 

92
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,571
and you might say,
well,

93
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:26,080
what they should do is celebrate your 
victory over chaos and evil,

94
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:26,914
but that isn't what will happen.
What will happen instead is that they 

95
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,750
will attempt to pull you back down.
They'll attempt to.

96
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,480
I mean obviously all families don't do 
that,

97
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:35,314
but,
but all families do that to some degree 

98
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:40,330
and some families do almost nothing but 
that.

99
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,230
And so what that means is that if you're
going to organize your room,

100
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,513
then you're going to have to confront 
the devils in your house and that's 

101
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:48,724
often.
That's often a terrifying thing because 

102
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:53,890
some of those devils have have lineages 
that go back many,

103
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:56,770
many,
many generations and God only knows what

104
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:58,990
you have to struggle with in order to 
overcome that.

105
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,680
And so and so to sort yourself out into 
fix up your room is a nontrivial matter.

106
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:06,610
You know,
and you,

107
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,603
you can do that.
You'll learn by doing that and then 

108
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:10,564
maybe you'll learn enough by doing that 
so that you can fix up your family a 

109
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,800
little bit,
and then having done that,

110
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:15,840
you'll have enough characters.
