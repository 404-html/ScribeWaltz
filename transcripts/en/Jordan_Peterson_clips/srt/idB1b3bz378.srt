1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,133
Many of you,
I presume have seen breaking bad and 

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:04,483
that's a really good example of the of 
the incorporation at least in part or 

3
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:12,000
maybe the possession by the shadow from 
the Union perspective,

4
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:12,834
right?
Because you have this ordinary high 

5
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:18,000
school teacher who really thinks that 
he's an ax and his family as well.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,730
You know,
like your typical persona,

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,250
roughly speaking,
he's just a normal guy,

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,060
but part of the reason that he's a 
normal guy is because he actually hasn't

9
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:27,894
been put in abnormal circumstances and 
then all of a sudden he is and he has a 

10
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,160
genuine moral conundrum.
Right?

11
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:34,560
He's going to die of lung cancer and 
his.

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,453
He has a son who's got a lot of health 
problems and he's terrified that he's 

13
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:40,674
going to leave his wife and his child 
behind with nothing and then of course 

14
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,144
as the story and so he decides to do 
something that temporarily that he 

15
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:49,344
regards as what they would normally 
regard as reprehensible and of course 

16
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,330
you just gets tangled up in that.

17
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,940
But then as the story unfolds,
you see that there's.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,480
It's more complicated because it's not 
that he was just innocent.

19
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:01,314
Good guy and he decided to turn bad.
He's also very resentful and angry and 

20
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:06,054
it's partly because he's a bit of a 
pushover at the beginning or maybe more 

21
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:10,883
than a bit of a pushover and also that 
he didn't really fulfill his own 

22
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:13,560
potential and that,
you know,

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,423
he,
he had friends who walked down the 

24
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:21,210
entrepreneurial path and maybe they 
weren't quite fair to him,

25
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:24,720
but whatever,
he ends up not very successful as a high

26
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:26,670
school teacher.
So he's really angry about that.

27
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:27,504
And so there's more motivation for him 
opening up the door to the terrible 

28
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:33,174
elements of his personality than just 
the fact that he's got good motivations 

29
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:39,060
to do so and that,
that unfolds,

30
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:39,894
you know,
and so he would see that warps and 

31
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:42,294
twists and is resentful.
Character increasingly manifest 

32
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:48,870
themselves as he walks down this road to
really total brutality.

33
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,750
And it,
it's,

34
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,970
it's,
it's quite good.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,833
Um,
there's a book called ordinary men 

36
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:56,970
that's a lot like that.
I don't think I've mentioned that to you

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,400
before,
but ordinary men is a book about.

38
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,150
It's the best book of it's type.
Maybe it's the only book of its type.

39
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,190
It's possible,
but it's plotted,

40
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,024
much like breaking bad in some sense.
It's a story about these German 

41
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:10,494
policemen in early stages of World War 
II and they were guys who were old 

42
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:20,661
enough to be raised in Germany really 
before the hitlarian propaganda came out

43
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:21,810
in full force,
you know,

44
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:23,860
if you were a teenager,
say in the 1930,

45
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,703
so you were going to be pulled right 
into the propaganda machine and maybe 

46
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:29,010
you were part of the Hitler youth and 
like you were raised in that,

47
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:29,844
you know,
but if you were older than you were 

48
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:35,790
raised before that and you're not as 
amenable to propaganda once you're older

49
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:36,420
than a boat.

50
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,570
While I would say about 22 or something 
like that.

51
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:41,370
It's,
it's pretty young actually.

52
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,533
If you're gonna make a soldier,
you have to get a soldier young because 

53
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:47,850
once people are in their early twenties,
say they're kind of.

54
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,890
They already have their personality 
developed.

55
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,203
Anyways.
These policemen were sent into Poland 

56
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:57,210
after the Germans marched through and 
uh,

57
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,823
you know,
it was war time and there is this 

58
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:04,150
hypothesis in Germany that the Jews in 
particular,

59
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:04,984
we're operating as a fifth column and 
undermining the German war effort 

60
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,104
because of course the Germans blame the 
Jews and a variety of other people for 

61
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:14,350
actually setting up the conditions that 
made the war necessary.

62
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:16,360
And so when the police were sent into 
Poland,

63
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,380
they were also required to make peace 
roughly speaking.

64
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:21,214
And so they started up by.
They started out by rounding up all the 

65
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,330
Jewish men between 18 and 65 and 
gathering them in,

66
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,880
in stadiums and then shipping them off 
on the trains.

67
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,310
But that isn't where they ended.
They ended in,

68
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,230
in very,
very dark place.

69
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:36,064
I mean,
these guys were going out in the field 

70
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:38,794
with naked pregnant women and shooting 
them in the back of the head by the end 

71
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,990
of their training.
And what's really interesting about that

72
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:44,824
is that is that their commander told 
them that they could go home at any 

73
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,400
time.
So this is,

74
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,263
this is not one of those examples of 
people following orders and the reason 

75
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:57,640
they didn't,
roughly speaking,

76
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:58,474
there's many reasons,
but one of the reasons they didn't is 

77
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:02,320
because they didn't think it was 
comradely,

78
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,380
so to speak,
to leave there,

79
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,570
the guys they were working with to do 
all the dirty work and run off,

80
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,140
you know.
And that's really,

81
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,320
that's really an interesting fact,
you know,

82
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:14,020
because you're in different 
circumstances,

83
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,090
you wouldn't think about that as 
reprehensible,

84
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,871
right?
You'd think,

85
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:17,704
well that's part of teamwork and under 
rough circumstances and that's at least 

86
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:22,534
in part how they viewed it.
And they were also made physically ill 

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,833
multiple times physically and 
psychologically ill by the things that 

88
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,730
they had to do,
but they kept doing them anyways.

89
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,283
So it's one step at a time.
And that's the thing is that you end up 

90
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:39,580
in very bad places one step at a time.
So you gotta watch those steps.
