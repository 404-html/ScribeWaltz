00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
There's a chapter in my book called 
don't ever don't let your children do 

2
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:08,250
anything that makes you dislike them and
I'm pretty happy about this chapter,

3
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:13,251
although I suspect it will be rather 
controversial and it's predicated on the

4
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:18,270
observation that many people hurt their 
children physically and psychologically,

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,633
you know,
because everyone gets sentimental about 

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,740
the relationship between parents and 
children.

7
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:26,640
But that's especially in relationship to
themselves because they think,

8
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:27,720
well,
you know,

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,613
of course I'm going to be a good parent.
It's like it's not so bloody obvious 

10
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:33,720
that you're going to be a good parent.
You know,

11
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:34,554
and so,
and then what I see happening with 

12
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:37,464
people who don't know how to discipline 
their children is that the children run 

13
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:41,724
roughshod over them in their,
let's call them a hierarchical disputes 

14
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,374
because children push for position and 
hierarchy and they do that behaviorally 

15
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:52,170
to sort of feel out the contours of the 
social structure.

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,560
So you know your kid locked perfectly 
fine at home,

17
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:56,394
let's say at the dinner table,
but then you take them to a stranger's 

18
00:00:58,651 --> 00:00:59,484
dinner table and all of a sudden they 
act out and you think what's up with 

19
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:02,784
you,
your little monster and what's up is 

20
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:07,280
that they're trying to figure out what 
the power structure is in the new.

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,200
They don't know this of course,
but they're acting this out there trying

22
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:11,034
to figure out if the same rules apply in
this new situation as apply in the old 

23
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:18,630
situation and they can't ask that and 
they don't even know that they are rules

24
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:23,250
exactly there regularities that they've 
learned and so they'll test and test and

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,810
then you have to show them that.
Yeah,

26
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,480
it's the same here.
It's the same in this situation,

27
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,010
but lots of parents are very uneasy with
disciplining their children.

28
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:32,844
Partly because there they believe that 
if you give a child infinite freedom 

29
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,850
that's best for them and that 
constraints are inappropriate,

30
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:40,260
which is really just.

31
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,603
Well,
I don't know what to say about that 

32
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:43,314
except it's so untrue that that it's 
very difficult to think of anything 

33
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:49,430
that's more untreated now,
but also the thing is,

34
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:51,570
is if you let your children take 
advantage of you,

35
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,620
if you have an ounce of spine and an 
ounce of aggression,

36
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:59,100
which you do,
especially if you don't admit it,

37
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,620
then you will take revenge on your 
children.

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,033
You know,
so if they have a temper tantrum in a 

39
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:06,570
grocery store and embarrass you,
which Gerald,

40
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:08,490
who's can,
he can do quite effectively,

41
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,743
you know,
because you wouldn't let them have that 

42
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:14,700
pack of crayons or a chocolate bar and 
then you know you,

43
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,920
you tell yourself it's okay and that you
still,

44
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,950
you know that that really didn't make 
you that angry and it's okay,

45
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:20,784
but you're fuming inside and then you go
home and half an hour later maybe the 

46
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,760
child is doing some interesting little 
bit of work,

47
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,653
maybe artwork or something or does 
something good and comes up for a 

48
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:30,480
reward.

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,313
It's like the probability that you're 
going to reward that child properly 

50
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:36,150
under those circumstances,
zero.

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,090
You're going to take the opportunity to 
take your revenge,

52
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,030
and if you don't know that,
then you're not much of the parent.

53
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,133
And so part of the trick with kids is 
that if your child is doing something 

54
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:49,224
that makes you dislike them,
that you have to figure out how to stop 

55
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:53,430
them from doing that and teach them how 
to do it properly.

56
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:56,580
And you have to talk to your wife to 
make sure that you're not being too much

57
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:57,780
of a monster,
you know?

58
00:02:57,781 --> 00:02:58,620
And the same with her.
