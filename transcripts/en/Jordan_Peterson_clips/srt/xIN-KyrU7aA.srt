1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,013
The radical left leaning anti theist 
environmentalists tend to make the case 

2
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:08,754
that the predations of the Western 
capitalist system are a consequence of 

3
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:15,234
the injunction that was delivered in 
Genesis by God to man to go out and 

4
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:24,600
dominate the earth.
David Suzuki has talked a lot about this

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,463
by the way.
They believe that that statement has 

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,233
given rise to our inappropriate 
assumption that we have the right to 

7
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:35,874
exert control over the world and that 
that's what's turned us into these 

8
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,163
terrible predatory monsters sometimes 
described as counselors on the face of 

9
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:45,414
the earth or viruses that have inhabited
the entire ecosystem who are doing 

10
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:52,920
nothing but one wandering everywhere and
wreaking havoc as rapidly as we possibly

11
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:53,754
can,
which is another perspective on the 

12
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,490
essential element of humankind that I 
find absolutely deplorable.

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,410
I mean,
if you look at the historical record,

14
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:06,060
for example,
even casually,

15
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,690
you'll find out that as early as,
as late as the late 18 hundreds,

16
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:10,530
18,
95,

17
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:12,120
thereabouts,
Thomas Huxley,

18
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,360
who was Elvis Huxley's grandfather and a
great defender of Darwin,

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,433
prepared a report for the British 
government on ocean sustainability and 

20
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:23,550
his conclusion was fish away.

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,370
Guys.
Man,

22
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,203
there are so many fish out there.
The oceans are so inexhaustible that no 

23
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:31,620
matter how hard humanity tried for,
for any number of years,

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,633
the probability that we could do more 
than put a dent in what was out there 

25
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:38,700
was zero.
Now Huxley turned out to be wrong.

26
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,760
He didn't realize that our population 
was going to spike so dramatically,

27
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:42,594
partly because we got a little bit rich 
and our children's stopped dying at the 

28
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:48,970
rate of 60 percent before they were one 
years old and you know,

29
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,650
we actually managed to populate the 
earth with a few people,

30
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:53,484
but it wasn't really until 1960 or so 
that we woke up to the fact that there 

31
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:57,144
were so many of us that we actually had 
to start paying attention to what we 

32
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:02,460
were doing to the planet.
And that's like what 50 years ago?

33
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:03,294
Well,
we've just started to develop the 

34
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,143
technology,
have the wherewithal to understand that 

35
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,383
the whole world might be well considered
a garden and we need to live inside the 

36
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:16,170
proper balance between culture and order
or culture and,

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,880
and,
and chaos.

38
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,553
Before that we were spending all of our 
time just trying not to die and usually 

39
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:24,714
very unsuccessfully,
so I don't agree with that 

40
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:30,780
interpretation of the opening section of
Genesis.

41
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:31,614
I don't believe that it's given human 
being has the right to act as super 

42
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:35,994
predators on the planet.
I think that instead the proper 

43
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,180
environment for human beings is 
presented quite properly as a garden and

44
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:45,150
that the role of people and that's 
explicitly stated in,

45
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,063
in the second story of Adam and Eve was 
to tend the garden and that means to 

46
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:51,024
make the proper decisions and to make 
sure that everything thrives and 

47
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:54,084
flourishes and and so that it's good for
the things that are living there that 

48
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:59,040
aren't just people,
but also good for the people too.

49
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,670
So fine.
I think we can.

50
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,623
We could least note that that's a 
slightly different take on the story 

51
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:06,484
than the that ultimately cynical 
interpretation that's so commonly put 

52
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,624
forward today.
