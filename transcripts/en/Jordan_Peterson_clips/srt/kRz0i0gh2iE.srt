1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,590
Just one or two questions I have a gay 
male.

2
00:00:05,591 --> 00:00:07,100
I want to say thank you for speaking the
truth.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,233
Absolutely ballistic.
The next two questions I want to get 

4
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:15,184
your social contract and the safe space 
that university I turned to push on us 

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,483
as well as what your view on this whole 
white privilege thing is that 

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,820
universities like unt Rogerson,
Gail,

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,900
all these other universities in terms of
crandall?

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,953
No.
I think the idea of white privilege is 

9
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:34,320
absolutely reprehensible

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,260
and it's not because people aren't 
traveling.

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,943
You know we have all sorts of privileges
and most people have privileges of all 

12
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:43,844
sorts and you should be grateful for 
your privileges and work to deserve 

13
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:46,994
them,
I would say,

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,193
but the idea that you can target an 
ethnic group with a collective crime 

15
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,623
regardless of the specific innocence or 
guilt of the constituent elements of 

16
00:00:56,871 --> 00:00:57,704
that group.
There is absolutely nothing that's more 

17
00:00:59,451 --> 00:01:01,780
racist than not.
It's absolutely

18
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,960
boring.
I can't.

19
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,913
You're not.

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,953
If you.
If you really want to know more about 

21
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:14,640
that sort of thing,
you should read about the Kulaks in the.

22
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,610
In the Soviet Union,
in the 19 twenties,

23
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:17,810
k,
U L A,

24
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,190
k,
s because they were.

25
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,740
They were farmers who were very 
productive.

26
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,940
They were the most productive element of
the agricultural strata in,

27
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,823
in Russia,
and they were virtually all killed or 

28
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:30,014
raped and robbed by the collectivists 
who insisted that because they showed 

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,353
signs.
