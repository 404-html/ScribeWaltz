1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,300
You know there,
there's,

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,380
there's good study published recently 
showing that six month old infants,

3
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:06,214
I think it was six month,
are already showing fear of snakes and 

4
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:12,430
spiders and that's before they've been 
exposed to them,

5
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:16,180
so there's not an argument about amongst
psychologist for a long time,

6
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:17,014
whether fears were only learned.
Thought would be the behavioral 

7
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:23,320
perspective,
whether you're prepared to learn certain

8
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:24,154
fears,
which is sort of a mediator between the 

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,913
behavioral perspective and a perspective
that takes into account inherited 

10
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:31,414
structures or whether they're actually 
innate and the evidence keeps accruing 

11
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:40,060
that some of these fundamental fears are
innate and that's a very strange thing.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,960
More more hardware than firmware,
if exactly that.

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,080
Exactly.
Well and metaphor and I mean the,

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,480
the,
the archetypes,

15
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:51,960
the symbolic representations we have say
of Reptilian predators.

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,050
Dragon in particular are very,
very deep.

17
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:58,050
That dragon is a symbol that you find 
everywhere in the world.

18
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:00,210
There was a good book written about that
recently.

19
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:03,210
Actually.
I'm the guy who wrote the book,

20
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:04,044
whose name I can't remember,
unfortunately thought that a dragon was 

21
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:08,034
a cat snake bird and so well on.
So because the major predators of of 

22
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,130
tree dwelling primates are predatory 
cats,

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,680
snakes and wrap doors,

24
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,750
right?
And Keyword.

25
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,310
There's,
in my opinion,

26
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,470
the way I'm interpreting it is tree 
dwelling.

27
00:01:24,471 --> 00:01:26,810
Like that's how far back $6.
Million

28
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,230
nears least.
Yeah.

29
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,750
So on that.
So at least $60,

30
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:31,670
million years.
It could,

31
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,550
it could be longer than that,
but snakes and human beings,

32
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,670
snakes and the ancestors of human beings
co evolved.

33
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,973
And Lynn is.
Bell has demonstrated that down and you 

34
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:45,730
know she's a,
she's a scientist and in with,

35
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,743
in the California state system,
I think she's at Ucla and she was very 

36
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:53,420
interested in white human beings have 
such a cute vision.

37
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:54,254
And so she did a study looking at the 
relationship between primate acuity of 

38
00:01:58,821 --> 00:01:59,654
primate vision and presence of predatory
snakes and found a pretty powerful 

39
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:03,770
relationship.
And so.

40
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,510
And we can really detect snake like a 
camouflage patterns,

41
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:10,850
particularly in the lower half of our 
visual field.

42
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,440
And so yeah,
these things are.

43
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,300
See the way it looks to me is that we 
develop this Predator detection system,

44
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:20,030
right?
What's in the unknown Predator?

45
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,850
What's the Predator?
It's a cat snake bird,

46
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,100
which is exactly what it is.
Right,

47
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:25,791
and you think,
well,

48
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:26,830
that's not a category.
It's.

49
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,673
Yes,
it is.

50
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,390
It's a low resolution category that 
apply.

51
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,890
It's the same category as Predator.
That's right ad from a cognitive,

52
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,680
anthropological perspective,
which is sort of,

53
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,850
again,
the way I tend to look towards things.

54
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,670
It's actually the most functional 
categories.

55
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,980
Absolutely,
because it all the relevant elements.

56
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:43,814
That's right.
If it's more differentiated than you 

57
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,414
have to make the assumption that you all
will automatically know what's about to 

58
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:48,500
attack you,
what you don't know,

59
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,120
the unknown.

60
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,940
That's right.
So it's a cat snake burden.

61
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,783
It breathes fire and you know that could
be a reference to the poisonous to a 

62
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:59,440
poisonous snake,
but it also could be the inclusion of in

63
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:00,274
the dangers because of course fire was 
certainly a danger on the velt at 

64
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:07,870
certain danger in the forests.
And so fire breathing,

65
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:10,330
cat snake bird covers a lot of 
territory,

66
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,300
but it's even better than that because 
you say,

67
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:14,650
well,
what's in the unknown?

68
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,340
So you project the contents of your 
imagination into the unknown to fill it.

69
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,340
But the thing is is that we're not just 
prey animals,

70
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:25,330
we're also predatory and exploratory.
And so the Dragon,

71
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,630
the cat snake bird that breathes fire 
isn't only a Predator,

72
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:32,440
it's also the thing that guards virgins 
and the thing that guards gold.

73
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,470
And that's also fascinating because I 
think that the,

74
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,300
the are the ancestral males who were 
good at,

75
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,030
at keeping the cat snake bird at bay.

76
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,490
We're much more likely to propagate.
I mean,

77
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,363
that's just seemed self evident I think 
when you tell people that everyone 

78
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,430
thinks,
well obviously,

79
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,593
you know,
and that's the gladiatorial type or 

80
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:57,460
maybe the person who went out and found 
out where the nests of these things were

81
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:58,810
in,
got rid of the nests.

82
00:03:58,811 --> 00:03:59,950
And,
and then.

83
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,863
And so we also,
we have this bifurcated image of the 

84
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:08,950
Predator which is the Predator slash 
unknown,

85
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:12,550
which is also the place of new useful 
things.

86
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,360
And so when it's very,
what would you call it?

87
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,580
It's very articulated,
almost like in the Mesopotamian story,

88
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:26,581
one of the names for Margo who goes out 
and confronts Tiamat,

89
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,723
who's basically a cat snake bird is he 
who makes ingenious things out of the 

90
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:34,480
body of Tire Matt.
And I mean,

91
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,463
how can you,
you can't get any more direct 

92
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,240
illustration of the idea than that.
And when he has battled with ty Matt,

93
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,810
who's come back with all the monsters,
there are including the king of evil out

94
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:51,310
there at their forefront to destroy that
society of the Gods.

95
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,810
He cuts her into pieces and makes the 
world.

96
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,340
And so it's perfect.
That's the,

97
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,530
the,
the uh,

98
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,020
the savior of humanity,
let's say,

99
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:02,854
is he who confronts the chaotic unknown,
differentiates it and makes the 

100
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:10,450
habitable world.
