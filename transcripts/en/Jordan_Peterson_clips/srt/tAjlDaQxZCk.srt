1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,933
Do you think that there's a right number
of children to have as you're saying 

2
00:00:04,061 --> 00:00:05,050
that?
That popped in my head.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,560
I.
I come from a good number

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,340
and the reason for that,
if you have one child,

5
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:13,530
it's like I'm not saying,
well that's terrible man.

6
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:14,364
Like what the Hell is wrong with you?
That's hard to have one child because 

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,123
children first of all socialize each 
other and they amuse each other and so 

8
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:25,554
we've found.
So we have two kids and then my wife 

9
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:27,924
also took care of a couple of neighbor 
kids that actually in some ways made 

10
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:31,764
things easier because the kids will just
run off and amuse themselves and then 

11
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:37,350
what you have to be is around when they 
have a problem,

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,860
but they don't want you around and you 
don't necessarily want them around.

13
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:44,460
You have adult things to do right?
With one child you've got the problem of

14
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,294
having to amuse the child all the time 
and the child has the problem of not 

15
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:53,700
having siblings to hash things out at,
at a peer to peer level.

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,150
And I think that maybe that one of the 
reasons the overprotected child,

17
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,123
you know,
going to university phenomena has 

18
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:07,491
emerged is because children are now 
mostly produced by older couples,

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,240
so who are more intent on doing 
everything right for them.

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,510
But they also don't have enough siblings
so they're not getting sorta,

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,093
you know,
they're like puppies that haven't had 

22
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:20,970
enough rough and tumble play with other 
puppies.

23
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,940
And they're really like that.
I mean,

24
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,893
and that's not good.
We know from the animal developmental 

25
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,870
studies,
like even with rats,

26
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,973
I'm social animals don't do that well 
unless they have peers to get into it 

27
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:34,140
with,
you know,

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,820
and a lot of socialization takes place 
between peers and so.

29
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,253
So I would say to kids minimum because 
well then you have kids and they can 

30
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:47,610
amuse each other and maybe three is 
nice,

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,433
but one is,
one is I do not believe that one is 

32
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:53,310
easier than two.
I don't believe that.
