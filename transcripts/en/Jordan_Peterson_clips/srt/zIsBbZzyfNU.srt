1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,400
The sociopathic types too,
they prey on the elderly,

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,260
like they're bad people.
Oh yeah.

3
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:06,200
Well this is a big problem now with the 
computer.

4
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:07,034
So I mean close to my grandma,
she calls me up and out of the blue 

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,853
she's like,
I just got a call from you and Mexico 

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,990
saying that you were stranded there and 
needed me to send you 1500 bucks.

7
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:19,824
I was like,
what the.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,903
Yeah,
exactly.

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,960
Yeah.
Well that's associated sociopath,

10
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:25,723
sociopath to do that.
Or they're just like opportunistic 

11
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:32,241
people or what's the difference to be 
the real psychopathic types state.

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,220
They have no conscience.
Like you're there to be plucked.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,880
You're an MPC in a video game.
It's had been described.

14
00:00:37,881 --> 00:00:38,880
Yeah,
exactly.

15
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:39,714
And,
and they're relatively rare and they do 

16
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:42,084
have to move around and you know,
they can be successful in 

17
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:47,730
extraordinarily corrupt environments for
short periods of time,

18
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:49,440
but it's just not a stable solution.

19
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,330
I can give you an example.
Well,

20
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,003
I'm curious,
what do you think about like the high 

21
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:57,780
ranking officers in the Nazi party where
these psychopaths that were thriving and

22
00:00:57,781 --> 00:00:58,614
a unstable corrupt situation or these 
otherwise decent people that just got 

23
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,510
twisted up and the and while they were 
there,

24
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,840
a little of column a and a little of 
column b,

25
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,810
you know,
like there was certainly openings in the

26
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:12,644
Nazi hierarchy's for people who were 
compassionless and cruel and vengeful 

27
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:16,970
and,
and,

28
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,550
and all of that.
The SS is a good example of that.

29
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,150
But there's a great book that I would 
recommend to your,

30
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,420
to your listeners,
to your viewers called ordinary men,

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,910
uh,
by Christopher Browning.

32
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,470
And so it's a great book and it tracks 
the development of.

33
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,783
So when the Nazis moved through Poland,
they left policeman behind to maintain 

34
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:40,011
order,
let's say,

35
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:40,844
but it was still under wartime and 
Browning track the behavior of this one 

36
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,480
unit of policemen.

37
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,333
They were all middle aged guys.
Just typical middleclass [inaudible] 

38
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,920
guys.
They'd grown up really before Hitler.

39
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:58,820
So they weren't thoroughly indoctrinated
like the Nazi youth say.

40
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,163
And uh,
and they were sent to Poland and their 

41
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:05,090
commander said,
look,

42
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,040
you guys,
it's war time and you know,

43
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,710
there are traders everywhere and you're 
going to have to do some pretty horrible

44
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:12,680
things here,
but if you don't have to,

45
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:15,410
you can go home if,
if you think that's just too much.

46
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,750
And none of them did and you think,
well why not?

47
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:20,270
They had the opportunity,
but the reason was,

48
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,900
well they were comrades,
let's say in arms,

49
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:26,570
you know,
so they had that spree decor thing going

50
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:27,404
and they were all thinking,
well I'm not gonna like run away and 

51
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:31,580
leave my colleagues to do all the dirty 
work.

52
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:34,460
It's a war and duty to have a duty.
Yeah,

53
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:34,820
okay.

54
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,920
So fine.
So you know,

55
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,580
they started by rounding up all the Jews
who were between 18 and 65,

56
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:44,510
the man and shipping them away.
And they ended up by,

57
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,830
this is,
this is rough,

58
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:46,664
it's a rough book.
They ended up taking naked pregnant 

59
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:51,710
women out into the middle of fields and 
shooting them in the back of the head.

60
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,851
And so you think,
well,

61
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:56,960
how does a man transform in that manner 
and Browning shows you like,

62
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:57,794
it's not pleasant.
They went psychological hell each step 

63
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:02,920
of the way.
But they went,

64
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,400
you know,
so lots of times it was ordinary men who

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,833
went down the bad path one step at a 
time and sometimes it was like people 

66
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,424
who were rotten to the core,
like the minister of propaganda or 

67
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,960
Magali the doctor.
I mean,

68
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,303
you know,
he was a sadistic psychopaths of the 

69
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,824
highest order

70
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,820
is um,
is there a mastermind at,

71
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,720
it seems so complicated to,
to,

72
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,190
to transform an ordinary man as the book
says,

73
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,430
and to just someone who's willing to,
to execute a pregnant,

74
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,623
innocent woman.
Is there a mastermind that plots the 

75
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:38,800
course of that?
Or is it just,

76
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,240
I'm circle like,
it just happened naturally as the,

77
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,990
along with the objectives of the like 
how did,

78
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,950
how do they orchestrate something so 
complicated?

79
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,200
Well,
I mean the,

80
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,153
the Germans were an organized,
are organized people were an organized 

81
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:56,720
people and Hitler really didn't give out
directives precisely.

82
00:03:56,721 --> 00:03:57,554
He sort of hinted at what he might want.
And then his minions would get together 

83
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:03,260
and you know,
lay out policies in accordance with what

84
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:05,600
they thought were his wishes.
And I mean there's a book,

85
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:09,230
another book I would recommend called 
Eichmann in Jerusalem.

86
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,590
And Eichmann was really the architect of
the final solution in many ways and it's

87
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:15,824
a character or logical analysis of 
Eichmann and Eichmann was in no way a 

88
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:20,450
psychopath,
you know,

89
00:04:20,451 --> 00:04:22,790
he was perfectly capable of,
I think,

90
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,803
I think this is actually a true story.
I might have it confused with another 

91
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,310
story,
but it doesn't matter really.

92
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:29,000
It's,
it's,

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,833
it's the same idea he won.
There's a story about him driving home 

94
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:37,220
after work one day and running over a 
cat and having like a terrible emotional

95
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:38,330
reaction to it,
you know,

96
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,690
and it's not like his kids didn't love 
them and you know,

97
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,240
but,
and he wasn't out there actually killing

98
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:46,160
people.
He was just making the plans.

99
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:46,994
He was the bureaucrats behind the scenes
and he was the sort of guy who had his 

100
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:51,920
mum do his laundry when he went off to 
the army,

101
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:53,150
you know,
he was a.

102
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,130
He was a faceless bureaucrat and he 
would have worked in any bureaucracy.

103
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:58,964
He was worried about his next promotion.
He wasn't thinking about the larger 

104
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,860
consequences and so,
and that's Hannah Arendt and she.

105
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,990
That's a very classic book,
a Eichmann in Jerusalem and that's,

106
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,930
that's very much worth reading if you're
interested in this sort of thing.

107
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,083
One of the interesting things I always 
heard about the Nazis that really 

108
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:18,280
humanizes them in a way is that they 
were,

109
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,960
and you could,
I might be wrong about this,

110
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:22,780
but they were passing out alcohol to all
the soldiers,

111
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,614
especially those in the concentration 
camps to keep them intoxicated all the 

112
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:30,670
time so that they could not confront the
horrible things they were doing.

113
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,041
Yeah.
Well,

114
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,360
they had all sorts of,
of,

115
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:34,910
of les learned how to do it across time.
Right.

116
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:36,110
I mean,
you know,

117
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,073
it,
it.

118
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,720
So Hitler started.
One of the things Hitler started.

119
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,103
It's a very strange story in many ways 
because Hitler was obsessed with order 

120
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:47,264
and cleanliness.
He was a very orderly person and he was 

121
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:52,730
very sensitive to discussed,
you know,

122
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:53,451
because you think,
well,

123
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:55,220
the Nazis were afraid of the Jews,
you know,

124
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,930
because they were out there and that's 
not right.

125
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,830
What's more accurate is that the.
Especially Hitler,

126
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:01,311
he,
he,

127
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:01,940
uh,
he was,

128
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,460
he was very sensitive to discuss.
That's what it looks like.

129
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:07,820
And if you're disgusted by something 
then you want to eradicate it.

130
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,050
Right.
If you're afraid of something,

131
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:10,890
you want to run away from it.
If you're disgusted by it,

132
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,000
you want to burn it to the damn ground.
You want to get rid of it.

133
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,133
And his writings,
I read a book called Hitler's table 

134
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:19,634
talk,
which was his spontaneous discussions 

135
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:27,671
during dinner time from 1939 to 1942.
It's really another amazing book.

136
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,310
And we had been doing some work and 
inspired a bit by Jonathan Heit,

137
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:34,724
who's done a lot of work on disgust and 
the relationship between trait 

138
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:38,624
personality and I was reading this book 
at the same time and it was just 

139
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,434
unbelievable how often Hitler referred 
to the people he was eradicating the 

140
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:47,534
Slavs and the Gypsies and the Jews and 
all the people he went after as 

141
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:53,990
parasites and as rats and insects and 
all of that.

142
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:56,000
So they were kind of put into that 
category.

143
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:56,834
So,
and here's the horrifying part of that 

144
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,410
story.
Like when Hitler came to power,

145
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,080
he put it in a lot of public health 
initiatives,

146
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,940
um,
including master book,

147
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,833
tuberculosis screening,
which actually turned out to be a good 

148
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:08,270
thing.

149
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,270
And at the same time he went on a 
beautify the factories campaign.

150
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,960
And so he convinced the German,
uh,

151
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,460
uh,
factory owners and so forth to,

152
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,260
to increase the levels of hygiene in the
factories to get rid of the rats and the

153
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:26,120
mice to plant flowers out front,
you know,

154
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:28,310
to make everything look neat and 
orderly.

155
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,580
And the insecticide they used was Zike 
lawn.

156
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,860
Well,
as icon to,

157
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:34,694
so to eradicate the routes and the 
insects cycle on slightly different 

158
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:39,980
formulation was the gas that was used in
the concentration camps.

159
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:40,814
And so Hitler went from cleaning up the 
rats and the mice in the factories and 

160
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:47,120
the insects and then he went into the 
mental hospitals and started cleaning up

161
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:52,100
in there and then like,
it just went broader and broader again,

162
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:54,330
sort of one step at a time,
you know,

163
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,130
when the Germans had plenty of reason to
be resentful and hateful because I mean,

164
00:07:58,131 --> 00:07:59,270
think about what they went through.

165
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,520
We can't even imagine it the first of 
all,

166
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:02,354
there was world war one.
And so there was many men like Hitler 

167
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:08,210
himself who served in the trenches.
And there's one story about Hitler.

168
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:09,080
He,
um,

169
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,813
he won a medal for heroism in World War 
One and he was sitting around with a 

170
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,540
group of his buddies and went off to do 
something.

171
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,374
God only knows what,
when he came back they were all dead 

172
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:20,160
because,
uh,

173
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,370
uh,
a mine and not a mine,

174
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,263
I don't remember what's kind of some 
kind of shell Atlanta did middler and 

175
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:28,610
killed them all.
So like that changes you,

176
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,693
you know,
and then afterwards there was all these 

177
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:33,200
brutalized men who'd come out of the 
trenches.

178
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:34,034
I mean,
you just can't imagine what it must've 

179
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,380
been like in the trenches,
you know,

180
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,900
especially if you're there for like a 
couple of years,

181
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,240
you aren't the same person get out of 
there,

182
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:43,190
you're unemployed,
your countries in ruins.

183
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,293
Then the hyperinflation hits and every 
single person in Germany who ever saved 

184
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:49,880
any money at all is flat,
bloody broke.

185
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,983
And then there's a communist revolution 
brewing in Russia and it's like it's 

186
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:56,160
hell.
And the Nazis came along and said,

187
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:56,994
well,
not only are we going to restore order 

188
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:00,774
in greatness,
but we're going to bloody well tell you 

189
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:03,600
whose fault this is.
It's like,

190
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:04,763
and Hitler,
I've studied him a lot trying to 

191
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:10,170
understand what happened.
And Hitler was Carl Jung called them the

192
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:13,200
mouthpiece of the collective unconscious
of the German people.

193
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,153
So imagine there's all this resentment 
and hatred brewing underneath the 

194
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:17,394
surface and all of this chaos is there 
and the desire for order is like 

195
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:24,300
clamoring and everyone's minds and 
Hitler comes along and he's,

196
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,373
he's a very powerful emotional oratory 
and he's watching the crowd and he 

197
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:33,990
listened and when he says thing a,
nothing happens.

198
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,870
When he says thing B,
everybody roars.

199
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,830
And so he takes note of that and it's 
not even conscious exactly right because

200
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:41,664
he's being molded by the crowd and so 
they roar and so we think so that's a 

201
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:47,070
reinforcement.
That's a reward.

202
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,233
And so then he goes down that line a 
little bit farther and they roar some 

203
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:53,300
more and then he tries something else 
and it's silent what they want.

204
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,760
You Bet exactly that man.
He,

205
00:09:55,761 --> 00:10:00,761
he acts out the dark desire of the mob.
So he becomes the embodiment of the dark

206
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:04,080
desire of the mob.
And that's partly,

207
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,003
that's partly why he had the charisma.
It's right because there's this 

208
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:11,760
unconscious fantasy brewing in the back 
of everyone's minds.

209
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:14,490
You see that to some degree now with 
Antifa for example,

210
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:17,850
and their proclivity towards violence.
You know what you asked what?

211
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,650
Just exactly what's going on there.

212
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,773
Well,
hip there came to embody the desire of 

213
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:27,150
the German people for order and revenge 
and he,

214
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,330
he embodied that fully know.
And you could say,

215
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:33,630
so what happened was a collaboration 
between him and the people.

216
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:36,090
It wasn't Hitler turned everyone into 
Nazis.

217
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:37,080
It's like,
no,

218
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,213
that's not how it works.
I'm sure there was a lot of good people 

219
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:44,781
still left over who got just overrun by 
the mania to well were disgusted.

220
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:45,540
Well,
the other,

221
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,070
the other thing too is that,
you know,

222
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:52,290
people are not that brave in everybody 
thinks this is one of the things I teach

223
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,060
in my maps of meaning class,
you know,

224
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:55,020
it's like,
okay,

225
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,480
you,
you look at Nazi Germany in the thirties

226
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:58,314
and you think,
well I'd be one of the heroes who 

227
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:00,504
rescued the Jews.
It's like statistically that's very 

228
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:03,760
improbable.
Right?

229
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,763
And one of the things I've learned in 
the last year with all this strange 

230
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,270
political,
what would you say,

231
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,223
this strange situation that I've been in
is how unlikely it is for people to 

232
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:19,974
speak up.
They just won't even tenured professors 

233
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,020
who are tenured,
they're protected.

234
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,303
It's like the probability they'll,
they'll pop their head up and say 

235
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:31,260
something that might make them 
identifiable is very,

236
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:33,220
very low.
So scary.

237
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,200
Yeah,
I guess you're right.

238
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,670
Well,
at that time,

239
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:38,400
and you know Nazi Germany,
the stakes were as high as it could get.

240
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,440
They didn't tolerate.
That's right.

241
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,290
That's exactly right.
But even when the stakes are low,

242
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,410
people won't speak up.
