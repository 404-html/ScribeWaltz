1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,193
So let's start with postmodernism.
The first thing to understand about the 

2
00:00:04,711 --> 00:00:09,000
postmodernists are that they are by no 
means unintelligent.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,000
Quite the contrary.
Jacques Derrida,

4
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:14,730
for example,
and Michel Foucault for that matter,

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,073
too,
famous French public intellectuals who 

6
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:18,384
are both at or near the head of what you
might describe as the postmodern 

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,063
intellectual revolution,
are extraordinarily intellectually 

8
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:29,550
capable.
Um,

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,610
that doesn't mean they're correct by any
stretch of the imagination,

10
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:37,320
but it certainly means that they're more
than able to put together a,

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,050
an argument that's difficult to 
disentangle.

12
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:43,140
And so we'll start with the,
what I think is the most central power,

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,930
the most powerful central claim of 
postmodernism.

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,720
A claim which I think is actually 
correct.

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,510
And which also has be devil,
many other fields,

16
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:54,390
including surprisingly enough,
artificial intelligence.

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:55,703
The claim is something like there is an 
infinite number of ways to interpret 

18
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,240
any,
even finite set of phenomena.

19
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,950
And,
and,

20
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,230
and that actually happens to be true.
It's part of the reason why it's been so

21
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:11,064
difficult for human beings to develop 
artificial intelligence and for them to 

22
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:17,310
develop machines that could operate in 
real world environments.

23
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,144
Because it turns out that the world is 
so complex that perceiving it all 

24
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,390
appears virtually impossible.
Technically speaking.

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,613
We heard a little bit earlier that the 
previous talk about embodied cognition 

26
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:29,664
and one of the ways psychologists are 
trying to address the issue of the 

27
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:32,334
impossibility of perception is to note 
that perception isn't possible without 

28
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:39,060
situating the mind in a body that has a 
certain set of constraints.

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,913
We also devote a tremendous amount of 
our neurological landscape to see to 

30
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,300
sensory processing so that when we look 
at the world that can manifest itself in

31
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:49,860
this self evident way that it appears to
you,

32
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,540
but that doesn't mean that it's a simple
problem.

33
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,020
It's a very complicated problem and the 
postmodernist we're technically correct.

34
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:55,854
There's there's,
there's a near infinite number of ways 

35
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:01,260
to to perceive and interpret a finite 
number of phenomena.

36
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,283
Now you see the thing that's interesting
about that claim apart from the fact 

37
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:07,854
that it happens to be technically true 
is that you can use it to mountain 

38
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:13,044
assault on any interpretation of 
anything whatsoever because there is a 

39
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,573
tremendous,
very variability in the number of 

40
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,810
interpretations that you could bring to 
bear on a situation.

41
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:22,883
Then you can instantly jump to the 
conclusion or expound the proposition 

42
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,000
that none of those interpretation should
be privileged,

43
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,500
Amal,
above all,

44
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,530
above any others.
Now that's actually wrong,

45
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,123
and this is why postmodernism is correct
and it's central assumption but 

46
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:41,724
incorrect in its secondary assumption.
Now the reason it's wrong is because 

47
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,970
although there is a very large number of
potential interpretations of the world,

48
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,953
that does not mean that there is an 
equally large number of viable 

49
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,560
interpretations of the world.

50
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,240
Now you might say,
well,

51
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:58,080
what constitutes constraints on the 
viability of an interpretation?

52
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,290
And I would say,
well,

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,333
there's a number of them and I think you
have to understand this in the context 

54
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:07,210
of living creatures,
viewing and interpreting the world,

55
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:09,400
and also within a broader evolutionary 
context,

56
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,413
the way that evolution solves the 
problem of the infinite number of 

57
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,653
potential interpretations is by killing 
every single thing that interprets 

58
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:19,300
things badly enough to die.
Right?

59
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:20,560
And so I,
I mean this,

60
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:21,394
this is actually one of the most 
powerful arguments for the necessity of 

61
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,783
the evolutionary reason for the 
necessity of the accuracy of the 

62
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,820
evolutionary theory.
It's,

63
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,743
it's that it's taken three and a half 
billion years of evolution to produce 

64
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:36,640
creatures of our sort who can interpret 
the world,

65
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:37,474
which is impossible to interpret well 
enough to live for approximately 80 

66
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:41,644
years and to have some reasonable chance
of propagating during that period of 

67
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:45,850
time,
three and a half billion years.

68
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,380
And that's the best we've been able to 
do.

69
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,363
It's a very complicated problem.
And evolution solves that problem by 

70
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:51,724
producing a tremendous number of 
variance and then killing almost all of 

71
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:55,114
them.
And so death is the solution to the 

72
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:59,860
problem of interpretation.
And it's a terrible solution,

73
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:00,694
but the point I'm trying to make there 
is that interpretations are constrained 

74
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:04,714
by such things,
primary things that happened to be 

75
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:09,370
relevant to living beings like suffering
and death.

76
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:10,930
So those are the first sets of 
constraints.

77
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,033
Your interpretations of the world should
shield you to the degree possible from 

78
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:16,534
excess suffering and death.
That doesn't seem to be too debatable 

79
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,610
proposition unless you're aimed in the 
suicidal direction.

80
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,850
And so we can start by merely pointing 
that out.

81
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:25,923
We also might point out that such things
as the necessity for cooperating and 

82
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:30,334
competing with others also constraints 
the interpretations that you're allowed 

83
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:33,754
in the world,
especially given that not only do you 

84
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:38,320
have to cooperate and compete with 
people one time,

85
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,154
but that you have to cooperate and 
compete with often the same people many 

86
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:43,414
times in many different contexts and so 
that not only do you have to interpret 

87
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:49,060
the world so that you can cooperate and 
compete with those people.

88
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,013
You have to do it in a manner that can 
be iterated and repeated and that 

89
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:55,360
constitutes also an extraordinary series
constraints.

90
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,194
So you don't want to suffer too much.
And you don't want to die and you want 

91
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:01,330
to be able to cooperate with people and 
you want to be able to compete with them

92
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:03,730
and you want to be able to do that over 
long periods of time.

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,690
And then maybe you also want to do it 
with an aim in mind because generally we

94
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:08,524
have aims in mind and so there are 
things that we'd like to have more than 

95
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:12,064
other things.
And so we aim at those and then we have 

96
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:17,470
to constrain our interpretation so that 
when we enact them in the world,

97
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:20,950
the probability that what we're aiming 
at is going to happen will improve.

98
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,120
And all of those constraints operates 
operate simultaneously.

99
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,890
And what that implies.

100
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,723
And I think John Piaget,
the developmental psychologists maybe 

101
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,870
went farther along this line of thinking
than anyone else I knew about anyways.

102
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,670
It's sort of an elaboration of cons,
fundamental,

103
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,780
ethical maximum,
which was something like,

104
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,913
um,
act as if the thing that you're doing 

105
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:41,800
will be done by everyone.
And,

106
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,693
but the pig and sense was more like act 
as if the thing that you will be doing 

107
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,073
needs to be repeated endlessly.
In a manner that moves up instead of 

108
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,640
down.
It's something like that,

109
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,743
but the point is is that there's.
There's tremendous constraints on the 

110
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,850
manner in which we can interpret the 
world from any realistic perspective.

111
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:02,480
So the criticism that there are an 
infinite number of interpretations falls

112
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:04,660
apart on closer examination.
So that's,

113
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,910
that's the first place that the 
postmodernists are seriously wrong.

114
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:11,240
They radically underestimated the 
intrinsic constraints on,

115
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,740
on,
on interpretation.
