1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,190
What is my opinion on open 
relationships,

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:05,010
polyamory,
other forms of non monogamy?

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,173
Well,
I think that as a medium to longterm 

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,383
strategy,
they're completely untenable because 

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,680
human beings,
as far as I'm concerned,

6
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,930
are fundamentally pair bonding and you 
know,

7
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:19,050
if you're just talking about casual sex,
first of all,

8
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:21,360
I think casual sex is a contradiction in
terms.

9
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:22,194
I don't think there's anything about sex
that's casual and I think that people 

10
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:26,400
are deceiving themselves badly whenever 
they think so.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,400
They might like to live in a 19 
seventies,

12
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:31,140
playboy,
adolescent fantasy,

13
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:31,974
but.
