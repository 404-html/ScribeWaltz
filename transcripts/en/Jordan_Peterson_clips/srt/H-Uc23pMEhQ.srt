1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,160
Do you have any advice for someone who 
may be a sexual,

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,083
I want to have a husband and children,
but I'm 27 and haven't felt connection 

3
00:00:06,851 --> 00:00:07,684
with anyone.
I'm just seeing everyone as friends so 

4
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:12,940
far in life.
Well,

5
00:00:12,941 --> 00:00:15,670
he might want to see a sex therapist 
that might help.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,400
Um,
I guess the other thing I would say is,

7
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:19,360
well,
you know,

8
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,970
it might not be too bad an idea to,
um,

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,910
act out what you want perhaps in the 
absence of any necessary desire.

10
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:28,744
Like you know,
what you might be so far have fallen so 

11
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:33,010
far inside yourself.
Then it's very difficult to get out.

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,370
Um,
what are the sex therapist would do,

13
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:37,150
would be,
you know,

14
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,770
once you've written some kind of,
let's say,

15
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:39,604
friendship that you wanted to move 
forward would be to have you guys 

16
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:47,250
practice interacting in an intimate 
manner,

17
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,960
stage by stage so that you could get 
accustomed to it.

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,793
You know,
so you need to explore whether that's 

19
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,100
asexuality as you say,
or if it's fear or if it's,

20
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,930
you know,
it might be fear of rejection,

21
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:02,790
it might be fear of sexuality,
might be that you're slow to warm up and

22
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,600
introverted,
but I think seeing a sex therapist might

23
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,370
not be a bad idea.
We know.

24
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,000
I guess the other thing,
and I say this with some hesitation,

25
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:16,300
is that if you find someone you liked 
that you could be friends with,

26
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:17,340
I mean,
you could try.

27
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,663
I'm initiating a romantic relationship 
and practice it for a couple of months 

28
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:23,074
and see what happens because you know,
maybe you'd warm up across time and 

29
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,590
certainly it's certainly,
it's certainly a possibility.

30
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,903
So.
