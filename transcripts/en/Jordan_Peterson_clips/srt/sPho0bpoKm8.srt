1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,953
So the fundamental thing that I learned 
from Paul Rosen is to see us as these 

2
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:04,644
amazing omnivores.
This is part of our survival strategy 

3
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:08,004
even more than other other apes.
We are just brilliant omnivores and we 

4
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:12,294
have the Omnivore's dilemma,
which is we've got to be interested in 

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:15,983
all kinds of new stuff.
We're not tied to one place we can roam 

6
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:22,590
onto a whole new continent.
So we were interested in stuff,

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,310
but stuff has all kinds of toxins and 
microbes.

8
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:27,144
We have to be careful about that stuff.
And so these motives have to be 

9
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:29,664
intention and this is actually an 
interesting way to understand the left 

10
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:34,500
right difference.
You have to have both motives,

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,960
but if so,
imagine two siblings,

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,990
one of whom is set more towards trying 
new stuff,

13
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:40,824
seeking out new stuff,
and the other's a little more fearful 

14
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:43,201
and we're like,
Whoa,

15
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:44,034
no,
let's,

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,260
let's not try that.

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,153
That stayed with what's tried and true.
I mean that's Progressive Ism and 

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,890
conservatives and that's the origins of 
it.

19
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,220
And if you look at kids' behavior at the
age of two or three,

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,010
it does predict how they'll vote much 
later.

21
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:58,740
Not Hugely,
but there is a clear prediction there.

22
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,760
So,
um,

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,193
so disgust is part of a regulatory 
system about our engagement with the 

24
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:08,130
world and whether we are just sorta out 
there and,

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:08,831
you know,
we,

26
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:10,710
we,
we seek out variety and diversity.

27
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:11,544
We think diversity is just a great thing
where whether we want a little more 

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,420
order structure,
predictability.

29
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,050
I'm conservatives are neater than 
progressive's.

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,370
If you take photos of their rooms,
um,

31
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,210
um,
you know,

32
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:24,320
you can actually,
you know,

33
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,780
cleanliness and organization,
you can predict how they vote,

34
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,580
um,
discussed.

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,533
It turns out what's really cool about 
disgust in modern politics is if you 

36
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:35,640
look at all the different things that 
we're fighting over,

37
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:37,630
especially in this country,
our culture war is over,

38
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,720
you know,
going back a few decades,

39
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:40,620
you know,
sex,

40
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:41,790
drugs,
the flag,

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,050
immigration,
all of these things.

42
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,313
Um,
I had to study with my colleagues was 

43
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,613
led by Seneca Leyva in which we asked 
all these cultural war attitudes of 

44
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:54,180
people and we also had their scores and 
the discus scale.

45
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,360
But one of the foundations of morality 
is sanctity and purity.

46
00:01:57,361 --> 00:02:00,990
And it relates to discuss what we found 
is that if you know,

47
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,780
if you know,
um,

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,500
uh,
what people's left,

49
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,130
right?
We're,

50
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:05,963
how they place themselves in the left 
rightscale you can pretty much predict 

51
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,233
where they fall on most cultural war 
attitudes except for those that load on 

52
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,760
or implicate sanctity or purity.
So what I mean his flag burning.

53
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,720
Okay.
Do you think,

54
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,070
you know,
do you think that people should have the

55
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:23,700
right to burn the American flag or the 
country's flag as an expression,

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,160
as a political action?
What do you think people could give some

57
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:30,060
answer on a one to seven scale and 
people on the right thing?

58
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,193
You know,
I'm more like this ain't no people in 

59
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:32,700
the left.
Yes.

60
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,043
People are score high on loyalty are 
more likely to say no people lower and 

61
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:38,843
say yes.
And that's even taking account of where 

62
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:42,180
they are on the left right dimension.
But here's the cool thing,

63
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,653
um,
it's only if you add in the purity or 

64
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:48,330
sanctity thing that you can really 
understand what people are doing because

65
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:52,890
some people see the flag not as just a 
piece of cloth.

66
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,620
They see it as having some innate 
essence,

67
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:57,960
some something sacred about it which 
must be protected.

68
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,170
And so,
um,

69
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,960
so this is true even they think of it as
a unifying center.

70
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,430
Exactly.
That's right.

71
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,290
So if there's something sacred,
and this is the,

72
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,124
this is the central piece of my work 
around politics and morality is the 

73
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:13,300
psychology of sanctity.
If you hold something sacred,

74
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,463
then your team's circles around it and 
it's only those who circle around with 

75
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:22,360
you and sometimes literally circle 
around like Muslims at prayer in Mecca,

76
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:24,300
they literally circle the Kebab.

77
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,200
Circling is a very primitive,
ancient.

78
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:27,034
It feels right to circle something,
but even if even if you do it 

79
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:33,340
symbolically or you all bow at the same 
time that binds you together,

80
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,170
children do that with their mothers when
they,

81
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,660
when they engage in exploratory 
behavior,

82
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,570
right where all they use their mother as
a center of the world.

83
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,643
And children differ in the degree to 
which they'll move outward from their 

84
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:46,400
mothers.
So they move out until they,

85
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,070
they,
they trip over their,

86
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,460
their uncertainty threshold a neat.
And is it a distance?

87
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:52,920
Like it's a district?
Yeah.

88
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,883
And so,
so the more exploratory kids who are 

89
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:56,284
lower negative emotion will go out 
farther before they come back to their 

90
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:01,120
mother.
So the mother is the center and you know

91
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:04,270
that that would be associated 
symbolically with the idea of the center

92
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:06,230
as a motherland or potentially as a 
father.

93
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,420
That's right.
That makes sense.

94
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,450
So this way that we're.
We're incredibly symbolic creatures.

95
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,940
We're not just out to make as much money
as we can.

96
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:13,774
Where's this symbolic and social 
creatures and this psychology of 

97
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:19,840
sanctity or purity has become really 
important,

98
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:20,943
not just on the right.
It's always been important for 

99
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:23,644
especially religious conservatives were 
beginning to see it even on the campus 

100
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:27,394
left.
And this is why I think we see some of 

101
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:34,261
the odd things we see on campus that the
campus must be kept as a sacred and pure

102
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:35,404
space.
One of the things that really alarms me 

103
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:38,074
about what's happened on campus and last
couple of years is that the older idea 

104
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:45,070
we had that it's a place for contesting 
ideas.

105
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,410
It's a,
it's a zone of enormous choice.

106
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:50,110
People can take what courses they want,
say what they want.

107
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:54,460
It's kind of a wonderful free for all 
with some with norms of respect.

108
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,773
It's now becoming much more of a 
religious zone where the perimeter of 

109
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:02,940
the campus is the boundaries and within 
it they're almost there.

110
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,190
Blasphemy laws basically,
and I really started noticing this.

111
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:08,740
When you look at the videos of the 
Middlebury,

112
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,570
a protest when Charles Murray spoke at 
Middlebury and as everybody knows,

113
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,553
he was shouted down so the students are 
chanting and they're chanting in unison 

114
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,633
and it seems like a religious revival 
meeting and they're swaying and they're 

115
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:24,790
saying they're sacred in a racist,
sexist,

116
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,310
antigay.
Charles Murray go away.

117
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:28,144
It's like a ritual incantation so that 
all the space as safe and it's safe and 

118
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,900
not maternal way.
Not yet.

119
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,270
So far all this happening is they're 
binding together.

120
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,104
They're moving and you know,
synchronous movement and call and 

121
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,714
response.
So it's using a lot of tropes from 

122
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:45,160
religion and religious worship.
But here's the cool thing.

123
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,800
When the administrator,
I forget who it is,

124
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,560
comes on to say,
okay,

125
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,110
we have moved,
we're moving the talk,

126
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,993
and then you hear a couple people 
screaming up off campus off campus and 

127
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:03,890
he says to another location on campus 
and there's like,

128
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,720
oh no,
no,

129
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,110
because no one had to go to this talk so
everyone could have just stayed home and

130
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:13,184
the students didn't succeed in shutting 
down the venues so they could have 

131
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:19,460
declared victory,
but it's not a full victory unless he is

132
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:21,380
physically off the campus.

133
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,460
We can't have him speaking on campus 
because that defiles us.

134
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,760
That pollutes us.
We must shut that down.

135
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,860
And that's where I started saying,
wow,

136
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:33,950
this is like full blown psychology of 
religion,

137
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,180
Durkheim,
sanctity,

138
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:36,640
purity,
blast for me.

139
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,360
Uh,
and that I think,

140
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,343
you know,
that doesn't describe most students 

141
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:42,200
that,
that describes this sort of the core,

142
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,050
those who,
who really have their identities wrapped

143
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:46,130
up in this movie.

144
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,040
Okay.
So,

145
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,900
so we discussed,
I wanted to,

146
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,480
I wanted to ask you a couple of things 
about that.

147
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:52,314
So you know,
the big five research into political 

148
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:58,440
differences basically shows that the 
liberals are high in trait,

149
00:06:58,441 --> 00:07:02,160
openness and low in conscientiousness 
and the conservatives or the reverse,

150
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,220
but we fragmented conscientiousness into
orderliness and industriousness with the

151
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:11,700
big five aspect scale and orderliness is
strongly associated with disgust.

152
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,160
So.
So.

153
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,800
Right,
right,

154
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,601
right,
exactly.

155
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,434
It does sound a lot like Freud but it.
But it also isn't accordance with your 

156
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:21,960
observations that conservatives have 
neater spaces,

157
00:07:21,961 --> 00:07:22,890
for example.
So,

158
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,020
so now,
and they're meeting start on time.

159
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,010
Yes.
Yeah,

160
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,910
exactly.
Right.

161
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:27,983
Right.
So,

162
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,483
so then the,
the nexus for political belief seems to 

163
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:32,604
be openness so that that exploratory 
tendency that you talked about 

164
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,660
exploration of ideas and creativity and 
low orderliness and so then I thought,

165
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:43,104
well why in the world would,
why would the political nexus go across 

166
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:48,810
those dimensions,
which are some relatively uncorrelated.

167
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,020
Then I thought,
and this is in keeping with your work on

168
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:54,810
discussed,
is that it's an issue of borders,

169
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,673
which of course seems more or less self 
evident in the wake of trump's election 

170
00:07:58,471 --> 00:08:01,680
when he talked about borders.
But you might say,

171
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,514
and I think this is reasonable,
that the conservative is someone who 

172
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,683
wants the borders between categories to 
remain intact no matter what level of 

173
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:11,214
analysis,
so it's borders from the highest 

174
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:14,814
resolution level of cognition all the 
way up to the actual physical borders 

175
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:18,550
of,
of,

176
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,460
of rooms,
towns,

177
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,260
states,
countries,

178
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:25,410
all of that.
So the borders should be thicker and the

179
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:26,970
reason they want that.
Now,

180
00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:29,760
there was a paper published in Plos one,
I don't know if you saw it,

181
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,040
it was a couple of years ago.
It was a mind boggling paper.

182
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,620
It should have been front page news as 
far as I was concerned.

183
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:35,963
And what the researchers did was between
countries and then within provinces or 

184
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:44,010
states within countries,
they correlated the level of,

185
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,793
um,
of frequency of infectious disease with 

186
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,310
authoritarian political beliefs and 
found a walloping correlation.

187
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:56,710
It was like point,
it was one of the highest by the,

188
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,241
for,
for,

189
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:58,074
for those of you who don't know,
social scientists never discover 

190
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:03,780
anything that's associated with anything
else at a correlation of point six other

191
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:06,060
than heritability other than 
heritability.

192
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:06,894
Yes.
And so what they found was that the 

193
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:10,230
higher the prevalence of infectious 
disease,

194
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:11,064
the higher the probability of,
of totalitarian authoritarian political 

195
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:15,414
attitudes,
and then they controlled for governance 

196
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,023
because one of the questions was,
was this pop down authoritarianism or 

197
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:22,104
bottom up authoritarianism?
And the answer was that it was bottom 

198
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,960
up.
Okay.

199
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:25,794
And so I thought about that in two from 
two perspectives simultaneously at the 

200
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:32,514
time.

201
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,990
Okay.
So we identified disgust,

202
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:37,590
sensitivity with orderliness,
so say a fundamental sub trait.

203
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,210
Then I was reading this book that was 
called Hitler's table talk,

204
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,403
and it was a,
it was the recordings of virtually 

205
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:49,050
everything he said at dinner from 1939 
to 1942.

206
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:51,150
Yeah.
So it's a spontaneous utterance say,

207
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,343
and it's full of discussions about Jews 
and Gypsies and all the people he 

208
00:09:58,081 --> 00:10:00,150
tormented.
But what's really interesting is all the

209
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:02,910
language is discussed.
It's not feared.

210
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,240
So,
so Hitler is basic metaphor was that the

211
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:09,540
area,
race and country was a pure body.

212
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,480
And then it was assaulted by parasites,
right?

213
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:13,314
And then I remembered what happened to 
the native Americans when the Europeans 

214
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:16,674
showed up and shook hands.
What happened was that 95 percent of 

215
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:21,090
them are dead within 50 years,
right?

216
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:21,924
Because of smallpox and measles,
and so that that border issue that 

217
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:29,550
separates conservatives from liberals,
let's say,

218
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:34,200
is the conservative say the novel is 
potentially contaminated.

219
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,510
It's not so much that it's dangerous.
That's different.

220
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,130
That's fear.
It's contaminated.

221
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,930
And the Liberals say,
hold on a minute.

222
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,410
If you make the borders too thick,
then information can't pass through.

223
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,393
Exactly.
So that's the Omnivore's dilemma right 

224
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:46,570
there.
Right?

225
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,453
And,
and then since we have a biological 

226
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,380
architecture on which are cognitive 
platforms are erected,

227
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,040
we have the same attitude towards 
abstract information,

228
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:59,660
which would be ideas that we do to 
things like food or,

229
00:10:59,661 --> 00:11:01,140
or illness.
Right?

230
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,003
Right.
And so we can think of an invading idea 

231
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:06,210
or a polluting idea or contaminating 
idea.

232
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:06,390
Yeah,

233
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,223
that's right.
Now I'm a big fan of George lakoff 

234
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,350
metaphors.
We live by that.

235
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:11,184
We yet we use our bodily,
our bodily Schema data to think about 

236
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:15,654
abstract things like politics and like 
what our policies should be about 

237
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:19,900
borders and immigration.
Uh,

238
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,630
there's a Canadian psychologist,
mark shaller.

239
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:24,750
He and his colleagues have developed 
what they call an account over these,

240
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,720
the behavioral immune system,
right.

241
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,480
That we don't just try to,
you know,

242
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,890
microbes killed probably many more of 
our ancestors.

243
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:36,750
Dan Did Lions and tigers and bears and 
so whoever can keep themselves and their

244
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:39,780
children from being exposed to fatal 
illnesses,

245
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:40,614
winds the evolutionary game.
And so a lot of that is judging 

246
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:44,880
carefully about people.
Is he dangerous,

247
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,430
dangerous.
And that's both for sexuality,

248
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:49,770
for contact,
for all kinds of association.

249
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,791
Um,
so yeah,

250
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:54,730
and a lot of ways our emotions and 
bodily interactions structure,

251
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:57,540
how we think and feel about about 
social.

252
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,750
Well even with the black death in 
Europe,

253
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:00,584
I mean,
so the black death occurred in Europe 

254
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:03,134
when the Europeans started to move 
around the world and they brought back 

255
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:06,800
rats that were infected.
Exactly.

256
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:07,634
So,
so what you saw there was both of those 

257
00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:09,584
forces at work at the same time.
So the European expansion produced a 

258
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:15,680
tremendous interchange of ideas from all
around the world.

259
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:16,514
That's globalization,
but it wiped out somewhere between 30 

260
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:20,840
and 60 percent of the population at the 
same time.

261
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,010
So wouldn't it

262
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,500
be good if in every society or every 
organization,

263
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:29,360
and we had some people who specialized 
in a specialized insane,

264
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,830
hey,
what are the opportunities?

265
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,720
And then we had other people who 
specialize in saying,

266
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,980
well,
but what are the risks?

267
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,053
And it just so happens that a lot of 
people have trouble doing all that in 

268
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:38,534
themselves.
When we have systems that are well 

269
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:40,754
constituted with people who have 
different personalities and different 

270
00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:45,320
motives and goals,
we actually can get better outcomes.

271
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,760
We can have a discussion between them.
