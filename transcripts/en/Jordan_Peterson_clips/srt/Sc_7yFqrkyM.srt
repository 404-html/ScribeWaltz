00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,630
One of the things you can be virtually 
certain of in life is that you don't get

2
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:06,930
something you don't aim at,
and one of the things that's interesting

3
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:07,764
about that is often people will keep 
their goals fuzzy because one of the 

4
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:15,990
problems with specifying your goals as 
you specify your failures,

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,580
right?
If the goal is really fuzzy,

6
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:20,280
you're not sure when you fail and that 
then you can fool yourself.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,061
You know,
really,

8
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:25,650
but you can kind of keep it foggy,
but you make your goal sharp and clear,

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,540
then well,
first of all,

10
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,374
then you know what to aim at.
And what's interesting is you know your 

11
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:34,770
brain is set up so that it reorganizes 
the world around your aims.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,873
And that's not.
I've also written about this and 12 

13
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,480
rules for life quite extensively,
and that's not a.
