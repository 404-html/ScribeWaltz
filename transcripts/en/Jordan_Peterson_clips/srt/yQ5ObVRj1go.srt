1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,953
There are experiments where people's 
task is to pick up an object and they 

2
00:00:06,491 --> 00:00:09,990
can see the object in front of so you're
given the task.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,853
That's the basic story.
The story is what you're required to do 

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,203
is to transform yourself from the person
you are now into the person who has a 

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,353
possession that watch.
It's just the standard laboratory 

6
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:27,330
experiment,
but the watch is actually not there.

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,343
It's an image that's generated by 
mirrors and when you move towards the 

8
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:32,214
watch,
you find that it's not where it appears 

9
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:34,710
to be.
Well,

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,743
the fact of the object not being where 
it appears to be is an anomaly with 

11
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:45,510
regards to your current plan and you'll 
react to that emotion.

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,320
The first thing that'll happen is 
obviously you're going to be surprised,

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,213
right?
You think this is pretty easy on you to 

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,900
pick that up and you find out that thing
that you see as low actually there.

15
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,820
That's an anomaly.
You contrast at your desired future,

16
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:00,654
which was your aim when you moved your 
arm with the actual outcome of your 

17
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:05,094
actions,
so part of your brain called the 

18
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:07,344
hippocampus.
That seems to be responsible for 

19
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:11,214
comparing what's actually going on in so
far as you can interpret that with what 

20
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:15,714
you want to have and if,
if a mismatch occurs that sets up the 

21
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:20,624
whole sequence related to events and 
those events manifest themselves in 

22
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:29,340
emotion and in thought and in behave 
most evidently and emotion.

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,473
If you're going to do something,
they've done it before and it doesn't 

24
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:36,810
work out the way you expected it to be.
Events that constitute the anomaly,

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,660
the unexpected occurrence there are 
surprising,

26
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,810
and the question then is what does 
surprising mean?

27
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,003
Well,
it basically means that something 

28
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:49,980
threatening as occurred in something.

29
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,470
Something like,
so what does the unknown me?

30
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,670
Well,
the thing about them unknown is that you

31
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:58,830
don't know what it means.
It's pretty.

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,450
It's a pretty straightforward statement,
but you see that immediately.

33
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,623
That immediately introduced as a string 
sort of paradox because you lack 

34
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,400
infinite information for obviously 
people don't know what they're doing all

35
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:12,234
the time,
which means that you come into contact 

36
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:17,220
with things that you don't understand a 
lot and that means in a sense,

37
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,953
but you have to know what to do when you
don't know what to do because you don't 

38
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:26,240
know what to do a lot and that just 
doesn't just bring into a halt.

39
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,900
What is the case?
Then?

40
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,003
Your nervous system is hardwired to move
to a sort of default position when the 

41
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,940
plans to be explicit plans that you 
have,

42
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:39,120
that you're carrying out sale,
so as long as you could say in a sense,

43
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,163
as long as you know what you're doing,
which means that you have a 

44
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,760
representation of where you are and 
where you'd like to be.

45
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,863
You're carrying out your plans to make 
the move and things are going according 

46
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:51,120
to plan.
As long as you're doing that,

47
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:54,130
then the higher centers in your of your 
brain,

48
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,810
the cortex basically it's under control.
You know what you're doing.

49
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,200
You feel comfortable and secure.
As soon as something unexpected happens,

50
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,513
the control shifts,
and this is something that basically 

51
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:09,220
beyond your capacity to control whether 
you can interfere with the process,

52
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,263
control shifts from the cortical centers
to the more fundamental areas of the 

53
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:14,830
brain,
the limbic system.

54
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,670
When something unexpected happens,
two things occur.

55
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,743
You start to feel a little bit of 
anxiety and it's not unexpected 

56
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,060
occurrences.
It's really unexpected.

57
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:25,894
You'll be very,
very frightened because just minor 

58
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,820
something minor league unexpected.
You'll just stop.

59
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,120
Your sensory processing will heightened,
he'll gather more information and you'll

60
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:36,963
explore and as you explore,
you generate information and the 

61
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:41,680
information is supposed to bring me back
on course basically,

62
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:42,514
so you'll say what you'll do if you're 
trying to reach for the wash and you 

63
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:48,244
find out that it isn't great this while 
you'll start making different sorts of 

64
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:55,010
approach sequences until you end up 
producing the outcome that you attended.

65
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,113
When something unexpected occurs,
two sets of circuitry or activated one 

66
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:03,340
looks like it's dominated by the right 
hemisphere.

67
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,560
Now it looks like it's dominated by the 
left hemisphere.

68
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,210
Unexpected things make you anxious,
curious,

69
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,570
and you've been localized.
Those emotions in the body,

70
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:17,380
so to speak,
anxiety is the emotion that accompany is

71
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,360
the cessation of your body's clam 
directed activities.

72
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,983
Okay?
That's you could say that anxiety is 

73
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,360
what you feel when you slip into the 
motor.

74
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,830
Pause,
pause for further analysis.

75
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,740
What do you expect it to happen so you 
have to stop.

76
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,750
Curiosity is what you feel when it's 
necessary for you to explore further,

77
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:40,210
to gather new information,
to update your plans,

78
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,523
and exploration is basically governed by
the interplay of the circuitry brain 

79
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:47,080
circuitry that mediates anxiety and 
curiosity.

80
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,320
Curiosity,
by the way,

81
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:52,350
and that's associated with positive 
emotions and anxiety as you all know was

82
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,363
associated.

83
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,960
That's a negative emotion.
People would rather not experience it.

84
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,063
Curiosity or surprise is basically the 
juxtaposition of those two sets of 

85
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:01,894
emotions which work antagonistically.
The unknown produces conflict all by 

86
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:06,214
itself.
You have a hard wired response to the 

87
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,423
emergence of the unexpected.
You have to because they have to know 

88
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:13,040
what to do when something unexpected 
occurs.

89
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,013
It's instinct,
your instinctive response to the 

90
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:19,030
unknown.
It's anxiety plus curiosity,

91
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,953
which is to say cessation of ongoing 
motor activity plus a drive to move 

92
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:26,680
forward and explore and your exploratory
activities.

93
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:27,514
Actually the sum total of the activation
of the two sets of circuitry that 

94
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:33,960
mediate that response.
When you explore,

95
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:36,370
if you explore something unexpected 
happens,

96
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:37,204
you don't have to explore,
you can note it and get the hell out of 

97
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:39,964
there safe,
but you don't gather any new 

98
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:44,350
information.
It's a good short term strategy.

99
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,330
It's not a good long term strategy,
but anyways,

100
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:50,440
the point is the surprise activities,
curiosity,

101
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,810
and it tells you 40 generate new 
information,

102
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:53,644
you update your plan,
and soon you can get to where you want 

103
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:56,164
it to go.
The point is the mismatch between what 

104
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:02,420
you expect to happen and what actually 
happens.

105
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,660
That explains it.
