1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,520
For those who are very creative but high
in neuroticism,

2
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:06,210
how should one work to gain emotional 
stability in order to go out into chaos,

3
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:08,640
to do more creative things?
That's a really good question.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,040
You know what I learned about that by 
reading Young's works on El Camino,

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:13,883
weirdly enough.
And so back again in graduate school 

6
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:16,854
when I was writing,
starting to write maps of meaning and 

7
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:20,310
really tearing myself apart 
psychologically.

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,173
I'm trying to understand evil,
I suppose the evil of the Cold War and 

9
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:28,400
the evil of the individuals who compose 
Nazi Germany in Stalinist,

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,930
Russia.
Um,

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,600
um,
I,

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,780
I was reading Carl Jung because he,
he,

13
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:34,663
he wrote his tracks on alchemy where a 
lot about self transformation and he 

14
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:39,240
talked about,
uh,

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,730
it's hard to explain his works on 
Alchemy,

16
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:45,750
but suffice it to say that his advice 
was something like,

17
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:46,584
the advice he derived from the alchemist
was that if you were going to make mess 

18
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:52,410
around with very complicated and 
dangerous matters,

19
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,760
that's a good way of putting it.

20
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,190
That you should really put your life 
together.

21
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:57,024
And so I would say the right way to deal
with your neuroticism is to increase 

22
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:00,834
your conscientiousness because we also 
know that the higher your 

23
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:04,164
conscientiousness,
the lower your neuroticism 

24
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,100
conscientiousness does seem to keep 
neuroticism and check.

25
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,680
And so I would say,
and have said this to many people,

26
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,130
I'm clean your room.
Organize your life like get a routine.

27
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,980
Get up everyday at the same time,
go to bed at the same time.

28
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,160
Establish disciplined habits.
And that will help a lot schedule like.

29
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:27,000
And here's how to use a schedule.
Use a,

30
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,890
use a calendar.
I use Google calendar,

31
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:32,130
but don't use it as a tyrant.
You know what you want to use your.
