Dr peterson,
I'm considering going into the education

2
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:03,744
stream slash system.
Do you have any advice for me not to 

3
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:10,050
become a mouthpiece for indoctrinating 
young students?

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,443
Well,
one thing I would recommend is that you 

5
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:17,910
don't write essays that you don't 
believe in.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:19,883
I think that's a sin.
I think it's a sin to use your words 

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,323
falsely and the reason for that,
like there's a good series of social 

8
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:31,020
psychology experiments that show,
like imagine that you bring someone into

9
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:31,854
a lab and you have them write an essay 
about or fill out a questionnaire about 

10
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,410
their political opinions.
You know,

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,400
so you get a baseline measure of their 
political stance and then you asked them

12
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:44,010
to write a thousand words.
Maybe they identify as,

13
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:44,844
right,
wait,

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,833
and then you get them to write a 
thousand word essay on why a particular 

15
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:53,271
left wing position is true and then you 
have them come back in two weeks and you

16
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:55,430
give them the same political belief 
questionnaire.

17
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,283
They'll,
they'll have shifted quite radically 

18
00:00:58,021 --> 00:00:58,854
towards the left.
And the reason for that is that people 

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,530
don't think through their positions in 
great detail.

20
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,000
And so if you get them to think through 
a contrary position in great detail.
