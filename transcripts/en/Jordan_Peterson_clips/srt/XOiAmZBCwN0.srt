1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,770
Everyone knows that we are social 
identities and ideological identities,

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,760
their religious or cultural,
intellectual,

3
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:06,594
whatever.
Nobody's really paid much attention to 

4
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:12,240
studying how the representations of that
cultural identity,

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,423
um,
alter the manner in which we feel 

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:17,703
emotion,
which English is perceived by which we 

7
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,354
act.
I'm interested in how our internal 

8
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:26,040
representations of our culture modulator
or emotional expression,

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,950
that's the best way to say no.
Your brain basically,

10
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:33,440
it's programmed as your social lives.
That's what socialization is for.

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,583
Obviously it's socialization that 
instills cultural identity and equally 

12
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:37,974
obviously the process of socialization 
that leads to cultural identity has to 

13
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:42,404
have some impact on the way you think.
Obviously lay that on the way that your 

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,123
mind functions and the way that your 
brain functions and see North American 

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,833
neuropsychologists have been loath to 
give any consideration to this sort of 

16
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:55,764
notion to think that cultural 
transformations might have some direct 

17
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:03,330
impact on physiological function by the 
time the Russians.

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,853
By contrast,
this has been a central tenant of their 

19
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:08,420
nurse neuro psychological theories.
Basically since,

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,683
since day one.
This is particularly true with regards 

21
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:14,700
to Alexander learning and the God.
See,

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,200
now you can think about this.
It's quite obvious if you think about it

23
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:19,763
for a second,
with regards to something like the 

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,270
capacity to read silently.
Now here's the case that what?

25
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,560
This is a relatively new talent.
Literacy is a new talent,

26
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:29,394
right?
Most people aren't able to read 500 

27
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:31,314
years ago.
It's only been 500 years and only for a 

28
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:34,554
little bit of that,
that the capacity to read has been 

29
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:41,271
widespread and the capacity to read 
silently as a relatively new development

30
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,650
in human history.
Now it's a good thing if you think about

31
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:45,484
it,
but nonetheless the capacity to read 

32
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:50,760
silently localized to a specific part of
the brain,

33
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:51,594
which is to say it's as if you have a 
part of the brain that's evolved for 

34
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:56,040
that purpose.

35
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,083
It's the same place and everybody more 
or less their individual variations or 

36
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:02,280
differences when people are allowed to 
realize differently,

37
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:05,360
but all that aside,
if you learn to read,

38
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,203
there was a party of this specializes 
for that and it's pretty much the same 

39
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:09,444
place and everyone and it wasn't there 
or wasn't doing that sort of Bot 

40
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,210
activity.
Two thousand years ago,

41
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:16,470
in fact,
I read at one point,

42
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:17,304
I don't know where the reference to this
is like so many things that I make 

43
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:21,624
reference to,
but I've had at one point that people 

44
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:23,874
thought Julius Caesar was a magician in 
part and he was obviously a remarkable 

45
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:27,684
person,
but in part because he can read 

46
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,200
silently,
he didn't have to read aloud,

47
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,540
so it wasn't just reading.
It was remarkable.

48
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,190
It was being able to read without 
talking.

49
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,683
Anyways,
the point of all this is that your 

50
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:41,560
brain,
this is learning.

51
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,060
His view of the brain fundamentally is 
your brain is an organ that produces sub

52
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:47,270
organs,
culturally specific subordinates,

53
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,143
not since that's it's remarkable 
capacity is that it can generate new 

54
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,670
molecules that are specialized for 
certain tasks.

55
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,100
As a consequence of environmental 
program.

56
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,023
This is an interesting notion which is 
to say that at some level of 

57
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:07,660
physiological analysis,
at least your culture determines how you

58
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:08,530
bring worse.
Now,

59
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,930
it's very plastic.
Your brain is very plastic.

60
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:11,764
When were a child,
you can sustain immense amounts of 

61
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:15,460
critical damage.
In childhood.

62
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,590
I still grow up normally.
For example,

63
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,650
if you're a very,
very epileptic as a child,

64
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,580
sometimes what surgeons will do is take 
out a whole hemisphere,

65
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,653
the right hemisphere on and children who
have hysterectomy is if they're done 

66
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:31,570
young enough,
still brought to be relatively normal,

67
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,700
quite normal.
In fact,

68
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:36,400
in the other cases too,
where people are hydrocephalic,

69
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:40,840
which basically means that they're 
ventricles don't vamped properly,

70
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,933
um,
and cerebral spinal fluid builds up in 

71
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:44,670
the scouts.

72
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,440
These people often have stalls that are 
slightly larger than normal,

73
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,770
not necessarily obvious,
but what steel case.

74
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,693
And they ended up with a skull.
It's essentially full of liquid with a 

75
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,714
very,
very thin layer of brain tissue around 

76
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:58,264
this is all liquid and there are a 
number of case reports of people who 

77
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:04,354
have like five percent of the fishing 
tact who have high functioning 

78
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:09,580
intelligence.
His normal personality,

79
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:12,820
so point is your,
especially the higher cortical levels of

80
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:16,190
your brain are very,
very functionally flexible.

81
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:18,480
We can childhood now by the time you 
have adult,

82
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,940
you know,
the pattern changes a little bit.

83
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,680
Guy Of looks like your brain dies into 
it's adult configuration.

84
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:27,840
That's an interesting at which is to say
you have way more neurons need,

85
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,630
especially right before you're born and 
environment,

86
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,480
prunes your brain down to its adult 
configuration,

87
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,800
so of course you develop connections as 
well,

88
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:39,634
but if you lose a lot of neurons,
so by the time you're an adult you're 

89
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,124
brain is nowhere near as flexible as it 
was when you were a child and if you 

90
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:47,864
have sustained damage to certain parts 
of you that are already specialized 

91
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:51,994
while you hold any,
have the damage and you can work around 

92
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,363
it,
but it can still be really prominent 

93
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,370
question.

94
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,040
So that's sort of the market and it's.
Yeah,

95
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,900
that's right because the brain adapts or
as the body.

96
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,570
That's a great comment.
You know,

97
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,460
and if you start thinking about that,
it has really revolutionary implication.

98
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:10,930
So you can say,
for example,

99
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,973
if I have an idea that's really radical 
in the sense that changes the 

100
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:19,300
configuration of my core tasks,
I can transmit that maybe not to you.

101
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,610
Maybe your brain is already fixed,
so to speak.

102
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:24,340
Put down the generations and altered the
structure of brains,

103
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:25,450
hand sports.
So you could say,

104
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:26,284
well,
ideas can spread through a population 

105
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:30,480
that way.
That's a lamarckian spread.

106
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,030
Even more interesting,
I think this is speculative of course,

107
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:39,031
but let's say that there are certain 
types of revolutions in thought that are

108
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:42,190
actually the consequences of biological 
mutations.

109
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,370
So you could sing that well,
you're a particularly odd sort of person

110
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:48,010
from the genetic perspective and as a 
consequence you think,

111
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:49,930
and a very,
very unique matter.

112
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,063
But the thing that's so interesting is 
that if you can still communicate those 

113
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:57,100
thoughts,
then the effect of that genetic mutation

114
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,680
be transmitted throughout the population
without any biological alteration at the

115
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:03,800
genetic level at all.
So that's really something,

116
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,173
something that's interesting because it 
means that the consequences of genetic 

117
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:09,494
mutation.
So in competition can spread throughout 

118
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,010
the population is fast as communication 
could move.

119
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,960
So that's,
yeah,

120
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,170
the Lamarckian everybody know what the 
transmission is.

121
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,183
Well,
Lamarck was the character who thought 

122
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:21,524
that the reason that that you could,
you can transmit acquired 

123
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:28,550
characteristics.
So the reason drafts at Lomax is because

124
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,120
it kept trying to stretch their next 
basically.

125
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,233
So,
and they transmitted the capacity to do 

126
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:35,114
stretching to their offspring so you can
transmit acquired characteristics down 

127
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:40,790
the genetic line,
but there's no,

128
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,290
you can't do that.
That's wrong.

129
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,124
But that's what Lamar thought.
But he wasn't completely wrong because 

130
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:45,944
there is.
That is how this sort of transmission 

131
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:50,930
works.
It's non genetically mediated cumulation

132
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:54,470
of biological resources.
So that's very interesting.
