1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,440
Sure,
George Gabriel on drugs says,

2
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:05,460
Jordan,
please help me.

3
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:09,900
I'm 99th percentile of openness and zero
with percentile and conscientiousness.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,020
Yeah.
Well,

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,180
how old are you?
That's the first thing.

6
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,470
If you're,
if you're young,

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,663
that's um,
because younger people are less 

8
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:20,904
conscientious.
So that's one thing to keep in mind if 

9
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:26,760
you're very open like that,
you need to be doing something creative,

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,250
but you're going to have to learn how to
discipline yourself.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,173
There's just no way around it.
And I would say go do the future 

12
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:33,174
authoring program.
That's a good start and you'll have to 

13
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:36,414
learn how to schedule your time then and
how to get up at the same time everyday 

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,120
and it's going to be a real struggle,
but you know,

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,890
you,
you can do it.

16
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:47,110
I've had students who were very high in 
openness and low in conscientiousness,

17
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,080
his graduate students and they 
disciplined themselves.

18
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,780
You need to find something that you're 
really interested in that you're willing

19
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:54,270
to pursue and then you have to hit it 
hard.

20
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,630
Um,
so that's what I would say,

21
00:00:57,631 --> 00:00:58,464
but do the future authoring program and 
get yourself a plan and start to 

22
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:01,824
implement it.
And every time you fall astray then get 

23
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:06,360
back at it.
And you know,

24
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:09,990
you may have to build up your 
conscientiousness over a number of years

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,850
and,
but it's worth doing.

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,713
So.
