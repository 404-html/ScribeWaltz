1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,390
So what I've been trying to do with my 
videos and,

2
00:00:02,391 --> 00:00:03,224
and,
and,

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,220
and I think this is part of the reason 
that they've become so popular,

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,420
in fact,
I'm certain of it,

5
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:08,254
is that I've been trying to agitate for 
the adoption of that personal 

6
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:14,680
responsibility as an alternative to 
political ideology.

7
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:18,550
It's like get your act together,
have a vision,

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,090
straighten out your life.
Say what you think,

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,983
you know,
stay away from the ideological idiocies 

10
00:00:24,521 --> 00:00:27,940
and simplicity and oversimplifications 
and try to put yourself together.

11
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:31,720
Because I think that I do believe at the
most fundamental level,

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,490
and I think this is the remarkable 
realization of Western civilization,

13
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:37,324
is that the well developed individual is
the antidote to the tyranny of society 

14
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:42,274
and biology.
I think that's our great discovery in 

15
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:47,050
the West.
It's not like other cultures haven't had

16
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:47,884
that idea in nascent form,
but it's been hyper developed in the 

17
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:54,610
west and I think it's right.
And so we abandoned that,

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,430
that,
that pathway of divine individuality and

19
00:00:57,431 --> 00:01:00,460
revert to ideological identification of 
race or sex.

20
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:01,294
We're going to tear each other apart.
And I think part of the reason we're 

21
00:01:03,551 --> 00:01:04,810
motivated to do that,
Joe,

22
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:05,644
is because many people don't want to 
bear the responsibility of developing 

23
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:11,050
themselves as individuals,
so they'll,

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,320
they'll shuffle off the responsibility.
And if that means that you know,

25
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:16,900
we're dancing in the streets because 
everything's on fire,

26
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:17,734
that'll be just fine.
And that's another thing that's adding 

27
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,760
to the terrible danger that we're in 
right now.

28
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,253
So.
