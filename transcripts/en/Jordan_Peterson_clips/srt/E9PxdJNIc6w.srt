1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,930
Thing about free speech is that like I'm
not a free speech advocate.

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:04,764
Let's say I'm a true speech advocate,
which is to say that I believe that 

3
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:11,640
people should say what they believe to 
be true.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,700
I think that's.
That's your obligation.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,730
It's also you're right,
but it comes with an obligation,

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,803
but I don't believe that true speech as 
possible without free speech because 

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,913
you're just not very good at thinking 
and so you have to stumble around when 

8
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:27,084
you were first formulating ideas and 
wander into territory that's not 

9
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,654
necessarily productive and manifest your
biases and in short you have to be a 

10
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:34,614
fool and the only way that you you 
improve upon that performances by well 

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,533
first of all,
stumbling through it to begin with and 

12
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:41,634
then second,
by observing carefully what sort of 

13
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:47,430
reactions you're getting and having a 
dialogue around it so that you can start

14
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:48,264
to sharpen up your ideas and improve 
their focus and find out where you've 

15
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:53,070
made a mistake and all of those things.

16
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,903
So a lot of what's necessary with 
regards to thinking is the freedom to 

17
00:00:57,361 --> 00:01:00,990
make mistakes because what are you going
to do it right the first time?

18
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:04,050
I don't think so.
And you know,

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,360
that's why for Carl Young,
for example,

20
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:08,820
the fool was a mythological precursor to
the,

21
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:09,743
to the hero,
the tricksters and mythological 

22
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:13,320
precursor to the hero.
Because unless you're willing to stumble

23
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:15,380
around badly to begin with,
you know,

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,840
and to be a fool when you first start 
doing something which is always the case

25
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:19,674
when you're learning something new,
then you're not going to make any 

26
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:23,250
progress.
And so practically speaking,

27
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,410
free speech has to be as untrammeled as 
possible so that people can be wrong and

28
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:29,244
they can be biased and they can still 
express their opinions including their 

29
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:32,514
darker ones and then allow themselves to
be subject partly to improvement by the 

30
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:37,890
world.

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,980
Because if you say things that are too 
stupid and then act the mouth,

32
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:41,814
the world's smacks you a good one.
But there's also the social 

33
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:45,714
intermediaries,
the other people that you're 

34
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:48,840
communicating with who will also do the 
same thing.

35
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,063
You know,
and we're always broadcasting 

36
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:52,644
information at each other,
constantly trying to shape each other's 

37
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:55,734
behavior and what we're trying to do is 
to bring forth from other people that 

38
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:02,490
which we would like to see them 
manifest.

39
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:03,324
And so there's an implicit ideal as well
that people are broadcasting at each 

40
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:07,164
other all the time and there's 
tremendous social pressure generally 

41
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:11,334
speaking,
to manifest that implicit ideal as 

42
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:14,394
closely as possible because otherwise 
people disapprove of you or lack 

43
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,230
interest in what you're saying or 
criticize you or and so on.

44
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,083
And you have to be allowed to be exposed
to that kind of corrective feedback 

45
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,144
because otherwise you drift and,
and you'll become subject to your own 

46
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,190
idiosyncratic insanity.

47
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:32,961
And I mean,
I,

48
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:35,700
I've seen that very many times in my 
clinical practice because,

49
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,571
well,
first of all,

50
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:39,990
I have some isolated people that come to
see me and all they do is talk.

51
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,363
I just listen.
I mean because they don't have anyone 

52
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:47,340
else around and they need someone to run
their narrative by,

53
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,233
to keep their minds organized.
They can't do it themselves and they 

54
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,340
can't do it without listening to 
themselves talk.

55
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:57,270
Even because for most people talking is 
how they think and,

56
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,620
and talking socially is even more how 
they think.

57
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:00,454
And I mean that literally.
I don't mean that metaphorically is 

58
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,124
that,
and I think that's true for almost 

59
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:05,340
everyone,
you know,

60
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,060
I mean there are people who are trained 
academically who can actually think,

61
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,013
but to think you have to divide yourself
into subpersonalities I suppose each of 

62
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:17,080
which has a differing opinion,
uh,

63
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:19,210
well elucidated differing opinion.

64
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,283
And then you have to let those different
elements of your personality have an 

65
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:25,210
internal dialogue and you have to draw 
conclusions from that.

66
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,550
It's very,
very difficult for people to do that.

67
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:30,580
And we radically overestimate the degree
to which they do.

68
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,933
Um,
young said at one point that people 

69
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:34,414
don't think so much is as thoughts 
appear in their head and they believe 

70
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:38,494
that the,
which I think is a much more accurate 

71
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:42,670
way of describing the,
the general.

72
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,780
Because true thought is not only that 
the thoughts arise in your mind,

73
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,780
it's that you look at the thought and 
then you critique it,

74
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,663
right?
You have to separate yourself from the 

75
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:54,170
thought and decide whether or not it's 
valuable.

76
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,620
Now it's more like an editing function 
and you know,

77
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,510
it takes a long time to be a good 
editor,

78
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,390
a tremendous amount of time and it just 
doesn't happen.

79
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,530
Generally speaking so well.
So I would say,

80
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:06,364
well,
without free speech there's no true 

81
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:09,070
thought.
And then you might say,

82
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:09,904
well,
who the hell cares whether or not we 

83
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:14,350
think,
and I think the answer to that is fairly

84
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,400
straightforward.
I mean,

85
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,010
you might think it's so obvious that it 
doesn't need explanation,

86
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:21,580
but there are very few things that are 
so obvious they don't need explanation.

87
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,773
So the reason you think is so that the 
world doesn't smack you as hard as it 

88
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:28,120
might fundamentally,
you know,

89
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:28,954
and,
and I really mean this technically 

90
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,420
because the way that people evolved the 
capacity to thought for thought was that

91
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,260
the prefrontal cortex which mediates a 
lot of,

92
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,450
of,
of voluntary linguistic ability actually

93
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:44,140
emerged over the course of evolutionary 
history out of the motor cortex.

94
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:47,680
And so that's a very interesting thing 
to understand because it means that,

95
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,793
you know,
animals basically think by moving and 

96
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:54,130
the problem with that is if you think by
moving and you make the wrong move,

97
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,070
then your dad,
whereas what human beings can do is they

98
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:57,904
can generate fictional avatars of 
themselves in fictional worlds and they 

99
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:05,980
can run the avatars as simulations and 
the ones that get killed,

100
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:07,810
they don't express in behavior.

101
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,000
And I mean you could do that with words 
too,

102
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:13,180
although people know originally would 
have done it mostly with images.

103
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:17,620
They do the same thing with drama.
And so the reason that you think,

104
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,483
and I think it was George,
was it Alfred North Whitehead that said 

105
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:22,631
this,
I think,

106
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:23,464
but I'm not absolutely sure.
The reason you think is so that your 

107
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:28,850
thoughts can die instead of you.
And that's a brilliant,

108
00:05:28,851 --> 00:05:29,684
so brilliant,
brilliant phrase and absolutely the 

109
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:34,870
case.
So if you think properly,

110
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,800
then you kill off.
The idea is that if you act it out would

111
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:39,634
kill you or at least cause you suffering
or perhaps caused suffering to the 

112
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:46,540
people around you.
And since it's more or less obvious,

113
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,374
a priority,
that suffering is worse than not 

114
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:49,744
suffering under most circumstances,
it seems reasonable to act in a manner 

115
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:56,440
that will minimize it to the degree that
that's possible.

116
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,543
And so you need clarity of thought 
because that helps guide you through a 

117
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:04,940
world that's in shrouded in fog and full
of sharp objects.

118
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:09,110
And if you don't want to stumble into 
them and impale yourself,

119
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,190
then you should have sharp vision and 
sharp capacity to communicate.

120
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,470
You know,
that's one of the things I tell students

121
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:16,304
when I'm trying to teach them to write 
because they had no one ever tells them 

122
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:19,094
why they should learn to write.
It's like you learn to write so you can 

123
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:25,340
think and you learn to think so that the
world doesn't treat you any more harshly

124
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:28,310
than it absolutely has to.
And that's no joke.

125
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,540
You know?
And if you,

126
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,340
if you're a person who's been around a 
bit,

127
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:35,540
you see very rapidly that people who 
sharpen their arguments properly and can

128
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:39,110
articulate their position and defendant 
are always,

129
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,440
always the people who are most 
successful and most compelling.

130
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:43,274
And that.
And that changed the way structures 

131
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,670
function and and that also helped things
continue in the proper path when they're

132
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:50,504
running down the proper path.
It's no joke to be articulate and to be 

133
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:57,020
able to think there isn't anything 
that's more powerful than that.
