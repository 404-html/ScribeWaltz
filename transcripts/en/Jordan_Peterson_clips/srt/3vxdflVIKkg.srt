To what extent do you think your tips 
for young people clean your room mate 

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,920
deschedule read great books are 
predicated on your own personality?

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,713
Well,
I think they're predicated on my 

4
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:13,024
personality to some degree.
I think that a lot of my 

5
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:19,030
conscientiousness such as it is,
has been learned.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,330
I think our disciplined myself,
particularly in graduate school,

7
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:27,310
so I don't think it was necessarily an 
intrinsic part of my personality.

8
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:28,144
I think it's something that I learned to
do because I felt that I had something 

9
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:32,830
that was worthwhile to do.
So,

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,223
um,
it's very difficult to answer it beyond 

11
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:40,360
that because,
you know,

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,270
I am affected by my own personality 
obviously.

13
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:44,104
Although I think that I give advice 
that's pretty balanced across all the 

14
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:48,430
dimensions,
you know,

15
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:49,264
like I think that you should be capable 
of speaking in public fluently and that 

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,970
you should be able to communicate with 
groups of people.

17
00:00:57,971 --> 00:01:00,970
I think that you should be able to be 
solitary work on your own.

18
00:01:00,971 --> 00:01:01,804
So that covers it.
