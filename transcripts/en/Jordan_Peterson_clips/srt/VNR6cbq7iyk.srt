1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,103
I read the story was not a biography,
if I remember correctly of the of the 

2
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:07,920
captain.
I might be wrong about that,

3
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:09,300
but I've got the basic story,
right?

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,940
Well,
they had a ship wreck and the Antarctica

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,740
was then they were there for a whole 
year in the Antarctic,

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,730
you know,
and none of them died.

7
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:19,410
Not One.
He didn't lose a single man,

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,543
not one.
He kept the morale high and then they 

9
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:22,764
took this boat that was on the ship and 
they crossed like 400 miles of the 

10
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:27,600
roughest ocean,
the roughest,

11
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:29,970
frigid ocean in the world,
right.

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,720
You don't go in that ocean.
And then they went to an island and they

13
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:34,554
walked across the island across these 
mountains that no one else has ever 

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,813
climbed since,
and they went to the city on the other 

15
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:42,444
side of the island and they got a boat 
and they went and rescued their 

16
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,110
compatriots and everyone survived.

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,810
It's like endurance is the name of the 
book.

18
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,160
You read that book,
man.

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,630
You think,
wow,

20
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,760
people are really tough.
You know,

21
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:58,230
and if it's ridiculous.
So who knows how tough you are and maybe

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,680
you find out by going out to find out 
how tough you are,

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,180
right?
So you take on a challenge,

24
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,950
one that you think you can master,
just that's just a bit beyond your grasp

25
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,200
and you master it and then your little 
tougher and you think,

26
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:11,730
hey,
that worked out pretty well,

27
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,773
and so then you're more of a monster and
then you go out and you find another 

28
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:16,920
challenge that's even bigger and you 
think,

29
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:19,950
well maybe I can do that too,
and then all of a sudden you can and you

30
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:20,784
get a little bit bigger and God only 
knows what the limit is of you and you 

31
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:27,420
find out by pushing yourself against the
world.

32
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,040
And of course that's what Abraham is 
doing.

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,533
And so see,
we're very pessimistic us more than 

34
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:38,400
people were pessimistic about humanity.
That's for sure.

35
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:42,330
Dismal,
wretched planet destroying cancer on the

36
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:43,021
planet,
right?

37
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:47,580
As the club of Rome described us so 
pleasantly back in the 19 sixties,

38
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:48,600
you know,
and,

39
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:51,330
and I don't know,
maybe we're ashamed of the Cold War.

40
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,490
Maybe we're ashamed of all the 
destruction.

41
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:56,010
In the 20th century and the hydrogen 
bomb and,

42
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,180
and the,
you know,

43
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,043
the continuing catastrophes of our 
societies and were deeply ashamed of 

44
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:02,580
that and ashamed of ourselves 
personally,

45
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,530
but it's a hell of a thing to,
you know,

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,393
call us a cancer on the planet.
There's just no excuse for that because 

47
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:09,054
what you do with cancer is eradicated.
And I don't think that that's a very 

48
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:13,314
noble motive personally.
And I think it says a lot about the 

49
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:18,474
people who would use such phraseology 
that they would dare to conceptualize 

50
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:22,230
humanity in that manner.

51
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,173
But you know,
it'd be nice if we could be optimistic 

52
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:29,730
and I think began the problem with being
optimistic is that it's naive.

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,490
So then the question is,
is there an optimism that's not naive?

54
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:33,324
And I think there is and the optimism 
that's not naive isn't just a 

55
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,980
visualization of how strong people can 
be.

56
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,053
So one of the things that I tell people,
I've told my students in my class in 

57
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:49,050
maps of meaning,
here's a goal.

58
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,483
You want to be the person at the funeral
of your father that everyone can rely 

59
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,400
on.
How would that be?

60
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,840
You want to be the person who's broken 
and,

61
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,993
and,
and useless and adding to the misery in 

62
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:02,740
the corner.
And look,

63
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,880
I'm not making light of people's grief,
you know,

64
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:10,480
I understand grief,
but who do you want to be when there's a

65
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,550
crisis,
right?

66
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:15,400
Do you want to be the person that 
everyone can turn to for strength?

67
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,810
It's like,
why the hell not?

68
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,370
Why not?
That is a goal.

69
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,460
That would be a good goal because then 
if there's a crisis and there will be,

70
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:22,294
it won't be such a bloody crisis because
there'll be someone there that can deal 

71
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:25,654
with it,

72
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,633
you know?
So when I went and talked to these 

73
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:31,570
people at the funeral home,
I envisioned that I thought,

74
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:32,404
okay,
well this is something you have to 

75
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:35,980
contend with.
If you're going to be alive and adult,

76
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,173
you have to contend with death and 
suffering and you have to be ready for 

77
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:41,314
it and you have to be there for the 
person because that's all they're going 

78
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:48,820
to have.
And so there's a goal man.

79
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,190
And in this time of nihilism,
you know what's,

80
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,083
what's the point of life?
People ask and they're taught that at 

81
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,160
universities.
What's the point of life?

82
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,410
Everything's interpretation.
Humanities.

83
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:01,810
A cancer on the planet,
you know?

84
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,370
Well,
how about no?

85
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,360
How about not that?
How about the do something to us.
