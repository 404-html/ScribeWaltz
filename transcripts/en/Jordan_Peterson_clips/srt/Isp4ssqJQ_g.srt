1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,680
I think one thing we should have learned
from the 20th century,

2
00:00:02,681 --> 00:00:03,514
but of course didn't was that there is 
something extraordinary dangerous about 

3
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:11,170
totalitarian utopian visions at 
something Dostoevsky wrote about,

4
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:14,410
by the way,
in his great book notes from underground

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,273
because Dostoevsky had figured out by 
the early 19 hundreds that there was 

6
00:00:18,911 --> 00:00:22,330
something very,
very pathological about a utopian vision

7
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:23,164
of perfection,
that it was profoundly anti human and 

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,210
and notes and notes from underground.
He demolishes the notion of Utopia.

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,710
One of the things he says that I loved,
it's so brilliant,

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,753
he said,
imagine that you brought the socialist 

11
00:00:35,831 --> 00:00:36,664
utopia into being and dusty FCC says 
that human beings had nothing to do 

12
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,123
except

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,473
eat,

14
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,463
drink,
and busy themselves with the 

15
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:48,204
continuation of the species.
He said that the first thing that would 

16
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:53,514
happen under circumstances like that 
would be that human beings would go mad 

17
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:58,674
and break the system,
smash it just so that something 

18
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:02,214
unexpected and crazy could happen 
because human beings don't want Utopian 

19
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:07,464
comfort and certainty.
They want adventure and chaos and 

20
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:11,544
uncertainty,
and so that the very notion of a utopia 

21
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:18,840
was anti human because we're not built 
for static utopia.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,513
We're built for a dynamic situation 
where there's demands placed on us and 

23
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:33,010
we're the optimal amount of uncertainty.
Well,

24
00:01:33,371 --> 00:01:34,204
we know what happened in the 20th 
century as a consequence of the 

25
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:39,640
widespread promulgation of Utopian 
schemes,

26
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,013
and what happened was a ham on a scale 
that had never been matched in the 

27
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:46,774
entire history of humanity,
and that's really saying something 

28
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:54,301
because there was plenty of mayhem 
before the 20th century.

29
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,960
I guess there wasn't as much industrial 
clout behind it.
