00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,040
How do you feel?
I know that people make this association

2
00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:05,770
with you because I've seen it when we 
have guests come on,

3
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:06,604
we have a thread on our reddit and 
people post their questions and I've 

4
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:10,114
seen it before people associate you with
pandering to like white supremacists or 

5
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:16,444
worse.
I've even seen the suggestion that you 

6
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:21,010
are a white supremace per supremacist 
yourself.

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,070
So how do you feel about that?
And that's,

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,320
that seems to be like a somewhat widely 
held.

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,600
Well,
I don't want to think about that.

10
00:00:28,601 --> 00:00:30,580
It's completely ridiculous.
Like for example,

11
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:31,414
I'm the member of A.
I'm an honorary member of a native 

12
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:35,920
American tribe.
I got inducted last year.

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,650
I have an Indian name,
a native American name,

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,710
like it's completely preposterous and 
I've been buying carvings from this like

15
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,563
isolated tribe in northern Vancouver for
northern northern Vancouver Island for 

16
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:48,190
15 years,
you know?

17
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:51,280
And so and I've had lot might.
Well it's,

18
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,610
it's preposterous.
And,

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,600
and I mean the,
the,

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,613
the,
there's evidence that it's preposterous 

21
00:00:56,021 --> 00:01:01,021
and the evidence is that I have 260 
videos on youtube and they must total at

22
00:01:01,331 --> 00:01:04,300
least 600 hours,
something like that.

23
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,493
And you know,
by now people have been over them 

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,673
essentially with a fine tooth comb.
Virtually everything I've said in my 

25
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:15,070
classes to my students in the last 25 
years is on video.

26
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,413
And so if there was anything in there 
that was even remotely associated with 

27
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:21,450
that,
it would come out and,

28
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,353
but it's even worse than that because 
it's actually the opposite because the 

29
00:01:25,991 --> 00:01:26,824
reason I've been teaching students for 
since 1993 about the Holocaust and what 

30
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:35,250
happened in the Soviet Union,
you know,

31
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:40,150
and I've been trying to make them 
understand how that's associated with,

32
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,523
with the unwillingness to accept 
personal responsibility and educating 

33
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,830
them as deeply as I can about the 
horrors of,

34
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,230
of,
of exactly that sort of thing.

35
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,090
I could say obsessed me ever since I 
was,

36
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,010
while ever since I was very,
very young.

37
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,070
And so not only is it not true,
it's,

38
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,850
it's anti true,
it's seriously untrue.

39
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,903
Right.
