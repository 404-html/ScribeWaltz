00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,120
The cynical attitude towards prayer is 
something like asking God for favors,

2
00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:05,954
and then of course the cynical analysis 
of that is that if you ask God for 

3
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:10,424
favors,
like he won't help you find your lost 

4
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:14,090
wallet,
generally speaking,

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,300
no,
but that isn't.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,493
If you're.
If you take a bit of a more 

7
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:20,084
sophisticated approach to it,
you know what you're doing if you pray 

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,420
is that you.
You formulate a question and you,

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,850
you wait for an answer like a prayer 
might be,

10
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:32,684
okay,
I would like to do the best thing I 

11
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:35,804
could with my life.
Now you have to open yourself up to 

12
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:40,160
that.
That's to knock the door will open.

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,230
I would like to do the best thing with 
my life.

14
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,483
What might that be?
Now you could say that you're thinking 

15
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:47,354
when you say that are you are.
You could say that you're leaving 

16
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,670
yourself open for revelation or an 
intuition,

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,953
but you're communing with whatever it is
that enables you to receive wisdom and 

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,840
you can attribute all of that to you or 
you can attribute it to your brain,

19
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:04,160
I suppose,
but you're.

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,370
You're really communing with the 
structure of the cosmos when you're,

21
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,293
when you're asking such a question and 
especially if you do it properly and 

22
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,253
it's really useful to do that and it's 
really necessary because it orients you 

23
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,050
properly.
So yeah,

24
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:22,040
the demise of prayer when prayer is 
considered in a sophisticated manner,

25
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,623
which is,
do I commune with the better part of 

26
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:26,990
myself,
let's say,

27
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,600
to determine how I should orient myself 
in the world?

28
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:31,670
It's a catastrophic loss not to do that.
