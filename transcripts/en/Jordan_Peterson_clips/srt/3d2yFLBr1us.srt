1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,160
I saw you tweet this recently and it 
really,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,380
uh,
shook me a little bit.

3
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:06,210
I was shocked.
I was shocked to see this.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,650
I like this one a lot.
I'll introduce this.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:11,823
So,
so you said those who consider 

6
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:13,704
themselves my enemies had been posting 
these all around my home neighborhood 

7
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:18,750
and it says here,
Community Safety Bulletin,

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,763
Jordan Pearson,
a local man teaching at the University 

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,880
of Toronto has been championing against 
the human rights of women,

10
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:25,830
people of color,
Muslims and l,

11
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:28,380
G,
b t people for over a year.

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,453
Peterson has opened association with Neo
Nazis and the outright even being 

13
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:32,724
referred to as a Nazi philosopher by the
leader of the new constitution party of 

14
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:39,230
Canada due to pressure from Jordan 
Peterson's alright.

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,073
Fan Base,
the University of Toronto has not taken 

16
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:44,670
any action to fire him or disavow his 
attacks on minority groups.

17
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:45,840
Look,
this is awful.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,730
I mean that's something where there's a 
bunch of things about it that I really,

19
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,310
that,
that are really creative.

20
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,143
Let's say the first is they posted it in
my neighborhood which is really nasty 

21
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,980
and it's really underhanded.
And,

22
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,090
and,
and,

23
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,450
and like thoughtfully.
So,

24
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,550
you know,
there's a double message there,

25
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:06,384
it's like we know where you are,
we know where your family is and we're 

26
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:10,720
perfectly willing to,
um,

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,810
make that known and to hypothetically 
embarrass you in front of your neighbors

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,100
and the community safety bulletin,
that's really a little stroke of genius,

29
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:21,780
you know,
because people are going to watch that.

30
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:24,300
And then one of the most underhanded 
things they did,

31
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,740
they'll,
which,

32
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,603
which,
which you can't really tell by looking 

33
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:32,751
at the poster because I look kind of 
angry there and it looks like exactly.

34
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:36,070
I'm going to choose something off there.
And um,

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,073
but what's really interesting about that
is that that picture was taken at a 

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,890
rally that I spoke out in favor of free 
speech,

37
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,260
of course,
that I was invited to speak at.

38
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,333
And during the rally,
the same kind of activist who put up 

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,473
this poster,
took the mic and shut off the PA system 

40
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:58,650
and blasted everyone with white noise.
So in order to be heard,

41
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,430
I had to raise my voice a lot.
And so they took a picture.

42
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:03,264
So really here I am,
they baby to essentially made it 

43
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,400
impossible for me to speak unless I 
spoke very loudly and so that's what I'm

44
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:12,234
doing here.
So they actually took a picture of me 

45
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,280
reacting appropriately in the situation 
to provocation from them to make me look

46
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:21,930
like,
well,

47
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,033
who knows?
Like,

48
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,940
like,
well,

49
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:24,980
like an angry,
like a,

50
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:27,570
like an angry guy,
or you just want to,

51
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,870
you want to round up some minorities.
I look of it.

52
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,800
Yep.
This is some impressive propaganda,

53
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,490
mean genius.
You're right.

54
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,510
It is.
It's impressive.

55
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:41,220
It's disturbing that people are,
can be so consciously manipulative.
