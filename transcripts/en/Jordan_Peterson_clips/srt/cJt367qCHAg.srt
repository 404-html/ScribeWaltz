00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,123
You've said that a marriage must be 
based on trust and transparency and 

2
00:00:03,411 --> 00:00:04,244
being shackled together.
How and for how long should you get to 

3
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:09,380
know someone?
How does set a foundation?

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:10,310
Oh,
well,

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,970
you know there's no.
There's no simple answer to that.

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,183
Hello.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:22,943
I think that you should know someone 
well enough so that you can so that you 

8
00:00:30,381 --> 00:00:31,214
know if you can negotiate with them and 
so that you have started to formulate a 

9
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:40,571
vision of your joint future that you can
both look forward to with enthusiasm and

10
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:44,384
confidence.
So and of course that's going to depend 

11
00:00:47,571 --> 00:00:49,580
to some degree on your level of 
maturity,

12
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,443
but that means you've considered such 
things as do you have a sufficient 

13
00:00:56,151 --> 00:00:56,984
number of joint interests and are you 
oriented in the same direction with 

14
00:00:59,781 --> 00:01:00,614
regards to how you're going to handle 
your joint careers and the possibility 

15
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:04,514
of children and that the manner in which
you're going to interact with your in 

16
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:10,310
laws and you have to start thinking 
about.

17
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:15,260
You have to start considering your life 
together.

18
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:18,440
From the perspective of practicality and
economics,

19
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:19,274
I would say so.
It can't just be that massive erotic 

20
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:26,000
attraction that's associated with with 
love,

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,073
although I think that's extraordinarily 
important and you're unbelievably 

22
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:31,850
fortunate if you have that and you 
should do everything you can to maintain

23
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:32,684
it.
