00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,143
Here,
here's the practical bit of information 

2
00:00:02,651 --> 00:00:03,484
for you to,
for all of you antisocial types who are 

3
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:06,334
going to end up in prison.
So if you're in prison and you want to 

4
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:13,150
go on parole,
okay,

5
00:00:13,151 --> 00:00:15,640
so you have to go in front of the judge 
and tell them why you're not going to do

6
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,230
it again.
So here's the deal.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,093
Here's the deal.
It doesn't really matter what you did 

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,510
and it doesn't really matter what you 
promise.

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,440
What matters is whether you see the 
judge before lunch or after lunch,

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,900
because if you see the judge after 
lunch,

11
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:32,140
the probability that you will get parole
is 60 percent higher.

12
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,410
Yeah,
right.

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,230
That is just like so.
Never have an argument with your partner

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,730
when you're hungry or when they're 
hungry.

15
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:41,590
Especially if you want something from 
them.

16
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:43,210
It's like,
here's the sandwich.

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,460
They'll eat it,
then there'll be happy.

18
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,520
Then you can manipulate them before,
before that,

19
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:49,354
man,
no.
