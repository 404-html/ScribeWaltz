1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,013
The realization that pleasure could be 
usefully for stole dawn with a 

2
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:04,224
difficulty that's almost impossible to 
overstate a realization runs absolutely 

3
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:11,274
contrary to our ancient fundamental 
animal instincts which demand immediate 

4
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:15,744
satisfaction,
particularly under conditions of 

5
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:18,594
deprivation,
which are both inevitable and 

6
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:22,290
commonplace,
and to complicate the matter,

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,513
such delay only becomes useful when 
civilization has stabilized itself 

8
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:30,120
enough to guarantee the existence of the
delayed reward.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,970
If everything you save will be destroyed
or worse,

10
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:34,760
stolen,
there's no point saving.

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,733
It's for this reason that a wolf will 
down 20 pounds of raw meat in a single 

12
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:41,280
meal.
He isn't thinking,

13
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:43,200
man,
I hate it when I binge.

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,900
I should save some of this for next 
week.

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,860
Here's a developmental progression from 
animal to human.

16
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,170
It's wrong,
no doubt in the details,

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,080
but it's sufficiently correct for our 
purposes in theme.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,900
First,
there's excess food.

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,093
Large carcasses.
Mammoths are other massive herbivores 

20
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,600
might provide that way.

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,960
A lot of mammoth,
maybe all of them with a large animal.

22
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:09,450
There's some left for later after a 
kill.

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,393
That's accidental at first,
but eventually the utility of for later 

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,573
starts to be appreciated.
Some provisional notion of sacrifice 

25
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:23,880
develops at the same time.
If I leave some now,

26
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,780
even if I want it now,
I won't have to be hungry later.

27
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,980
That provisional notion then develops to
the next level.

28
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,023
If I leave some for later,
I won't have to go hungry and neither 

29
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:39,030
will those I care for and then to the 
next level.

30
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,553
I can't possibly eat all this mammoth,
but I can't store the rest for too long 

31
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:44,574
either.
Maybe I should feed some to other 

32
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:47,214
people.
Maybe they'll remember and feed me some 

33
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:52,230
of their mammoth when they have some and
I have none.

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,220
Then I'll get some mammoth now and some 
mammoth later.

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,473
That's a good deal and maybe those I'm 
sharing with will come to trust me more 

36
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:02,364
generally.

37
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,110
Maybe then we could trade forever in 
such a manner.

38
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,740
Mammoth becomes future,
mammoth and future.

39
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:11,574
Mammoth becomes personal reputation.
That's the emergence of the social 

40
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:20,721
contract to share does not mean to give 
away something you value and get nothing

41
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:23,250
back.
That's only instead what?

42
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:24,084
Every child who refuses to share his 
afraid that it means to share means 

43
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:30,540
properly to initiate the process of 
trade.

44
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,150
A child who can't share,
who can't trade,

45
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,450
can't have any friends because having 
friends is a form of trade.

46
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,643
Benjamin Franklin once suggested that a 
newcomer to a neighborhood ask a new 

47
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:48,840
neighbor to do him or her a favor citing
an old maxim.

48
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,270
He that has once done,
you have kindness,

49
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,313
will be more ready to do you another.
Then he whom you yourself have obliged 

50
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,480
in Franklin,
so opinion.

51
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:58,314
Asking something for someone,
asking someone for something not too 

52
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:02,484
extreme.
