1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
Uh,
this is always something I've been 

2
00:00:01,321 --> 00:00:02,970
interested for,
something that I've,

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,800
I've,
I've wanted to enrich myself with.

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,450
I think a lot of people,
you're,

5
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,320
you're a busy guy as far as I can tell.
You do speaking engagements,

6
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:11,670
lectures,
you operate a youtube channel.

7
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:14,580
Presumably you're a voracious reader.
I saw you on the couch.

8
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,414
He had a book open yet,
like a moment you're reading and you're 

9
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:18,840
a prolific tweeter.
You tweet a lot.

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,310
So my question is how do you tweak your 
approach?

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,750
How do you organize your time?
How do you remain focused and productive

12
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:30,900
in the face of insurmountable at work 
lists?

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,520
Schedules and I have help.
I mean my wife in particular in the last

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,353
year has been unbelievably helpful.
I mean it's become a full time job for 

15
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:42,120
her really helping me manage my schedule
and keep me on track.

16
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:45,270
But a lot of it is like I get up in the 
morning,

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,150
I have like everything scheduled.

18
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,560
I know exactly what I'm supposed to do.
There's a hierarchy of,

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,563
of law,
of priority and I'm really operating on 

20
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,020
a day to day level right now because 
there's so many things to do.

21
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:00,630
I can't look more than about a day or 
two ahead,

22
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,990
although it's,
it's,

23
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,053
it's basically scheduled now,
but I learned to discipline myself when 

24
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,300
I was in graduate school when I was 
writing,

25
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,153
I wrote a book called maps of meaning 
that was published in 1999 and I've 

26
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,270
worked for that on that for about 15 
years,

27
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,133
about three hours a day and I really 
sort of grabbed myself by the scruff of 

28
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:23,400
the neck and forced myself to learn how 
to concentrate without,

29
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,650
without deviation.
How do you do that?

30
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,560
How do you,
how do you focus that intensely?

31
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:30,300
Because I,
I often have trouble,

32
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:35,180
like I get overwhelmed sometimes when I 
have a lot of work and the,

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,053
the worst feeling is like when I feel 
like I have a ton of work and I do work 

34
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:40,404
all day,
but I still feel like I didn't get 

35
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:42,774
anything done.

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

37
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,660
But all the time you probably did 
probably conscientious person.

38
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,573
Do you know?
I don't even know what exactly that 

39
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:53,730
means.
Well,

40
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:55,590
okay.
So that's another thing we could mention

41
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:56,424
briefly.
I have a website called understand 

42
00:01:58,681 --> 00:01:59,514
myself.com
and I set up a coupon code for your 

43
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,980
viewers.
So it's h three,

44
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:09,150
h three o what's the understand 
myself.com.

45
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,223
And you can go there and take a 
personality test that was devised in my 

46
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:13,404
lab.
The main researcher was Dr Colin de 

47
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,940
Young who is now a professor at the 
University of Minnesota,

48
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:21,660
but we took the standard big five trait 
model,

49
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:24,120
which is the standard modern personality
model.

50
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,073
So that's extroversion,
which is a positive emotion dimension 

51
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,380
and extroverted people are enthusiastic 
and assertive.

52
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:34,230
So you're both enthusiastic year.
Really assertive.

53
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:35,390
That would be my.
I can be.

54
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,241
Yeah,
yeah.

55
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:37,620
Well you wouldn't be doing this sort of 
thing.

56
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,140
I'll put an extra shirt.

57
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,170
So because you know,
you're,

58
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,020
you're,
you're,

59
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,480
you're verbally fluent and,
and um,

60
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,410
you'd like to engage in that sort of 
thing.

61
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,990
Um,
so that's a positive emotion dimension.

62
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:52,380
It's associated with the positive 
emotion that you feel when you're moving

63
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,940
towards desired things.
Um,

64
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,530
and the next dimension is sometimes it's
called neuroticism,

65
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:01,170
and sometimes negative emotionality.
Well,

66
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,520
people who are high in neuroticism are,
have some anticipatory anxiety.

67
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,620
Um,
you know,

68
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:09,454
you know,
you have anticipatory anxiety if you're 

69
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:11,284
worried about going somewhere and it 
really bugs you and then you get there 

70
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:16,000
and like 20 minutes later you're calm 
and it's okay.

71
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,380
Big Time,
big time.
