1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,400
That's Michelangelo's famous Sistine 
Chapel Representation.

2
00:00:03,401 --> 00:00:05,320
And there's some cool things about this.
I mean,

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,300
you got to wonder this,
this,

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,163
this is a side,
and I don't know if it's a credible 

5
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:13,240
aside,
but it's an interesting aside.

6
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:14,800
So that's,
that's a form of credible.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,990
What the Hell is God doing in this 
thing?

8
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,161
No,
I mean,

9
00:00:18,161 --> 00:00:21,260
what is this exactly?
And so there's,

10
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:23,980
there's been some interesting answers to
that and this is one of them.

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,680
So there was a group of scientists about
20 years ago that,

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,050
that were remarked on the precise,
uh,

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,453
the precise analogy between this 
structure and the brain bisected down 

14
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:38,650
the middle.
And of course,

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,820
Michael Angelo was one of the first 
people who did detailed dissections.

16
00:00:42,821 --> 00:00:46,000
And so they felt that,
that,

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,130
that Michelangelo had put God inside the
brain for some reason.

18
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,330
And,
uh,

19
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,060
that seems to me to be associated with 
the notion that there's,

20
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,290
you know,
there's a,

21
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,123
there's an analogy or a metaphorical 
identity between the notion of whatever 

22
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:02,830
God is and the structures that give rise
to consciousness.

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,113
And,
uh,

24
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,410
I think we really underestimate the 
degree to which consciousness is,

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,410
is both same,
miraculous.

26
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,390
And not understood,
I mean,

27
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,880
you know,
you,

28
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,763
you,
you have what appears to be an entirely 

29
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,610
material substrate.
Yep.

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,473
Here you are aware and self aware and 
able to generate the world merely in 

31
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:24,244
some sense by looking at it.
It really is remarkable in that 

32
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:27,064
consciousness is dependent on,
on something that wells up from deep 

33
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:33,430
within that material substrate that we 
don't understand at all.

34
00:01:33,431 --> 00:01:36,250
It's really a,
it's crazily remarkable thing.

35
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,770
You know,
when you hear,

36
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,110
you hear a lot about scientific 
reductionism,

37
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:44,230
but I'll tell you something that's kind 
of interesting and it's a tangent to,

38
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:46,300
you know,
the guy that discovered Dna,

39
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,970
I think it was Watson and Watson and 
crick,

40
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:50,410
but I don't remember who wrote this 
book,

41
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:54,160
but one of them I don't remember which 
one,

42
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,180
he believed that DNA was so complicated 
that it had to come from space.

43
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,520
He didn't believe it could have possibly
evolved on earth.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,060
And so like a lot of these people who 
are used

45
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,140
as exemplars of scientific reductionism 
aren't like that at all.

46
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:09,670
When you actually read what they had to 
say,

47
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,051
right?
They,

48
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:10,884
they were very aware of the limits of 
their own knowledge and I mean DNA is 

49
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:17,260
something really quite spectacularly 
remarkable.

50
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,320
It's an eternal substance.
It's been around for a very long time.

51
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:21,154
And the idea that we understand it is a 
very stupid idea and I would say that I 

52
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,460
would say that the same thing applies to
the brain.

53
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:28,740
Like we're,
we're,

54
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,050
we're scratching away at the surface of 
something we don't understand at all.

55
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,850
And so it's quite interesting.
I think that,

56
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,580
and maybe Michelangelo had enough goal 
to do that.

57
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:37,414
It's certainly possible.
I mean he had enough goal to do 

58
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,790
dissections when the,
when the cost of that was death,

59
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,643
you know,
he had this rob corpses essentially to 

60
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:47,170
go and do it.
So he was,

61
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,430
he wasn't,
I would say,

62
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:51,060
not particularly politically correct.
So.

63
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,413
So that's kind of interesting and there 
is another representation of the same 

64
00:02:55,661 --> 00:03:00,661
thing and that's a funny one.
I had to throw that in.

65
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:02,860
I don't know how many of you know this,
but there's,

66
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,003
there's,
there's this joke in the atheistic 

67
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,903
atheist community.
I think it might've been started by 

68
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:09,850
Richard Dawkins,
but that might be wrong,

69
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:10,923
that it was just as reasonable to 
believe in the flying spaghetti monster 

70
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:14,554
as it was to believe in God.
And that's the flying spaghetti monster 

71
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,703
by the way.
And,

72
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,723
and,
uh,

73
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,563
and so that's,
that's called touched by his noodly 

74
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:26,730
appendage and anyways,
it's fun.

75
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,660
It's not very sophisticated,
but it is funny.

76
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,173
Okay.
