1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,100
People often talk about the whole cost 
in terms of the relationship between the

2
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:09,240
Jews and the Germans are between the 
Jews and the Nazis was obviously playing

3
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:10,074
the part of victims and the Nazis often 
for always playing the part of the 

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,503
perpetrators and of course this has 
absolutely comprehensible from the 

5
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:16,164
historical point of view,
but it also strikes me that if what we 

6
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:19,464
remember is that the Nazis killed the 
Jews that were already on the road to 

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,200
making a mistake that similar to the 
mistake that was,

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,830
it was made that led to the Holocaust to
begin with,

9
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:29,664
which is to identify characteristics 
that lead to patterns of action of that 

10
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:37,710
sort as characteristics of groups 
identifiable groups.

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,180
And it seems to me,
I mean,

12
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:43,350
I'm not trying to equate the role of the
Jews and the Nazis and the Holocaust.

13
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:44,184
I would obviously be observed,
but when I'm trying to second into the 

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,540
lesson,
it seems to me to be.

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,680
Especially when you consider that the 
propensity for whole costs like,

16
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,070
uh,
events is deeply rooted in human nature.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,790
The lesson to draw from the events of 
World War II,

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,830
that's what human beings are like,
knowing what the Nazis were like because

19
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,690
these sorts of events happen all the 
time.

20
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,350
I mean it's obviously the case that 
there are.

21
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,220
There are well in the 20th century 
alone,

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,160
English and benefit the concentration 
camp in South Africa,

23
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,573
Germans,
her fact that Chinese used to great 

24
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:18,684
advantage,
so an s an estimated also show this on 

25
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:21,324
the next slide,
66 million people in the Soviet Union 

26
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:26,310
were killed as a consequence of internal
repression,

27
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,893
many of whom went through camp like 
procedures on their road to their 

28
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:34,170
demise,
see ethnic cleansing occurring in places

29
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:38,040
like Rwanda and even once again in 
Europe and the Balkans,

30
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,653
whatever it was that we were supposed to
learn from the events of the Second 

31
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,183
World War hasn't been learned nor being 
remembered because you can't remember 

32
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:49,740
what you don't understand and that's 
what this course is about.

33
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,440
I've been working for since 1985,
I guess the on trying to figure out what

34
00:01:56,101 --> 00:02:00,190
it is about people remember hunting 
around.

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,373
Maybe you know this.
Maybe she's a famous political 

36
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,970
scientist.
She was a student of Martin heidegger.

37
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:07,770
She wrote a book called the banality of 
evil,

38
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:10,260
and one of her points was that these 
people,

39
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,990
she was talking about the Nazis in 
particular,

40
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,310
people who perpetrate events like this,
if you meet them when you talk to them,

41
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:18,144
if you have encountered with them,
the thing that's often striking about 

42
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:24,030
them is not their striking abnormality 
or the resident evil,

43
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:27,660
but the fact that they're very much like
other people that you might've met,

44
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,810
which was supposed to be surprised.
So surprising.

45
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:32,820
When you think about how thoroughly,
for example,

46
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,663
the Nazi movement dominated the German 
Punch with a sort of likewise with 

47
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:37,074
communism in the Soviet Union.
I mean those ideological movements 

48
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:40,704
characterized people,
characterized some strange sort of 

49
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:44,963
misfits whose consciousness was 
characterized by something in 

50
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,124
comprehensible that led them to perform 
the kind of actions that we are 

51
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:53,790
theoretically supposed to remember.

52
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,463
My perspective on all the assistant,
the fact people are capable of 

53
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,440
perpetrating atrocities,
light those characterize.

54
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,430
The whole foster says something about 
why people are like,

55
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,443
what everybody's like because it strikes
me that that kind of tendency is 

56
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,530
something that's deeply rooted in human 
nature and then to say that,

57
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,483
but what was it about the Nazis or what 
was it about the Soviet communists that 

58
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,503
lend them to participate in this sort of
behavior is completely decided to point 

59
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,300
in a sense.
All that does is you're looking for some

60
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:30,610
sort of group characteristic.
It's devoid.

61
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,100
You don't have any personal relationship
with that group.

62
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:36,160
The problem is instantly made abstract 
and as far as I'm concerned,

63
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,440
if it's abstract open,
once again,

64
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,250
nothing is remember now.
What I want to do is to try.

65
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:48,460
I want to outline the reasons why.
Something like the Holocaust,

66
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,373
what it is about us that make us so 
concerned with protecting art group 

67
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:55,600
identities,
what those identities mean,

68
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,050
what role they play in the regulation of
emotion.

69
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,440
That's the critical thing right there 
for me.

70
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,250
Etiologies are art are the expression in
a sense,

71
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:10,900
the verbal expression of the internal 
structures that regulate our emotions.

72
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,090
When you mess around with someone's 
ideologies,

73
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,953
therefore as a consequence,
you're messing around with the 

74
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:19,330
inhibitory structure that regulates the 
interplay between their emotions.

75
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,673
Whatever your identity is,
plays some role in regulating your 

76
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:29,281
emotional nature and your physiology 
because your thoughts are embodied.

77
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:31,780
They're part of your mind,
you're a part of your brain.

78
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,703
You want to get right down to it.
People have belief systems and they'll 

79
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:39,520
do anything to protect,
and I find that peculiar.

80
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,020
What is so important about belief system
that would lead people to do things,

81
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,820
normal people,
as far as I'm concerned,

82
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,893
to commit acts that under normal 
circumstances would would be conceived 

83
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:54,220
of as incomprehensible even by those 
people.

84
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,960
So I also hoped to make,
as I said,

85
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,050
I want to make the lessons here 
personally.

86
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,093
I'm not interested in discussing the 
issue from the abstract perspective 

87
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:09,064
because I don't think that an issue,
an issue of this magnitude deserves to 

88
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:16,210
be discussed.
Data at an abstract level.

89
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,510
It's not an abstract problem.
It's something.

90
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,433
There's something peculiar about us that
we have to learn to control because as 

91
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:28,630
far as I'm concerned,
we're technologically powerful to remain

92
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:32,230
at the whims of the uncomprehending 
aspects of our nature.
