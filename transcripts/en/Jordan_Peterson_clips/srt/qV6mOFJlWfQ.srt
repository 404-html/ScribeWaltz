1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,510
I've told people to learn to use a 
schedule.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,230
And people often hate schedules because 
they act as their own tyrants,

3
00:00:06,231 --> 00:00:07,064
right?
They say we have to do this unpleasant 

4
00:00:08,631 --> 00:00:11,060
thing and then here's another unpleasant
thing you have to do.

5
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:11,894
And then you have to do this unpleasant 
thing and you do that for about three 

6
00:00:14,511 --> 00:00:17,240
days and you think tail with this.
I'm not doing that.

7
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:19,190
You know,
and you fall off the wagon.

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,770
That isn't what you're supposed to do 
with the schedule.

9
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:22,604
You're supposed to use it to design the 
days that you would like to have if you 

10
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:29,600
were taking care of yourself.
And so some of that is,

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,733
you know,
you wake up in the morning and you 

12
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:32,024
think,
here's five things I have to do that if 

13
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:38,600
I don't do my life will be worse.
It's like paying bills for example,

14
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:39,351
or,
or,

15
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:40,640
or taking out the garbage.

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,460
It's like you have to do those because 
otherwise things degenerate.

17
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,770
So you've got to put some of those in 
the schedule.

18
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:48,140
Cause otherwise,
tomorrow is worse than today.

19
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:51,710
And that's a bad trajectory.
But you also want to build in things.

20
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,530
You know,
you've got to act in some sense,

21
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:57,800
like you're dealing with a relatively 
recalcitrant nine year old.

22
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,320
It's like so well here's some things you
have to do,

23
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:04,670
but here's some things that if you do,
you could reward yourself with.

24
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:08,000
And if you get the balance there between
obligation and reward,

25
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:08,834
right,
then you'll find that you're motivated 

26
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:12,500
to do the things.
And that's what you want to do.

27
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:13,334
You want to do that.
So it's sustainable across days and 

28
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,030
weeks and months.
And so you've got to,

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,193
you got to treat yourself like a good 
boss would treat a valued employee and 

30
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:27,230
not like a tyrant would treat a slave 
because the slave will rebel.

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,400
And you know,
people say,

32
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:30,950
well,
I don't follow through on my plans.

33
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:33,030
It's like,
well a,

34
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:33,883
they're probably not very well 
formulated and maybe you're doing them 

35
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:38,810
because of an external moral obligation 
or something,

36
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:40,820
not really your plans,
right?

37
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,090
And B,
you're acting like a tyrant and a slave.

38
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,580
And that's a bad relationship to have 
with yourself.

39
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,970
So you,
you want to treat yourself with some,

40
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,350
well,
the same way.

41
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,970
That's the golden rule,
right?

42
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,470
It treat yourself as you would treat 
other people as you would have them.

43
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,663
Sorry.
Treat other people as you would like to 

44
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,090
be treated.
It works both ways.

45
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,630
You also treat yourself like you treat 
other people properly,

46
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,080
so that's a necessary thing.
And often people don't do that,

47
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,180
but the scheduling is really important.
