1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,310
How do you pick up knowledge of how to 
act well,

2
00:00:02,311 --> 00:00:04,770
that's not quite as explicit.
It's not as easy to figure out,

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,580
you know,
obviously you know the children up a lot

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,423
of information by modeling behavior,
which is basically a copy adults and 

5
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:12,234
that basically means they watched adults
act with their body through space and 

6
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:18,360
they duplicate those patterns of action.
Can you generalize from them?

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,553
So that's one way behavioral wisdom is 
transmitting something that is explicit 

8
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,124
as well,
at least in terms of the receipt of 

9
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:25,254
rewards and punishments because parents 
will modulate their children's behavior 

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,130
by engaging and motivationally 
significant interactions with them.

11
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:33,930
At least that's what you should do if 
you're a parent.

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,260
That's your primary responsibility in a 
sense.

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,940
So that's what we mean when we say that 
you're paying attention to someone.

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,793
That basically means that you're 
modulating your behavior with your 

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,210
behavior,
with your emotions.

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,353
So like a child will monitor or parallel
marcher is child would react positively 

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,220
when something that the parent wants to 
happen happens and negatively.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,290
When something happens with the parent 
doesn't want to happen.

19
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,860
So the child's behaviors,
well that's just classical reinforcement

20
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:02,694
theory.
Basically you exchanged rewards and 

21
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:06,840
punishments and threats and promises and
behavior.

22
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:08,970
We do that all the time in their 
interpersonal interactions.

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,633
That's part of the reason why people 
with personality disorders can sort of 

24
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:14,274
have an uncanny effect on you,
which is to say if you're a personality 

25
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:18,384
disorder,
do you have a really potent expectation 

26
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:20,784
about how someone else will behave 
usually like a son of a bitch 

27
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:24,324
fundamentally,
and if someone with a personality 

28
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:26,994
disorder encountered someone who doesn't
talk like that and they're a challenge 

29
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:30,054
to their belief system,
people with personality disorders are 

30
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:35,580
extremely good at turning everyone.
They meet into the same person that they

31
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:37,440
already met and they do that.

32
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,010
I think by exchanging very,
very subtle and covert reinforcements,

33
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,863
which is to say,
you're engaged with me and I have a 

34
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:46,230
personality disorder.
Every time you act properly,

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,153
I'll ignore you or say something 
contemptuous or look away or do 

36
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:52,080
something quite subtle and every time 
you act like a miserable bastard,

37
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:52,914
which is nice to expect.
I'll at least pay some attention and 

38
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:58,620
possibly even reinforced you covertly.
And you'll find if you get close to me,

39
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,880
that you,
it's almost like you'd been distorted by

40
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:01,714
a gravitational field as you paid your 
starts getting pulled in strange 

41
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:04,824
directions.
We do that to each other all the time 

42
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,860
and one of the things you might consider
as well,

43
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,793
these are very large.
We're all engaged in these patterns of 

44
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:20,180
mutually modifying interactions and 
something emerges from that stable.

45
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,113
I guess I would say that the things I'm 
going to teach you about mythology or 

46
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:25,824
the things that I do as stable,
emerging properties from risk from 

47
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,680
centuries of reciprocal interaction.

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,873
So if we're engaged in some pursuit,
you're going to notify me and I'm going 

49
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:36,644
to modify you and neither of us really 
know precisely what that means because 

50
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,110
we're not conscious of all the reasons 
that we do everything.

51
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,660
And that's just been.
I mean it's bad.

52
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,340
Not if there's only two of us,
but if it was like 50 of us will,

53
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,174
then you can imagine the calculating all
the permutations of the interactions 

54
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,283
become virtually impossible.
Point is we will settle into some sort 

55
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:55,884
of stable configuration or disappear.
Those are the options and that human 

56
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,990
societies do settle,
settle into stable configuration,

57
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:06,910
so we don't really understand how that 
happens,

58
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,193
but we we have developed the ability to 
describe those configurations without 

59
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,953
understanding of it.
I think that makes up a big part of 

60
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,204
mythology.
The stories we tell ourselves about how 

61
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:19,774
we behave when we don't know how or even
why you things to consider in the 

62
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,113
future.
