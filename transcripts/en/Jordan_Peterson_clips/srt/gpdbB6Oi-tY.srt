Dr.
Peterson,

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,900
I heard you recently say that if a woman
doesn't want a baby by age 30,

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,890
that something is unhealthy.
I take no offense to that assertion.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,143
Rather I am taking it very seriously.
I'm 34 years old in a longterm 

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,550
relationship but don't feel desire to 
have children.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,623
I always thought that I would one day 
but I'm getting older and that I'm 

7
00:00:20,181 --> 00:00:22,190
getting older and that day still hasn't 
come.

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,623
I'm terrified of raising,
realizing too late that I should have 

9
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:26,414
had a family.
But I'm also terrified of having them 

10
00:00:28,311 --> 00:00:31,100
and regretting it because I never truly 
want it to be a mother.

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,530
I don't think I have any ideology of 
play.

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,660
I'm not a feminist or anything like 
that.

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,180
When you say something might be wrong or
unhealthy,

14
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,270
where might I look?
Any advice on how to make this change?

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,800
What won't make this choice?

16
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,413
Ps,
my boyfriend and I both had he depaul 

17
00:00:45,981 --> 00:00:50,150
mothers perhaps that is relevant.
Well it might be relevant given that you

18
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,070
saw fit to um,
include it as a potential detail.

19
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:55,904
And one of the rules that I would 
operate by as a psychotherapist is that 

20
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:03,080
if a client is inclined to add a detail 
to the,

21
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,623
to the formulation of a problem,
that the details are likely to be 

22
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,930
relevant.
Um,

23
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,270
but I can't tell,
right?

24
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:14,150
Because of course I can't use it a rule 
of thumb.

25
00:01:14,151 --> 00:01:15,560
And so you might object,
well,

26
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:19,040
I shouldn't have used to rule of thumb 
to say something like if a woman doesn't

27
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,710
want a baby by the age of 30,
that something is unhealthy.

28
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:22,843
Well,
they're going to be exceptions to every 

29
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,333
general rule.
But my attitude to this essentially is 

30
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:33,920
that we have all come from an unbroken 
string of 3.5

31
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:36,290
million years of successful mothers.

32
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,130
And so the probability that that's going
to be part and parcel of,

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,473
um,
healthy woman's desire and not only a 

34
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:45,501
woman,
no.

35
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:49,190
Obviously men desire to have a family 
too and often very intensely.

36
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,293
It's just that men have a much longer 
time span over which to consider such 

37
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:54,554
things.
Uh,

38
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,680
so perhaps the chips are down so rapidly
and to the same degree for men.

39
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,763
Um,
I wouldn't be so bold as to say that 

40
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:09,020
there's anything wrong with you,
the questioner specifically.

41
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,183
Um,
maybe you have the sort of temperament 

42
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:14,390
that isn't particularly inclined towards
maternal behavior.

43
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,323
Uh,
that might be someone who's low in 

44
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:19,910
agreeableness and well,
that would be the primary issue.

45
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,140
Um,
and so I wouldn't take my word for it,

46
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:26,150
that if you don't want to have a child 
in your 30,

47
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,480
that there is necessarily something 
specifically wrong with you.

48
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:32,230
But I would say as a rule of thumb,
it's,

49
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,700
it's part of the normal panoply of human
desires and values.

50
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,220
And so if,
if,

51
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,320
if there's violent objection to having a
family,

52
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,263
something like that,
then generally that seems to me to be 

53
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:49,910
indicative of something that might be at
least worth looking into.
