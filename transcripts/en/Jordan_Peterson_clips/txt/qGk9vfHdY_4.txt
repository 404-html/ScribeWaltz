Speaker 1:          00:00          One of the things that made marks wrong was Marx believed that capital would flow into the hands of fewer and fewer people and that the association between the rich and the poor would become more extreme as capitalism developed and like so many things that mark said. That's it's kind of true. It's kind of true in that

Speaker 1:          00:27          the distribution of wealth and in fact the distribution of anything that's produced follows a peritoneal pattern and the prieto pattern basically is that a small proportion of people end up with a bulk of the goods and it isn't just money. It's, it's anything that people produce, creatively ends up in that distribution and that's actually the economists called out the matthew principle and they take that from US statement in the New Testament and the statement is to those who have everything more will be given and from those who have nothing. Everything will be taken and it's a map of the manner in which the world manifests itself. Where human creative production is involved in the map seems to indicate that as you start to produce and you're successful, the probability that you will continue to be successful or accelerate increases as you're successful and as you fail, the probability that you will fail starts to accelerate.

Speaker 1:          01:19          So in your progress through life looks like this or like this, something like that. And the reason that Marx was right was because he noted that as a feature of the capitalist system. The reason that he was wrong is that it's not a feature that's specific to a capitalist system. It's a feature that's general to all systems of creative production that are known and so it's like a natural law and it's enough of a natural law by the ways that the distribution of wealth can be modeled by physical models using the same equations that govern the distribution of gas molecules in a vacuum. So it's a really profound. It's a fundamentally profound observation about the world way the world lays itself out and it's problematic because if resources accrue unfairly to a small minority of people and there's a natural law like element to that that has to be dealt with from a social perspective because if the inequality becomes too extreme, then the whole system will destabilize and so you can have an intelligent discussion about how to mitigate the effects of the transfer of creative production into the hands of a small number of people. Now, the other reason, however, having said that, the other reason that Marx was wrong, there's a number of them. One is that even though

Speaker 1:          02:50          creative products end up in the hands of a small number of people, it's not the same people consistently across time. It's the same of people and that's not the same thing. You know, like imagine that there's water going down a drain and you say, well, look at the spiral. It's permanent. You think, well, the spirals permanent, but the water molecules aren't. They're moving through it and it's the same in some sense with the prieto distribution is that there's a one percent and there's always a one percent, but it's not the same people. It's the stability of a diy differs from culture to culture, but there's a lot of movement in the upper one percent, a tremendous amount of movement, and one of the reasons for that movement is that things get large and then they get too large and then they collapse, and so in 2008, when the politicians said too big to fail, they got something truly backwards as far as I can tell, and that was. It was a reverse. The statement was reversed. It should have been so big it had to fail.
