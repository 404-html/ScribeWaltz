Speaker 1:          00:00          Do you plan your day much or your time generally? Does this lead to higher productivity? Yes, I planned my day obsessively. My calendar is always absolutely full and often weeks in advance and my plan in the morning, especially when I'm on top of things and I plan each hour and I probably plan each minute and yes, it leads to way higher productivity. You know you, you decide what your goals are going to be. You place them in the calendar. Use the calendar as your friend day because what you want to do.
