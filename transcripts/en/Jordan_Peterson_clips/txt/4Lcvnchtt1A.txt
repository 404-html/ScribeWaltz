Speaker 1:          00:00          There's a chapter in my book called don't ever don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them and I'm pretty happy about this chapter, although I suspect it will be rather controversial and it's predicated on the observation that many people hurt their children physically and psychologically, you know, because everyone gets sentimental about the relationship between parents and children. But that's especially in relationship to themselves because they think, well, you know, of course I'm going to be a good parent. It's like it's not so bloody obvious that you're going to be a good parent. You know, and so, and then what I see happening with people who don't know how to discipline their children is that the children run roughshod over them in their, let's call them a hierarchical disputes because children push for position and hierarchy and they do that behaviorally to sort of feel out the contours of the social structure.

Speaker 1:          00:52          So you know your kid locked perfectly fine at home, let's say at the dinner table, but then you take them to a stranger's dinner table and all of a sudden they act out and you think what's up with you, your little monster and what's up is that they're trying to figure out what the power structure is in the new. They don't know this of course, but they're acting this out there trying to figure out if the same rules apply in this new situation as apply in the old situation and they can't ask that and they don't even know that they are rules exactly there regularities that they've learned and so they'll test and test and then you have to show them that. Yeah, it's the same here. It's the same in this situation, but lots of parents are very uneasy with disciplining their children. Partly because there they believe that if you give a child infinite freedom that's best for them and that constraints are inappropriate, which is really just.

Speaker 1:          01:40          Well, I don't know what to say about that except it's so untrue that that it's very difficult to think of anything that's more untreated now, but also the thing is, is if you let your children take advantage of you, if you have an ounce of spine and an ounce of aggression, which you do, especially if you don't admit it, then you will take revenge on your children. You know, so if they have a temper tantrum in a grocery store and embarrass you, which Gerald, who's can, he can do quite effectively, you know, because you wouldn't let them have that pack of crayons or a chocolate bar and then you know you, you tell yourself it's okay and that you still, you know that that really didn't make you that angry and it's okay, but you're fuming inside and then you go home and half an hour later maybe the child is doing some interesting little bit of work, maybe artwork or something or does something good and comes up for a reward.

Speaker 1:          02:30          It's like the probability that you're going to reward that child properly under those circumstances, zero. You're going to take the opportunity to take your revenge, and if you don't know that, then you're not much of the parent. And so part of the trick with kids is that if your child is doing something that makes you dislike them, that you have to figure out how to stop them from doing that and teach them how to do it properly. And you have to talk to your wife to make sure that you're not being too much of a monster, you know? And the same with her.
