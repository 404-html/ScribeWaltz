Speaker 1:          00:00          Yes, very interested in your comments on this fridge. Western is committing suicide. Why is that happening? Yes. What do it badly?

Speaker 2:          00:20          No, there's lots for people to be guilty about. You know, I mean you might say, to what degree should you bear the horrendous guilt of your ancestors? And that's a. that's a really hard question. I mean, because of the radical left answer would be to the degree that you're privileged by your ancestry, you should bear their guilt. Well, well, yes. The question is then what do you do? Well, what you should do is, what I suggested today I would say is take responsibility for your lives and understand that what you have came at a terrible cost and that you have an ethical obligation to use it properly and that would be sufficient to pay for the sins of your ancestors, so to speak. I think it's absolutely reprehensible that the radical left there's to attribute to to ethnically identified groups, collective guilt. There's absolutely no excuse for that. It's completely murderous and that should be rejected out of hand. So, but that's independent of the issue about what you should do. Given that part of your wealth is a consequence of historical catastrophe, so you should try to sort that out roughly speaking and for everyone's benefit, but not necessarily because you're any more guilty. Personally. You're guilty as hell personally, but so is everyone else.
