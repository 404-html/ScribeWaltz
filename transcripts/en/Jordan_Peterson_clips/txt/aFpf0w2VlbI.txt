Speaker 1:          00:00          Question, how is capitalism compatible with your definition of good if it requires ever increasing use of the finite resources of the planet, where once depleted would mean our end? Well, I would say capitalism isn't compatible with my definition of good if it requires every increasing uses of the finite resources of the planet, but that's by no means self evident even though the Scuttlebutt, let's say, especially among the environmentalist oriented types who might have some sympathy for, by the way, especially with regards to ocean depletion. Um, there's a huge argument and there has been for many, many years between the economists and the biologists and this is a really important thing to know. And The economist point out that human ingenuity is such that we're continually able to make more with less. And certainly over the last well, 500 years that the, especially in the last 150 years, that's just absolutely evident.

Speaker 1:          00:54          You know, like people say we're going to run out of energy. And I think that's absolutely preposterous. It's like it's, it's crazy as thinking we're going to run out of mattered. I mean, we're going through a bit of a bottleneck right now because you know the population is going to increase to about 9 billion and then it's going to decrease. That's, that's the most reliable projections and 9 billion isn't the law more than we have now and you know, there's going to be some environmental disruption as a consequence of that, but I don't think there's any reason to assume that all that capitalism necessarily requires ever increasing use of the finite resources of the planet. It's also not obvious to what degree the resources of the planet are actually finite because we, we can continually think up new uses for things that nobody thought had any use at all.

Speaker 1:          01:40          So it depends to some degree on whether or not you're willing to bet on human imaginativeness or you're going to be a male Uzi and pessimist. And I'm not saying that there are reasons for both. I'm just saying that it is by no means self evident that things are getting worse. You know, like I can give you an example. So, you know, in the last, in the last 15 years, the millennium goal for the UN was to have world poverty, like absolute poverty, so that's less than a dollar 50 a day by 50 percent within 15 years that was actually reached ahead of schedule and we've lifted hundreds of millions of people into the middleclass over the last 30 years. And so there is an increasing inequality in the west because the working classes taken the brunt of that say that redistribution to third world countries. But by the same token, you know, there's no starvation in the world anymore except really for reasons of misdistribution and, and, and, and political purpose.

Speaker 1:          02:38          And people are becoming richer and more educated all the time. And you know, when we are waking up to our planetary responsibilities, once people stopped starving to death and having to burn like dirt and, and eat, you know, substandard food that they've scraped out into the Brown. They do start to turn their attention to things that might be more aesthetic. And so look, I don't think any reason to be pessimistic, not fundamental. And I guess the reason that capitalism is compatible with my definition of good, I wouldn't say that exactly. I would say that I don't see an alternative that has manifested itself that doesn't have far more negative consequences. You know, it's sort of a minimal pessimism issue. It's like, well this is the best devil that we have and I do believe it is because the successful societies, by any stretch of the imagination, by virtually any metric are the capitalist societies. It's certainly the case, for example, that the Soviet Union demolished far more of its natural resources. Too Far less a productive consequence than the west did hearsay evidence. There's suggestions that between 10 and 15 percent of the total area of the Soviet Union has been rendered more or less permanently uninhabitable. So the question is, compared to what.
