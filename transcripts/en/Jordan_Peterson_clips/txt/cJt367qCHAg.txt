Speaker 1:          00:00          You've said that a marriage must be based on trust and transparency and being shackled together. How and for how long should you get to know someone? How does set a foundation? Oh, well, you know there's no. There's no simple answer to that.

Speaker 2:          00:15          Hello.

Speaker 1:          00:22          I think that you should know someone well enough so that you can so that you know if you can negotiate with them and so that you have started to formulate a vision of your joint future that you can both look forward to with enthusiasm and confidence. So and of course that's going to depend to some degree on your level of maturity, but that means you've considered such things as do you have a sufficient number of joint interests and are you oriented in the same direction with regards to how you're going to handle your joint careers and the possibility of children and that the manner in which you're going to interact with your in laws and you have to start thinking about. You have to start considering your life together. From the perspective of practicality and economics, I would say so. It can't just be that massive erotic attraction that's associated with with love, although I think that's extraordinarily important and you're unbelievably fortunate if you have that and you should do everything you can to maintain it.
