Speaker 1:          00:00          One of the things we don't understand very well from a political perspective is that conservatives and liberals are actually quite different people, temperamentally, and so the way they filter the world is different and so the world presents itself as a set of facts that are different for liberals and conservatives and so it's not just a matter of opinion. It's a matter of fundamental, fundamental, temperamental orientation and to understand that other people, this is the diversity argument. If you were really making a diversity argument that was real, this is the argument you would make. People are actually different and and you need to understand the differences because there's advantages and disadvantages to all of the differences and there's also advantages and disadvantages into how we interact with each other. That's important. People to know. It's really useful to talk to someone who's different than you because they actually see a different world and if you listen to them, they can give you some insight into that world and that means that your world can expand and maybe if you knew that they were actually different, like biologically different, you'd be more inclined to listen to them because you wouldn't think that.

Speaker 1:          01:04          I mean obviously people are arbitrary and ignorant and malevolent at times. That's. Those are separate issues. But apart from all that, they're also very different from one another. And if you listen to someone who's different from you, they'll tell you things you don't know. And that's really helpful. Unless you would like to not know things and then you run like, you know, face first into walls.
