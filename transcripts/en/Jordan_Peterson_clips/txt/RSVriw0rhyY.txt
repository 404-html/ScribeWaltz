Speaker 1:          00:00          Here, here's the practical bit of information for you to, for all of you antisocial types who are going to end up in prison. So if you're in prison and you want to go on parole, okay, so you have to go in front of the judge and tell them why you're not going to do it again. So here's the deal. Here's the deal. It doesn't really matter what you did and it doesn't really matter what you promise. What matters is whether you see the judge before lunch or after lunch, because if you see the judge after lunch, the probability that you will get parole is 60 percent higher. Yeah, right. That is just like so. Never have an argument with your partner when you're hungry or when they're hungry. Especially if you want something from them. It's like, here's the sandwich. They'll eat it, then there'll be happy. Then you can manipulate them before, before that, man, no.
