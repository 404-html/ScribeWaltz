Speaker 1:          00:00          You're always contrasting what you want and happy with what you think is that they're both more and wherever there's a deviation, wherever what you want to happen isn't going on. Then you feel anxiety, curiosity as well here in pell to explore the anxiety is the thing that comes up first and the larger the magnitude of the unexpected occurrence, the greater the amount of anxiety. One of the things we're going to try to determine in the courses, how you can understand how large a disruption and given unexpected event is because you know, minor thing. Let's go back to this other diner for a second. Here's a. here's a way of looking at it. So let's say you're, you know, you're going to wear three plans to get there and this plan doesn't work, so that means that produces outcomes. It isn't what you envisioned and this plan doesn't work.

Speaker 1:          00:54          It produces on a normal civilian as well. But this plan does work well. That's no problem. I mean those are pretty minor league disruptions. All you do is you keep the same vision of yourself and the same vision of the future. You just switched between plants and you're really in trouble if none of your plans work or if someone messes around with your representation of this for this, so you can say, for example, you want to get into medical school and you need 30 courses to get into medical school and you should have a's on all of them and you get a b plus on one course. Okay, well, he's done all these other courses. That's not such a big deal. It's a minor league disruption. It causes you a certain mode of anxiety and produces a certain amount of exploratory behavior. Perhaps go with the professor and say, why isn't that I got this being the last one is expecting a don't.

Speaker 1:          01:46          You don't what that's going to do the vision of the ideal future and so on and so forth. That's one sort of disruption. You're a bit anxious, but hey, you have 29 other courses. It's not such a big deal. Now instead, write down cap and You score in the 50th percentile. Well now you're in trouble because you have a vision of yourself. We think this is your version of the unbearable present. You know a doctor that's a pain in the neck, but you're a potential doctor. You have the intellectual resources at your disposal and the educational background and and and the familial push perhaps to make him into a doctor, and so that's what you perceived yourself as. That's your story about yourself because you're the person with this set number of potentials and you also have a visual of what it is that you're going, oh, am score comes back and you're in the 15th percentile.

Speaker 1:          02:37          Well, your, your ideal future is gone. That's a big problem because that means that all of the events that have surrounded you, that surround you now and as far back as you can remember, that were given determinant significance by this particular plan have all been cast into chaos because everything that you've done up to that point has been predicated on the notion that this is where you were going and that means that the significance that you attributed to me, everything was attributed to everything in relationship to that goal. You blow out the goal and all those significant, sir, back up in the air, you have to modify your version of yourself like what the hell are you going to do now they're going to be a doctor. He put a lot of work into this. Plus it's your whole self conception. Well this is gone.

Speaker 1:          03:25          This is gone. This is irrelevant, right? I mean the other 29 courses, why the hell are you even here now? So that's one example of the levels at which normally occur. Minor League anomalies, no problem. You just screwed around with when you go to the same place, major league anomalies, it's a new ideal future. That's part of the reason that people are so prone to ideological conflicts. It's like this is an ideology can say it has a particular version of the way things are. Knowing a little bit for me to see college is pretty. It's pretty explicit. What's the unbearable presence so to speak? Well, I know this is a bit dated, but we're running out of hard line etiologies to fund that, but by the time the unbearable present is the class struggle and we kind of reasons for that, it's basically the fault of the are exploring before the ideal future is the point at which those unfair divisions of capital are eliminated debt.

Speaker 1:          04:23          There's a whole bunch of means to that end. That's that's an ideology. While someone else has a different ideology, different version of the significance of current events, a different version of the significance and the nature of the ideal future, how they completely different apprehension of how to transform one and the other. With those two cultures come into contact with how, first of all, they make each other anxious because they're not convinced, commensurate pools, and if this is the structure that regulates emotion, well what's going to happen? You can just give up your damn plans because then your emotions are dysregulated. We fall into chaos so to speak. You don't know where you are and you don't know who you are. You don't know what to do and you don't know where you're going because that makes you anxious. Neither side is going to give up. Give up near certainty. The only thing left and under what circumstances is conflict and you see this look, how do arguments escalate? An argument with someone that you love even they want one thing. You want another, you discuss it. You know, getting anywhere your tempers raised because the abstract discussion isn't healthy. Finally, you give up, maybe move to to violence to solve your problem, to hammer out story, so to speak and do that, but still oppressing the person who has the different different.
