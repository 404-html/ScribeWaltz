Speaker 1:          00:00          If you're not united within yourself and you need to be united in relationship to a higher purpose to be united within yourself, then you're weak and the world will take you apart and and and the reason it takes you apart, I think as partly because life is, is rife with suffering and it certainly bounded by mortality and those are very grim fats and unless you have hammered yourself together to find a destiny that's of sufficient nobility so that, that the so that those negative elements become tolerable, then the suffering will take you apart and, and, and, and demolish you. And so it's not optional. This is you might say, well, what does that have to do with God? And I suppose that depends on what you're, what, how you interpret God, but it certainly at least has to do with the finding of a transcendent purpose.

You know, and you're yourself, and this is a kind of a way of looking at things that, that curl you can develop your self that I'm talking about is the higher self. That tells you, for example, when your pursuit of impulsive pleasure has demeaned you or or interfered with your proper motive being and people understand that experience very well. You don't have to talk to someone very long until you can discover what they're ashamed of. For example, like why be ashamed if you aren't doing something that demeans you. Why have contempt for yourself if you're not missing the mark and with and the fact that you have shame and self contempt. He indicates that there's something in you that striving beyond what you're currently investigating and and for your libertarian types, like I would say, look, you don't have to Kowtow to an arbitrary external authority, although often there's use in that from a disciplinary perspective, but I could say just as straightforwardly and usefully that your viewers and listeners could merely stop doing what they know themselves to be wrong. Forget about what anyone else thinks. It's like you know when you've transgressed against your, your being and we we could say, well, you have an ethical. It's an ethical necessity to limit the transgressions, transgressions that you can identify against the nature of your being, and I don't see that that's a disputable point. Unless someone can step forward and claim. While I never feel any shame and everything I do, I believe to be 100 percent right. It's like get away from that person unless they're the Buddha.
