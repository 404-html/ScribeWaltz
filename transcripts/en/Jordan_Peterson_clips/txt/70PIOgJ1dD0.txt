Speaker 1:          00:00          What cures in therapy is truth. That's the curative. Now there's exposure to the things you're afraid of and avoiding as well, but I would say that's a form of enacted truth because if you know there's something you should do by your own set of rules and you're avoiding it, then you're enacting a lot. You know you're not telling one, but you're acting went out. It's the same damn thing. So if I can get you to face what it is that you're confronting that you know you shouldn't be avoiding, then what's happening is that we're both partaking in the process of attempting to act out your deepest truth and what happens is that that improves people's lives and it improves some radically and the evidence, the clinical evidence for that is overwhelming. We know that if you expose people to the things they're afraid of but that they're avoiding, they get better and you have to do it carefully and cautiously and with their own participation and all of that, but of all the things that clinicians have established that's credible, that's number one, and that's nested inside this deeper realization that the clinical experience is redemptive, let's say, because it is designed to address suffering in so far as the people who are engaged in the process are both telling each other the truth and then you think, well obviously, because if you have some problems and you come to talk to me about them, well first of all just by coming to talk to me about them.

Speaker 1:          01:14          You've admitted that they exist. Man. That's a pretty good start in second. Well, if you tell me about them, then we know what they are and then if we know what they are, we can maybe start to lay out some solutions and then you can go act out the solutions and see if they work. But if you don't admit they're there and you won't tell me what they are. And I don't, and I'm like posturing and acting egotistically and taking the upper hand in all of that in our discussions. Well, how the hell is that going to work? You know, it might be comfortable moment to moment while we stay encapsulated in our delusion, but it's not going to work. So a lot of that seems to think it through. It seems pretty self evident. And you know, Freud thought that repression was at the heart of much mental suffering.

Speaker 1:          01:57          The difference between repression and deception is matter of degree and that's all. It's technical. It's a technical differentiation. And Alfred Adler who was one of Freud's greatest associates, let's say, and much underappreciated, I would say he thought that people got into problems because they started to act out a life lie. That's what he called it, a life lie that's worth looking up because Adler, although not as charismatic as Freud, was very practical and, and really foreshadowed lot of later developments and cybernetic theory and of course young believed that you could bypass psychotherapy entirely by merely making a proper moral effort in your own life. And Carl Rogers believed that. It was honest communication mediated through dialogue that had redemptive consequences and the behaviors believe that you do a careful micro analysis of the problems that are laid before you would help introduce people to what they're avoiding. It's like all of those things to me are just secular variations of the notion that truth will set you free essentially.
