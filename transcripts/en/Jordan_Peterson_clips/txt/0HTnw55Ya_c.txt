Speaker 1:          00:00          Uh, this is always something I've been interested for, something that I've, I've, I've wanted to enrich myself with. I think a lot of people, you're, you're a busy guy as far as I can tell. You do speaking engagements, lectures, you operate a youtube channel. Presumably you're a voracious reader. I saw you on the couch. He had a book open yet, like a moment you're reading and you're a prolific tweeter. You tweet a lot. So my question is how do you tweak your approach? How do you organize your time? How do you remain focused and productive in the face of insurmountable at work lists? Schedules and I have help. I mean my wife in particular in the last year has been unbelievably helpful. I mean it's become a full time job for her really helping me manage my schedule and keep me on track. But a lot of it is like I get up in the morning, I have like everything scheduled.

Speaker 1:          00:48          I know exactly what I'm supposed to do. There's a hierarchy of, of law, of priority and I'm really operating on a day to day level right now because there's so many things to do. I can't look more than about a day or two ahead, although it's, it's, it's basically scheduled now, but I learned to discipline myself when I was in graduate school when I was writing, I wrote a book called maps of meaning that was published in 1999 and I've worked for that on that for about 15 years, about three hours a day and I really sort of grabbed myself by the scruff of the neck and forced myself to learn how to concentrate without, without deviation. How do you do that? How do you, how do you focus that intensely? Because I, I often have trouble, like I get overwhelmed sometimes when I have a lot of work and the, the worst feeling is like when I feel like I have a ton of work and I do work all day, but I still feel like I didn't get anything done.

Speaker 1:          01:42          Yeah. Yeah. But all the time you probably did probably conscientious person. Do you know? I don't even know what exactly that means. Well, okay. So that's another thing we could mention briefly. I have a website called understand myself.com and I set up a coupon code for your viewers. So it's h three, h three o what's the understand myself.com. And you can go there and take a personality test that was devised in my lab. The main researcher was Dr Colin de Young who is now a professor at the University of Minnesota, but we took the standard big five trait model, which is the standard modern personality model. So that's extroversion, which is a positive emotion dimension and extroverted people are enthusiastic and assertive. So you're both enthusiastic year. Really assertive. That would be my. I can be. Yeah, yeah. Well you wouldn't be doing this sort of thing. I'll put an extra shirt.

Speaker 1:          02:39          So because you know, you're, you're, you're, you're verbally fluent and, and um, you'd like to engage in that sort of thing. Um, so that's a positive emotion dimension. It's associated with the positive emotion that you feel when you're moving towards desired things. Um, and the next dimension is sometimes it's called neuroticism, and sometimes negative emotionality. Well, people who are high in neuroticism are, have some anticipatory anxiety. Um, you know, you know, you have anticipatory anxiety if you're worried about going somewhere and it really bugs you and then you get there and like 20 minutes later you're calm and it's okay. Big Time, big time.
