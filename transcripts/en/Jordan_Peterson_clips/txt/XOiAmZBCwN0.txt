Speaker 1:          00:00          Everyone knows that we are social identities and ideological identities, their religious or cultural, intellectual, whatever. Nobody's really paid much attention to studying how the representations of that cultural identity, um, alter the manner in which we feel emotion, which English is perceived by which we act. I'm interested in how our internal representations of our culture modulator or emotional expression, that's the best way to say no. Your brain basically, it's programmed as your social lives. That's what socialization is for. Obviously it's socialization that instills cultural identity and equally obviously the process of socialization that leads to cultural identity has to have some impact on the way you think. Obviously lay that on the way that your mind functions and the way that your brain functions and see North American neuropsychologists have been loath to give any consideration to this sort of notion to think that cultural transformations might have some direct impact on physiological function by the time the Russians.

Speaker 1:          01:04          By contrast, this has been a central tenant of their nurse neuro psychological theories. Basically since, since day one. This is particularly true with regards to Alexander learning and the God. See, now you can think about this. It's quite obvious if you think about it for a second, with regards to something like the capacity to read silently. Now here's the case that what? This is a relatively new talent. Literacy is a new talent, right? Most people aren't able to read 500 years ago. It's only been 500 years and only for a little bit of that, that the capacity to read has been widespread and the capacity to read silently as a relatively new development in human history. Now it's a good thing if you think about it, but nonetheless the capacity to read silently localized to a specific part of the brain, which is to say it's as if you have a part of the brain that's evolved for that purpose.

Speaker 1:          01:56          It's the same place and everybody more or less their individual variations or differences when people are allowed to realize differently, but all that aside, if you learn to read, there was a party of this specializes for that and it's pretty much the same place and everyone and it wasn't there or wasn't doing that sort of Bot activity. Two thousand years ago, in fact, I read at one point, I don't know where the reference to this is like so many things that I make reference to, but I've had at one point that people thought Julius Caesar was a magician in part and he was obviously a remarkable person, but in part because he can read silently, he didn't have to read aloud, so it wasn't just reading. It was remarkable. It was being able to read without talking. Anyways, the point of all this is that your brain, this is learning.

Speaker 1:          02:41          His view of the brain fundamentally is your brain is an organ that produces sub organs, culturally specific subordinates, not since that's it's remarkable capacity is that it can generate new molecules that are specialized for certain tasks. As a consequence of environmental program. This is an interesting notion which is to say that at some level of physiological analysis, at least your culture determines how you bring worse. Now, it's very plastic. Your brain is very plastic. When were a child, you can sustain immense amounts of critical damage. In childhood. I still grow up normally. For example, if you're a very, very epileptic as a child, sometimes what surgeons will do is take out a whole hemisphere, the right hemisphere on and children who have hysterectomy is if they're done young enough, still brought to be relatively normal, quite normal. In fact, in the other cases too, where people are hydrocephalic, which basically means that they're ventricles don't vamped properly, um, and cerebral spinal fluid builds up in the scouts.

Speaker 1:          03:44          These people often have stalls that are slightly larger than normal, not necessarily obvious, but what steel case. And they ended up with a skull. It's essentially full of liquid with a very, very thin layer of brain tissue around this is all liquid and there are a number of case reports of people who have like five percent of the fishing tact who have high functioning intelligence. His normal personality, so point is your, especially the higher cortical levels of your brain are very, very functionally flexible. We can childhood now by the time you have adult, you know, the pattern changes a little bit. Guy Of looks like your brain dies into it's adult configuration. That's an interesting at which is to say you have way more neurons need, especially right before you're born and environment, prunes your brain down to its adult configuration, so of course you develop connections as well, but if you lose a lot of neurons, so by the time you're an adult you're brain is nowhere near as flexible as it was when you were a child and if you have sustained damage to certain parts of you that are already specialized while you hold any, have the damage and you can work around it, but it can still be really prominent question.

Speaker 1:          04:57          So that's sort of the market and it's. Yeah, that's right because the brain adapts or as the body. That's a great comment. You know, and if you start thinking about that, it has really revolutionary implication. So you can say, for example, if I have an idea that's really radical in the sense that changes the configuration of my core tasks, I can transmit that maybe not to you. Maybe your brain is already fixed, so to speak. Put down the generations and altered the structure of brains, hand sports. So you could say, well, ideas can spread through a population that way. That's a lamarckian spread. Even more interesting, I think this is speculative of course, but let's say that there are certain types of revolutions in thought that are actually the consequences of biological mutations. So you could sing that well, you're a particularly odd sort of person from the genetic perspective and as a consequence you think, and a very, very unique matter.

Speaker 1:          05:50          But the thing that's so interesting is that if you can still communicate those thoughts, then the effect of that genetic mutation be transmitted throughout the population without any biological alteration at the genetic level at all. So that's really something, something that's interesting because it means that the consequences of genetic mutation. So in competition can spread throughout the population is fast as communication could move. So that's, yeah, the Lamarckian everybody know what the transmission is. Well, Lamarck was the character who thought that the reason that that you could, you can transmit acquired characteristics. So the reason drafts at Lomax is because it kept trying to stretch their next basically. So, and they transmitted the capacity to do stretching to their offspring so you can transmit acquired characteristics down the genetic line, but there's no, you can't do that. That's wrong. But that's what Lamar thought. But he wasn't completely wrong because there is. That is how this sort of transmission works. It's non genetically mediated cumulation of biological resources. So that's very interesting.
