Speaker 1:          00:00          So what I've been trying to do with my videos and, and, and, and I think this is part of the reason that they've become so popular, in fact, I'm certain of it, is that I've been trying to agitate for the adoption of that personal responsibility as an alternative to political ideology. It's like get your act together, have a vision, straighten out your life. Say what you think, you know, stay away from the ideological idiocies and simplicity and oversimplifications and try to put yourself together. Because I think that I do believe at the most fundamental level, and I think this is the remarkable realization of Western civilization, is that the well developed individual is the antidote to the tyranny of society and biology. I think that's our great discovery in the West. It's not like other cultures haven't had that idea in nascent form, but it's been hyper developed in the west and I think it's right. And so we abandoned that, that, that pathway of divine individuality and revert to ideological identification of race or sex. We're going to tear each other apart. And I think part of the reason we're motivated to do that, Joe, is because many people don't want to bear the responsibility of developing themselves as individuals, so they'll, they'll shuffle off the responsibility. And if that means that you know, we're dancing in the streets because everything's on fire, that'll be just fine. And that's another thing that's adding to the terrible danger that we're in right now. So.
