Speaker 1:          00:00          Your authentic leftism is populist. Okay. It is based in working class style, working class language, working class, direct emotion and an openness and brushing some speech. Okay. Not this fancy, contorted jargon of the pseudo leftist of academe who are frauds. These people, these people who managed to manage to rise to the top and ended at Berkeley and Harvard and Princeton. Okay. You have any of these people are radical. They are career people. Their corporate types. Okay. Then who like who succeeded in and they love the institutional context. They know how to manipulate the bureaucracy which has totally invaded in usurped. Okay. The or they have an academe everywhere. Okay. These people are company poor players. They could have done well in any, any field, and then they, they love to sit in endless committees. They love bureaucratic regulation and so on. There's not one, not one leftist.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Okay. And American academe raised his or her voice against obscene growth. Growth of tuition costs which have bankrupted a whole generation of young people. Not, not one voice. Okay. To challenge that. That invasion by the bureaucrats. Okay. Actual fascist bureaucrats. Okay. Well, if whoever added the cancerous, okay, there's so many of them can. If they told the faculty have completely lost any power in American academia. Okay. It's us. It's a scandal. What has happened and they deserve the president's servitude that they're in right now. Okay. Because they never protested. When I. my first job at Bennington College, 1976. I was there when there was an uprising by the faculty against encroachment, by the board of trustees and the president. Okay. And it was a huge thing. It was, it was. It was reported on the New York Times and so on. And we. And we pushed that president out and, and there's not been a single uprising of mankind against, against encroachment, by the trustees and by the administrations and all these decades. Okay. Passive slaves. Slaves. They deserve their slavery.

Speaker 2:          01:50          Yup. I couldn't agree more. I thought the same thing about university professors for a long time is that they get exactly what they deserve because they never stand up and say no. And the fact that in the United States, it's not quite as bad in Canada, I wouldn't say, but the fact that the students have been essentially handed a bill of indentured servitude here for the student loans is absolutely beyond comprehension. You know, it seems to me that the bureaucracy has basically conspired to determine how to pick the pockets of the students' future earnings. Right? And they do that by offering them an extended adolescence with no quality control, something like that. So it's a real bargain with the devil.
