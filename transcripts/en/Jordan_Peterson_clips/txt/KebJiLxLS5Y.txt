Speaker 1:          00:00          Of course, you know that nature was the philosopher who announced the death of God, right, and who is a great, great critic of Christianity at vicious critic of Institutional Christianity in the best sense, you know, and he announced the death of God and he said that we'd never find enough water to wash away the blood. It wasn't a triumphant proclamation even though it's often read that way and niches conclusion from that, from the death of God, the fact that our ethical systems, we're going to collapse. When the foundation was pulled out from underneath him, he believed that human beings would have to find their own values to create their own values, and there's a problem with that because it doesn't seem. This is something Carl young was very thorough in investigating, doesn't really look like people are capable of creating their own values because you're not really capable of molding yourself just any old way.

Speaker 1:          00:48          You want to be like you have a nature that you have to contend with, and so it isn't a matter of creating our own values because we don't have that capacity. It might be a matter of rediscovering those values, which is what [inaudible] was attempting to do now. And, and, and so I think Nietzsche was actually profoundly wrong in that, in that recommendation. I think he was psychologically wrong. Now, you know, there was [inaudible] wrote in many ways in parallel to. Nisha was a great influence on Ninja. Their, their lives parallel each other to a degree that's somewhat miraculous and in some senses it's quite uncanny. Dostoevsky was obviously a literary figure, whether whereas nature was a philosopher, a literary philosopher, but still a philosopher and Dostoevsky wrestled with exactly the same problems that, that nature wrestled with and, but he did it in a different way.

Speaker 1:          01:38          He didn't literary manner and he has this great book and the brothers Karamazov. And in that book there's a hero of the book is really Leo Show Who's a monastic novitiate, a very good guy, kind of a, not an intellect, not an intellect, but, uh, a person of great character, you know, and, but he has a brother Ivan, who's his older brother who a great intellect and, and a very handsome soldier and a brave man. And like Dostoyevsky's villains, Ivan isn't exactly a villain, but that's close enough. Ivan or Dostoevsky makes his villains extraordinarily powerful. So if Dostoevsky's trying to work out an argument, he, he clothes the argument in the, in the flesh of one of his characters, and if it's an argument he doesn't agree with and he makes that character as strong as he possibly can, as strong and as attractive and intelligent as he possibly can.

Speaker 1:          02:24          And then he let him just have outer. And so Ivan is constantly attacking Lee Osha and from every direction trying to knock him off his perch of faith, let's say, and the Osha Lee. Osha can't address a single one of Ivan's criticisms and, and he doesn't have the intellect for it. And, and, and Ivan has a devastating intellect. It's devastating to him himself as well. What happens in the brothers Karamazov essentially is the daily. Alicia continues to act out his commitment to the good, let's say. And in that manner, he's triumphant. It doesn't matter that he loses the arguments because the arguments aren't exactly the point. The arguments in some sense are aside.
