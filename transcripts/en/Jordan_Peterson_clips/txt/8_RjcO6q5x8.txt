Speaker 1:          00:00          I had a friend at one point who was a very bitter person and he had a bunch of problems and some of them were self inflicted in some of them were fate I suppose, and he had his. He had become very, very destructive, murderously, destructive, genocidally destructive. I would say. You could see it in his dreams and, and he lived with me for awhile and I knew him very well. He was a friend of mine from the time I was 12 until the time he committed suicide when he was 40 and when he lived with me I was trying to help him get on his feet, which was why he had come to live with me because he thought maybe I could help him get on his feet and he could only take relatively low level jobs. You know, like he had some mechanical ability.

Speaker 1:          00:46          He didn't, he didn't get educated. Although he's a very, very smart person. He probably had an Iq of about 135 or something like that. He's very smart and so he was bitter too because he hadn't educated themselves to the level that has, as you know, his intellect would have demanded. So we had to take jobs that were beneath him intellectually and he had a re. He had that real intellectual arrogance, you know, because he was smart and really smart people often come to believe that only smart matters and if they're smart and all that and all that matters is smart and then the world is sort of laying itself at their feet and they've been terribly betrayed and, and then they claim to their intelligence which is more like a talent or a gift. Like it's like it's an idol, you know, a false idol, which is exactly what it is in a very dangerous one.

Speaker 1:          01:30          And get cynical about the stupidity of the world and the fact that there are talents weren't properly recognized and that's just not that helpful because smart is a good thing. But I'll tell you, if you don't use it properly, it will devour you just like all arbitrarily assigned. Tell it right. So you might have a talent, but it's your friend. If you use it properly and you misuse it, it will be your enemy and maybe that's how God keeps the cosmic scales adjusted. But anyhow, my friend was a very smart person, although not as smart as he thought he was unfortunately and and, but he hadn't done what would have been necessary with that intelligence to make it manifest itself properly in the world. And that also embittered him because he also knew that there was more that he could have done if he would have done it and perhaps more that he could still do what I was suggesting to him while he was living with us because he was, you know, two levels from homeless by that point was that he should find a job that he could find working in a garage, working in a shop, something like that because he had some mechanical ability and that he should do.

Speaker 1:          02:37          He should separate himself from the arrogance that made him presumed that such a job would be beneath him because at that point no job was beneath him. And, but more importantly, it's not so obvious that jobs are beneath people, you know. Because even if you're a, even if you imagine you have a job as a checkout person in a grocery store, you know as a fairly unskilled job, you can be in some miserable, resentful, horrid bastard doing that job. Boy, you know you can come in there just exuding resentment and bitterness and making mistakes and making sure that every customer that passes by you has a slightly worse day than they need to write and pilfering time and perhaps pilfering goods and being resentful about the people who, who gave you the position because they're above you in the dominance hierarchy and talking bad things.
