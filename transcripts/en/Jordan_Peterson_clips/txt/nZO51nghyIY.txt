Speaker 1:          00:01          Clease Noren how to use the results in the new personality test for progress in life, trying to compensate some sites that that received fewer points, well at the risk of sounding self. That's actually why we developed the self authoring suite, was to help people improve their website performance and mental health. Now, we don't have direct evidence that will, that will improve personality, but I suspected that evidence would take a very long time to accumulate. What we do know is that the self authoring suite, especially the future authoring suite, um, helps people, helps university students, for example, stay enrolled in university. It increases the probability of that by about 25 percent and increase his grade point average by about the same. Then there's good theoretical reasons for assuming that writing is a good way of, of, um, writing about yourself and about your past and about your future is a good way of catalyzing personality transformation because it appears that personality, the human psyche is organized at the highest level of abstraction.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Using something like self narrative and a well-developed narrative makes the frame for your life and helps you stabilize your negative emotions. And also experience more positive emotions because you only experienced positive emotion in relationship to a goal and that can make goal directed activity lot more rewarding. So you know, it's a lot easier to engage in activities that aren't intrinsically rewarding if they're linked to something that you really find important. And so I would say if you want to work on your personality, well the first thing you have to do is figure out who it is that you want to be and then you have to make the plan and maybe you have to clean up your past as well. And the self authoring suite was designed no quite carefully in order to help people do that with a relative minimum of effort. Not that it's easy because it's not, but a relative minimum minimum of effort compared to other technologies, let's say, and like, like longterm psychotherapy and, uh, to make it cost effective as well. So.
