Speaker 1:          00:00          So the temporary victory, it's also something really good to know about marriage. It's like you can never win an argument with your wife, like you could if you only lived with her for one day. Right? It's like I wanna see you later. It's like, no, no, she's there the next day. And then she's been, she does. She does remember that. Yeah, maybe even more than you remember it, you know. And it also might be that she was right and you just out argued her. So. And that's something that's really worth knowing too because sometimes you know, you'll have an argument with, well let's say with your wife and she's got something to say and it's not very well articulated. Same could be true for you. And so you can just brush it aside, but you don't want to brush it aside because maybe there's something there and if you don't address it then it's not like it's gonna go away, man.

Speaker 1:          00:46          It's going to grow. So maybe you have to help her formulate her argument, which is really annoying because you want to win and you have in this dispute, I want to win. So like, well, you're not winning that game. You're winning the game. Well, I think about it as the game of games. You want to win the set of games that stretch across time, the long war. Yeah, that's right. Exactly where that little battles knocking, no matter and in fact you should not try and be right. If you're right, everybody knows it's fine, but there's the worst thing to do is rub it in and say, I'm right and you're wrong. Yeah. You do that 100 times and then like, well you're the, you're the winner and she's the loser. And then that's great because now you're married to a loser. I mean, you know, that's. If you do that 100,000 times, then your marriage is over and then and then there'll be hell to pay. You can be sure of that.
