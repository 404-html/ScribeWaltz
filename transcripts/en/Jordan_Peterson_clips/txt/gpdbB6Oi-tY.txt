Speaker 1:          00:00          Dr. Peterson, I heard you recently say that if a woman doesn't want a baby by age 30, that something is unhealthy. I take no offense to that assertion. Rather I am taking it very seriously. I'm 34 years old in a longterm relationship but don't feel desire to have children. I always thought that I would one day but I'm getting older and that I'm getting older and that day still hasn't come. I'm terrified of raising, realizing too late that I should have had a family. But I'm also terrified of having them and regretting it because I never truly want it to be a mother. I don't think I have any ideology of play. I'm not a feminist or anything like that. When you say something might be wrong or unhealthy, where might I look? Any advice on how to make this change? What won't make this choice?

Speaker 1:          00:43          Ps, my boyfriend and I both had he depaul mothers perhaps that is relevant. Well it might be relevant given that you saw fit to um, include it as a potential detail. And one of the rules that I would operate by as a psychotherapist is that if a client is inclined to add a detail to the, to the formulation of a problem, that the details are likely to be relevant. Um, but I can't tell, right? Because of course I can't use it a rule of thumb. And so you might object, well, I shouldn't have used to rule of thumb to say something like if a woman doesn't want a baby by the age of 30, that something is unhealthy. Well, they're going to be exceptions to every general rule. But my attitude to this essentially is that we have all come from an unbroken string of 3.5 million years of successful mothers.

Speaker 1:          01:36          And so the probability that that's going to be part and parcel of, um, healthy woman's desire and not only a woman, no. Obviously men desire to have a family too and often very intensely. It's just that men have a much longer time span over which to consider such things. Uh, so perhaps the chips are down so rapidly and to the same degree for men. Um, I wouldn't be so bold as to say that there's anything wrong with you, the questioner specifically. Um, maybe you have the sort of temperament that isn't particularly inclined towards maternal behavior. Uh, that might be someone who's low in agreeableness and well, that would be the primary issue. Um, and so I wouldn't take my word for it, that if you don't want to have a child in your 30, that there is necessarily something specifically wrong with you. But I would say as a rule of thumb, it's, it's part of the normal panoply of human desires and values. And so if, if, if there's violent objection to having a family, something like that, then generally that seems to me to be indicative of something that might be at least worth looking into.
