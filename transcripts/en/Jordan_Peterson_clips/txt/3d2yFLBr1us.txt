Speaker 1:          00:00          I saw you tweet this recently and it really, uh, shook me a little bit. I was shocked. I was shocked to see this. I like this one a lot. I'll introduce this. So, so you said those who consider themselves my enemies had been posting these all around my home neighborhood and it says here, Community Safety Bulletin, Jordan Pearson, a local man teaching at the University of Toronto has been championing against the human rights of women, people of color, Muslims and l, G, b t people for over a year. Peterson has opened association with Neo Nazis and the outright even being referred to as a Nazi philosopher by the leader of the new constitution party of Canada due to pressure from Jordan Peterson's alright. Fan Base, the University of Toronto has not taken any action to fire him or disavow his attacks on minority groups. Look, this is awful. I mean that's something where there's a bunch of things about it that I really, that, that are really creative.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Let's say the first is they posted it in my neighborhood which is really nasty and it's really underhanded. And, and, and, and like thoughtfully. So, you know, there's a double message there, it's like we know where you are, we know where your family is and we're perfectly willing to, um, make that known and to hypothetically embarrass you in front of your neighbors and the community safety bulletin, that's really a little stroke of genius, you know, because people are going to watch that. And then one of the most underhanded things they did, they'll, which, which, which you can't really tell by looking at the poster because I look kind of angry there and it looks like exactly. I'm going to choose something off there. And um, but what's really interesting about that is that that picture was taken at a rally that I spoke out in favor of free speech, of course, that I was invited to speak at.

Speaker 1:          01:46          And during the rally, the same kind of activist who put up this poster, took the mic and shut off the PA system and blasted everyone with white noise. So in order to be heard, I had to raise my voice a lot. And so they took a picture. So really here I am, they baby to essentially made it impossible for me to speak unless I spoke very loudly and so that's what I'm doing here. So they actually took a picture of me reacting appropriately in the situation to provocation from them to make me look like, well, who knows? Like, like, well, like an angry, like a, like an angry guy, or you just want to, you want to round up some minorities. I look of it. Yep. This is some impressive propaganda, mean genius. You're right. It is. It's impressive. It's disturbing that people are, can be so consciously manipulative.
