Speaker 1:          00:00          Dr peterson, I'm considering going into the education stream slash system. Do you have any advice for me not to become a mouthpiece for indoctrinating young students? Well, one thing I would recommend is that you don't write essays that you don't believe in. I think that's a sin. I think it's a sin to use your words falsely and the reason for that, like there's a good series of social psychology experiments that show, like imagine that you bring someone into a lab and you have them write an essay about or fill out a questionnaire about their political opinions. You know, so you get a baseline measure of their political stance and then you asked them to write a thousand words. Maybe they identify as, right, wait, and then you get them to write a thousand word essay on why a particular left wing position is true and then you have them come back in two weeks and you give them the same political belief questionnaire. They'll, they'll have shifted quite radically towards the left. And the reason for that is that people don't think through their positions in great detail. And so if you get them to think through a contrary position in great detail.
