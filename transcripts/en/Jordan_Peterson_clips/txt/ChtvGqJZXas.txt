Speaker 1:          00:00          Nothing motivates me aside from eating to sleeping. I lie in my bed all day, no one on my computer or my phone not doing anything. I just lie there thinking what's happening to me. I would say that you are. This is not a diagnostic comment and I don't know enough about you to provide that sort of information, but I would recommend that you see a therapist and be screened for depression because that's what it looks like to me and I would say that if it's depression you should do something about it because depression is very hard on people that produces a lot of stress hormones like cortisol and that can hurt human man. You know, if it's only been a couple of days I wouldn't worry about it, but if it's a chronic pattern then you should go talk to somebody. Even your family doctor, you know, and there's always the possibility that a low dose of an antidepressant might be worth trying.

Speaker 1:          00:47          You know, in a month if it fixed you. But I would say don't, don't stay in that situation now. Go, go find out, do whatever you have to do to get out of it, and especially the fact that you're not on your computer and you're not doing anything, you know, you're, you're ruminating, that's just lying there thinking about snoop's of negative emotion and you don't have any positive emotion, you know, that's why you're not on your computer or your phone. And so one of the characteristics of depression was supposed to have the characteristics is a decrease in positive motivation. And so that means that you're not interested in anything and an increase in negative emotion and that can manifest itself in. Now I'm just lying there thinking, you know, so, um, go talk to someone, go talk to someone, tell someone that this is happening, gift to your family doctor, let them know what's happening. Get them to give you a depression screening and uh, and see what you can do about it because there are effective treatments for depression. And sometimes antidepressants work like a absolute charm.
