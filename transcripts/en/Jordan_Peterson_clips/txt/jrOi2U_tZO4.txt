Speaker 1:          00:00          It's our shared apprehensions about the implications of situations for behaviors that constitute our cultures and it's those shared maps that bring predictability to our interpersonal relationships. You can only understand that if you understand what the world is like when it's not predictable and it's difficult to understand that for water and people who live in peaceful times because our culture is so successful at regulating our interpersonal behavior and even the environment for that matter, but we hardly ever encounter a situation where anything remotely unpredictable happens, so you can't tell what it's like to be faced with something that's unpredictable, so you don't know what it's like when you're in an environment where it doesn't rain because you're part of a successful community in your extraordinarily well protected it. You're like, you're like a a boy that lives inside the castle. You can't see over the wall, doesn't even know that they're there.

Speaker 1:          00:51          There's all sorts of terrible things outside the castle, but everything inside is peaceful and that's the world. The boy has no idea what he would be like if we went outside into the real world where things were actually a predictable because he's only had a chance to observe his behavior under stable conditions. Wherever that is predictable and acceptable. It's even worse now in a sentence. It's better the way to. I mean it is peaceful now anyways. I mean even compared to 15 years ago, there's much less ideological dispute in the world about how the conduct is fair is then there was staying in the mid seventies when people are more or less. I mean I know there's exceptions to this, but people the world over half, more or less accepted in this desk, for example, for a market economy, there aren't very many ideologies that appear attractive even in the imagination in contrast to to Western style democracies and I mean that's a pretty recent occurrence and it's unlikely to last for any great length of time I think, but it is peaceful now that the fact that that piece makes it even more difficult for us to either to understand ourselves or to be sufficiently motivated.

Speaker 1:          01:54          I'm just kind of just also because when things are going really well and everything's predictable, then you presume that you know what you're doing. In fact, that's the basis on which you base your judgments about whether you know what you're doing. If you perform a procedure and what you predicted it occurs. You're right. That doesn't mean you know everything, but as far as you're concerned, that's sufficient.
