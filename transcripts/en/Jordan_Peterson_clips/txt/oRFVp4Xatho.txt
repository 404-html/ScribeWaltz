Speaker 1:          00:00          How do you feel? I know that people make this association with you because I've seen it when we have guests come on, we have a thread on our reddit and people post their questions and I've seen it before people associate you with pandering to like white supremacists or worse. I've even seen the suggestion that you are a white supremace per supremacist yourself. So how do you feel about that? And that's, that seems to be like a somewhat widely held.

Speaker 2:          00:27          Well, I don't want to think about that. It's completely ridiculous. Like for example, I'm the member of A. I'm an honorary member of a native American tribe. I got inducted last year. I have an Indian name, a native American name, like it's completely preposterous and I've been buying carvings from this like isolated tribe in northern Vancouver for northern northern Vancouver Island for 15 years, you know? And so and I've had lot might. Well it's, it's preposterous. And, and I mean the, the, the, there's evidence that it's preposterous and the evidence is that I have 260 videos on youtube and they must total at least 600 hours, something like that. And you know, by now people have been over them essentially with a fine tooth comb. Virtually everything I've said in my classes to my students in the last 25 years is on video. And so if there was anything in there that was even remotely associated with that, it would come out and, but it's even worse than that because it's actually the opposite because the reason I've been teaching students for since 1993 about the Holocaust and what happened in the Soviet Union, you know, and I've been trying to make them understand how that's associated with, with the unwillingness to accept personal responsibility and educating them as deeply as I can about the horrors of, of, of exactly that sort of thing.

Speaker 2:          01:50          I could say obsessed me ever since I was, while ever since I was very, very young. And so not only is it not true, it's, it's anti true, it's seriously untrue. Right.
