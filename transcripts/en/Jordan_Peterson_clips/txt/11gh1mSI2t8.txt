Speaker 1:          00:00          Little kids should be doing whatever they can that's productive and useful as young as they can. Like if you have a two year old is just toddling around, you know you can get that two year old to set the table. We used to have our kids do that. It's really funny to watch it because the table's like half above their heads. So you know, you give the two year old and knife, not a sharp one. Obvious. That's a different cycle. I can save that for next time. Peterson. Yeah, exactly. You know when you say, okay, go put this on the table now they can't exactly put it beside the plate because they can't see the damn plate, but the kids are actually. If you're careful with them and you, you adjust your expectations to their level of developing expertise. That's called the zone of proximal development.

Speaker 1:          00:41          By the way there they're more than happy to, to comply because it helps them develop and move forward and they have a really powerful instinct for them, you know? And with kids, it's also interesting if you, if you watch them very carefully, you can see when they're ready for the next task, you know, and then also the kids, you know, people talk a lot about self esteem, which is very badly conceptualized self esteem because it, it'll come to me and you should feel good about yourself, which I don't believe. I think you should feel good about who you, who you could be if you've got your act together and you shouldn't be feeling so good about who you are now and your story state. It's like, what the hell, man, you're 17. Don't be feeling too good about yourself. Get the hell. Get your act together and see what you could be and feel good about your trajectory. That's way different, but also your competence. And so like even with little kids is they know they're being taken care of. They have an existential debt to their parents is like if you allow them to be useful and encourage them to do things, then they get to pay off that existential debt and then they can see that they're contributing members of even this small society and it's no lie.
