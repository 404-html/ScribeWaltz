Speaker 1:          00:00          Can I ask your thoughts on Brexit? Yes, you can have my thoughts on brexit and the other day I was doing a lecture on the on the stories in genesis and one of the stories that I analyze briefly, and this will be posted very soon is the story of the Tower of Babel and I've been very curious about that story. It comes after Noah's flood myth in genesis. What happens is that human beings get together and they decide to build a massive building and the human beings that are building that building all speak in one voice and they have this grand vision which you might regard as a utopian vision, which is what I think it is, that they can build a building so high that within it everyone will speak the same language and it will reach all the way to have it, and so you could see it in some sense as an attempt to usurp the transcendent.

Speaker 1:          00:49          I kind of read it as an an early precursor of the story that Milton told and paradise lost. Where Satan, who's God's highest heavenly angel and perhaps and who's Lucifer? The brightest light in the psychic hierarchy you might say, and the spirit of untrammeled rationality decides that he can wage war in heaven and overcome God, overcome the ultimate in the transcendent value, and I read that as a cautionary tale about the pride that goes along with intellectual presupposition in the same pride that produced the totalitarian states of the 20th century. What happens with the Tower of Babel is that human beings start to build this, a unitary homogenous structure who's pinnacle will reach into God's heavenly domain, perhaps thereby taking the place of the transcendent. God gets wind of that and goes to earth and takes the people or or transforms the people who are, who are building them.
