Speaker 1:          00:00          Well, think of reward as what happens with you achieved something, but that's not exactly right. Not with human beings. Most of the time we feel reward when or so engagement and, and, and, and, and, and, and positive the positive desire to move forward in life when there's evidence that we're moving towards a valuable goal. So we're making progress. It's like, yes, we're making progress. There's a real neurochemical kick that comes along with that. The same system that cocaine effects and amphetamines. And so with rats for example, you can get wrapped hooked on cocaine if they're alone in a cage and they'll self administer cocaine until basically until they die. But if they're doing rat things with the route buddies, like they're not that interested in cocaine. So, so, and the reason I'm saying that is because like a rat who's out with his rat buddies doing rat things gets enough reward from that.

Speaker 1:          00:52          So the drugs aren't that attractive. So part of the reason that people take drugs like cocaine is because they're not doing enough things that are deeply meaningful, you know? And so, but you don't get meaning unless he got a name because you're. Your nervous system is wired to give you a pat on the back when you're making progress towards your aim. Well, so you've got to have an aim and the aim should be high because otherwise why bother with it, but it should also be broken down into steps that you have a reasonably high probability of attaining. You know, with a kid you want to say, well, you're trying to get your kid to develop you. You don't give them an impossible task. You give them a task that's slightly harder than that, which they can already do. Right? And so they're engaged by that. Maybe they're a little anxious about it, but they master it and they've. They've expanded their domain of competence. It's no game. It's a big deal to do that and that kids love that, that that's where you learn in that zone. You know where you're pushing yourself just a little bit beyond where you are.
