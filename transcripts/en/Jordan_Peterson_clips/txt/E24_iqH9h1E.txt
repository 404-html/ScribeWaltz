Speaker 1:          00:00          The realization that pleasure could be usefully for stole dawn with a difficulty that's almost impossible to overstate a realization runs absolutely contrary to our ancient fundamental animal instincts which demand immediate satisfaction, particularly under conditions of deprivation, which are both inevitable and commonplace, and to complicate the matter, such delay only becomes useful when civilization has stabilized itself enough to guarantee the existence of the delayed reward. If everything you save will be destroyed or worse, stolen, there's no point saving. It's for this reason that a wolf will down 20 pounds of raw meat in a single meal. He isn't thinking, man, I hate it when I binge. I should save some of this for next week. Here's a developmental progression from animal to human. It's wrong, no doubt in the details, but it's sufficiently correct for our purposes in theme. First, there's excess food. Large carcasses. Mammoths are other massive herbivores might provide that way.

Speaker 1:          01:02          A lot of mammoth, maybe all of them with a large animal. There's some left for later after a kill. That's accidental at first, but eventually the utility of for later starts to be appreciated. Some provisional notion of sacrifice develops at the same time. If I leave some now, even if I want it now, I won't have to be hungry later. That provisional notion then develops to the next level. If I leave some for later, I won't have to go hungry and neither will those I care for and then to the next level. I can't possibly eat all this mammoth, but I can't store the rest for too long either. Maybe I should feed some to other people. Maybe they'll remember and feed me some of their mammoth when they have some and I have none. Then I'll get some mammoth now and some mammoth later. That's a good deal and maybe those I'm sharing with will come to trust me more generally.

Speaker 1:          02:02          Maybe then we could trade forever in such a manner. Mammoth becomes future, mammoth and future. Mammoth becomes personal reputation. That's the emergence of the social contract to share does not mean to give away something you value and get nothing back. That's only instead what? Every child who refuses to share his afraid that it means to share means properly to initiate the process of trade. A child who can't share, who can't trade, can't have any friends because having friends is a form of trade. Benjamin Franklin once suggested that a newcomer to a neighborhood ask a new neighbor to do him or her a favor citing an old maxim. He that has once done, you have kindness, will be more ready to do you another. Then he whom you yourself have obliged in Franklin, so opinion. Asking something for someone, asking someone for something not too extreme.
