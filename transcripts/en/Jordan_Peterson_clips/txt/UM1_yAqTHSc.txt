Speaker 1:          00:00          People often talk about the whole cost in terms of the relationship between the Jews and the Germans are between the Jews and the Nazis was obviously playing the part of victims and the Nazis often for always playing the part of the perpetrators and of course this has absolutely comprehensible from the historical point of view, but it also strikes me that if what we remember is that the Nazis killed the Jews that were already on the road to making a mistake that similar to the mistake that was, it was made that led to the Holocaust to begin with, which is to identify characteristics that lead to patterns of action of that sort as characteristics of groups identifiable groups. And it seems to me, I mean, I'm not trying to equate the role of the Jews and the Nazis and the Holocaust. I would obviously be observed, but when I'm trying to second into the lesson, it seems to me to be.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Especially when you consider that the propensity for whole costs like, uh, events is deeply rooted in human nature. The lesson to draw from the events of World War II, that's what human beings are like, knowing what the Nazis were like because these sorts of events happen all the time. I mean it's obviously the case that there are. There are well in the 20th century alone, English and benefit the concentration camp in South Africa, Germans, her fact that Chinese used to great advantage, so an s an estimated also show this on the next slide, 66 million people in the Soviet Union were killed as a consequence of internal repression, many of whom went through camp like procedures on their road to their demise, see ethnic cleansing occurring in places like Rwanda and even once again in Europe and the Balkans, whatever it was that we were supposed to learn from the events of the Second World War hasn't been learned nor being remembered because you can't remember what you don't understand and that's what this course is about.

Speaker 1:          01:50          I've been working for since 1985, I guess the on trying to figure out what it is about people remember hunting around. Maybe you know this. Maybe she's a famous political scientist. She was a student of Martin heidegger. She wrote a book called the banality of evil, and one of her points was that these people, she was talking about the Nazis in particular, people who perpetrate events like this, if you meet them when you talk to them, if you have encountered with them, the thing that's often striking about them is not their striking abnormality or the resident evil, but the fact that they're very much like other people that you might've met, which was supposed to be surprised. So surprising. When you think about how thoroughly, for example, the Nazi movement dominated the German Punch with a sort of likewise with communism in the Soviet Union. I mean those ideological movements characterized people, characterized some strange sort of misfits whose consciousness was characterized by something in comprehensible that led them to perform the kind of actions that we are theoretically supposed to remember.

Speaker 1:          02:54          My perspective on all the assistant, the fact people are capable of perpetrating atrocities, light those characterize. The whole foster says something about why people are like, what everybody's like because it strikes me that that kind of tendency is something that's deeply rooted in human nature and then to say that, but what was it about the Nazis or what was it about the Soviet communists that lend them to participate in this sort of behavior is completely decided to point in a sense. All that does is you're looking for some sort of group characteristic. It's devoid. You don't have any personal relationship with that group. The problem is instantly made abstract and as far as I'm concerned, if it's abstract open, once again, nothing is remember now. What I want to do is to try. I want to outline the reasons why. Something like the Holocaust, what it is about us that make us so concerned with protecting art group identities, what those identities mean, what role they play in the regulation of emotion.

Speaker 1:          03:59          That's the critical thing right there for me. Etiologies are art are the expression in a sense, the verbal expression of the internal structures that regulate our emotions. When you mess around with someone's ideologies, therefore as a consequence, you're messing around with the inhibitory structure that regulates the interplay between their emotions. Whatever your identity is, plays some role in regulating your emotional nature and your physiology because your thoughts are embodied. They're part of your mind, you're a part of your brain. You want to get right down to it. People have belief systems and they'll do anything to protect, and I find that peculiar. What is so important about belief system that would lead people to do things, normal people, as far as I'm concerned, to commit acts that under normal circumstances would would be conceived of as incomprehensible even by those people. So I also hoped to make, as I said, I want to make the lessons here personally. I'm not interested in discussing the issue from the abstract perspective because I don't think that an issue, an issue of this magnitude deserves to be discussed. Data at an abstract level. It's not an abstract problem. It's something. There's something peculiar about us that we have to learn to control because as far as I'm concerned, we're technologically powerful to remain at the whims of the uncomprehending aspects of our nature.
