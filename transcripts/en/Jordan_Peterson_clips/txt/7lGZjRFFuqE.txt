Speaker 1:          00:00          So I got a story to tell you that you might like, because I've thought a lot about that use of language, you know, because language can be used as camouflage. And so here's the story. I think I got this from Robert Sapolsky, so he was talking about zebras and zebras of course have stripes and hypothetically that's associated with camouflage, but it's not a straightforward association because zebras are black and white and they're on the velt along with the lions. The lions are camouflage because their grasp colored. But the bloody zebras are black and white. You can see them like 15 miles away. So okay. So biologists go out to study zebras and they're like making notes on a zebra and they watch it and then they look down at their notes and then they look up and they think, oh no, I don't know which Zebra I was looking at.

Speaker 1:          00:45          So the camouflage is actually against the herd because the zebras, a herd animal, not an individual. And so the black and white stripes breakup the animal against the herd so you can't identify it. So this was a quandary for the biologists. So they did one of two things, one was drive a jeep up to the, to the zebra, heard and use a dab of red paint and Dab the horn. Should the zebra or tag it with an ear tag like used for cattle. The lions would kill it. So as soon as it became identifiable the Predator, yes, the predators could organize their hunt around that. Identify all about animal. That's why you know there's the old idea that lions and predators take down the weak animals, but they don't. They take down the identifiable animals. So that's the thing is if you stick your damn head up, you get picked off by predators.

Speaker 1:          01:31          And so one of the things that academics seem to do is congregate together in heard like entities and then they share a language, right? And the language unites them and also keeps them. As long as they share the same set of linguistic tools among themselves there, they know that there isn't anybody in the, in the codery that's going to attack them or deed destabilize the entire herd. And that seems to me to account for that impenetrable use of language. It's, it's, it's group protection strategy and it has absolutely nothing to do with the search for. It's the search for security within a system and not the desire to expand the system.
