Speaker 1:          00:00          There's some lovely representations of of Paradise. This is a garden of earthly delights. What's his name? Say That Bosh? Yes. Hieronymus Bosch. He has a crazy. I mean if you, how he didn't get burnt at the stake is absolutely beyond me. I mean, you know, some of you know about Salvador Dali, I suppose most of you do. I mean delis a piker compared to Hieronymus Bosch. Man, you could spend because there's three pieces of this particular painting. You could spend a very bizarre and surreal month looking at that painting. I don't know what it was with Bosch, but he was some sort of creature that only popped up once and probably for the best. And so there's been very many representations of Paradise Mean God only knows what that is. It's like I could probably guess, but I won't. And then look, I mean that's, that's, that's the lion lying down with the lamb.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Right? So that's this idea that's maybe projected back in time that there was a time or maybe will be a time when, when the, the horrors of life are no longer necessary for life itself to exist. Right. And the horrors of life, or of course that everything eats everything else and that everything dies and that everything is born in the whole bloody places at charnel house and it's, it's a catastrophe from beginning to end. And this is, this is the vision of it being. Other than that. And you know, there's a strong idea. This was also in implicit in the alchemical ideas and I think it's also implicit in the scientific revolution that human beings can interact with reality in such a way so that the tragic and evil elements of it can be mitigated. And so that we can move somewhat closer to a state that might be characterized. Well, that's obviously imagistic, but it might be characterized by something like that where we have the benefits of actual existence without all of the catastrophe. That seems to go along with it.
