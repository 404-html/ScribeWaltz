Speaker 1:          00:00          How does he become corrupt and for a person to avoid the dangers of the postmodern, neo Marxist ideologies and not enroll? Would you agree the same thing applies to the institute of marriage with laws as they are? No, I wouldn't say that. I guess partly because I don't understand what the alternative is. First, I would say that to the degree that men are just your unjustly upset about the way the marriage laws are set up and I think they have reason to be concerned, especially with regards to the custody of children and the probability of paying virtually endless alimony with unbelievably severe penalties for failure. Um, I think that it's incumbent on men to organize themselves politically and rectify that.
