Speaker 1:          00:00          I've told people to learn to use a schedule. And people often hate schedules because they act as their own tyrants, right? They say we have to do this unpleasant thing and then here's another unpleasant thing you have to do. And then you have to do this unpleasant thing and you do that for about three days and you think tail with this. I'm not doing that. You know, and you fall off the wagon. That isn't what you're supposed to do with the schedule. You're supposed to use it to design the days that you would like to have if you were taking care of yourself. And so some of that is, you know, you wake up in the morning and you think, here's five things I have to do that if I don't do my life will be worse. It's like paying bills for example, or, or, or taking out the garbage.

Speaker 1:          00:40          It's like you have to do those because otherwise things degenerate. So you've got to put some of those in the schedule. Cause otherwise, tomorrow is worse than today. And that's a bad trajectory. But you also want to build in things. You know, you've got to act in some sense, like you're dealing with a relatively recalcitrant nine year old. It's like so well here's some things you have to do, but here's some things that if you do, you could reward yourself with. And if you get the balance there between obligation and reward, right, then you'll find that you're motivated to do the things. And that's what you want to do. You want to do that. So it's sustainable across days and weeks and months. And so you've got to, you got to treat yourself like a good boss would treat a valued employee and not like a tyrant would treat a slave because the slave will rebel.

Speaker 1:          01:27          And you know, people say, well, I don't follow through on my plans. It's like, well a, they're probably not very well formulated and maybe you're doing them because of an external moral obligation or something, not really your plans, right? And B, you're acting like a tyrant and a slave. And that's a bad relationship to have with yourself. So you, you want to treat yourself with some, well, the same way. That's the golden rule, right? It treat yourself as you would treat other people as you would have them. Sorry. Treat other people as you would like to be treated. It works both ways. You also treat yourself like you treat other people properly, so that's a necessary thing. And often people don't do that, but the scheduling is really important.
