Speaker 1:          00:00          We're trying to study political correctness and so what the first thing we're trying to figure out was is there even such a thing? Because if you, if you look at the political dialogue, what you find is that people on the side of the political spectrum who have been defined as politically correct tend to say that it doesn't exist and that that category is just a pejorative term that was invented by people who hold alternative political opinions. And so the first question is, well, what do you mean some does it exist? What do you mean by exist? What? How do you tell if a psychological concept is real? Like his anger is anger or something that exists objectively. Is it done an objective phenomena? Well, it's not that easy to determine. You say, well, we, we act like it is and we understand what anger means, but no one goes along round in the world and says anger without saying anything else or you'd run away from them.

Speaker 1:          00:53          You know, what they do is they, they, they placed the word anger into a sentence and place the sentence within a conversation and they enable you to infer exactly what they mean by the word anger, by listening to the surrounding context. Right? And, and if you're going to turn that into something like an objective term, what you do is you pull out the term anger and then you make the hypothesis that it represents something real in the objective world, but it's not that easy to determine if something does exist, especially if it's a psychological phenomena in the real world. What do you mean by exist? That's the problem of construct validation. Okay, so that's another term you really need to know if you're interested in experimental psychology, especially on the personality and a construct is a representation of something psychological that hypothetically exists. Objectively, how do you establish its existence objectively?

Speaker 1:          01:45          Well? Does fear exist? No. Does you have the problem with all the emotional terms? Does joy exist to surprise exist? Does embarrassment exist? Does guilt exist? Shame? How are they related to one another? Guilt and shame, for example, seem quite similar to one another, right, and pain and fear and anger all seem to share the, the, the, the attribute of unpleasant to negative emotions and so how similar, how something, if something exists, it should be the same as some things and different from other things and that's part of construct validation as well to specify how the construct is the same as some things and different from others. Anger should be reliably distinguishable from joy, for example, because otherwise they're not different and anger and fear should be somewhat the same if they're both negative emotions. So it's extraordinarily complex to, to, to validate a construct.

Speaker 1:          02:37          And so here, here's what we did with political correctness. It's, and it's. The reason I'm using the political examples is because that's an obvious place where self serving bias can enter the scientific arena. Right? So if I wanted to make a point about political correctness or if I wanted to make a point about right wing fascism, I could build my biases into the measurement instruments accidentally and then they would produce as output what I put into them as input. And I want to protect myself against that if I actually want to do this scientific investigation properly. So what we did when we started to construct our measures of political correctness was employ a number of people to go through as many news sources as they could get their hands on to identify any attitude or behavior, some roughly that that had been described by anyone at all as potentially politically correct.

Speaker 1:          03:32          So it was kind of agnostic and we're trying to do it as randomly as possible, you know, to get as many new sources as we possibly could so that we were sampling across the environment without bias. Okay. So then we came up with, I don't remember how many, couple hundred, maybe more a couple hundred items that were roughly indicative of what you might describe as political correctness, but that's not good enough, right? Because just because you have this random assemblage of items doesn't indicate at all that they're all measuring something that was similar, but that's just implicit. They're all cold political correctness, but you don't know if those attitudes covariate. And what that means is if you held one attitude of that list, were you more likely to hold another or multiple others? Right? So is the conditional probability of holding multiple items? Is there a high probability of holding true multiple items simultaneously while you figure that out with factor analysis?

Speaker 1:          04:29          So what we did is we turned that into a questionnaire using different question types and we administered it to several hundred people and we did a factor analysis and we found actually that there was such a thing as political correctness because the questions clumped together, people would reliably answered them in a pattern manner, but that there were actually two dimensions that were quite separate. So there isn't one political correctness. There seems to be two. And then we looked at the personality predictors in the ICU predictors and a variety of other predictors that would enable us to come to some understanding of the temperamental proclivity towards those political attitudes, if any. We knew already that political conservatives tended to be low in trade, openness. That's the creativity dimension and high in trait conscientiousness. Whereas political liberals tended to be high in trait, openness and low in conscientiousness, and so one of the things that's extraordinarily interesting to know from the big five perspective is that your political proclivities are very powerfully influenced by your temperament. And so one of the things you can think about with regards to ongoing political discussions in the real world is that those discussions are actually attempts by people of different temperaments. One, to impose their temperamental viewpoints on the world and to, to engage in a dialogue with people who are actually quite different than they are.
