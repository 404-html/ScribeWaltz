Speaker 1:          00:00          Any tips on avoiding booze? Yeah, that's a real tough one. Well, I would say a couple of things. There is a drug. If you're a binge drinker, there is a drug called naltrexone that you could consider and you take naltrexone every day. It doesn't really have any psychological effect on you, but if you're a nail trucks don't respond. Or what will happen is that it will dampen your positive response to alcohol. So some people who are alcoholic, many of them have a very pronounced opiate is uh, an opiate effect from alcohol. It looks like it's mediated by Beta endorphin and now trucks into is an opiate blocker. And so, um, what naltrexone seems to do is dampen the positive response and the positive response which would be opiate. And then dopaminergic is the same response that makes you want to keep drinking when you start drinking.

Speaker 1:          00:54          So if you're one of those people that has a drink and then has to have another one, then has to have another one and you know, soon all your money's gone. Then the probability that you have an opiate response is pretty high. And now trucks can help with that. Um, generally when people take Naltrexone, nick, keep drinking, they try to control but to keep drinking it and they learn over time that the alcohol doesn't have the same punch, still pleasant but doesn't have the same overwhelming punch than it did at one point. So that would be one suggestion. And it's worth drawing the other reasons like makeup plan, I would say do the future authoring program, you know, because it isn't that you're trying to avoid booze. Exactly. It's that you're trying to restructure your whole life, you know, because if you're a drinker than all your friends are drinkers and, and you're used to drinking in every social situation and the places that you go to socialize or places that you drank, tim, like it's really built in as a whole set of habits.

Speaker 1:          01:50          And so what you have to do is kind of redesign your life. And you have to think of things. You can't just stop drinking. You have to figure out what you're going to start doing instead of drinking. There's a hole that you have to fill in and you know the future authoring program will also helped you figure out what your life could look like in the absence of alcohol and what kind of Hell you could end up being if you keep drinking and it causes all the problems that it can cause and I think you really need to like, you need to think through the hell that can occur and you have to think through how your life could be valuable without alcohol so that you can be motivated enough to to try to, to regulate it. And I would also say if you fail and slip, don't berate yourself and beat yourself up.

Speaker 1:          02:39          Just start quitting again because you know if you can cut your alcohol intake down 75 percent, that's a hell of lot better than zero. And often people go all or nothing just like they do with their quitting cigarettes and she quit for a month and then have a cigarette and say, oh my God, now I'm now I've broken the pact. And then they'll smoke a whole pack. They'd be smoking again. You don't have to do that. You can just decide that you slept and that you're going gonna get back on the wagon again and now it can take a long time, but I do believe that you need a better vision of life, right? You have to find something to do with it's better than alcohol and that might take some, some real consideration, especially if alcohol is a very potent drug for you. Then I would also say don't hesitate to try the NALTREXONE. This, it's got a pretty decent clinical history and it's basically harmless. So.
