Speaker 1:          00:00          Conscientious people like they, they value hard work, rules, order reliability, integrity and structure, and so their dutiful. We analyze what predicted military performance. For example, in theU , s army overwhelmingly conscientiousness. That's not surprising, right? Because it's a very structured rule, ordered top down follow procedure sort of endeavor. Now the armed forces had problems with that to some degree because they were also simultaneously looking for people who could think independently on their feet because if you're in a battlefield, for example, especially if you're isolated from your command structure, there's going to be times when you have to make extraordinarily difficult decisions on your own, but if you're selected primarily for conscientiousness, that's not going to be your forte because if you're a conscientious person, what happens is that you enter into a contract with someone, even yourself, and then you carry it out.
