Speaker 1:          00:00          That's Michelangelo's famous Sistine Chapel Representation. And there's some cool things about this. I mean, you got to wonder this, this, this is a side, and I don't know if it's a credible aside, but it's an interesting aside. So that's, that's a form of credible. What the Hell is God doing in this thing? No, I mean, what is this exactly? And so there's, there's been some interesting answers to that and this is one of them. So there was a group of scientists about 20 years ago that, that were remarked on the precise, uh, the precise analogy between this structure and the brain bisected down the middle. And of course, Michael Angelo was one of the first people who did detailed dissections. And so they felt that, that, that Michelangelo had put God inside the brain for some reason. And, uh, that seems to me to be associated with the notion that there's, you know, there's a, there's an analogy or a metaphorical identity between the notion of whatever God is and the structures that give rise to consciousness. And, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:06          I think we really underestimate the degree to which consciousness is, is both same, miraculous. And not understood, I mean, you know, you, you, you have what appears to be an entirely material substrate. Yep. Here you are aware and self aware and able to generate the world merely in some sense by looking at it. It really is remarkable in that consciousness is dependent on, on something that wells up from deep within that material substrate that we don't understand at all. It's really a, it's crazily remarkable thing. You know, when you hear, you hear a lot about scientific reductionism, but I'll tell you something that's kind of interesting and it's a tangent to, you know, the guy that discovered Dna, I think it was Watson and Watson and crick, but I don't remember who wrote this book, but one of them I don't remember which one, he believed that DNA was so complicated that it had to come from space. He didn't believe it could have possibly evolved on earth. And so like a lot of these people who are used

Speaker 1:          02:05          as exemplars of scientific reductionism aren't like that at all. When you actually read what they had to say, right? They, they were very aware of the limits of their own knowledge and I mean DNA is something really quite spectacularly remarkable. It's an eternal substance. It's been around for a very long time. And the idea that we understand it is a very stupid idea and I would say that I would say that the same thing applies to the brain. Like we're, we're, we're scratching away at the surface of something we don't understand at all. And so it's quite interesting. I think that, and maybe Michelangelo had enough goal to do that. It's certainly possible. I mean he had enough goal to do dissections when the, when the cost of that was death, you know, he had this rob corpses essentially to go and do it. So he was, he wasn't, I would say, not particularly politically correct. So. So that's kind of interesting and there is another representation of the same thing and that's a funny one. I had to throw that in. I don't know how many of you know this, but there's, there's, there's this joke in the atheistic atheist community. I think it might've been started by Richard Dawkins, but that might be wrong, that it was just as reasonable to believe in the flying spaghetti monster as it was to believe in God. And that's the flying spaghetti monster by the way. And, and, uh, and so that's, that's called touched by his noodly appendage and anyways, it's fun. It's not very sophisticated, but it is funny.

Speaker 2:          03:47          Okay.
