Speaker 1:          00:00          What is your advice for finding a sane sound therapist and do you think a fruitful psychotherapeutic relationship requires a therapist to have specific temperamental compatibility or even literacy and interests that align with the patient? Well, I would say with regards to finding a sane and sound therapists there some practical things you can do. Um, I guess this is more relevant if you live in North America and I'm not sure exactly what the training requirements are in other places in the world, but your best bet I would say is to find someone who is appropriately trained and I would regard someone who's appropriately trained as a psychotherapist to be someone who's. I think you're safer if you go with someone who's trained at one of the big research schools and you have a therapist who's well versed in psychotherapeutic practice but who's also sufficiently educated scientifically to be able to understand the scientific literature and you can be pretty certain of that.

Speaker 1:          00:57          If you find a therapist who's got their phd rather than us id. Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with ids. If they had received their phd from an American Psychological Association, Approved School of Clinical Psychology, and those schools operate under what's called the bolder model, and the boulder model is promotes, um, science, science practitioner as, as the optimal ideal combination for a psychotherapist. So someone who's trained, psychotherapeutic, but also has research experience and can understand the relevant scientific literature as it pertains to, to mental health. So that would be the first thing. The second thing I would say is, um, well go to see a psychotherapist once and maybe go to see a couple of them and find someone that listens to you because the psychotherapist shouldn't be someone who solves your problems for you or offers even really offers you advice. Although sometimes that can be helpful.

Speaker 1:          01:59          Really what the psychotherapists should do is be someone who can help you understand what problem it is that you're facing so that that can be delineated properly to help you articulate what it is that you want. So what your vision of mental health might be in, and what you'd like to attain in psychotherapy. And then who helps you strategize towards that end. And so you want someone who will really listen to you, that you feel comfortable telling the truth too, because that's also incredibly important. If you can't tell you a psychotherapist the truth, then you're not going to get anywhere therapy because you won't be able to actually outline the nature of your fundamental problems. So that's vital. And go see someone and see if you're happy with the way that you're interacting with them. That's the most relevant issue. So that's the first question.

Speaker 1:          02:51          Now the next one was, do I think a fruitful psychotherapeutic relationship requires the therapists to have specific, temperamental compatibility or even literacy and interests that align with the patient. I think it's difficult to work with the therapist who is less intelligent than you are. That's kind of a rough way of conceptualizing it, but a lot of what a therapist does is help you strategize and the person has to be able to think analytically and probably at least to some degree, to the same with the same degree of complexity that you're capable of. It's not necessarily a good idea to be able to think your, your therapist. So was there ever a time when you saw a therapist of some kind.
