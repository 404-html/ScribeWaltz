Speaker 1:          00:00          Tell me if you disagree with this. Okay, because I'm a psychologist, not a sociologist, and so I'm dabbling in things that are outside of my field of expertise and there is some danger in that, but the, the central postmodernists claim seems to me that because there's a near infinite number of ways to interpret a complex set of phenomena which which actually happens to be the case that you can't make a case that any of those modes of interpretation are canonical and so if they're not canonical and if that canonical element isn't based in some kind of reality than it serves some other master, and so the master that it hypothetically serves for the postmodernists is nothing but power because that seems to be everything that they believe it. They don't believe in competence. They don't believe in authority. They don't seem to believe in an objective world because everything is language mediated.

Speaker 1:          00:47          So it's an extraordinarily cynical perspective that that because there's an infinite number of interpretations, none of them are canonical. You can attribute it to everything to power and dominance. Okay, so that that seemed like a reasonable summary of the radical relativism. It's a radical relativism now, but the strange thing is despite. Okay, and so what goes along with that is the demolition of grand narratives and so that would be associated, for example, with the rejection of thinkers like Don and Eric Norman, because of course their foundational thinkers in relationship to the idea that there are embodied grand narratives that's never touched, but then despite the fact that the grand narrative is rejected, there's a neo Marxism that's tightly, tightly allied with postmodernism. That also seems to shade into this strange identity. Politics and I don't. Two things. I don't understand the causal relationship there. Like the skeptical part of me thinks that postmodernism was a, was an intellectual. It's intellectual camouflage for the continuation of the kind of pathological Marxism that produced the Soviet Union and that it has no independent existence as an intellectual field whatsoever. But I still can't understand how the postmodernists can make the no grand narrative claim but then immerse themselves in this grand narrative without anyone pointing out the evidence. Contradictions. Like I don't understand that. So what do you think about?

Speaker 2:          02:13          Well, I can only speak about literary know professors really, and they seem to me almost universally in theU , s to being very naive or they, they, they seem to know nothing about actual history, political science or economics. So it, it is simply an attitude. They have an attitude of Marxism become simply a badge by which they telegraph their, um, their solidarity with the working class that they have nothing to do with, right? I mean,

Speaker 1:          02:39          and generally nothing but contempt.

Speaker 2:          02:41          Yes. And, and, and the thing is that the, the, the campus leftists are almost notorious for their, uh, for their rather snobbish treatment of staff. I mean, they don't, they don't have any rapport with the actual working class members of the, um, of the infrastructure, the janitor, the janitor is, and you know, even the, even the secretaries, it was kind of high and mighty aristocracy and there were just, these are people who um, who have wandered into the English department and our were products of a time when I'm doing the new criticism. They were when history with history and psychology had been excluded. Me and my ambition. Okay. Was, I mean I love the new criticism. Okay. As a, as a style of textual analysis. Right? And, and the and the new criticism had multiple interpretations. Okay. That were possible and we're encouraged. In fact, one of the great projects was made in Max series.

Speaker 2:          03:32          Twentieth Century views were what you had at least some books. I adored them in college and it was about Jane Austin or about Emily Bronte or about wordsworth and they were collections of alternate views of the same thing. The idea that there were no alternative views and there was no relativistic situational kinds of interpretive approach is nonsense. But the point was we needed to restore history to literary literary study. Okay. And we needed to add psychology to it because it was, it was great animus against Freud. When I arrived in, in graduate school, in fact, I actually went into the director of graduate studies and protesting the way Freud and Freudian were used as, as negative terms pay in a sneering way by that very wasp professors. Right. So we need to do it. Actually, it seemed like we were moving there, get in there early. Nineteen seventies was a great period of psycho biography about great.

Speaker 2:          04:24          About political figures. Okay. And so I thought it's happening in all of a sudden they all got short circuited by this arrival of, of poststructuralism and postmodernism in the, in the, in the 19 seventies. Right. Um, so I, I, I, I feel I'm an old historicist okay. Now not a new historical. So I mean, I think new stores. So it was an absolute scam, right? It. And it's like, it's just a way. It's like tweezers you'd like just, you pick a little bit of this, a little bit of that, a little bit of that you make a little tiny salad and someone that is atomized thing, right? It's supposed to mean something. It's all can be very superficial, very cynical, very distance. I like, I, I am, uh, I am the product. Okay. Of Old historicism German philology. I decide my, my first choice of profession when I was a child.

Speaker 2:          05:08          What was Egyptology archeology, [inaudible] I'm. Everything I ever think about or say is, is related to an enormous time scheme. Okay. From from antiquity and indeed from the Stone Age, and that is the problem with these people. They're their male educated. The postmodernist and academic Marxists are male educated, embarrassingly so. Okay. They know nothing before the present, so call okay is absolutely a joke before the enlightenment. Okay. You mean per perhaps he might be useful to people to talk about what happened at after Neil classicism, which by the way, he failed to notice a lot of what he was talking about. Okay. Turns out to CB simply the hangover of neoclassicism. Okay. This is how ignorant that man was. I mean, his head was. He was not talented as a researcher. He knew absolutely nothing. Okay. What stuff? You know, nothing about antiquity. How can you make any kind of large structure, large mechanism to analyze western culture without knowing about classical antiquity? Okay. He did not see anything from some person who had no business making large theoretical statements about anything.

Speaker 1:          06:12          Well, maybe, maybe part of it is that if you, if you generate an intelligible doctrine of radical relativism, then there is no reason to assume that there are distinctions between categories of knowledge or between different levels of quality of knowledge. Right. So I've seen the same thing in the psychology departments, although we have the, uh, what would you call it? The luxury of being bounded at least to some degree by the empirical method and by biology, right? It's one of the things that keeps most of the branches of psychology relatively sane, you know, because the real world is actually built into it to some degree. But if you accept the postmodernist claim of radical relativism, then you completely demolished the idea that there are quality levels that are associated with education because everything becomes the same. And that seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable justification for maintaining ignorance.

Speaker 1:          07:03          You know, like Food Co. I actually found him the most readable of the lecan. There are de fuko trIad. You can read fuko. I read madison civilization and a couple of his other books and I thought they were painfully obvious. You know the idea that mental disorder is in part a social construct is self evident to anybody who has even a smattering of psychiatric training. I mean the real narrow medical types tend to to think of a mental disorder, let's say as something that might be purely biological. They have a peer disease model, but nobody's who's a sophisticated thinker ever thinks that it's a bit partly because medicine is a brand of engineering, not a brand of science because it's associated with health and the diagnostic categories are hybrids between physiological observation and sociocultural condition. Everyone knows that and so when I read madness and civilization, I thought, well that's not radical. That's just bloody self evident.

Speaker 2:          07:58          I actually think that he began know the entire turn toward a total theological grounding of, of modern psychology, social psychology, and was was well, well launcher the 19 twenties for example, know the levels of ignorance of these. These people moving with all original have not read durkheim. They've not read mocks of or are they not read erving goffman. Okay, so in other words, to me for everything is the costing of the estimate because I had read the sources from which he was borrowing without attribution, but I mean, again, I know these people, I mean I, I've met him in some cases, knew them in graduate school, people who went onto become these, these, these admirers of fico, lack on dairy dot and I know what their training was there. Training was pureLy within the english department. That's all they ever knew. They never made it any research outside of that. Right. And so the idea for coal is simply this is a mechanism, it's like a little tiny kit by which they can approach everything in culture and then with the contortions of language that deliberate labyrinthine, elitist language at the same time as pretending to be a leftist. Okay. This is one of the biggest frauds. every practice.
