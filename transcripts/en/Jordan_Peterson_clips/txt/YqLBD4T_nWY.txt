Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay, yes. What is your opinion on the whole cultural appropriate? Okay, two questions. What's my opinion on the alt right and what's my opinion on cultural appropriation? The idea of cultural appropriation is absolute nonsense.

Speaker 2:          00:17          That's that.

Speaker 1:          00:23          No, there's no difference between cultural appropriation and learning from one another. The same thing. Now that doesn't mean I can't. That doesn't mean that there's no theft between people. There is no. It doesn't mean that just because you encounter someone else's ideas, you have an immediate right to those ideas as if they were your own, but the idea that manifesting in your own behavior, some element of another culture, the idea that that's somehow immoral is insane. It's actually one of the bases of peace. You know, one of the things that the various groups of human beings that exist have to offer each other is the tremendous value of their culture. You know, it's been really interesting to me, for example, to watch the response of ball of everyone, but for this argument to you, for young Caucasian males to hip hop, you know, there's an aggressiveness about hip hop that's really attractive to young Caucasian males and there's something observed about, about the, the spectacle of the young Caucasian males taking on the persona of inner city black gang members, you know, but, but I'm sympathetic to it because there is an aggressiveness to that, to that art form that's a necessary corrective to the insistence that the highest moral virtue for a modern man is harmlessness, which is observed.

Speaker 1:          01:47          Women don't even like harmless man. They hate them. They liked them apart.
