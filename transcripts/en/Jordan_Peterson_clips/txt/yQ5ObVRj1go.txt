Speaker 1:          00:00          There are experiments where people's task is to pick up an object and they can see the object in front of so you're given the task. That's the basic story. The story is what you're required to do is to transform yourself from the person you are now into the person who has a possession that watch. It's just the standard laboratory experiment, but the watch is actually not there. It's an image that's generated by mirrors and when you move towards the watch, you find that it's not where it appears to be. Well, the fact of the object not being where it appears to be is an anomaly with regards to your current plan and you'll react to that emotion. The first thing that'll happen is obviously you're going to be surprised, right? You think this is pretty easy on you to pick that up and you find out that thing that you see as low actually there.

Speaker 1:          00:55          That's an anomaly. You contrast at your desired future, which was your aim when you moved your arm with the actual outcome of your actions, so part of your brain called the hippocampus. That seems to be responsible for comparing what's actually going on in so far as you can interpret that with what you want to have and if, if a mismatch occurs that sets up the whole sequence related to events and those events manifest themselves in emotion and in thought and in behave most evidently and emotion. If you're going to do something, they've done it before and it doesn't work out the way you expected it to be. Events that constitute the anomaly, the unexpected occurrence there are surprising, and the question then is what does surprising mean? Well, it basically means that something threatening as occurred in something.

Speaker 1:          01:52          Something like, so what does the unknown me? Well, the thing about them unknown is that you don't know what it means. It's pretty. It's a pretty straightforward statement, but you see that immediately. That immediately introduced as a string sort of paradox because you lack infinite information for obviously people don't know what they're doing all the time, which means that you come into contact with things that you don't understand a lot and that means in a sense, but you have to know what to do when you don't know what to do because you don't know what to do a lot and that just doesn't just bring into a halt. What is the case? Then? Your nervous system is hardwired to move to a sort of default position when the plans to be explicit plans that you have, that you're carrying out sale, so as long as you could say in a sense, as long as you know what you're doing, which means that you have a representation of where you are and where you'd like to be.

Speaker 1:          02:45          You're carrying out your plans to make the move and things are going according to plan. As long as you're doing that, then the higher centers in your of your brain, the cortex basically it's under control. You know what you're doing. You feel comfortable and secure. As soon as something unexpected happens, the control shifts, and this is something that basically beyond your capacity to control whether you can interfere with the process, control shifts from the cortical centers to the more fundamental areas of the brain, the limbic system. When something unexpected happens, two things occur. You start to feel a little bit of anxiety and it's not unexpected occurrences. It's really unexpected. You'll be very, very frightened because just minor something minor league unexpected. You'll just stop. Your sensory processing will heightened, he'll gather more information and you'll explore and as you explore, you generate information and the information is supposed to bring me back on course basically, so you'll say what you'll do if you're trying to reach for the wash and you find out that it isn't great this while you'll start making different sorts of approach sequences until you end up producing the outcome that you attended.

Speaker 1:          03:57          When something unexpected occurs, two sets of circuitry or activated one looks like it's dominated by the right hemisphere. Now it looks like it's dominated by the left hemisphere. Unexpected things make you anxious, curious, and you've been localized. Those emotions in the body, so to speak, anxiety is the emotion that accompany is the cessation of your body's clam directed activities. Okay? That's you could say that anxiety is what you feel when you slip into the motor. Pause, pause for further analysis. What do you expect it to happen so you have to stop. Curiosity is what you feel when it's necessary for you to explore further, to gather new information, to update your plans, and exploration is basically governed by the interplay of the circuitry brain circuitry that mediates anxiety and curiosity. Curiosity, by the way, and that's associated with positive emotions and anxiety as you all know was associated.

Speaker 1:          04:53          That's a negative emotion. People would rather not experience it. Curiosity or surprise is basically the juxtaposition of those two sets of emotions which work antagonistically. The unknown produces conflict all by itself. You have a hard wired response to the emergence of the unexpected. You have to because they have to know what to do when something unexpected occurs. It's instinct, your instinctive response to the unknown. It's anxiety plus curiosity, which is to say cessation of ongoing motor activity plus a drive to move forward and explore and your exploratory activities. Actually the sum total of the activation of the two sets of circuitry that mediate that response. When you explore, if you explore something unexpected happens, you don't have to explore, you can note it and get the hell out of there safe, but you don't gather any new information. It's a good short term strategy. It's not a good long term strategy, but anyways, the point is the surprise activities, curiosity, and it tells you 40 generate new information, you update your plan, and soon you can get to where you want it to go. The point is the mismatch between what you expect to happen and what actually happens. That explains it.
