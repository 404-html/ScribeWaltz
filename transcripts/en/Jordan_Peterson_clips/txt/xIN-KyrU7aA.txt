Speaker 1:          00:00          The radical left leaning anti theist environmentalists tend to make the case that the predations of the Western capitalist system are a consequence of the injunction that was delivered in Genesis by God to man to go out and dominate the earth. David Suzuki has talked a lot about this by the way. They believe that that statement has given rise to our inappropriate assumption that we have the right to exert control over the world and that that's what's turned us into these terrible predatory monsters sometimes described as counselors on the face of the earth or viruses that have inhabited the entire ecosystem who are doing nothing but one wandering everywhere and wreaking havoc as rapidly as we possibly can, which is another perspective on the essential element of humankind that I find absolutely deplorable. I mean, if you look at the historical record, for example, even casually, you'll find out that as early as, as late as the late 18 hundreds, 18, 95, thereabouts, Thomas Huxley, who was Elvis Huxley's grandfather and a great defender of Darwin, prepared a report for the British government on ocean sustainability and his conclusion was fish away.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Guys. Man, there are so many fish out there. The oceans are so inexhaustible that no matter how hard humanity tried for, for any number of years, the probability that we could do more than put a dent in what was out there was zero. Now Huxley turned out to be wrong. He didn't realize that our population was going to spike so dramatically, partly because we got a little bit rich and our children's stopped dying at the rate of 60 percent before they were one years old and you know, we actually managed to populate the earth with a few people, but it wasn't really until 1960 or so that we woke up to the fact that there were so many of us that we actually had to start paying attention to what we were doing to the planet. And that's like what 50 years ago? Well, we've just started to develop the technology, have the wherewithal to understand that the whole world might be well considered a garden and we need to live inside the proper balance between culture and order or culture and, and, and chaos.

Speaker 1:          02:18          Before that we were spending all of our time just trying not to die and usually very unsuccessfully, so I don't agree with that interpretation of the opening section of Genesis. I don't believe that it's given human being has the right to act as super predators on the planet. I think that instead the proper environment for human beings is presented quite properly as a garden and that the role of people and that's explicitly stated in, in the second story of Adam and Eve was to tend the garden and that means to make the proper decisions and to make sure that everything thrives and flourishes and and so that it's good for the things that are living there that aren't just people, but also good for the people too. So fine. I think we can. We could least note that that's a slightly different take on the story than the that ultimately cynical interpretation that's so commonly put forward today.
