Speaker 1:          00:00          We talked a little bit about this, uh, over a drink we had a couple of weeks ago, but what about the couples that have no kids, couples that just say, you know, we're, we're more interested in our intellectual pursuits or traveling or something. You think they are really missing sort of like a key component of, of what life is, right?

Speaker 2:          00:19          I do. I really believe that. I mean, I think they don't. I think the kids have a bad rap. That's the problem. That's also why I wrote this chapter in part because, you know, you see this too, a lot of Hollywood depictions of children's, very rare that you see children portrayed knowably in, in a, in a, in a Hollywood film. You kind of saw with Harry Potter. I liked that and that's partly why that was so popular. I mean those kids had some, you know, there were bad kids and they were good kids and they're heroic kids. Like they were treated pretty in some sense, realistically given that it was such a magical, you know, enterprise and, and, but they had some courage and they had some heart and they had some rebelliousness and so, so I liked that. But the thing that you have to understand about kids is they're unbelievably good company, you know, and so they pay you back for your care of them and by being ridiculously a music there, their little clouds and they're doing crazy little stunts all the time and they have a sense of humor that kicks in.

Speaker 2:          01:17          Like I have a grandchild now that's two and a half months old and that child can already smile and has the beginnings of a sense of humor. And that's, to me, that's a miracle. It is. It. And so they're very funny. They're really playful. They really, really like you. And you can have the kind of relationship with them that you set out to have. And so that's very, very interesting now. And you can also, like once I had little kids, I spent a lot more time with them than I did with my friends. Say. And the reason for that was that I actually found it more enjoyable to do things with little kids than with the adults. And the reason for that is like, by the time you're 30, say you've seen so much of the world that you actually don't see the world anymore. And this is technically true.

Speaker 2:          02:08          Like I'm old, I'm 55 when I walked down the street, there's houses, I don't look at them, I have house icons in my memory and I just see the house icons and, and so the older you get in some sense, the more what you see of the world is your memory and that's kind of, it's efficient, but it's sort of dad, you know, and, and artists help break through that. They show you something as if it's new again, you know. And, and so that's why van Gogh's irises will sell for $160,000,000. It's like you haven't looked at flowers since you were three. Okay. So the thing that's cool about having little kid is everywhere you go. Because we're so good at putting ourselves in other people's bodies. The kid revitalizes the world. And the kid's like, oh, I mean that's what a two year old looks like all the time. They're just completely awestruck by everything. And you can see that again. And that's really interesting

Speaker 1:          03:05          man. I know you know about my love of star wars, but I watched empire strikes back with my five year old at the time, nephew. And at the moment when darth vader told he was his father, I was staring at him and he loves star wars and I was looking at him and the way his eyes opened, I was like, wow. Like what? That, that thing, like that's what it's all about, that's what it's all like as an adult. How could I ever as a 41 year old have that experience again? And that's what you're talking about, about and, and a movie is art.

Speaker 2:          03:34          Oh yeah, absolutely. Well, I took my daughter to see the mask with Jim Carrey when she gets like a little bit young for that. Um, and I held her on my lap during, I think she was, she was probably only about five, maybe something like that. But I took her out one night. We went, saw the mask and it's pretty intense and it was like holding a, what would you call a bundle of electrically charged barbed wire for an hour and a half. She was just like that and like I said, it was perhaps a bit much for her, but he had the knife. It was exactly. But I mean you, you, you forget how much impact the world has and you know, if you bring little kids around, old people, you can really see this [inaudible] old people will sit around. Like when we first had my daughter, when she was the first grandchild on my, my side, we'd take her up to this lake that I go to see my parents that way, the hell up in northern Alberta.

Speaker 2:          04:29          And she was like a little fire. You know how people sit around a fire and look at it, they can't look away. It's because we're all the descendants of the first crazy chimpanzee who couldn't keep his God dammit fire, you know? And that's what little kids are like and, and the older people just watch them nonstop and it's partly because they're participating in that renewal of the world, you know, which is like, it's like a reintroduction to the unsalted paradise of being something like that. But it only works if the, if you like your kids. And so there's a disciplinary element that's really important too. And one of the things that modern parents don't understand, and I think this is because of the exceptionally permissive ethos of the 19 sixties, were when we developed this idea that everything that society does to children is bad and so don't damage your children by putting restrictions on them. It's like, that's just not so wrong that it's almost impossible. It's why people shy away from kids because they don't understand that you don't have to put up with any unpleasant. You don't have to put up with any unnecessary unpleasant nonsense from children. It's not necessary.

Speaker 1:          05:39          It's interesting. So the. You could almost argue that the sixties led to exactly what you're talking about. These kids who then were taught to be afraid of everything. They become a mess there, the parents have now, and that's probably in part why they're having less children or at least talking about family and children in a

Speaker 2:          05:57          different way when there's. There's also less trust in the structure of the family because the divorce rate has proliferated and it's hard. Like there was a woman in our department in the psychology department who's allison, what's Helen's last name? She's going to hate me if she ever watches this. I can't think of it. We'll post the full post. You're going to get it the second week and I hope that's right. It's probably not. Anyways, she showed that if you. If you interfere with the maternal relationship between rats and they're pops because children are called pops, that you can see the detrimental effects of that disruption three generations later. Right? Yeah. So you know, you disrupt those early bonds, you disrupt the familial structure that echoes. It takes. It's like an oral tradition in some sense, you know, because being a good mother is not just something that you're taught.

Speaker 2:          06:49          It's something that you kind of have in your bones. If you were mothered properly. Like my father was an excellent father, especially when I was a little kid. He really spent a lot of time with me and I used to love it when he came home and, and like I have a natural affinity for little kids and I do believe it's, it's in large part. That's why it's because I just know how to react with them and it's. I do believe it's because of the way that I was treated when I was little kit. You disrupt that. It's like lots of people don't trust themselves as parents say because they were hurt or they didn't have good role models or they don't trust the familial structure. And so you know that all that all makes people afraid.
