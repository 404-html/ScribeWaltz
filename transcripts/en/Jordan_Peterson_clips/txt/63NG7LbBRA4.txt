Speaker 1:          00:00          Going to tell you a story from the Soviet Union, it's Solzhenitsyn. He introduces it with the whole from the Russian poet laureate cost. So sympathizer with cohesion, construction, grit and repression. Wring the neck of this gang. Right? That's nice. Pole socialists and wonderful. Who was the gay? That's the question. As I said, he has to make 66 million people died between 1970 and 1950. Nine. Socialists are also estimated that substantially larger number of in Communist China. No one really knows the staff's on map. Now. This is a debatable statistic as social next one. Points out spoke business from the Gulag archipelago as soon as the official statistics are released to revise their estimates. This includes, for example, separate millions billion hasn't pushed into the Tundra forced relocation at nearly $26 million trainings. We've famines in 1930. Second preview story.

Speaker 1:          01:11          So this is the situation. So I'll tell you a little bit about his life story. It was a three volume. The second volume of which you will read a story about blue light system of forced labor camps set up in the Soviet Union. Soon after Lennon died. In fact, yes, some of them were set up before he died and upon which the Soviet economy brand for much of what constituted it's nets and started his travels through the gulag originally as a Russian front line soldier storing sense thrown into a German prisoner of war camp and when he was repatriated to the Soviet Union styling through later in a concentration camp and the reason why is as he did with all of the return Russian prisoners of war who were treated by the week terribly in the German prisoners of war camps because Stalin refused to sign the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners.

Speaker 1:          02:17          So not only were they in prisoners of war camps, which was miserable enough that they were starved to the degree that the other ally prisoners used to give them food. They didn't have much food themselves. So he was a front line soldier. Then he got thrown into German prisoner of war camp and then when he finally returned to Russia, tell him through when it comes to training camp. And the reason for that was that the Russians who were in German prisoners of war camp had been contaminated by their exposure to western ideas and that was his rationale. So anyways, that he's spent a decade and a half of their boats in concentration camps, but when he got out and developed stomach cancer. So that's a brief summary of some of the highlights of his life. Okay. In this scene, he's being transported from one camp to another rail car and it's been roughly outfitted for transporting human beings.

Speaker 1:          03:12          He's sitting with a friend that he calls panic. I'm just going to read you this story. My friend Pat and I are lying on the Middle Shelf of a stall up into cattle cars. Basically they're refitted for fema transport and have set ourselves up constantly talk to our assault herring in her pocket. So we don't need water. I can go to sleep, but at some station or other, they shoved into our compartment. A Marxist scholar. We can tell this from his guilty and spectacles. He doesn't hide the fact. So He's been arrested. He's a devout communist, been arrested by the Columbias. He doesn't hide the fact. He's a former professor of the communist academy. We have down in the square, cut out from his very first words. We see that comedians impenetrable. We have been serving time for a very long time and have a long time lift serve and we value of Mary joke. We'd been fun. There's ample space left in the compartment, so we exchanged places with someone in crown. Ian. Hello? Hello. You know, too crowded. No, it's all right. Have you been in the jug a long time? Long enough? Are you past the halfway mark? Just look over there. How poverty stricken or villages are? Straw thatch, crooked hugs. That's an inheritance Harrington's from the czarist regime. What we've already had 30 Soviet years. That's an insignificant period. Historically. It's terrible that the collective farmers are starving at older.

Speaker 1:          04:56          Just ask any collective farmer in our compartment, put everyone in jail is the bitter and prejudice, but I've seen collective farms myself. That means they were on characteristic. The goatee had never been in any way simpler. Just ask the old folks desire. They were well Fed, well upload, and they used to have many holidays. I'm not even going to ask. It's a subjective trait of human memory to praise everything past the cow that died is the one that gave twice the milk. Sometimes even say, and our people don't like qualities. They like to work. Why is there a shortage of brand in many cities when right before the war, for example, not true before the war, everything. In fact, he worked at. Listen at that time in all the cities on the pool guy, there were accused of thousands of people, a local failure in supply.

Speaker 1:          06:00          More likely your memory's failing you, but there is a shortage now. Old Wives Tales, we hear it from seven to 8 billion bushels of grain. The grain is rotten, not so. We've been very successful in developing new species and so forth. He's in her term of speaks in the language which requires no effort of the mining and arguing with him is like walking through a desert. It's about people like that, but they say he made the rounds of all the blocks, miss and came home unsure when they write in their obituaries perished tragically during the period of the stout on this cult, it should be corrected to read. Parish comically had worked out differently. We would have never learned what a dry, insignificant little man he really was. We would have respectfully made his name in the newspaper. We would have. He would have become a people's commissar or even venture to represent all of Russia abroad.

Speaker 1:          07:00          To argue with him was useless. It was much more interested in playing with it. Not a chess, but at the game really is such a game. It's very simple game play off to him a couple of times or so. Use some of his own pet words and phrases like that phrase growing accustomed to find all around who were in a. he's become weary of star like it doesn't mind to tell his stories because all of them will be twisted and thrown right back into space, but if he takes you for one of his own, he will quite disclose to you. What are you seeing that the station people are passing by? Talking, laughing. Life goes on. The party is providing leadership. People are being moved from job to job. You and I are languishing in prison. There are only a handful of us and we must write and write petitions, begging a review of our cases being a part or he will tell you something interesting in the Communist Academy, they just started to devour one cobra.

Speaker 1:          08:03          We decided he wasn't going to Jannie with one of our own. Somehow they could manage it. There are no errors and his assets and his biography was clean and all of a sudden going through the archives, what I find, they ran across an old brochure written by his comrade in which Bladimir Lennon himself. He held in his hands and in the margin of which he had written in his own handwriting. The notation as an economist is shit, well now you understand our. Anything smiled eventually, but after that it's no trouble at all to make short work of that month we foster he was expelled from the academy in deprived to the scholar, a communist professor. This exchange, he doesn't think. It doesn't have to think because he has an ideological system worked out.

Speaker 1:          08:55          He won't admit any evidence whatsoever exists to suggest some of these presuppositions are wrong for every bit of evidence that exists. There is a counter argument that justifies it or excuse it or makes it disappear in some way. That's the first part. The second part of the story is that being like this, he's also extraordinarily clannish in this sense. Can you tell us a brief story about being in the academy where everyone shares that you Ologie and finding outside so that you can essentially destroy their specific reasons why the two halves of that narrative who stuck together because the first attitude leads an exorbitant to the second attitude to say the adoption of authoritarian ideology, which is basically the presumption of innocence. If your Nav along, you think that what you think is the right thing thing, there isn't anything else that needs to be thought.

Speaker 1:          10:01          It's you that has the answer. Now, you might go to you. You might think that it's your leader or the ideology in and of itself, but what it is you're the one that's in possession of the truth and every fact that might exist to dispute that is eliminated. The problem with the fact is that sometimes they come in and body forms, which is the same. We tend to think of ideas as disembodied, abstracted entities of truth of the matter is that ideas are representations of human patterns of action and sometimes the enemy idea is actually the enemy and there's very little difference from the practical perspective between repressing thoughts that are uncomfortable and repressing. People whose viewpoints or even styles of existence are equal.
