Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah, well a few tyrannized people badly enough, they'll actually hurt themselves to hurt you so you know, they're willing to take a willing to take a hit to reclaim justice, let's say. So yeah, that's really worth knowing. And so one of the things that John Piaget pointed out and because he was, he's a very interesting psychologist and he's never taught properly because you know, most of these great thinkers were very strange people and the strangeness Gets Edited Out of their stories and it's really too bad because they're way more interesting when you know how strange they were and so piaget was obsessed with the disjunction between religion and science and his goal as a thinker was to reconcile the two. And so to some degree he was looking for a biological basis of morality. That might be one way of thinking about it or at least to reconcile the idea of a biological substrate with an emergent morality.

Speaker 1:          00:52          And one of the things he said is, okay, imagine two systems. All right, so both systems are moving towards a goal, any old arbitrary goal and in one system the the people within it are acting under compulsion and in the other system that people within it are acting voluntarily said the people who are acting voluntarily will defeat the people acting under compulsion because in order to use compulsion, you have to spend a fair bit of time and energy on force and so it makes you inefficient. Whereas if everybody is together on the project, then they'll. You don't have to spend any time on compulsion because people are compelling themselves and so that's what he called an equilibrium state. So in equilibrium state was, well, we sit down and we have a negotiation. That's a real negotiation. So it, it has to be honest and we say, okay, well what the hell are we doing?

Speaker 1:          01:47          And everyone hash that out and we decide what we're doing and then we decide how that would be good for all of us, but each of us singularly as well. So if you've got your family put together property, then the whole family moves together, but everybody inside moves ahead as well, and so then everybody's pushing in the same, you know, you know how it is in a negotiation. You actually want your interests to align with the interests of the other person because then you don't have to worry about the integrity of the deal. It's like everybody has reasons to keep it, to keep it thriving, and the idea that capitalism in somehow is somehow is predicated on the tyranny of the people at the, at the pinnacle that happens when it gets corrupt, but it doesn't happen at all when it's working properly because deals that aren't based on mutual self interest and group interests simultaneously have to be enforced usually with lawyers and then you're done, right? You're done. At that point.
