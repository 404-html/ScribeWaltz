Speaker 1:          00:00          In Milton's Paradise Lost Satan as an intellectual figure and you see that motif emerge very frequently by the way in popular culture. So for example, in the lion king, the figure of scar who's a titanic figure is also hyper intellectual and that's very common that the evil scientist Motif for the or the evil advisor to the king, the same motif. It encapsulate something about rationality and what it seems to encapsulate as the idea that rationality like Satan is the highest angel in God's heavenly kingdom. It's a psychological idea. You know that the most powerful sub element of the human psyche is the intellect and and it's the thing that shines out above all within the domain of humanity and maybe across the the domain of life itself. The human intellect. There's something absolutely remarkable about it, but it has a flaw and the floor is that it tends to fall in love with its own productions and to assume that their total solzhenitsyn, when he was writing the Gulag archipelago had a warning about that with regards to totalitarian ideology.

Speaker 1:          01:08          And he said that the price of selling your God given sole to the entrapments of of human dogma was slavery and death essentially. And Satan in May in Milton's paradise lost. Satan decides that he can do without the transcendent, he can do without God. And that's why foment rebellion. It's something like that. And the consequence of that, the immediate consequence from Milton's perspective was that as soon as Satan decided that what he knew was sufficient and that he could do without the transcendent, which you might think about as the domain outside of what you know, something like that. Immediately he was inhale. And when I read paradise lost, I was studying totalitarianism and I thought, you know, the poet, the true poet, like a prophet is someone who has intimations of the future. And maybe that's because the poetic mind, the philosophical or prophetic mind is a pattern detector.

Speaker 1:          02:14          And, and, and there are people who can detect the underlying. It's like the melody of, of a nation. Melody has in song the song of the nation and can see how it's going to develop across the centuries. You see this, you see that nature because nature, for example, in the mid, around 18, 60 or so, and he prophesied what was going to happen in the 20th century. He said that he said specifically that the specter of communism would kill millions of people in the 20th century. It's amazing prophecy. He said that in the notes that became willpower and Dostoevsky was of the same sort of mind. Someone who was in touch enough with the fundamental patterns of, of, of, of human movement that they could extrapolate out into the future and see what was coming. And I mean, some people are very good at detecting patterns, you know, and, and, uh, Milton I think was of that.
