Speaker 1:          00:00          The act of eating, especially if you're hungry, especially if you're starving, produces a rapid spiritual transformation, right? I mean, some of you, this is worth knowing. You probably have a crabby partner or child because everyone does and one thing you might try is that if they get erratic during the day and you know, get all volatile about nothing at all, it's given them something to eat. Really. I'll tell you, a man needs this souls. If I do this with my clinical clients all the time, it's like they say, well, I fly off the handle at the littlest things. It's like, okay, yeah, I'll just try this for a week. When when you're crabby and unreasonable, eat a piece of cheese or eat a peanut butter sandwich, eat something that's high protein, high fat, and then just wait 10 minutes and see if you're sane and you'll find out that you're saying after you eat so often that you just can't believe how crazy you are when you're hungry. Here's. It's really absolutely bloody remarkable. So I'm telling you, try this. It'll, it'll, it'll. If especially if you don't eat breakfast, this will change your life.
