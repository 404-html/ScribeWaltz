Speaker 1:          00:00          One of the natural response to what you said, would it be okay? Well, the, the priorities are, it's a rigged game because only when there are the ones who are able to procreate. So what do we answer to that? Of course, it's a rigged game. Obviously it's a rigged game. Women have complicated lives and the pill has made them more complicate. Well, that's not, I wouldn't say that exactly because you know, a hundred years in 1895 the average person in the western world lived on $1 a day in today's money. Okay. So those people worked so hard at, slaved away to such a degree that you can't even imagine it and all their kids die. Right? So the death rate among kids below five is beyond comprehension. And so like women have terrible time of timber. Well, so with men, they got to be coal miners and soldiers.

Speaker 1:          00:44          Cause now that wasn't exactly entertaining, you know, so life was very, very, very, very, very hard before we got rich and we're rich. Even those of you who are in this class, you think you're poor. It's like, oh no, you're not. You're in the top one 10th of 1% by historical standards and probably there by her and world's standards as well. Of course, you could just compare yourself to the few people to Richard than you and feel sorry for yourself. But that's a pretty pathetic in my estimation. So it's in, it's certainly historically uninformed. So yeah, women have it rough obviously. Now there's, there's other things to consider. You do live eight years longer, so that's not trivial. Testosterone kills men. That's basically why men die earlier, you know, and men are much more likely to be killed and dangerous jobs. They do almost all the dangerous jobs.

Speaker 1:          01:32          They do almost all the outside work. And there's lots of reasons that men get paid more than women that have nothing to do with prejudice. It's because they take awful, horrible jobs like working in the oil rates in northern Alberta when it's bloody 40 below and come out at, you know of that after five years with two or three fingers missing and, and all warped up because you really want to wrestle pipe when it's 40 below and it's filthy with a bunch of ordinary men who are hung over beyond belief. It's like that's not very entertaining. So yeah, I mean each gender, each sex has its own unfairness to deal with. But to think of that as a consequence of the social structure, it's like come on, really. What about nature itself? And this is something, this is something that seems to be completely invisible on the left side of the political spectrum.

Speaker 1:          02:22          So like of course you're a bloody oppressed and your life is full of suffering obviously. But to think about that as a direct consequence of unjust social structures is just moronic. It's like that's part of the reason, a small part. But look where you're sitting people, it's pretty warm in here and you're so privileged. You could come here and Saturday morning and listen to an intellectual lecture. It's like you should be happy about that because by historical standards, you should be out lifting rocks in your skeletal form about five foot three with no teeth. So have cougars, cougars alliance. Yeah, exactly. You know, there's no gratitude. That's the thing. There's no gratitude for what our society is capable of doing.
