Speaker 1:          00:00          It seems indisputable. I would say that the Canadian healthcare system is preferable to the American healthcare system except at the very highest end and there's a couple of reasons for that that would even perhaps appeal to conservatives. One is the amount of administrative overhead that spent by Canadian health institutions as far less in Canada than it is in the US, partly because hospitals don't have to collect money so they don't spend 30 percent of their intake on on the financial end of the equation, which is approximately the case in the u. s and everyone has access to healthcare in Canada and because of that, our rate of individual entrepreneurship is higher in Canada than it is in the US and that's because because people don't have to worry about losing their healthcare. If they switched jobs, they can switch jobs more easily and they can also take risks if they have a family that can take entrepreneurial risks without putting all the health of their entire family at stake.

Speaker 1:          00:59          So these things can't be broken down really simply into right wing versus left wing issues. Right there. Too complicated. But the overall point is that Canada has done a very good job of having that conversation even are socialists are basically fiscally conservative, right? Although they're not socially conservative, but there, there, there are signs of the kind of polarization in Canada that, that that's really plaguing the United States. And of course that would be, that's not good for the US. It's not good for Europe where it's also happening, but it's also not good for our country and I don't want that to happen. So that's partly why I've been objecting to the more ill advised in radical moves that the so called liberals have been managing over the last few years.
