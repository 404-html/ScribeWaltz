Speaker 1:          00:00          You know there, there's, there's good study published recently showing that six month old infants, I think it was six month, are already showing fear of snakes and spiders and that's before they've been exposed to them, so there's not an argument about amongst psychologist for a long time, whether fears were only learned. Thought would be the behavioral perspective, whether you're prepared to learn certain fears, which is sort of a mediator between the behavioral perspective and a perspective that takes into account inherited structures or whether they're actually innate and the evidence keeps accruing that some of these fundamental fears are innate and that's a very strange thing.

Speaker 2:          00:40          More more hardware than firmware, if exactly that.

Speaker 1:          00:43          Exactly. Well and metaphor and I mean the, the, the archetypes, the symbolic representations we have say of Reptilian predators. Dragon in particular are very, very deep. That dragon is a symbol that you find everywhere in the world. There was a good book written about that recently. Actually. I'm the guy who wrote the book, whose name I can't remember, unfortunately thought that a dragon was a cat snake bird and so well on. So because the major predators of of tree dwelling primates are predatory cats, snakes and wrap doors,

Speaker 2:          01:19          right? And Keyword. There's, in my opinion, the way I'm interpreting it is tree dwelling. Like that's how far back $6. Million

Speaker 1:          01:26          nears least. Yeah. So on that. So at least $60, million years. It could, it could be longer than that, but snakes and human beings, snakes and the ancestors of human beings co evolved. And Lynn is. Bell has demonstrated that down and you know she's a, she's a scientist and in with, in the California state system, I think she's at Ucla and she was very interested in white human beings have such a cute vision. And so she did a study looking at the relationship between primate acuity of primate vision and presence of predatory snakes and found a pretty powerful relationship. And so. And we can really detect snake like a camouflage patterns, particularly in the lower half of our visual field. And so yeah, these things are. See the way it looks to me is that we develop this Predator detection system, right? What's in the unknown Predator? What's the Predator? It's a cat snake bird, which is exactly what it is. Right, and you think, well, that's not a category. It's. Yes, it is. It's a low resolution category that apply.

Speaker 2:          02:30          It's the same category as Predator. That's right ad from a cognitive, anthropological perspective, which is sort of, again, the way I tend to look towards things. It's actually the most functional categories. Absolutely, because it all the relevant elements. That's right. If it's more differentiated than you have to make the assumption that you all will automatically know what's about to attack you, what you don't know, the unknown.

Speaker 1:          02:49          That's right. So it's a cat snake burden. It breathes fire and you know that could be a reference to the poisonous to a poisonous snake, but it also could be the inclusion of in the dangers because of course fire was certainly a danger on the velt at certain danger in the forests. And so fire breathing, cat snake bird covers a lot of territory, but it's even better than that because you say, well, what's in the unknown? So you project the contents of your imagination into the unknown to fill it. But the thing is is that we're not just prey animals, we're also predatory and exploratory. And so the Dragon, the cat snake bird that breathes fire isn't only a Predator, it's also the thing that guards virgins and the thing that guards gold. And that's also fascinating because I think that the, the are the ancestral males who were good at, at keeping the cat snake bird at bay.

Speaker 1:          03:43          We're much more likely to propagate. I mean, that's just seemed self evident I think when you tell people that everyone thinks, well obviously, you know, and that's the gladiatorial type or maybe the person who went out and found out where the nests of these things were in, got rid of the nests. And, and then. And so we also, we have this bifurcated image of the Predator which is the Predator slash unknown, which is also the place of new useful things. And so when it's very, what would you call it? It's very articulated, almost like in the Mesopotamian story, one of the names for Margo who goes out and confronts Tiamat, who's basically a cat snake bird is he who makes ingenious things out of the body of Tire Matt. And I mean, how can you, you can't get any more direct illustration of the idea than that. And when he has battled with ty Matt, who's come back with all the monsters, there are including the king of evil out there at their forefront to destroy that society of the Gods. He cuts her into pieces and makes the world. And so it's perfect. That's the, the, the uh, the savior of humanity, let's say, is he who confronts the chaotic unknown, differentiates it and makes the habitable world.
