Speaker 1:          00:00          It's really useful to understand that there are actual reasons why people see the world differently and that you can't just easily say that one is right and the other is wrong because the liberals are correct when it comes to borders, that if you thicken them too much and diminish the information flow, you risk making the society so static that any radical environmental transformation will sink it. It's the case, but the conservatives are right in that you pay a big price with regards to newcomers and new information with regards to risk to exposure to contaminating while to contamination period, but also to contaminating ideas. And so then I've always thought, you know, the, the environment itself moves back and forth like a snake in some sense. And what we're trying to do is stay on the center of its back. And the only way we can do that is by people, by having people pull to the right and say, be careful.

Speaker 1:          00:48          And people pull to the left and say, well yeah, but be open with that dialogue and the, the exchange of information that, that dialogue allows, we can maybe specify the center of that moving target and stay and stay well and stay on the back. Let's, yeah. Okay. So that's a really complicated metaphor with the snake. But I think it's a perfect way in to what's going on on campus and to why viewpoint diversity is so important. Cause that's, I agree exactly with what you just said. And so what I, the view that I've come to in studying moral psychology is that we is that humans are ultra social apes. Um, we, we evolved to live in these small groups that are fighting with each other. Uh, we evolve to have these low level animistic religions. That's our steady state. That's the way we were for at least a hundred thousand years are much more, um, probably closer to million in some form.

Speaker 1:          01:42          Um, so that's sort of our design. That's what we were designed for in a sense. Um, and in that sense were as individuals really kind of stupid tribal creatures designed to do post hoc reasoning. Um, but if you put us together in the right way with the right checks, with the right, the right systems, um, the, the whole can be vastly smarter than the components that go into it, which is true of the brain to the brain is composed of neurons. Each neuron is really kind of stupid little switch, but you put them together in the right way and you get something really brilliant. And in the same way, um, I don't know all the history here, but my understanding is that science begins or the culture of science, the scientific revolution begins in Europe in the 17th century. As you begin getting, you get the printing press so people can share their ideas, but you get communities of people who are challenging each other's ideas.

Speaker 1:          02:34          And that's what makes it so brilliant is that is that people have to do their best. We're really bad at this confirming our own ideas. It's very hard to make it very hard to do that. But you put your ideas out there and then everyone else is motivated to challenge them. And so if you put us together in the right way, the truth comes out. And so adversarial systems of law journalists know this. They have to listen to both sides. Scientists know this. Social scientists should know this. Okay, what happened? Well, um, the academy has, has always leaned left in the 20th century, but leaning isn't the problem. So people think, oh, viewpoint diversity we need, we need everybody. We need Nazis. We need every view. No, we don't need everybody. What we need is no orthodoxy. That's what's fatal orthodoxy. So if you have a, if you have to feel it like sociology or social psychology in which it's two or three, two, one left to right, that's totally fine with me, that's totally fine because if someone makes some claim that's just like ideologically blind, someone will say, uh, you know, common sense, other evidence that you've missed and then the system works.

Speaker 1:          03:42          But what, what I learned when I started down this road in 2011, I gave a talk at the big conference of social psychologists. I gave a talk about this problem that we're losing our diversity, that I could only find one conservative and the entire field and they gave a talk on this. Um, and um, um, and so what I've learned since then is that the ratio in psychology was between two to one and four to one left, right? All the way up to the early nineties. We've gathered together all of the studies we could find. So all the, up to the early nineties, it's only three or four to one left to right, which would be okay. Um, but then between 1995 or four and 2010, it goes to a 14 to one. Do you, do you have any idea why and why that time? Yes. So, um, so you get the same story.

Speaker 1:          04:32          Whether you look at Republican, Democrat ratios or liberal conservative, they're, they tell the same story. So the two of the big things going on, there are one is that the greatest generation, which had a lot of Republicans, um, so a lot of men go off to World War II. They are there on the Gi bill. They entered the academy in the 1950s a lot of them are conservative or Republican. Um, so you have a lot of them. But in the sixties and seventies, one of the main reasons to go to Grad school and the social sciences is either a to stay in school to escape the Vietnam war draft or be to fight for social justice and against racism. So in sociology and psychology in particular in political science, maybe, I'm not sure you get a huge influx of left leaning people who are there to pursue social justice. So you know, the motives are fine and if it was balanced and be totally fine, but as you get these young junior people on the left come in in the 70s and eighties and then you get the older people that are more politically balanced, retiring in the eighties and nineties.

Speaker 1:          05:30          By the time you get to the late nineties, it's all baby boomers. And so do you get a, you get a positive feedback loop developing in there. Like you said, it's like three to one. It's okay, but maybe when it hits four to one, it goes to like 20 to one, then you stay. Exactly. So then, so then you start getting hostile climate. So I wrote a review paper on this with uh, with Joe Duarte and Phil tetlock and lead Justin, jared Crawford. Um, um, and um, um, and we, uh, so we reviewed everything that we could find and we concluded that most of what's going on is self selection. That is people on the left are more open to experience. They're always going to get self selection. But then there's really good evidence that there's also hostile climate. I mean it's, it's undeniable now that if you are not on the left in a Grad program, there's just constant little subtle or not so subtle reminders that you don't belong. And look in the academy, we're all about saying, Hey, if there are subtle hints here and there, you can't succeed. Right? I mean, that's what we do for a living is we say that little things will stop people. Um, well, little things are put in the way of anyone who doesn't fit politically. Uh, and so you do get hostile climate. You do get over discrimination. There's evidence of that.
