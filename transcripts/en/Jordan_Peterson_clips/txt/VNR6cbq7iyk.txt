Speaker 1:          00:00          I read the story was not a biography, if I remember correctly of the of the captain. I might be wrong about that, but I've got the basic story, right? Well, they had a ship wreck and the Antarctica was then they were there for a whole year in the Antarctic, you know, and none of them died. Not One. He didn't lose a single man, not one. He kept the morale high and then they took this boat that was on the ship and they crossed like 400 miles of the roughest ocean, the roughest, frigid ocean in the world, right. You don't go in that ocean. And then they went to an island and they walked across the island across these mountains that no one else has ever climbed since, and they went to the city on the other side of the island and they got a boat and they went and rescued their compatriots and everyone survived.

Speaker 1:          00:46          It's like endurance is the name of the book. You read that book, man. You think, wow, people are really tough. You know, and if it's ridiculous. So who knows how tough you are and maybe you find out by going out to find out how tough you are, right? So you take on a challenge, one that you think you can master, just that's just a bit beyond your grasp and you master it and then your little tougher and you think, hey, that worked out pretty well, and so then you're more of a monster and then you go out and you find another challenge that's even bigger and you think, well maybe I can do that too, and then all of a sudden you can and you get a little bit bigger and God only knows what the limit is of you and you find out by pushing yourself against the world.

Speaker 1:          01:27          And of course that's what Abraham is doing. And so see, we're very pessimistic us more than people were pessimistic about humanity. That's for sure. Dismal, wretched planet destroying cancer on the planet, right? As the club of Rome described us so pleasantly back in the 19 sixties, you know, and, and I don't know, maybe we're ashamed of the Cold War. Maybe we're ashamed of all the destruction. In the 20th century and the hydrogen bomb and, and the, you know, the continuing catastrophes of our societies and were deeply ashamed of that and ashamed of ourselves personally, but it's a hell of a thing to, you know, call us a cancer on the planet. There's just no excuse for that because what you do with cancer is eradicated. And I don't think that that's a very noble motive personally. And I think it says a lot about the people who would use such phraseology that they would dare to conceptualize humanity in that manner.

Speaker 1:          02:23          But you know, it'd be nice if we could be optimistic and I think began the problem with being optimistic is that it's naive. So then the question is, is there an optimism that's not naive? And I think there is and the optimism that's not naive isn't just a visualization of how strong people can be. So one of the things that I tell people, I've told my students in my class in maps of meaning, here's a goal. You want to be the person at the funeral of your father that everyone can rely on. How would that be? You want to be the person who's broken and, and, and useless and adding to the misery in the corner. And look, I'm not making light of people's grief, you know, I understand grief, but who do you want to be when there's a crisis, right? Do you want to be the person that everyone can turn to for strength? It's like, why the hell not? Why not? That is a goal. That would be a good goal because then if there's a crisis and there will be, it won't be such a bloody crisis because there'll be someone there that can deal with it,

Speaker 1:          03:27          you know? So when I went and talked to these people at the funeral home, I envisioned that I thought, okay, well this is something you have to contend with. If you're going to be alive and adult, you have to contend with death and suffering and you have to be ready for it and you have to be there for the person because that's all they're going to have. And so there's a goal man. And in this time of nihilism, you know what's, what's the point of life? People ask and they're taught that at universities. What's the point of life? Everything's interpretation. Humanities. A cancer on the planet, you know? Well, how about no? How about not that? How about the do something to us.
