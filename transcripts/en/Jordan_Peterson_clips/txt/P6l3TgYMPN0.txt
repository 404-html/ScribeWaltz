Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay. So presumably the reason we've got into this situation, this mindset you might call us, right? I want to say we, I mean the culture certainly on the left is this remarkable transformation that's taking place in the potential and possibilities that women have enjoyed over the last 40 years when they turned out to be, it seems much more plastic and capable and having a great deal more talents and potentiality is that we used to think in the 1950s and this extraordinary liberation that's happened and it has happened on questions as has seems to have led us to the point of view that there is a kind of infinite malleability going well, but you can see how the argument would have got there. Well it's, I would say it's partly about, it's certainly partly post birth control confusion, right? Because with the invention of the birth control pill, you basically have a new female or because there's never been a female in the history of life that have voluntary control over her reproductive capability.

Speaker 1:          01:08          And now that's possible. MMM. So then the question arises, well, what is this new creature life? And one answer is she's like any way she wants to be. And then if you ally that as well with the Marxist sharp turn up, which is a social construction as doctrine that the state constructs the individual and should do so then you get a double whammy. And that, so some of it's understandable because we are still trying to figure out the parameters of female behavior once femininity is unlocked from involuntary reproductions and also the birth control can about, I've pretty much the same time, it says it quite an uptick in economic. So there was presumably a great deal, well possibility there is a great deal of possibility because it's quite clear that women are as intelligent as men for example. Although the variability might differ as we discussed and there was conscientiousness man and so, and there is created as men.

Speaker 1:          02:16          So although they may not be as creative as old man's, so that remains to be seen, but we'll see how that plays out. So it's not surprising that there's a lot of upheaval in the relationships between men and women because the bird is, you know, when humanity looks back on the 20th century, they're going to identify three dramatic revolutions. One is going to be, let's say the last half of the 20th century. One is going to be the transistor, the other is going to be the hydrogen bomb, and the third is going to be the birth control pill. And they're all of of of revolutionary significance. It's even more complex than that because it turns out that women on the birth control pill, like feminine men better than masculine men.

Speaker 1:          03:06          So the preference actually shifts when their own, because of some hormonal change. Yeah. So if you track women across their menstrual cycle when they're not on the tails, so what you do is you show them photographs of men, the same manny, but all you do is vary his jaw width, which you can do. We're on a continuum with the computer. Now John With is associated with testosterone. So larger job guys have higher levels of testosterone and women prefer the larger job guy when they're ovulating. And the smaller John's guy, when they're gifted from reproduction possibility. And, and so you see, women might want a monster to mate with and uh, and uh, uh, pell to raise children with. And I think in, in the beauty and the beast story, which I think is in some ways the central female myth, there's an attempt to bridge the gap because what the woman does is find a monster and payment, but you want your man to be tame enough so he doesn't eat your children, but you want them to be rough enough so that your son has a fighting chance in the mating hierarchy. And so that you have someone tough and aggressive is potentially able to protect you around. And there's a lot of sexual attractiveness. I'm not park. And now element.
