Speaker 1:          00:00          It's very necessary for people at some point in their life to dedicate themselves to a single game of some sort, which is kind of what you're doing in university, you know you have to become one thing at some point in your life and the sacrifice of course is that you give up all the other things that you could become, but the. You don't really have a choice because if you don't decide voluntarily to become one thing, you know, to become a, a disciplined adherent of some specific practice or profession or viewpoint, then you risk just aging chaotically and you don't get away with not aging, so you might as well age into something that's. That's actually something rather than just remaining or then just becoming an old child, which is really not a not a good thing. It's not a good thing to see. Especially by the time people hit about 40.

Speaker 1:          00:46          It's not. It's not. It's not pretty for them or anyone else. And even at 30 it's getting pretty old at that point. 40. It's like it's almost a repairable at 40 and the reason for that is you run, you start running out of opportunities when you're young and stupid. People don't care because they think, well, you know, whatever. You've got decades of of, of possibility still ready to unfold in you, but if you're in the same unspecified position at 40, people are much less forgiving. Especially because if they're going to hire someone who doesn't know what's going on or or employ them or or sorry or engage them in some sort of productive activity, they might as well take a chance on someone young and full of potential rather than someone who's really lived more than half of their life already. Because of course you have, by the time you're 40.
