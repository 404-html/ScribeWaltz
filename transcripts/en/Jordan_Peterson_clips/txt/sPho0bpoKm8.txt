Speaker 1:          00:00          So the fundamental thing that I learned from Paul Rosen is to see us as these amazing omnivores. This is part of our survival strategy even more than other other apes. We are just brilliant omnivores and we have the Omnivore's dilemma, which is we've got to be interested in all kinds of new stuff. We're not tied to one place we can roam onto a whole new continent. So we were interested in stuff, but stuff has all kinds of toxins and microbes. We have to be careful about that stuff. And so these motives have to be intention and this is actually an interesting way to understand the left right difference. You have to have both motives, but if so, imagine two siblings, one of whom is set more towards trying new stuff, seeking out new stuff, and the other's a little more fearful and we're like, Whoa, no, let's, let's not try that.

Speaker 1:          00:45          That stayed with what's tried and true. I mean that's Progressive Ism and conservatives and that's the origins of it. And if you look at kids' behavior at the age of two or three, it does predict how they'll vote much later. Not Hugely, but there is a clear prediction there. So, um, so disgust is part of a regulatory system about our engagement with the world and whether we are just sorta out there and, you know, we, we, we seek out variety and diversity. We think diversity is just a great thing where whether we want a little more order structure, predictability. I'm conservatives are neater than progressive's. If you take photos of their rooms, um, um, you know, you can actually, you know, cleanliness and organization, you can predict how they vote, um, discussed. It turns out what's really cool about disgust in modern politics is if you look at all the different things that we're fighting over, especially in this country, our culture war is over, you know, going back a few decades, you know, sex, drugs, the flag, immigration, all of these things.

Speaker 1:          01:43          Um, I had to study with my colleagues was led by Seneca Leyva in which we asked all these cultural war attitudes of people and we also had their scores and the discus scale. But one of the foundations of morality is sanctity and purity. And it relates to discuss what we found is that if you know, if you know, um, uh, what people's left, right? We're, how they place themselves in the left rightscale you can pretty much predict where they fall on most cultural war attitudes except for those that load on or implicate sanctity or purity. So what I mean his flag burning. Okay. Do you think, you know, do you think that people should have the right to burn the American flag or the country's flag as an expression, as a political action? What do you think people could give some answer on a one to seven scale and people on the right thing?

Speaker 1:          02:30          You know, I'm more like this ain't no people in the left. Yes. People are score high on loyalty are more likely to say no people lower and say yes. And that's even taking account of where they are on the left right dimension. But here's the cool thing, um, it's only if you add in the purity or sanctity thing that you can really understand what people are doing because some people see the flag not as just a piece of cloth. They see it as having some innate essence, some something sacred about it which must be protected. And so, um, so this is true even they think of it as a unifying center. Exactly. That's right. So if there's something sacred, and this is the, this is the central piece of my work around politics and morality is the psychology of sanctity. If you hold something sacred, then your team's circles around it and it's only those who circle around with you and sometimes literally circle around like Muslims at prayer in Mecca, they literally circle the Kebab.

Speaker 1:          03:24          Circling is a very primitive, ancient. It feels right to circle something, but even if even if you do it symbolically or you all bow at the same time that binds you together, children do that with their mothers when they, when they engage in exploratory behavior, right where all they use their mother as a center of the world. And children differ in the degree to which they'll move outward from their mothers. So they move out until they, they, they trip over their, their uncertainty threshold a neat. And is it a distance? Like it's a district? Yeah. And so, so the more exploratory kids who are lower negative emotion will go out farther before they come back to their mother. So the mother is the center and you know that that would be associated symbolically with the idea of the center as a motherland or potentially as a father.

Speaker 1:          04:06          That's right. That makes sense. So this way that we're. We're incredibly symbolic creatures. We're not just out to make as much money as we can. Where's this symbolic and social creatures and this psychology of sanctity or purity has become really important, not just on the right. It's always been important for especially religious conservatives were beginning to see it even on the campus left. And this is why I think we see some of the odd things we see on campus that the campus must be kept as a sacred and pure space. One of the things that really alarms me about what's happened on campus and last couple of years is that the older idea we had that it's a place for contesting ideas. It's a, it's a zone of enormous choice. People can take what courses they want, say what they want. It's kind of a wonderful free for all with some with norms of respect.

Speaker 1:          04:54          It's now becoming much more of a religious zone where the perimeter of the campus is the boundaries and within it they're almost there. Blasphemy laws basically, and I really started noticing this. When you look at the videos of the Middlebury, a protest when Charles Murray spoke at Middlebury and as everybody knows, he was shouted down so the students are chanting and they're chanting in unison and it seems like a religious revival meeting and they're swaying and they're saying they're sacred in a racist, sexist, antigay. Charles Murray go away. It's like a ritual incantation so that all the space as safe and it's safe and not maternal way. Not yet. So far all this happening is they're binding together. They're moving and you know, synchronous movement and call and response. So it's using a lot of tropes from religion and religious worship. But here's the cool thing. When the administrator, I forget who it is, comes on to say, okay, we have moved, we're moving the talk, and then you hear a couple people screaming up off campus off campus and he says to another location on campus and there's like, oh no, no, because no one had to go to this talk so everyone could have just stayed home and the students didn't succeed in shutting down the venues so they could have declared victory, but it's not a full victory unless he is physically off the campus.

Speaker 1:          06:21          We can't have him speaking on campus because that defiles us. That pollutes us. We must shut that down. And that's where I started saying, wow, this is like full blown psychology of religion, Durkheim, sanctity, purity, blast for me. Uh, and that I think, you know, that doesn't describe most students that, that describes this sort of the core, those who, who really have their identities wrapped up in this movie.

Speaker 2:          06:46          Okay. So, so we discussed, I wanted to, I wanted to ask you a couple of things about that. So you know, the big five research into political differences basically shows that the liberals are high in trait, openness and low in conscientiousness and the conservatives or the reverse, but we fragmented conscientiousness into orderliness and industriousness with the big five aspect scale and orderliness is strongly associated with disgust. So. So. Right, right, right, exactly. It does sound a lot like Freud but it. But it also isn't accordance with your observations that conservatives have neater spaces, for example. So, so now, and they're meeting start on time. Yes. Yeah, exactly. Right. Right. So, so then the, the nexus for political belief seems to be openness so that that exploratory tendency that you talked about exploration of ideas and creativity and low orderliness and so then I thought, well why in the world would, why would the political nexus go across those dimensions, which are some relatively uncorrelated.

Speaker 2:          07:49          Then I thought, and this is in keeping with your work on discussed, is that it's an issue of borders, which of course seems more or less self evident in the wake of trump's election when he talked about borders. But you might say, and I think this is reasonable, that the conservative is someone who wants the borders between categories to remain intact no matter what level of analysis, so it's borders from the highest resolution level of cognition all the way up to the actual physical borders of, of, of rooms, towns, states, countries, all of that. So the borders should be thicker and the reason they want that. Now, there was a paper published in Plos one, I don't know if you saw it, it was a couple of years ago. It was a mind boggling paper. It should have been front page news as far as I was concerned.

Speaker 2:          08:35          And what the researchers did was between countries and then within provinces or states within countries, they correlated the level of, um, of frequency of infectious disease with authoritarian political beliefs and found a walloping correlation. It was like point, it was one of the highest by the, for, for, for those of you who don't know, social scientists never discover anything that's associated with anything else at a correlation of point six other than heritability other than heritability. Yes. And so what they found was that the higher the prevalence of infectious disease, the higher the probability of, of totalitarian authoritarian political attitudes, and then they controlled for governance because one of the questions was, was this pop down authoritarianism or bottom up authoritarianism? And the answer was that it was bottom up. Okay. And so I thought about that in two from two perspectives simultaneously at the time.

Speaker 2:          09:32          Okay. So we identified disgust, sensitivity with orderliness, so say a fundamental sub trait. Then I was reading this book that was called Hitler's table talk, and it was a, it was the recordings of virtually everything he said at dinner from 1939 to 1942. Yeah. So it's a spontaneous utterance say, and it's full of discussions about Jews and Gypsies and all the people he tormented. But what's really interesting is all the language is discussed. It's not feared. So, so Hitler is basic metaphor was that the area, race and country was a pure body. And then it was assaulted by parasites, right? And then I remembered what happened to the native Americans when the Europeans showed up and shook hands. What happened was that 95 percent of them are dead within 50 years, right? Because of smallpox and measles, and so that that border issue that separates conservatives from liberals, let's say, is the conservative say the novel is potentially contaminated. It's not so much that it's dangerous. That's different. That's fear. It's contaminated. And the Liberals say, hold on a minute. If you make the borders too thick, then information can't pass through. Exactly. So that's the Omnivore's dilemma right there. Right? And, and then since we have a biological architecture on which are cognitive platforms are erected, we have the same attitude towards abstract information, which would be ideas that we do to things like food or, or illness. Right? Right. And so we can think of an invading idea or a polluting idea or contaminating idea. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:06          that's right. Now I'm a big fan of George lakoff metaphors. We live by that. We yet we use our bodily, our bodily Schema data to think about abstract things like politics and like what our policies should be about borders and immigration. Uh, there's a Canadian psychologist, mark shaller. He and his colleagues have developed what they call an account over these, the behavioral immune system, right. That we don't just try to, you know, microbes killed probably many more of our ancestors. Dan Did Lions and tigers and bears and so whoever can keep themselves and their children from being exposed to fatal illnesses, winds the evolutionary game. And so a lot of that is judging carefully about people. Is he dangerous, dangerous. And that's both for sexuality, for contact, for all kinds of association. Um, so yeah, and a lot of ways our emotions and bodily interactions structure, how we think and feel about about social.

Speaker 2:          11:57          Well even with the black death in Europe, I mean, so the black death occurred in Europe when the Europeans started to move around the world and they brought back rats that were infected. Exactly. So, so what you saw there was both of those forces at work at the same time. So the European expansion produced a tremendous interchange of ideas from all around the world. That's globalization, but it wiped out somewhere between 30 and 60 percent of the population at the same time. So wouldn't it

Speaker 1:          12:22          be good if in every society or every organization, and we had some people who specialized in a specialized insane, hey, what are the opportunities? And then we had other people who specialize in saying, well, but what are the risks? And it just so happens that a lot of people have trouble doing all that in themselves. When we have systems that are well constituted with people who have different personalities and different motives and goals, we actually can get better outcomes. We can have a discussion between them.
