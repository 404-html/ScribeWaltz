Speaker 1:          00:00          This was a statistic that just absolutely shocked and staggered me when I went through the Intel intelligence literature, so you know, it is illegal in the United States to induct anybody who has an Iq of less than 83 and the reason for that is you know that the American armed forces have been conducting intelligence research for like more than 100 years and that was partly because they needed a way of sorting people rapidly during times of military expansion during war time. But it was also because Iq tests and especially in the early part of the 20th century were used to identify, let's say the deserving poor who could really benefit from additional educational attainment and advancement in the unit. And the military was hoping to identify people from lower class strata that can be streamed into say, officer training programs and so forth or, or even skills training programs to.

Speaker 1:          00:50          To move people from the underclass into at least the working class and maybe above. So they had a bloody stake in this man. They wanted to find people, they want it to sort them properly and they wanted to do social good when they weren't just trying to win a war, let's say, which often also is social good, but what happened was that by, I don't remember when this legislation was introduced, but it wasn't. It was in the later part of the 20th century, but there are basic finding. Was that by say the 19 eighties, they had determined that if you had an Iq of less than 83, there was not a damn thing that the unit that the army could do, the armed forces could do to transform you into someone who could do something that was more productive than nonproductive, and the terrible thing about that is that it's about 10 percent of the population and so they look at a statistic like that and you think, oh my God, you've got this, this, this, this enterprise, this massive enterprise that's chronically hungry for people.

Speaker 1:          01:48          Right? It's always, they're always looking for people who are really oriented towards taking people from the underclass and lower working class and pushing them up. The societal strata and during war time there actually desperate to bring in recruits period and their conclusion is that 10 percent of the population can't be trained to do anything. Anything sufficiently useful to make them militarily operable. It's just. I just read that my jaw just dropped. It's like in the United States we have about 330 million people and because of the distribution, the relatively normal distribution of Iq scores about 16 percent of 85 or what? They're not going to graduate school. No, it means that from, from what I've read practically, it means the wanderlust company has actually done a really. They have a nice Iq tests from the commercial perspective, you know, it's actually psychometrically valid and they've linked Iq levels to a job. Specifically the job categories, you know, I know not a lot. I was going to say is they're not only not going to graduate school, they're not going to find a, a stable

Speaker 2:          03:00          job that pays a livable wage.

Speaker 1:          03:05          Especially even given that so many of the service jobs now require fair, high degree of computational savvy or leader built. No, I'm not computation, but ability to interact with complex computational technology, the typical till ladder at a checkout market or or the Mcdonald's because the dongles is actually very complicated, is often far beyond the ability of people who are on the low end of the intelligence distribution and they claimed, I think it was wonderlic, although it might know it might've been. It might've been hunt. What's his name? These ICU researcher. Is it earl haunt? I think possibly what he claimed that that if you have an Iq of below 90, that it's. It's difficult. It's difficult for you to read well enough to translate what you're reading into action, so you can't actually read instructions and follow them. You don't have that level of literacy.

Speaker 2:          03:58          That's correct, yeah. I was going to say that in in the United States, this bottom 16 percent translates into 51 million people, including $13 million children who are in school. Right. This is a very difficult problem. Now I knew earl hunter. He passed away. I knew him pretty well. He also would say that there is this a cognitive segregation in society. This is a point that Charles Murray makes an often asked, you know, when's the last time you had someone over for dinner who wasn't a college graduate?

Speaker 1:          04:41          Well that was something that Marie and Bernstein wrote about in their book the bell curve, which really struck me because I read that book twice unlike most of the people criticized it and you know, we're one of the things that they pointed out in there, it was, look the typically the typical educated person thinks that someone isn't very bright if they have an Iq of 150. So you at graduate level, Phd Level Research Institutions, right? Because 115, there's as many people at 115 and above as there are at 85 and below. And so it's a minority of the population and that's the top 15 percent. And you know, that's, that's the dollar undergraduate people have. See I'm a clinical psychologist and I've dealt with people who had, I ranges in the low eighties and tried to find them jobs and tried to train them. And I, I have some real knowledge about the stunning gap between people at the low end of the ICU distribution and the high end, and it's, it's no bloody wonder, people hate Iq research and intelligence research because it reveals a set of seriously, a dismal facts about the incredible range of ability among human beings.

Speaker 2:          05:52          Well, yes, this is true. And moreover I would add to this that people in universities, professors and a couple of graduate students, uh, have a hard time understanding what the, what everyday life is like. If you have an Iq of 84, 85 and we're making your way, you're living independently. You were making your way in the world

Speaker 1:          06:21          five. It is a challenge. I mean, just, just barely begins to describe it. I had a, I had a client who, he probably had an Iq of under 80 nonverbal portion of it anyways. And um, he was indistinguishable in physical appearance from, from let's say, I hate to use the frame normal person, but there's nothing more that marked him out about particularly intellectually impaired, you know. And uh, I tried at one point, this is this, this was so, so telling to me I got him a volunteer job, which by the way is very difficult. It's harder to get a volunteer job in a real job because you have to do police screening and all sorts of things and the selection process is just as extreme. But I eventually ended up getting him a job at a bike store, bike slash bookstore and at that place couldn't hold him once the subsidy program had expired.

Speaker 1:          07:16          And then I got him a job at a charity and his job was to fold letters into three so that they can be put into envelopes. Well, that sounds easy except that he also had a bit of a motor tremor and you know, it took me about 30 hours to train him to fold up a piece of paper with sufficient precision so that it can be put in an envelope rapidly so that the envelope wasn't so mangled that it would get stuck in the automatic sorting machine. How, in other words, high performance demands on him too. He had to whip through those letters pretty quickly and then sometimes the letters would have a photograph appended to them that was stapled on and they weren't always stapled on in the same place, so then he had to calculate how to fold the paper over the photograph without bending the photograph in precise third so that would still fit in the envelope, and then he had to separate the French letters from the English letters and associate them with the proper envelopes and that level of complexity just did him in. Let

Speaker 2:          08:20          me say two things. One is I hope common sense and the other is pretty provocative. The common sense thing is we have to be very careful when we have these discussions not to devalue the human dignity of people who are in the upper end of the distribution and if there's one criticism that is fair is sometimes in these conversations it sounds like we're devaluing people at the lower end of the distribution and we have to be very careful that we don't do that. A human has dignity

Speaker 1:          08:56          and Iq is not the most important thing that defines human beings even associated with wisdom. It's not necessarily associated with truth or with courage or with many virtues that how did it all with being likable or on the psychometric psychometric relationship between intelligence and conscientiousness is zero. Right? We have to make that point. Yes, I. I agree. I agree. I'm trying to make the point about how difficult it is for people who are on the low end of the cognitive spectrum to survive in a, in an increasingly complex, cognitively sophisticated environment, jobs are just disappearing.
