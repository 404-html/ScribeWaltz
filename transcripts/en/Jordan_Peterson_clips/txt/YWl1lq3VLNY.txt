Speaker 1:          00:00          How do you pick up knowledge of how to act well, that's not quite as explicit. It's not as easy to figure out, you know, obviously you know the children up a lot of information by modeling behavior, which is basically a copy adults and that basically means they watched adults act with their body through space and they duplicate those patterns of action. Can you generalize from them? So that's one way behavioral wisdom is transmitting something that is explicit as well, at least in terms of the receipt of rewards and punishments because parents will modulate their children's behavior by engaging and motivationally significant interactions with them. At least that's what you should do if you're a parent. That's your primary responsibility in a sense. So that's what we mean when we say that you're paying attention to someone. That basically means that you're modulating your behavior with your behavior, with your emotions.

Speaker 1:          00:45          So like a child will monitor or parallel marcher is child would react positively when something that the parent wants to happen happens and negatively. When something happens with the parent doesn't want to happen. So the child's behaviors, well that's just classical reinforcement theory. Basically you exchanged rewards and punishments and threats and promises and behavior. We do that all the time in their interpersonal interactions. That's part of the reason why people with personality disorders can sort of have an uncanny effect on you, which is to say if you're a personality disorder, do you have a really potent expectation about how someone else will behave usually like a son of a bitch fundamentally, and if someone with a personality disorder encountered someone who doesn't talk like that and they're a challenge to their belief system, people with personality disorders are extremely good at turning everyone. They meet into the same person that they already met and they do that.

Speaker 1:          01:37          I think by exchanging very, very subtle and covert reinforcements, which is to say, you're engaged with me and I have a personality disorder. Every time you act properly, I'll ignore you or say something contemptuous or look away or do something quite subtle and every time you act like a miserable bastard, which is nice to expect. I'll at least pay some attention and possibly even reinforced you covertly. And you'll find if you get close to me, that you, it's almost like you'd been distorted by a gravitational field as you paid your starts getting pulled in strange directions. We do that to each other all the time and one of the things you might consider as well, these are very large. We're all engaged in these patterns of mutually modifying interactions and something emerges from that stable. I guess I would say that the things I'm going to teach you about mythology or the things that I do as stable, emerging properties from risk from centuries of reciprocal interaction.

Speaker 1:          02:32          So if we're engaged in some pursuit, you're going to notify me and I'm going to modify you and neither of us really know precisely what that means because we're not conscious of all the reasons that we do everything. And that's just been. I mean it's bad. Not if there's only two of us, but if it was like 50 of us will, then you can imagine the calculating all the permutations of the interactions become virtually impossible. Point is we will settle into some sort of stable configuration or disappear. Those are the options and that human societies do settle, settle into stable configuration, so we don't really understand how that happens, but we we have developed the ability to describe those configurations without understanding of it. I think that makes up a big part of mythology. The stories we tell ourselves about how we behave when we don't know how or even why you things to consider in the future.
