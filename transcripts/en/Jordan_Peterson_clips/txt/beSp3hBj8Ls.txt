Speaker 1:          00:00          What do I think of Paul Joseph Watson supposition that populism is the new punk slash counterculture? That's a good question. I mean you see that you see, I would say some indication of that on Youtube, although it's not easy to get an unbiased sample of what's going on on Youtube because of course youtube tends to present you with things that are akin to the things that you're already watching. It does appear to me that the conservative commentators on youtube are playing somewhat of the same role that the counterculture played. Let's call it more traditionally, even though that's a funny thing to say about the counterculture. What I'm wondering more is whether or not not so much whether it's a counterculture, but if it's something that's more specifically associated with a place that men, young men are finding their new political voice online. Part of the reason that I'm wondering about that, although there are a number of female conservative commentators who also become popular online, is because many of the commentators appear to be man and many of the people who are following them also appear to be mad. And so, and it's not obvious to me that men, it's easy now for men, especially young men, to have a political voice on campus, for example, or perhaps even in public. Um, and so maybe they're turning to youtube to, to find these viewpoints that aren't being destroyed, disseminated widely in the, in the popular media.
