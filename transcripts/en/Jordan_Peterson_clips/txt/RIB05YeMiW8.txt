Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay, quick question. Are you a Christian? I suppose the most straightforward answer to that is yes. Although I think it's. Let's leave it at. Yes. I'm a bit dissatisfied with that because there are so many kinds of Christians. Christian, well, there are. There are truths to other than the literal that perhaps are more truthful than even literal truth. No. There are many kinds of truth and I don't mean that in A. I don't mean that in a postmodern way actually, but the truths that govern behavior and the truths that emerged from facts are not the same truths. What do you do you believe that Jesus rose again from the day I find it. I cannot answer that question and the reason is because.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Let me think about it for a minute. See if I can come up with a reasonable answer to that. Well, the first answer would be it depends on what you mean by Jesus and historical human being that existed in a. It was a physical body and then it was on earth that was literally was literally came back to life after death. I would say that at the moment I'm agnostic about that issue, which is a lot different than saying I don't believe for it's happened. Explain why when I get to that, when I get to the New Testament, in my biblical lectures, I'll spend like six hours trying to explain what I think about that, but one of the things I have come to learn over the last 15 years in particularly in particular is that the world is a theory, theory, strange place. It's far stranger than we think and what we don't understand about consciousness and its relationship with the body was still many books and you could say the same thing about our relationship with time and perhaps corporality and vulnerability and all and death for that matter.

Speaker 1:          02:31          So I don't understand that. The structure of being well enough to to to make my way through the complexities of the resurrection story. I would say it's the most mysterious element of the biblical stories to me and perhaps I'm not alone, is now. I mean it's the central. It's the central drama and in the Christian Corpus, let's say, but I don't believe that it's reasonable to boil it down to something like, do you believe that or do you not believe that? You know it's not. It's I don't know what the limits. I don't know the limits of human possibility. I don't know intriguing because I had very much has you down as somebody sold us essentially projections of the human consciousness. They are that and I could say I could say the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ symbolizes the necessity of the psyche to a sequence of deaths and rebirths attainment of the ideal.

Speaker 1:          03:51          That's what I expected you to say is true. It's a phoenix. It's a phoenix story. No know the actual facts. It started. The thing is is that just because that's true, it doesn't mean that's all true about it because I also don't know. So here, for example, in order to stay alive, it's necessary to get the balance between death and life are in your psyche and your physiology because that keeps you alive. Your cells die and regenerate all the time, and if you die too much, then you die, and if you don't die enough, well then you also die. You end up with cancer or something like that. You have to get the balance between death and life, right? In order to survive. I don't know what would happen if you got the balance between death and life exactly right and I don't know what the upper limits are to human possibility and and neither does anyone else, and human consciousness and human beings are capable of.

Speaker 1:          04:56          We don't know what we're capable of, I suppose is the final answer, and so I'm unwilling for a variety of reasons which aren't, which I can't explain. They're tangled up with the experiences of the experiences that I've had that I can't. I can't. I can neither understand newer explained, but I'm unwilling to rule out. I'm unwilling to rule out the existence of heaven. I'm unwilling to rule out the existence of life after death. I'm unwilling to rule out the idea of universal redemption and the defeat of evil. Now I know perfectly well that all those things can be pro well conceptualized metaphorically. I know that metaphorical conceptualization, but I'm not willing to make the claim that those ideas exhaust themselves in the metaphor of it's, you know, I'm not in a position as of yet to articulate why I think that in a manner that would be anything other than a jumble of lateral thoughts. I have thoughts, but they're not organized and part of the reason I'm doing the biblical lecture series is to organize those thoughts. That's so interesting. I had one day I'll have a chance to ask you more about that.
