00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.920
<v Speaker 1>What advice would you give to someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking to quit porn?</v>

2
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.653
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave some advice a little earlier </v>

3
00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:09.140
<v Speaker 1>about quitting alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.740
<v Speaker 1>and I would say it isn't that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to quit porn.</v>

5
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.020
<v Speaker 1>It's not the right way to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

6
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.273
<v Speaker 1>The right way to think about it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to figure out how to have </v>

7
00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:21.410
<v Speaker 1>a better life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to figure out,</v>

8
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.173
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say do the future authoring </v>

9
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:27.490
<v Speaker 1>program and keep your porn addiction in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

10
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.160
<v Speaker 1>And think so in the first part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future authoring program,</v>

11
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.230
<v Speaker 1>it asks you a bunch of questions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what your life could be like in three to</v>

12
00:00:36.231 --> 00:00:37.064
<v Speaker 1>five years if you took care of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were someone that you cared </v>

13
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:40.124
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

14
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

15
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.273
<v Speaker 1>then it asks you questions about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and your family and your career </v>

16
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 1>and your time outside of work and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>health and you know,</v>

17
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>the important dimensions of life and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it asks you to spend,</v>

18
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.683
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

19
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.153
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes writing about how good your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life could be in three to five years if </v>

20
00:00:59.531 --> 00:01:01.720
<v Speaker 1>you got your act together and did what </v>
<v Speaker 1>was good for you.</v>

21
00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:04.570
<v Speaker 1>And then it asked you to write about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell you could be at if you didn't.</v>

22
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.920
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say you really need to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because porn isn't the issue.</v>

23
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.950
<v Speaker 1>The issue is that you're not living your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life the way you want to.</v>

24
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.750
<v Speaker 1>So you need a vision of life that's more</v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling than the porn.</v>

25
00:01:16.751 --> 00:01:19.090
<v Speaker 1>And you need a counter vision to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>frightens you.</v>

26
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.643
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise porn is obviously </v>

27
00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:24.940
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily gratifying in the short </v>
<v Speaker 1>term.</v>

28
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.793
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you seem to be suffering from the </v>

29
00:01:27.101 --> 00:01:29.770
<v Speaker 1>medium to longterm consequences of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

30
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.013
<v Speaker 1>And so you need a story that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell yourself that's really deeply </v>

31
00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:38.170
<v Speaker 1>thought through about why this is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate for you.</v>

32
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.071
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>

33
00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:39.904
<v Speaker 1>It's how it's hurting you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how it's minimizing you would be </v>

34
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.143
<v Speaker 1>perhaps making you embarrassed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ashamed and more socially isolated and </v>

35
00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:46.804
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say think about it as </v>

36
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.853
<v Speaker 1>cleaning up your psyche and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior rather than merely started </v>

37
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.663
<v Speaker 1>stopping,</v>

38
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.933
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

39
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.943
<v Speaker 1>stopping poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you also might want to write down </v>

40
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.263
<v Speaker 1>and you could do this in the negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision part of the future of the </v>

41
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.693
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to write down everything bad </v>

42
00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:05.884
<v Speaker 1>that you think porn is doing to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because obviously you have some </v>

43
00:02:08.651 --> 00:02:11.170
<v Speaker 1>suspicions that this is not good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

44
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it's that it's actually harming you</v>

45
00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:18.451
<v Speaker 1>in some important way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you need to be fully cognizant of</v>

46
00:02:18.521 --> 00:02:19.354
<v Speaker 1>what those ways are and then take them </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously and decide if that's the </v>

47
00:02:22.031 --> 00:02:26.410
<v Speaker 1>pathway through life on which you wish </v>
<v Speaker 1>to travel.</v>

48
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.020
<v Speaker 1>And so I up then I would also say good </v>
<v Speaker 1>luck to you.</v>

49
00:02:29.021 --> 00:02:32.260
<v Speaker 1>You know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very good idea to identify one of</v>

50
00:02:32.261 --> 00:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>your weaknesses and work on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Done.</v>

51
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.953
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can strengthen yourself </v>

52
00:02:35.741 --> 00:02:37.050
<v Speaker 1>substantially by doing that.</v>
