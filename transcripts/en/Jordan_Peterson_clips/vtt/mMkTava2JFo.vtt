00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.150
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.133
<v Speaker 1>what women want are dangerous men who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are civilized and they want to help </v>

3
00:00:06.551 --> 00:00:07.384
<v Speaker 1>civilize them.</v>

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Beauty and the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5
00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:12.094
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a funny story and only </v>

6
00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:16.000
<v Speaker 1>engineers could have come up with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they are the only ones that have</v>

7
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:16.834
<v Speaker 1>the unparalleled blindness to social </v>
<v Speaker 1>convention that would allow them to </v>

8
00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:23.530
<v Speaker 1>discover it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Google engineers,</v>

9
00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:26.050
<v Speaker 1>I like engineers by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they're very straight forward.</v>

10
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.973
<v Speaker 1>The Google engineers wrote a book a </v>
<v Speaker 1>while back called a billion wicked </v>

11
00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:32.530
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a study of Internet searches,</v>

12
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.453
<v Speaker 1>billions of them literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were looking a lot at </v>

13
00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:36.184
<v Speaker 1>pornography use and well there's lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing about male pornography use </v>

14
00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:41.020
<v Speaker 1>partly and it's easy to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

15
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.070
<v Speaker 1>males are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.113
<v Speaker 1>pretty visually oriented and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracts them to pornography is fairly </v>

17
00:00:46.751 --> 00:00:48.100
<v Speaker 1>straight forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.490
<v Speaker 1>you can tell that if you look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>graffiti and a men's washroom,</v>

19
00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:54.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like two circles and a triangle and</v>

20
00:00:54.431 --> 00:00:56.500
<v Speaker 1>the men are absolutely transfixed.</v>

21
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

22
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.843
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

23
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 1>for women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story is more complex.</v>

24
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:15.084
<v Speaker 1>They use pornography too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it tends to be literary because </v>

25
00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:19.480
<v Speaker 1>women tend to like words more than they </v>
<v Speaker 1>like visual stimuli.</v>

26
00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:23.840
<v Speaker 1>And so the Google guys tried to track </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the archetipal structure of all,</v>

27
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>they didn't use those words of female </v>
<v Speaker 1>pornography use.</v>

28
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:27.294
<v Speaker 1>And so some of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you know what a Harlequin </v>

29
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.540
<v Speaker 1>Romances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

30
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are archetypal stories,</v>

31
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the taming of the wild man.</v>

32
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Essentially by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the desirable and virgin a woman.</v>

33
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:43.350
<v Speaker 1>And if you think women don't want that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you better bloody well come up with</v>

34
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>an explanation for 50 shades of grey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

35
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:47.394
<v Speaker 1>Which is the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most rapid selling novel in human </v>

36
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>history and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and merged at exactly the same time that</v>

37
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:55.820
<v Speaker 1>all of this noise about the lack of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absence of gender roles is,</v>

38
00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 1>is being produced.</v>

39
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Mohs.</v>

40
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like perfect female fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly Arkan typically correct.</v>

41
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:02.004
<v Speaker 1>It's beauty and the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they do go guys showed was the </v>

42
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:06.354
<v Speaker 1>structure of beauty and the beast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they didn't use that as a </v>

43
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 1>reference that the female pornographic </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy was wild guy.</v>

44
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 1>somewhat careless about the wants and </v>
<v Speaker 1>desires of others,</v>

46
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Speaker 1>attractive to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

47
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:19.134
<v Speaker 1>High Status Tamed by the Magic of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single woman and brought into a </v>

48
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>relationship with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

49
00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the comical part.</v>

50
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>This just made me laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

51
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:27.864
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why were the five categories of most </v>

52
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>desirable male entity used most broadly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and female pornography?</v>

53
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so embarrassing.</v>

54
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to cover your head.</v>

55
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say this because vampire,</v>

56
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.850
<v Speaker 1>we're wolf billionaire surgeon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pirate.</v>
