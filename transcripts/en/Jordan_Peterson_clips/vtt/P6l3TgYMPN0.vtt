1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.113
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So presumably the reason we've got into </v>

2
00:00:02.621 --> 00:00:05.750
<v Speaker 1>this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this mindset you might call us,</v>

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say we,</v>

4
00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean the culture certainly on the left</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this remarkable transformation that's</v>

5
00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:13.814
<v Speaker 1>taking place in the potential and </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities that women have enjoyed </v>

6
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:20.870
<v Speaker 1>over the last 40 years when they turned </v>
<v Speaker 1>out to be,</v>

7
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:25.871
<v Speaker 1>it seems much more plastic and capable </v>
<v Speaker 1>and having a great deal more talents and</v>

8
00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:29.084
<v Speaker 1>potentiality is that we used to think in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1950s and this extraordinary </v>

9
00:00:33.381 --> 00:00:34.214
<v Speaker 1>liberation that's happened and it has </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened on questions as has seems to </v>

10
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 1>have led us to the point of view that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a kind of infinite malleability</v>

11
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:42.564
<v Speaker 1>going well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can see how the argument would </v>

12
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:45.490
<v Speaker 1>have got there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>

13
00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:50.050
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's partly about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly partly post birth control</v>

14
00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:52.480
<v Speaker 1>confusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

15
00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Because with the invention of the birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>control pill,</v>

16
00:00:54.551 --> 00:00:55.384
<v Speaker 1>you basically have a new female or </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's never been a female in </v>

17
00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:03.334
<v Speaker 1>the history of life that have voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 1>control over her reproductive </v>

18
00:01:06.581 --> 00:01:07.414
<v Speaker 1>capability.</v>

19
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>And now that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>

20
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.590
<v Speaker 1>So then the question arises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

21
00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:20.591
<v Speaker 1>what is this new creature life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one answer is she's like any way she</v>

22
00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:22.234
<v Speaker 1>wants to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you ally that as well with </v>

23
00:01:24.671 --> 00:01:25.504
<v Speaker 1>the Marxist sharp turn up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a social construction as </v>

24
00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:32.860
<v Speaker 1>doctrine that the state constructs the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual and should do so then you get</v>

25
00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 1>a double whammy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

26
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:35.064
<v Speaker 1>so some of it's understandable because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we are still trying to figure out the </v>

27
00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:38.344
<v Speaker 1>parameters of female behavior once </v>
<v Speaker 1>femininity is unlocked from involuntary </v>

28
00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:49.981
<v Speaker 1>reproductions and also the birth control</v>
<v Speaker 1>can about,</v>

29
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.720
<v Speaker 1>I've pretty much the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says it quite an uptick in economic.</v>

30
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.563
<v Speaker 1>So there was presumably a great deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well possibility there is a great deal </v>

31
00:02:00.851 --> 00:02:05.851
<v Speaker 1>of possibility because it's quite clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>that women are as intelligent as men for</v>

32
00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the variability might differ as</v>

33
00:02:09.341 --> 00:02:12.790
<v Speaker 1>we discussed and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness man and so,</v>

34
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.620
<v Speaker 1>and there is created as men.</v>

35
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.070
<v Speaker 1>So although they may not be as creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>as old man's,</v>

36
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>so that remains to be seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll see how that plays out.</v>

37
00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:23.244
<v Speaker 1>So it's not surprising that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of upheaval in the relationships </v>

38
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>between men and women because the bird </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

39
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.413
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when humanity looks back on the 20th </v>

40
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to identify three dramatic</v>

41
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:38.480
<v Speaker 1>revolutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is going to be,</v>

42
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.470
<v Speaker 1>let's say the last half of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

43
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.543
<v Speaker 1>One is going to be the transistor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other is going to be the hydrogen </v>

44
00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:49.114
<v Speaker 1>bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the third is going to be the birth </v>

45
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:51.644
<v Speaker 1>control pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're all of of of revolutionary </v>

46
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>significance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's even more complex than that because</v>

47
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that women on the birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>control pill,</v>

48
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>like feminine men better than masculine </v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

49
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>So the preference actually shifts when </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own,</v>

50
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.780
<v Speaker 1>because of some hormonal change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

51
00:03:12.781 --> 00:03:13.614
<v Speaker 1>So if you track women across their </v>
<v Speaker 1>menstrual cycle when they're not on the </v>

52
00:03:16.791 --> 00:03:17.624
<v Speaker 1>tails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what you do is you show them </v>

53
00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 1>photographs of men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same manny,</v>

54
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>but all you do is vary his jaw width,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can do.</v>

55
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.713
<v Speaker 1>We're on a continuum with the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now John With is associated with </v>

56
00:03:29.931 --> 00:03:34.590
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So larger job guys have higher levels of</v>

57
00:03:34.591 --> 00:03:39.591
<v Speaker 1>testosterone and women prefer the larger</v>
<v Speaker 1>job guy when they're ovulating.</v>

58
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.063
<v Speaker 1>And the smaller John's guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're gifted from reproduction </v>

59
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.530
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

60
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.443
<v Speaker 1>and so you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women might want a monster to mate with </v>

61
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

62
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pell to raise children with.</v>

63
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.070
<v Speaker 1>And I think in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the beauty and the beast story,</v>

64
00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:02.910
<v Speaker 1>which I think is in some ways the </v>
<v Speaker 1>central female myth,</v>

65
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.223
<v Speaker 1>there's an attempt to bridge the gap </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what the woman does is find a </v>

66
00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:07.344
<v Speaker 1>monster and payment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you want your man to be tame enough </v>

67
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:12.844
<v Speaker 1>so he doesn't eat your children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you want them to be rough enough so </v>

68
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:18.540
<v Speaker 1>that your son has a fighting chance in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mating hierarchy.</v>

69
00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:19.374
<v Speaker 1>And so that you have someone tough and </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive is potentially able to </v>

70
00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:23.454
<v Speaker 1>protect you around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of sexual </v>

71
00:04:25.491 --> 00:04:26.900
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not park.</v>

72
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.250
<v Speaker 1>And now element.</v>
