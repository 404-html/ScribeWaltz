00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.203
<v Speaker 1>When my son was born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my daughter was about year and a half </v>

2
00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:06.710
<v Speaker 1>old and you can get pretty intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>sibling rivalry with,</v>

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.070
<v Speaker 1>with kids aren't separated by three </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.650
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean you should separate them by</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years,</v>

5
00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:12.484
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because the older kid is still </v>

6
00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:15.610
<v Speaker 1>pretty dependent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you got to watch that.</v>

7
00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:16.444
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing we did was we talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>to her about the new baby that was </v>

8
00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:21.700
<v Speaker 1>coming and we told her that that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be her baby,</v>

9
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as our baby.</v>

10
00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:23.914
<v Speaker 1>That's your baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we taught her to get a hug and </v>

11
00:00:26.471 --> 00:00:28.150
<v Speaker 1>we had her act that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like okay,</v>

12
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.083
<v Speaker 1>when when the new baby comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be times when your mom </v>

13
00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:34.240
<v Speaker 1>was preoccupied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to say it in a way,</v>

14
00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:36.340
<v Speaker 1>a three year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one and a half year old,</v>

15
00:00:36.341 --> 00:00:37.174
<v Speaker 1>something like that was one and a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>can understand and that means acting it </v>

16
00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:40.900
<v Speaker 1>out in playing.</v>

17
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like pretend play.</v>

18
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.293
<v Speaker 1>But the message was there'll be times </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're going to feel lonesome and </v>

19
00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:47.920
<v Speaker 1>you have to come and get a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

20
00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>so then we'd have for practices like </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's play a game,</v>

21
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.150
<v Speaker 1>pretend you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

22
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.800
<v Speaker 1>now come and get a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

23
00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'd get a hug.</v>

24
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.950
<v Speaker 1>This is better than the knife game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's better.</v>

25
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>It's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better than the knife gate.</v>

26
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Well in so okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far.</v>

27
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:05.020
<v Speaker 1>And then we had our new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our son and we helped Mckayla,</v>

28
00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:07.430
<v Speaker 1>my daughter figure out how to take care </v>
<v Speaker 1>of him and you know,</v>

29
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.300
<v Speaker 1>when he wasn't in a half year old can </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually take care of the baby.</v>

30
00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:12.820
<v Speaker 1>They can watch the baby and the baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>cries.</v>

31
00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:14.240
<v Speaker 1>They can come and tug on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.120
<v Speaker 1>say the baby needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:18.340
<v Speaker 1>whatever the baby needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then,</v>

34
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.893
<v Speaker 1>well then there's the older child also </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets a set of privileges because of </v>

35
00:01:23.381 --> 00:01:23.560
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

36
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.393
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

37
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.280
<v Speaker 1>you're older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to be an infant anymore.</v>

38
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.560
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of socks because mums with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you all the time,</v>

39
00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:31.240
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you get in exchange?</v>

40
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>You get some more freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get some more status,</v>

41
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.670
<v Speaker 1>you get some more power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a good trade off.</v>

42
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>That's why you want to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

43
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:39.024
<v Speaker 1>You want to become an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to steal that from </v>

44
00:01:40.781 --> 00:01:42.550
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still there.</v>

45
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.373
<v Speaker 1>It's that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the witch in Hansel and Gretel </v>

46
00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:50.140
<v Speaker 1>who fattens up the kids and eats them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like compared to my layer,</v>

47
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.640
<v Speaker 1>the Latin gingerbread and candy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have to do anything.</v>

48
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.410
<v Speaker 1>I'll take care of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

49
00:01:56.411 --> 00:01:58.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run away from that person.</v>
