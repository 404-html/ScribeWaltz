1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.953
<v Speaker 1>So the fundamental thing that I learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Paul Rosen is to see us as these </v>

2
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:04.644
<v Speaker 1>amazing omnivores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is part of our survival strategy </v>

3
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:08.004
<v Speaker 1>even more than other other apes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are just brilliant omnivores and we </v>

4
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:12.294
<v Speaker 1>have the Omnivore's dilemma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is we've got to be interested in </v>

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.983
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of new stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not tied to one place we can roam </v>

6
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:22.590
<v Speaker 1>onto a whole new continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were interested in stuff,</v>

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>but stuff has all kinds of toxins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>microbes.</v>

8
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:27.144
<v Speaker 1>We have to be careful about that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these motives have to be </v>

9
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:29.664
<v Speaker 1>intention and this is actually an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting way to understand the left </v>

10
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:34.500
<v Speaker 1>right difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have both motives,</v>

11
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>but if so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine two siblings,</v>

12
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>one of whom is set more towards trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>new stuff,</v>

13
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:40.824
<v Speaker 1>seeking out new stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other's a little more fearful </v>

14
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:43.201
<v Speaker 1>and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

15
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:44.034
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

16
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.260
<v Speaker 1>let's not try that.</v>

17
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.153
<v Speaker 1>That stayed with what's tried and true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's Progressive Ism and </v>

18
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.890
<v Speaker 1>conservatives and that's the origins of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

19
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at kids' behavior at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>age of two or three,</v>

20
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 1>it does predict how they'll vote much </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

21
00:00:56.011 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Not Hugely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is a clear prediction there.</v>

22
00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.760
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.193
<v Speaker 1>so disgust is part of a regulatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>system about our engagement with the </v>

24
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:08.130
<v Speaker 1>world and whether we are just sorta out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and,</v>

25
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

26
00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:10.710
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we seek out variety and diversity.</v>

27
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:11.544
<v Speaker 1>We think diversity is just a great thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>where whether we want a little more </v>

28
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.420
<v Speaker 1>order structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictability.</v>

29
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm conservatives are neater than </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive's.</v>

30
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.370
<v Speaker 1>If you take photos of their rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:24.320
<v Speaker 1>you can actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 1>cleanliness and organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can predict how they vote,</v>

34
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed.</v>

35
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.533
<v Speaker 1>It turns out what's really cool about </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust in modern politics is if you </v>

36
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:35.640
<v Speaker 1>look at all the different things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're fighting over,</v>

37
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:37.630
<v Speaker 1>especially in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our culture war is over,</v>

38
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back a few decades,</v>

39
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>

40
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:41.790
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flag,</v>

41
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.050
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these things.</v>

42
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.313
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to study with my colleagues was </v>

43
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.613
<v Speaker 1>led by Seneca Leyva in which we asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these cultural war attitudes of </v>

44
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 1>people and we also had their scores and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the discus scale.</v>

45
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>But one of the foundations of morality </v>
<v Speaker 1>is sanctity and purity.</v>

46
00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 1>And it relates to discuss what we found </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you know,</v>

47
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.780
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

48
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people's left,</v>

49
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

50
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.963
<v Speaker 1>how they place themselves in the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>rightscale you can pretty much predict </v>

51
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.233
<v Speaker 1>where they fall on most cultural war </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitudes except for those that load on </v>

52
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.760
<v Speaker 1>or implicate sanctity or purity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I mean his flag burning.</v>

53
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think,</v>

54
00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that people should have the</v>

55
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:23.700
<v Speaker 1>right to burn the American flag or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country's flag as an expression,</v>

56
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>as a political action?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think people could give some</v>

57
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 1>answer on a one to seven scale and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on the right thing?</v>

58
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.193
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more like this ain't no people in </v>

59
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

60
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.043
<v Speaker 1>People are score high on loyalty are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely to say no people lower and </v>

61
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.843
<v Speaker 1>say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's even taking account of where </v>

62
00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:42.180
<v Speaker 1>they are on the left right dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the cool thing,</v>

63
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.653
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only if you add in the purity or </v>

64
00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:48.330
<v Speaker 1>sanctity thing that you can really </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what people are doing because</v>

65
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:52.890
<v Speaker 1>some people see the flag not as just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of cloth.</v>

66
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.620
<v Speaker 1>They see it as having some innate </v>
<v Speaker 1>essence,</v>

67
00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>some something sacred about it which </v>
<v Speaker 1>must be protected.</v>

68
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.170
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

69
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>so this is true even they think of it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a unifying center.</v>

70
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

71
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>So if there's something sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the,</v>

72
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:06.124
<v Speaker 1>this is the central piece of my work </v>
<v Speaker 1>around politics and morality is the </v>

73
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>psychology of sanctity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you hold something sacred,</v>

74
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.463
<v Speaker 1>then your team's circles around it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only those who circle around with </v>

75
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>you and sometimes literally circle </v>
<v Speaker 1>around like Muslims at prayer in Mecca,</v>

76
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:24.300
<v Speaker 1>they literally circle the Kebab.</v>

77
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Circling is a very primitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient.</v>

78
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:27.034
<v Speaker 1>It feels right to circle something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even if even if you do it </v>

79
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 1>symbolically or you all bow at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time that binds you together,</v>

80
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 1>children do that with their mothers when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

81
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>when they engage in exploratory </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

82
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>right where all they use their mother as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a center of the world.</v>

83
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.643
<v Speaker 1>And children differ in the degree to </v>
<v Speaker 1>which they'll move outward from their </v>

84
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:46.400
<v Speaker 1>mothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they move out until they,</v>

85
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they trip over their,</v>

86
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 1>their uncertainty threshold a neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is it a distance?</v>

87
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a district?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

88
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.883
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the more exploratory kids who are </v>

89
00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:56.284
<v Speaker 1>lower negative emotion will go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>farther before they come back to their </v>

90
00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the mother is the center and you know</v>

91
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 1>that that would be associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolically with the idea of the center</v>

92
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:06.230
<v Speaker 1>as a motherland or potentially as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

93
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

94
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.450
<v Speaker 1>So this way that we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're incredibly symbolic creatures.</v>

95
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 1>We're not just out to make as much money</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we can.</v>

96
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:13.774
<v Speaker 1>Where's this symbolic and social </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures and this psychology of </v>

97
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>sanctity or purity has become really </v>
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

98
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.943
<v Speaker 1>not just on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always been important for </v>

99
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:23.644
<v Speaker 1>especially religious conservatives were </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to see it even on the campus </v>

100
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:27.394
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is why I think we see some of </v>

101
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:34.261
<v Speaker 1>the odd things we see on campus that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>campus must be kept as a sacred and pure</v>

102
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:35.404
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that really alarms me </v>

103
00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:38.074
<v Speaker 1>about what's happened on campus and last</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years is that the older idea </v>

104
00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 1>we had that it's a place for contesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

105
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a zone of enormous choice.</v>

106
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 1>People can take what courses they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say what they want.</v>

107
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a wonderful free for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some with norms of respect.</v>

108
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.773
<v Speaker 1>It's now becoming much more of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious zone where the perimeter of </v>

109
00:04:58.451 --> 00:05:02.940
<v Speaker 1>the campus is the boundaries and within </v>
<v Speaker 1>it they're almost there.</v>

110
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Blasphemy laws basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really started noticing this.</v>

111
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:08.740
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the videos of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Middlebury,</v>

112
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.570
<v Speaker 1>a protest when Charles Murray spoke at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Middlebury and as everybody knows,</v>

113
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.553
<v Speaker 1>he was shouted down so the students are </v>
<v Speaker 1>chanting and they're chanting in unison </v>

114
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.633
<v Speaker 1>and it seems like a religious revival </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting and they're swaying and they're </v>

115
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 1>saying they're sacred in a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexist,</v>

116
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>antigay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles Murray go away.</v>

117
00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:28.144
<v Speaker 1>It's like a ritual incantation so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the space as safe and it's safe and </v>

118
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.900
<v Speaker 1>not maternal way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>

119
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.270
<v Speaker 1>So far all this happening is they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>binding together.</v>

120
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:38.104
<v Speaker 1>They're moving and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>synchronous movement and call and </v>

121
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:40.714
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's using a lot of tropes from </v>

122
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:45.160
<v Speaker 1>religion and religious worship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the cool thing.</v>

123
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.800
<v Speaker 1>When the administrator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget who it is,</v>

124
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.560
<v Speaker 1>comes on to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

125
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.110
<v Speaker 1>we have moved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're moving the talk,</v>

126
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.993
<v Speaker 1>and then you hear a couple people </v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming up off campus off campus and </v>

127
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>he says to another location on campus </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's like,</v>

128
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

129
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.110
<v Speaker 1>because no one had to go to this talk so</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone could have just stayed home and</v>

130
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:13.184
<v Speaker 1>the students didn't succeed in shutting </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the venues so they could have </v>

131
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 1>declared victory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a full victory unless he is</v>

132
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 1>physically off the campus.</v>

133
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 1>We can't have him speaking on campus </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that defiles us.</v>

134
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.760
<v Speaker 1>That pollutes us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We must shut that down.</v>

135
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's where I started saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

136
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:33.950
<v Speaker 1>this is like full blown psychology of </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

137
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Durkheim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sanctity,</v>

138
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:36.640
<v Speaker 1>purity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blast for me.</v>

139
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that I think,</v>

140
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.343
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't describe most students </v>

141
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:42.200
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that describes this sort of the core,</v>

142
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 1>those who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who really have their identities wrapped</v>

143
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:46.130
<v Speaker 1>up in this movie.</v>

144
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

145
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.900
<v Speaker 2>so we discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to,</v>

146
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to ask you a couple of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

147
00:06:51.481 --> 00:06:52.314
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big five research into political </v>

148
00:06:55.261 --> 00:06:58.440
<v Speaker 2>differences basically shows that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals are high in trait,</v>

149
00:06:58.441 --> 00:07:02.160
<v Speaker 2>openness and low in conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the conservatives or the reverse,</v>

150
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.220
<v Speaker 2>but we fragmented conscientiousness into</v>
<v Speaker 2>orderliness and industriousness with the</v>

151
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:11.700
<v Speaker 2>big five aspect scale and orderliness is</v>
<v Speaker 2>strongly associated with disgust.</v>

152
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.160
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

153
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

154
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:15.601
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

155
00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:16.434
<v Speaker 2>It does sound a lot like Freud but it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it also isn't accordance with your </v>

156
00:07:19.411 --> 00:07:21.960
<v Speaker 2>observations that conservatives have </v>
<v Speaker 2>neater spaces,</v>

157
00:07:21.961 --> 00:07:22.890
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

158
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.020
<v Speaker 2>so now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're meeting start on time.</v>

159
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

160
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.910
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

161
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.983
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

162
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:29.483
<v Speaker 2>so then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nexus for political belief seems to </v>

163
00:07:31.771 --> 00:07:32.604
<v Speaker 2>be openness so that that exploratory </v>
<v Speaker 2>tendency that you talked about </v>

164
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:41.660
<v Speaker 2>exploration of ideas and creativity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>low orderliness and so then I thought,</v>

165
00:07:42.271 --> 00:07:43.104
<v Speaker 2>well why in the world would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would the political nexus go across </v>

166
00:07:45.991 --> 00:07:48.810
<v Speaker 2>those dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are some relatively uncorrelated.</v>

167
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.020
<v Speaker 2>Then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is in keeping with your work on</v>

168
00:07:52.021 --> 00:07:54.810
<v Speaker 2>discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it's an issue of borders,</v>

169
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.673
<v Speaker 2>which of course seems more or less self </v>
<v Speaker 2>evident in the wake of trump's election </v>

170
00:07:58.471 --> 00:08:01.680
<v Speaker 2>when he talked about borders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you might say,</v>

171
00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:02.514
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the conservative is someone who </v>

172
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:06.683
<v Speaker 2>wants the borders between categories to </v>
<v Speaker 2>remain intact no matter what level of </v>

173
00:08:10.381 --> 00:08:11.214
<v Speaker 2>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's borders from the highest </v>

174
00:08:13.981 --> 00:08:14.814
<v Speaker 2>resolution level of cognition all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way up to the actual physical borders </v>

175
00:08:17.851 --> 00:08:18.550
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

176
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.460
<v Speaker 2>of rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>towns,</v>

177
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.260
<v Speaker 2>states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>

178
00:08:22.261 --> 00:08:25.410
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the borders should be thicker and the</v>

179
00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:26.970
<v Speaker 2>reason they want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

180
00:08:26.971 --> 00:08:29.760
<v Speaker 2>there was a paper published in Plos one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you saw it,</v>

181
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.040
<v Speaker 2>it was a couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a mind boggling paper.</v>

182
00:08:32.041 --> 00:08:34.620
<v Speaker 2>It should have been front page news as </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as I was concerned.</v>

183
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:35.963
<v Speaker 2>And what the researchers did was between</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries and then within provinces or </v>

184
00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:44.010
<v Speaker 2>states within countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they correlated the level of,</v>

185
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.793
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of frequency of infectious disease with </v>

186
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.310
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian political beliefs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>found a walloping correlation.</v>

187
00:08:54.311 --> 00:08:56.710
<v Speaker 2>It was like point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was one of the highest by the,</v>

188
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.241
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

189
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:58.074
<v Speaker 2>for those of you who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social scientists never discover </v>

190
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 2>anything that's associated with anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>else at a correlation of point six other</v>

191
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Speaker 2>than heritability other than </v>
<v Speaker 2>heritability.</v>

192
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:06.894
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what they found was that the </v>

193
00:09:08.101 --> 00:09:10.230
<v Speaker 2>higher the prevalence of infectious </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>

194
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:11.064
<v Speaker 2>the higher the probability of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of totalitarian authoritarian political </v>

195
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:15.414
<v Speaker 2>attitudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they controlled for governance </v>

196
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.023
<v Speaker 2>because one of the questions was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was this pop down authoritarianism or </v>

197
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:22.104
<v Speaker 2>bottom up authoritarianism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer was that it was bottom </v>

198
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:24.960
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

199
00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:25.794
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought about that in two from </v>
<v Speaker 2>two perspectives simultaneously at the </v>

200
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:32.514
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

201
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we identified disgust,</v>

202
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:37.590
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity with orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so say a fundamental sub trait.</v>

203
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Then I was reading this book that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>called Hitler's table talk,</v>

204
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:43.403
<v Speaker 2>and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the recordings of virtually </v>

205
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:49.050
<v Speaker 2>everything he said at dinner from 1939 </v>
<v Speaker 2>to 1942.</v>

206
00:09:49.051 --> 00:09:51.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a spontaneous utterance say,</v>

207
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.343
<v Speaker 2>and it's full of discussions about Jews </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Gypsies and all the people he </v>

208
00:09:58.081 --> 00:10:00.150
<v Speaker 2>tormented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's really interesting is all the</v>

209
00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:02.910
<v Speaker 2>language is discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not feared.</v>

210
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.240
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Hitler is basic metaphor was that the</v>

211
00:10:06.241 --> 00:10:09.540
<v Speaker 2>area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>race and country was a pure body.</v>

212
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.480
<v Speaker 2>And then it was assaulted by parasites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

213
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:13.314
<v Speaker 2>And then I remembered what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the native Americans when the Europeans </v>

214
00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:16.674
<v Speaker 2>showed up and shook hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened was that 95 percent of </v>

215
00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:21.090
<v Speaker 2>them are dead within 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

216
00:10:21.091 --> 00:10:21.924
<v Speaker 2>Because of smallpox and measles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that that border issue that </v>

217
00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:29.550
<v Speaker 2>separates conservatives from liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

218
00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:34.200
<v Speaker 2>is the conservative say the novel is </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially contaminated.</v>

219
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.510
<v Speaker 2>It's not so much that it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's different.</v>

220
00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.130
<v Speaker 2>That's fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's contaminated.</v>

221
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.930
<v Speaker 2>And the Liberals say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on a minute.</v>

222
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.410
<v Speaker 2>If you make the borders too thick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then information can't pass through.</v>

223
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.393
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the Omnivore's dilemma right </v>

224
00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:46.570
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

225
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.453
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then since we have a biological </v>

226
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.380
<v Speaker 2>architecture on which are cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>platforms are erected,</v>

227
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.040
<v Speaker 2>we have the same attitude towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstract information,</v>

228
00:10:56.041 --> 00:10:59.660
<v Speaker 2>which would be ideas that we do to </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like food or,</v>

229
00:10:59.661 --> 00:11:01.140
<v Speaker 2>or illness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

230
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.003
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we can think of an invading idea </v>

231
00:11:03.421 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 2>or a polluting idea or contaminating </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

232
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

233
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.223
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm a big fan of George lakoff </v>

234
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.350
<v Speaker 1>metaphors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live by that.</v>

235
00:11:10.351 --> 00:11:11.184
<v Speaker 1>We yet we use our bodily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our bodily Schema data to think about </v>

236
00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:15.654
<v Speaker 1>abstract things like politics and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what our policies should be about </v>

237
00:11:18.421 --> 00:11:19.900
<v Speaker 1>borders and immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

238
00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.630
<v Speaker 1>there's a Canadian psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mark shaller.</v>

239
00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:24.750
<v Speaker 1>He and his colleagues have developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they call an account over these,</v>

240
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:26.720
<v Speaker 1>the behavioral immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

241
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:28.480
<v Speaker 1>That we don't just try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

242
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.890
<v Speaker 1>microbes killed probably many more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our ancestors.</v>

243
00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Dan Did Lions and tigers and bears and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so whoever can keep themselves and their</v>

244
00:11:36.751 --> 00:11:39.780
<v Speaker 1>children from being exposed to fatal </v>
<v Speaker 1>illnesses,</v>

245
00:11:39.781 --> 00:11:40.614
<v Speaker 1>winds the evolutionary game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of that is judging </v>

246
00:11:43.111 --> 00:11:44.880
<v Speaker 1>carefully about people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he dangerous,</v>

247
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.430
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's both for sexuality,</v>

248
00:11:47.431 --> 00:11:49.770
<v Speaker 1>for contact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all kinds of association.</v>

249
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:50.791
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

250
00:11:50.791 --> 00:11:54.730
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of ways our emotions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodily interactions structure,</v>

251
00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:57.540
<v Speaker 1>how we think and feel about about </v>
<v Speaker 1>social.</v>

252
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.750
<v Speaker 2>Well even with the black death in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe,</v>

253
00:11:59.751 --> 00:12:00.584
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the black death occurred in Europe </v>

254
00:12:02.301 --> 00:12:03.134
<v Speaker 2>when the Europeans started to move </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world and they brought back </v>

255
00:12:04.911 --> 00:12:06.800
<v Speaker 2>rats that were infected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

256
00:12:06.801 --> 00:12:07.634
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what you saw there was both of those </v>

257
00:12:08.751 --> 00:12:09.584
<v Speaker 2>forces at work at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the European expansion produced a </v>

258
00:12:12.471 --> 00:12:15.680
<v Speaker 2>tremendous interchange of ideas from all</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world.</v>

259
00:12:15.681 --> 00:12:16.514
<v Speaker 2>That's globalization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wiped out somewhere between 30 </v>

260
00:12:18.411 --> 00:12:20.840
<v Speaker 2>and 60 percent of the population at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>

261
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.010
<v Speaker 2>So wouldn't it</v>

262
00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.500
<v Speaker 1>be good if in every society or every </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>

263
00:12:24.501 --> 00:12:29.360
<v Speaker 1>and we had some people who specialized </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a specialized insane,</v>

264
00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.830
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the opportunities?</v>

265
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.720
<v Speaker 1>And then we had other people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>specialize in saying,</v>

266
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:33.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what are the risks?</v>

267
00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.053
<v Speaker 1>And it just so happens that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have trouble doing all that in </v>

268
00:12:37.701 --> 00:12:38.534
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we have systems that are well </v>

269
00:12:39.921 --> 00:12:40.754
<v Speaker 1>constituted with people who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>different personalities and different </v>

270
00:12:43.071 --> 00:12:45.320
<v Speaker 1>motives and goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually can get better outcomes.</v>

271
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:46.760
<v Speaker 1>We can have a discussion between them.</v>
