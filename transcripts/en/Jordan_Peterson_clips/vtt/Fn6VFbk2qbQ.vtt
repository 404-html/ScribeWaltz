<v Speaker 1>Dr peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm considering going into the education</v>

2
00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:03.744
<v Speaker 1>stream slash system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any advice for me not to </v>

3
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>become a mouthpiece for indoctrinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>young students?</v>

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.443
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing I would recommend is that you </v>

5
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>don't write essays that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in.</v>

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.883
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a sin to use your words </v>

7
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.323
<v Speaker 1>falsely and the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a good series of social </v>

8
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:31.020
<v Speaker 1>psychology experiments that show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like imagine that you bring someone into</v>

9
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:31.854
<v Speaker 1>a lab and you have them write an essay </v>
<v Speaker 1>about or fill out a questionnaire about </v>

10
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:37.410
<v Speaker 1>their political opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

11
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 1>so you get a baseline measure of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>political stance and then you asked them</v>

12
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>to write a thousand words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they identify as,</v>

13
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:44.844
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.833
<v Speaker 1>and then you get them to write a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand word essay on why a particular </v>

15
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:53.271
<v Speaker 1>left wing position is true and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have them come back in two weeks and you</v>

16
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:55.430
<v Speaker 1>give them the same political belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire.</v>

17
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.283
<v Speaker 1>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll have shifted quite radically </v>

18
00:00:58.021 --> 00:00:58.854
<v Speaker 1>towards the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that people </v>

19
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>don't think through their positions in </v>
<v Speaker 1>great detail.</v>

20
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>And so if you get them to think through </v>
<v Speaker 1>a contrary position in great detail.</v>
