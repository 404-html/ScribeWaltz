1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>People often talk about the whole cost </v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the relationship between the</v>

2
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Jews and the Germans are between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews and the Nazis was obviously playing</v>

3
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:10.074
<v Speaker 1>the part of victims and the Nazis often </v>
<v Speaker 1>for always playing the part of the </v>

4
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.503
<v Speaker 1>perpetrators and of course this has </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely comprehensible from the </v>

5
00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:16.164
<v Speaker 1>historical point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also strikes me that if what we </v>

6
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:19.464
<v Speaker 1>remember is that the Nazis killed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews that were already on the road to </v>

7
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.200
<v Speaker 1>making a mistake that similar to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake that was,</v>

8
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.830
<v Speaker 1>it was made that led to the Holocaust to</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with,</v>

9
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:29.664
<v Speaker 1>which is to identify characteristics </v>
<v Speaker 1>that lead to patterns of action of that </v>

10
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>sort as characteristics of groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>identifiable groups.</v>

11
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

12
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to equate the role of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews and the Nazis and the Holocaust.</v>

13
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:44.184
<v Speaker 1>I would obviously be observed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm trying to second into the </v>

14
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me to be.</v>

15
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you consider that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>propensity for whole costs like,</v>

16
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>events is deeply rooted in human nature.</v>

17
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 1>The lesson to draw from the events of </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War II,</v>

18
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>that's what human beings are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing what the Nazis were like because</v>

19
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>these sorts of events happen all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

20
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's obviously the case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are.</v>

21
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>There are well in the 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone,</v>

22
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>English and benefit the concentration </v>
<v Speaker 1>camp in South Africa,</v>

23
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.573
<v Speaker 1>Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her fact that Chinese used to great </v>

24
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:18.684
<v Speaker 1>advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so an s an estimated also show this on </v>

25
00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:21.324
<v Speaker 1>the next slide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>66 million people in the Soviet Union </v>

26
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 1>were killed as a consequence of internal</v>
<v Speaker 1>repression,</v>

27
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.893
<v Speaker 1>many of whom went through camp like </v>
<v Speaker 1>procedures on their road to their </v>

28
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 1>demise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see ethnic cleansing occurring in places</v>

29
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>like Rwanda and even once again in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe and the Balkans,</v>

30
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.653
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was that we were supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn from the events of the Second </v>

31
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.183
<v Speaker 1>World War hasn't been learned nor being </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembered because you can't remember </v>

32
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:49.740
<v Speaker 1>what you don't understand and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what this course is about.</v>

33
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.440
<v Speaker 1>I've been working for since 1985,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the on trying to figure out what</v>

34
00:01:56.101 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 1>it is about people remember hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

35
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.373
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she's a famous political </v>

36
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 1>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a student of Martin heidegger.</v>

37
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:07.770
<v Speaker 1>She wrote a book called the banality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>

38
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 1>and one of her points was that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

39
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.990
<v Speaker 1>she was talking about the Nazis in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

40
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 1>people who perpetrate events like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you meet them when you talk to them,</v>

41
00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:18.144
<v Speaker 1>if you have encountered with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's often striking about </v>

42
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>them is not their striking abnormality </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the resident evil,</v>

43
00:02:24.031 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that they're very much like</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people that you might've met,</v>

44
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>which was supposed to be surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So surprising.</v>

45
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:32.820
<v Speaker 1>When you think about how thoroughly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

46
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.663
<v Speaker 1>the Nazi movement dominated the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>Punch with a sort of likewise with </v>

47
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.074
<v Speaker 1>communism in the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those ideological movements </v>

48
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:40.704
<v Speaker 1>characterized people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized some strange sort of </v>

49
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.963
<v Speaker 1>misfits whose consciousness was </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by something in </v>

50
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:50.124
<v Speaker 1>comprehensible that led them to perform </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of actions that we are </v>

51
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>theoretically supposed to remember.</v>

52
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.463
<v Speaker 1>My perspective on all the assistant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact people are capable of </v>

53
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>perpetrating atrocities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>light those characterize.</v>

54
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>The whole foster says something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>why people are like,</v>

55
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.443
<v Speaker 1>what everybody's like because it strikes</v>
<v Speaker 1>me that that kind of tendency is </v>

56
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>something that's deeply rooted in human </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature and then to say that,</v>

57
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.483
<v Speaker 1>but what was it about the Nazis or what </v>
<v Speaker 1>was it about the Soviet communists that </v>

58
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.503
<v Speaker 1>lend them to participate in this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior is completely decided to point </v>

59
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that does is you're looking for some</v>

60
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>sort of group characteristic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's devoid.</v>

61
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 1>You don't have any personal relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that group.</v>

62
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>The problem is instantly made abstract </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as far as I'm concerned,</v>

63
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>if it's abstract open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>

64
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.250
<v Speaker 1>nothing is remember now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I want to do is to try.</v>

65
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 1>I want to outline the reasons why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like the Holocaust,</v>

66
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.373
<v Speaker 1>what it is about us that make us so </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with protecting art group </v>

67
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 1>identities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what those identities mean,</v>

68
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 1>what role they play in the regulation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

69
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.440
<v Speaker 1>That's the critical thing right there </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>

70
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Etiologies are art are the expression in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sense,</v>

71
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>the verbal expression of the internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that regulate our emotions.</v>

72
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 1>When you mess around with someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies,</v>

73
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.953
<v Speaker 1>therefore as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're messing around with the </v>

74
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>inhibitory structure that regulates the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interplay between their emotions.</v>

75
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.673
<v Speaker 1>Whatever your identity is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plays some role in regulating your </v>

76
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:29.281
<v Speaker 1>emotional nature and your physiology </v>
<v Speaker 1>because your thoughts are embodied.</v>

77
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 1>They're part of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a part of your brain.</v>

78
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.703
<v Speaker 1>You want to get right down to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have belief systems and they'll </v>

79
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 1>do anything to protect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I find that peculiar.</v>

80
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Speaker 1>What is so important about belief system</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would lead people to do things,</v>

81
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 1>normal people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

82
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.893
<v Speaker 1>to commit acts that under normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances would would be conceived </v>

83
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:54.220
<v Speaker 1>of as incomprehensible even by those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

84
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.960
<v Speaker 1>So I also hoped to make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

85
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.050
<v Speaker 1>I want to make the lessons here </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally.</v>

86
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.093
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested in discussing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue from the abstract perspective </v>

87
00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:09.064
<v Speaker 1>because I don't think that an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an issue of this magnitude deserves to </v>

88
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 1>be discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Data at an abstract level.</v>

89
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not an abstract problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something.</v>

90
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.433
<v Speaker 1>There's something peculiar about us that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to learn to control because as </v>

91
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're technologically powerful to remain</v>

92
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>at the whims of the uncomprehending </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of our nature.</v>
