1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well so you've got this room and it's a </v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.713
<v Speaker 1>place that you can operate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's actually a little bit of the </v>

3
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:08.400
<v Speaker 1>cosmos that's under your control and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

4
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.181
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:10.620
<v Speaker 1>it's only a room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so who cares,</v>

6
00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:11.454
<v Speaker 1>but that's the wrong attitude because </v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what you can do in your </v>

7
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:15.564
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No orange may God only knows what you </v>

8
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 1>will do in your room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe only nightmares I have about knock</v>

9
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.270
<v Speaker 1>her in his room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>but so first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to set your room up properly,</v>

11
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 1>you have to know what you're going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there and that means that you have to</v>

12
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:30.294
<v Speaker 1>know what you're going to do and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means you have to know what you should </v>

13
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:33.174
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of setting up your room is </v>

14
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:35.094
<v Speaker 1>figuring out what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's hard because your room </v>

15
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>should serve your purposes and if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you have purposes,</v>

16
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:42.474
<v Speaker 1>then you don't know what purpose the </v>
<v Speaker 1>room should serve and you can't set it </v>

17
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>up and then so the room should.</v>

18
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>The room should invite you to be the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be.</v>

19
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:51.324
<v Speaker 1>When you're in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you envision yourself the way you </v>

20
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>would like yourself to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you should build the room.</v>

21
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:57.384
<v Speaker 1>So it's the stage where that drama can </v>
<v Speaker 1>take place and then if you try to make </v>

22
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>the room beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will also teach you,</v>

23
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>that will also improve your taste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Because maybe you have to buy a painting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you have to learn something about</v>

25
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>art and you have to paint it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to learn something about color.</v>

26
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>harmony and form and then you know,</v>

27
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:17.851
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:18.684
<v Speaker 1>you're learning something about how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulate yourself physically and </v>

29
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:22.584
<v Speaker 1>psychologically and you're setting up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the room so that that's going to be an </v>

30
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.570
<v Speaker 1>easy something that you can do without </v>
<v Speaker 1>undue complexity every day.</v>

31
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that can be phenomenally useful,</v>

32
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:33.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it,</v>

33
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.953
<v Speaker 1>let's say that that adjusts the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you act half an hour every day just for </v>

34
00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:38.461
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

35
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:43.440
<v Speaker 1>so that's about three hours a week and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about 150 hours a year.</v>

36
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.863
<v Speaker 1>And so that's about three weeks worth of</v>
<v Speaker 1>work weeks per year that you've changed </v>

37
00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>in your life just by attending to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammock.</v>

38
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.333
<v Speaker 1>And you want to get that exactly right </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you actually need some rest and </v>

39
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:56.244
<v Speaker 1>you need to be creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this idea of getting your room </v>

40
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:01.830
<v Speaker 1>sorted out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which people are,</v>

41
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

42
00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>they're having a lot of fun with and </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing out about a lot.</v>

43
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:06.684
<v Speaker 1>It's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll give you a little Christian </v>

44
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:11.430
<v Speaker 1>interpretation about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

45
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.593
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says in the New Testament that the </v>

46
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Kingdom of God is like a mustard seed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course a mustard seed is very,</v>

47
00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:19.440
<v Speaker 1>very small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very small.</v>

48
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:20.523
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will build itself given the proper </v>

49
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>circumstances into quite a magnificent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and complex,</v>

50
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>fully developed plant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost a tree.</v>

51
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>And so when you make your room perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a mustard seed,</v>

52
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:34.740
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's equivalent to heaven,</v>

53
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.200
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're doing is you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

54
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:38.034
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're doing is you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>building a little microcosm of the </v>

55
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Kingdom of God on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

56
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>that will have agreed to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>

57
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 1>That will have power.</v>
