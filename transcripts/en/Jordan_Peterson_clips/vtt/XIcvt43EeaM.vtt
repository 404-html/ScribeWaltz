1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well a few tyrannized people badly </v>

2
00:00:02.291 --> 00:00:04.330
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll actually hurt themselves to hurt</v>

3
00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:05.164
<v Speaker 1>you so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're willing to take a willing to </v>

4
00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:11.170
<v Speaker 1>take a hit to reclaim justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

5
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.180
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really worth knowing.</v>

6
00:00:13.181 --> 00:00:17.020
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that John </v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget pointed out and because he was,</v>

7
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.213
<v Speaker 1>he's a very interesting psychologist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's never taught properly because you </v>

8
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:24.024
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of these great thinkers were very </v>

9
00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:26.314
<v Speaker 1>strange people and the strangeness Gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>Edited Out of their stories and it's </v>

10
00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:30.154
<v Speaker 1>really too bad because they're way more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting when you know how strange </v>

11
00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:33.124
<v Speaker 1>they were and so piaget was obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the disjunction between religion </v>

12
00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:42.421
<v Speaker 1>and science and his goal as a thinker </v>
<v Speaker 1>was to reconcile the two.</v>

13
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.720
<v Speaker 1>And so to some degree he was looking for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a biological basis of morality.</v>

14
00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:47.554
<v Speaker 1>That might be one way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it or at least to reconcile the idea of </v>

15
00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:52.480
<v Speaker 1>a biological substrate with an emergent </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality.</v>

16
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.430
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things he said is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

17
00:00:54.431 --> 00:00:56.620
<v Speaker 1>imagine two systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

18
00:00:56.621 --> 00:00:59.650
<v Speaker 1>so both systems are moving towards a </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>

19
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.543
<v Speaker 1>any old arbitrary goal and in one system</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the people within it are acting </v>

20
00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:06.754
<v Speaker 1>under compulsion and in the other system</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people within it are acting </v>

21
00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:11.134
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily said the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>acting voluntarily will defeat the </v>

22
00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:17.980
<v Speaker 1>people acting under compulsion because </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to use compulsion,</v>

23
00:01:17.981 --> 00:01:18.814
<v Speaker 1>you have to spend a fair bit of time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy on force and so it makes you </v>

24
00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:25.264
<v Speaker 1>inefficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if everybody is together on the </v>

25
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:29.170
<v Speaker 1>project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they'll.</v>

26
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.820
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to spend any time on </v>
<v Speaker 1>compulsion because people are compelling</v>

27
00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:37.090
<v Speaker 1>themselves and so that's what he called </v>
<v Speaker 1>an equilibrium state.</v>

28
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.190
<v Speaker 1>So in equilibrium state was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

29
00:01:39.191 --> 00:01:42.700
<v Speaker 1>we sit down and we have a negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real negotiation.</v>

30
00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:45.070
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be honest and we say,</v>

31
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what the hell are we doing?</v>

32
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.123
<v Speaker 1>And everyone hash that out and we decide</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing and then we decide how </v>

33
00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:56.470
<v Speaker 1>that would be good for all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but each of us singularly as well.</v>

34
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.810
<v Speaker 1>So if you've got your family put </v>
<v Speaker 1>together property,</v>

35
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.003
<v Speaker 1>then the whole family moves together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody inside moves ahead as </v>

36
00:02:03.011 --> 00:02:03.844
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then everybody's pushing in the </v>

37
00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:06.281
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:07.114
<v Speaker 1>you know how it is in a negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually want your interests to </v>

39
00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:11.314
<v Speaker 1>align with the interests of the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>person because then you don't have to </v>

40
00:02:13.571 --> 00:02:14.404
<v Speaker 1>worry about the integrity of the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everybody has reasons to keep </v>

41
00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:19.900
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep it thriving,</v>

42
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:20.734
<v Speaker 1>and the idea that capitalism in somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>is somehow is predicated on the tyranny </v>

43
00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:26.284
<v Speaker 1>of the people at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the pinnacle that happens when it </v>

44
00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:29.614
<v Speaker 1>gets corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't happen at all when it's </v>

45
00:02:31.241 --> 00:02:36.241
<v Speaker 1>working properly because deals that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't based on mutual self interest and</v>

46
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:38.134
<v Speaker 1>group interests simultaneously have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be enforced usually with lawyers and </v>

47
00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:42.520
<v Speaker 1>then you're done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.930
<v Speaker 1>You're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that point.</v>
