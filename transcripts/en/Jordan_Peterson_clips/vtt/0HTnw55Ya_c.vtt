1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is always something I've been </v>

2
00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:02.970
<v Speaker 1>interested for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I've,</v>

3
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've wanted to enrich myself with.</v>

4
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.450
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

5
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.320
<v Speaker 1>you're a busy guy as far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do speaking engagements,</v>

6
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you operate a youtube channel.</v>

7
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Presumably you're a voracious reader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw you on the couch.</v>

8
00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:15.414
<v Speaker 1>He had a book open yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a moment you're reading and you're </v>

9
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>a prolific tweeter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tweet a lot.</v>

10
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.310
<v Speaker 1>So my question is how do you tweak your </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach?</v>

11
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 1>How do you organize your time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you remain focused and productive</v>

12
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 1>in the face of insurmountable at work </v>
<v Speaker 1>lists?</v>

13
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Schedules and I have help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean my wife in particular in the last</v>

14
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.353
<v Speaker 1>year has been unbelievably helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's become a full time job for </v>

15
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>her really helping me manage my schedule</v>
<v Speaker 1>and keep me on track.</v>

16
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of it is like I get up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>

17
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I have like everything scheduled.</v>

18
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.560
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what I'm supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a hierarchy of,</v>

19
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.563
<v Speaker 1>of law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of priority and I'm really operating on </v>

20
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>a day to day level right now because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things to do.</v>

21
00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>I can't look more than about a day or </v>
<v Speaker 1>two ahead,</v>

22
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.990
<v Speaker 1>although it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

23
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.053
<v Speaker 1>it's basically scheduled now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I learned to discipline myself when </v>

24
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>I was in graduate school when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>

25
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.153
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a book called maps of meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was published in 1999 and I've </v>

26
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:15.270
<v Speaker 1>worked for that on that for about 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

27
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.133
<v Speaker 1>about three hours a day and I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of grabbed myself by the scruff of </v>

28
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>the neck and forced myself to learn how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to concentrate without,</v>

29
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.650
<v Speaker 1>without deviation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>

30
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you focus that intensely?</v>

31
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often have trouble,</v>

32
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:35.180
<v Speaker 1>like I get overwhelmed sometimes when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of work and the,</v>

33
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.053
<v Speaker 1>the worst feeling is like when I feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have a ton of work and I do work </v>

34
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:40.404
<v Speaker 1>all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still feel like I didn't get </v>

35
00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:42.774
<v Speaker 1>anything done.</v>

36
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 1>But all the time you probably did </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably conscientious person.</v>

38
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.573
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what exactly that </v>

39
00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

40
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another thing we could mention</v>

41
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:56.424
<v Speaker 1>briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a website called understand </v>

42
00:01:58.681 --> 00:01:59.514
<v Speaker 1>myself.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I set up a coupon code for your </v>

43
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.980
<v Speaker 1>viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's h three,</v>

44
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 1>h three o what's the understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.com.</v>

45
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.223
<v Speaker 1>And you can go there and take a </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality test that was devised in my </v>

46
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:13.404
<v Speaker 1>lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main researcher was Dr Colin de </v>

47
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Young who is now a professor at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Minnesota,</v>

48
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>but we took the standard big five trait </v>
<v Speaker 1>model,</v>

49
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:24.120
<v Speaker 1>which is the standard modern personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>

50
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.073
<v Speaker 1>So that's extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a positive emotion dimension </v>

51
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 1>and extroverted people are enthusiastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and assertive.</v>

52
00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>So you're both enthusiastic year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really assertive.</v>

53
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:35.390
<v Speaker 1>That would be my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can be.</v>

54
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

55
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Well you wouldn't be doing this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

56
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll put an extra shirt.</v>

57
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.170
<v Speaker 1>So because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

58
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.020
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

59
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.480
<v Speaker 1>you're verbally fluent and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

60
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.410
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to engage in that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

61
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a positive emotion dimension.</v>

62
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:52.380
<v Speaker 1>It's associated with the positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion that you feel when you're moving</v>

63
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:54.940
<v Speaker 1>towards desired things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

64
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.530
<v Speaker 1>and the next dimension is sometimes it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>called neuroticism,</v>

65
00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:01.170
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes negative emotionality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>people who are high in neuroticism are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have some anticipatory anxiety.</v>

67
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:09.454
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have anticipatory anxiety if you're </v>

69
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:11.284
<v Speaker 1>worried about going somewhere and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>really bugs you and then you get there </v>

70
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 1>and like 20 minutes later you're calm </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's okay.</v>

71
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Big Time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big time.</v>
