1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I already have trouble regulating my </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

2
00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:03.864
<v Speaker 1>I have a suspicion it's to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that I'm 90 percentile and </v>

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.313
<v Speaker 1>openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and neuroticism and </v>

4
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>second percentile in agreeableness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion.</v>

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Any tips on dealing with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:16.734
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're really high in openness and </v>

7
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:23.220
<v Speaker 1>you're really high in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be a rough combination.</v>

8
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>The conscientiousness should actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>help without,</v>

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 1>although it might make you a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectionistic.</v>

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.633
<v Speaker 1>The problem with being high in openness </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is creativity and interest in </v>

11
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:33.384
<v Speaker 1>ideas and high in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is tendency towards anxiety and </v>

12
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:37.314
<v Speaker 1>emotional pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that like open people like to break </v>

13
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:40.704
<v Speaker 1>open boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual boxes and see what's inside </v>

14
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:44.094
<v Speaker 1>like Pandora's box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people are high in neuroticism or </v>

15
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.800
<v Speaker 1>are more likely to respond negatively to</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity and uncertainty and if you're</v>

16
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:53.394
<v Speaker 1>an open person and you're always </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking up new things you you tend to </v>

17
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.373
<v Speaker 1>saw off the branch that you're sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>on on a regular basis and that can be </v>

18
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>pretty destabilizing.</v>

19
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Any tips on dealing with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

20
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.523
<v Speaker 1>I would repeat what I said earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that one of the things that you </v>

21
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:15.561
<v Speaker 1>do if you're high in anxiety is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stabilize your sleep wake cycles,</v>

22
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.183
<v Speaker 1>so get up at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to bed at the same time and eat at </v>

23
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:20.814
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure that you eat breakfast and a </v>

24
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:23.544
<v Speaker 1>big breakfast too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's heavy on fat and protein because </v>

25
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>if you're hungry and then you stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

26
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>

27
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:32.904
<v Speaker 1>you destabilize your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your insulin production system and it </v>

28
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:38.060
<v Speaker 1>will restabilize till you go to sleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

29
00:01:38.061 --> 00:01:38.894
<v Speaker 1>So I would say like two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is have a big breakfast and then </v>

30
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>also if you're feeling particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious,</v>

31
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:46.854
<v Speaker 1>try eating something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not carbohydrates and see if that helps </v>

32
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.023
<v Speaker 1>because you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be somewhat permanently </v>

33
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>dysregulated in your insulin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress-related insulin production.</v>

34
00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.273
<v Speaker 1>That would be worth trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would also say that you should shield </v>

35
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:06.771
<v Speaker 1>yourself to some degree from news </v>
<v Speaker 1>sources and sources of bad news,</v>

36
00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:12.021
<v Speaker 1>especially catastrophic news because </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of it isn't news.</v>

37
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>It's the repetition of things that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>already know full well,</v>

38
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:15.744
<v Speaker 1>and there's reason to protect yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>from an onslaught of negative </v>

39
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:20.874
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's not really </v>

40
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>necessary for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

41
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should bury your head </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sand,</v>

42
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>but constant exposure to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes of the world,</v>

43
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.753
<v Speaker 1>especially when there's nothing that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do about those catastrophes even </v>

44
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is something that can really destabilize</v>

45
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:39.084
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often tell people in my clinical </v>

46
00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:41.710
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

47
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 1>which isn't operating right now by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

48
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.913
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to shield themselves from news reports </v>

49
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>because it's just too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're depressed and anxious,</v>

50
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:53.280
<v Speaker 1>it's just not something that you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not helpful to you.</v>

51
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Second percentile in agreeableness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion.</v>

52
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.493
<v Speaker 1>Well know one of the things that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>do if you're that low in agreeableness </v>

53
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>that shouldn't disregulate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>

54
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:06.274
<v Speaker 1>but it might interfere with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships with other people you </v>

55
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you might be a little bit harder</v>

56
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:12.394
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might take other people's feelings </v>

57
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>into consideration less than might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>

58
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>low in agreeableness can do is to try to</v>

59
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>think of things they could do for other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and make that a practice.</v>

60
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.883
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe once a week you could </v>

61
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 1>consciously do someone a favor or give </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone a gift,</v>

62
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And practice being,</v>

63
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>

64
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>compassionate and polite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>that'll expand your personality rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than transforming it.</v>

66
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 1>So then maybe you could have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantages of being disagreeable,</v>

67
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>which means you're tough minded and </v>
<v Speaker 1>skeptical and competitive and,</v>

68
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.740
<v Speaker 1>and those can all be really good things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would be nice to be able to leave</v>

69
00:03:54.741 --> 00:03:55.574
<v Speaker 1>it out a little bit with some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the ability to take other people's </v>

70
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>perspectives a bit more and to take them</v>
<v Speaker 1>into account.</v>

71
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.691
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:02.524
<v Speaker 1>if your relationships improve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can also improve your emotional </v>

73
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:05.854
<v Speaker 1>stability because one of the ways that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people regulate their anxieties by </v>

74
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 1>having people around them that they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with.</v>

75
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

76
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 1>if the upset people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they upset you.</v>

77
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:16.264
<v Speaker 1>And especially if you're high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism and that can increase your </v>

78
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your pain.</v>

79
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.653
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
