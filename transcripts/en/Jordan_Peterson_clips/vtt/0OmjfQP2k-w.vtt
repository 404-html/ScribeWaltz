1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.923
<v Speaker 1>I've been telling people online in </v>
<v Speaker 1>various ways in the lectures that they </v>

2
00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:04.584
<v Speaker 1>should start fixing up the world by </v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaning up the room and I wanted to </v>

3
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 1>just elaborate on that a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>before I get back to the lecture itself.</v>

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>So I'd say it's become this Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird Internet meme,</v>

5
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

6
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a joke and good.</v>

7
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.104
<v Speaker 1>It's a jewel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really happy about the fact that so </v>

8
00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:24.954
<v Speaker 1>much of this has got the leaving of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humor and it's really important because </v>

9
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>that's what stops things from </v>
<v Speaker 1>degenerating into,</v>

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.733
<v Speaker 1>into conflict humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking about this idea of </v>

11
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:35.574
<v Speaker 1>cleaning up your room in relationship to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mustard seed idea and you see the </v>

12
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:39.534
<v Speaker 1>thing about cleaning up your room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is also something I learned from </v>

13
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Carl young and his studies on alchemy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because for young,</v>

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>when the alchemist was attempting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the philosopher's stone,</v>

15
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>he was not only engaged in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation of the material world,</v>

16
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:57.291
<v Speaker 1>but he was engaged in a process of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation that occurred at the same</v>

17
00:00:57.331 --> 00:00:58.980
<v Speaker 1>time as the chemical transformation.</v>

18
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>So it was a psychological work in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

19
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.063
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you want to sort out your room</v>
<v Speaker 1>and beautified because the beauty is </v>

20
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:05.544
<v Speaker 1>also important and let's say that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have is just a little room like </v>

21
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:08.754
<v Speaker 1>you're not rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're poor and you don't have any </v>

22
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing,</v>

23
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:15.120
<v Speaker 1>but you've got your damn room and you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got this space right in front of you.</v>

24
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:15.954
<v Speaker 1>You know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's a part of the cosmos that </v>

25
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>you can come to grips with and you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

26
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:21.264
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's there in front of you right in </v>

27
00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:23.004
<v Speaker 1>front of you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is it depends on </v>

28
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:25.314
<v Speaker 1>how open your eyes are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the proper answer because you </v>

29
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:30.240
<v Speaker 1>could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and William Blake said this,</v>

30
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.103
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aldous Huxley made comments that were </v>

31
00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>very similar that in a transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>

32
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:37.920
<v Speaker 1>you can see infinity in the finite and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

33
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:38.754
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say if you can see infinity in </v>

34
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>what you have within your grasp.</v>

35
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.710
<v Speaker 1>If you look and you could save,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's the case with your room and</v>

36
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.150
<v Speaker 1>so you want to clean up your room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.710
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that?</v>

38
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:51.924
<v Speaker 1>a room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his room is a place to sleep and so if </v>

40
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:55.344
<v Speaker 1>you set your room up properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you figure out how to sleep and </v>

41
00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:58.104
<v Speaker 1>when you should sleep and how you should</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep and then you figure out when you </v>

42
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:01.674
<v Speaker 1>should wake up and then you figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what clothes you should wear </v>

43
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:05.520
<v Speaker 1>because they have to be arranged </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly in your dresser.</v>

44
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:07.350
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to have some place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put your clothes.</v>

45
00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 1>And if you're going to have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes,</v>

46
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:09.410
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna.</v>

47
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Wear those clothes to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

48
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.683
<v Speaker 1>and then that means you have to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what you're going to do and then </v>

49
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:15.354
<v Speaker 1>your room has to serve that purpose </v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise it doesn't set up </v>

50
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:18.150
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

51
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>And if it doesn't set up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't serve your purposes,</v>

52
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 1>you will be unhappy and not happy in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

53
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:29.931
<v Speaker 1>Because the way that we perceive the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is as a place to move from point a</v>

54
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:31.164
<v Speaker 1>to point B in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if the place that we're in </v>

55
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>facilitates that movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're happy to be there.</v>

56
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>And if the place that we're in serves as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an obstacle to that movement,</v>

57
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:45.000
<v Speaker 1>then we're unhappy to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what it means to set up your room</v>

58
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>is that you have to have somewhere to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's worthwhile,</v>

59
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:48.864
<v Speaker 1>or you can set up your room and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>room has to be set up to facilitate </v>

60
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing is,</v>

61
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have to make it beautiful,</v>

62
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.580
<v Speaker 1>but that's not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

63
00:02:56.581 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>That means you have to have some taste </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that doesn't.</v>

64
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>You have to have money.</v>

65
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you can be garish with money and</v>

66
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:04.564
<v Speaker 1>you can be tasteful with nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you need is taste and taste beats </v>

67
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to beautifying things,</v>

68
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean not that money is trivial because</v>

69
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The taste is crucial.</v>

70
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:14.254
<v Speaker 1>And people who are very artistically </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented can make beautiful things out </v>

71
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 1>of virtually nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

72
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 1>the literature suggests that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make beautiful things,</v>

73
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>putting real constraints on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on what you allow yourself to do,</v>

74
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>facilitates creativity instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interfering with it.</v>

75
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Because let's say you have to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>something out of nothing,</v>

76
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I suppose would be a Godly Act,</v>

77
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:35.764
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to make something out of </v>

78
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:37.594
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be creative in order to do </v>

79
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:39.934
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then to beautify your room means </v>

80
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:43.834
<v Speaker 1>that you also have to develop your </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to be creative and so then you </v>

81
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:47.254
<v Speaker 1>can make your room shine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then what will happen is that if </v>

82
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 1>your family isn't together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will interfere with that.</v>

83
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.933
<v Speaker 1>You'll interfere with that because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't have the discipline to do it </v>

84
00:03:57.191 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when you start building this,</v>

85
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little microcosm of perfection with</v>

86
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:03.904
<v Speaker 1>what you have at hand and it'll evoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the pathologies of everyone in your </v>

87
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 1>household,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wonder what the hell you're up to in</v>

88
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>there and they won't necessarily be </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy because if you're.</v>

89
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>If they're in a lowly place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

90
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>and so are you and you're trying to move</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of that,</v>

91
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.793
<v Speaker 1>then the higher you move out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more the place they're in looks bad </v>

92
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.571
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

93
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:26.080
<v Speaker 1>what they should do is celebrate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>victory over chaos and evil,</v>

94
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:26.914
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will happen instead is that they </v>

95
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 1>will attempt to pull you back down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll attempt to.</v>

96
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously all families don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

97
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:35.314
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all families do that to some degree </v>

98
00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>and some families do almost nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

99
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to organize your room,</v>

100
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.513
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to have to confront </v>
<v Speaker 1>the devils in your house and that's </v>

101
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:48.724
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's often a terrifying thing because </v>

102
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:53.890
<v Speaker 1>some of those devils have have lineages </v>
<v Speaker 1>that go back many,</v>

103
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:56.770
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many generations and God only knows what</v>

104
00:04:56.771 --> 00:04:58.990
<v Speaker 1>you have to struggle with in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome that.</v>

105
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.680
<v Speaker 1>And so and so to sort yourself out into </v>
<v Speaker 1>fix up your room is a nontrivial matter.</v>

106
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

107
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:07.603
<v Speaker 1>you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll learn by doing that and then </v>

108
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:10.564
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll learn enough by doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you can fix up your family a </v>

109
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then having done that,</v>

110
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:15.840
<v Speaker 1>you'll have enough characters.</v>
