00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.903
<v Speaker 1>One of the things we don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>very well from a political perspective </v>

2
00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:08.890
<v Speaker 1>is that conservatives and liberals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually quite different people,</v>

3
00:00:08.891 --> 00:00:09.724
<v Speaker 1>temperamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the way they filter the world is </v>

4
00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:13.354
<v Speaker 1>different and so the world presents </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself as a set of facts that are </v>

5
00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:17.494
<v Speaker 1>different for liberals and conservatives</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's not just a matter of </v>

6
00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:22.360
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of fundamental,</v>

7
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.703
<v Speaker 1>fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperamental orientation and to </v>

8
00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:28.450
<v Speaker 1>understand that other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the diversity argument.</v>

9
00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:31.390
<v Speaker 1>If you were really making a diversity </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument that was real,</v>

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.433
<v Speaker 1>this is the argument you would make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are actually different and and </v>

11
00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:36.904
<v Speaker 1>you need to understand the differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's advantages and </v>

12
00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:39.694
<v Speaker 1>disadvantages to all of the differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's also advantages and </v>

13
00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:44.560
<v Speaker 1>disadvantages into how we interact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

14
00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>That's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People to know.</v>

15
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.013
<v Speaker 1>It's really useful to talk to someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's different than you because they </v>

16
00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:53.020
<v Speaker 1>actually see a different world and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you listen to them,</v>

17
00:00:53.021 --> 00:00:56.320
<v Speaker 1>they can give you some insight into that</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and that means that your world can</v>

18
00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:59.890
<v Speaker 1>expand and maybe if you knew that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were actually different,</v>

19
00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:03.730
<v Speaker 1>like biologically different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be more inclined to listen to them</v>

20
00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>because you wouldn't think that.</v>

21
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously people are arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ignorant and malevolent at times.</v>

22
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.170
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are separate issues.</v>

23
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.153
<v Speaker 1>But apart from all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're also very different from one </v>

24
00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:15.094
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you listen to someone who's </v>

25
00:01:16.481 --> 00:01:18.790
<v Speaker 1>different from you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you things you don't know.</v>

26
00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:22.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's really helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you would like to not know things</v>

27
00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 1>and then you run like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.090
<v Speaker 1>face first into walls.</v>
