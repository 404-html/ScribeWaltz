1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
<v Speaker 1>And the sons of Noah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went forth of the Ark were shem and</v>

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:07.950
<v Speaker 1>ham and Japheth and ham is the father of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canaan.</v>

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.750
<v Speaker 1>These are the three sons of Noah and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them was the whole earth.</v>

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Overspread and Noah began to be a hud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>husbands men,</v>

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.940
<v Speaker 1>and he planted a vineyard and he drank </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the wine and was drunk,</v>

6
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>and he was uncovered within his tent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ham.</v>

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.103
<v Speaker 1>The father of Canaan saw the nakedness </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his father and told his two brethren </v>

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>without friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid</v>

9
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:34.014
<v Speaker 1>upon both their shoulders and went </v>
<v Speaker 1>backward and covered the nakedness of </v>

10
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:37.284
<v Speaker 1>their father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And their faces were backward and they </v>

11
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:39.714
<v Speaker 1>saw not their father's nakedness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Noah awoke from his wine and knew </v>

12
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:46.230
<v Speaker 1>what his younger son had done unto him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

13
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>curse it to be Canaan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A servant of servants,</v>

14
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:53.450
<v Speaker 1>shall he be unto his brethren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

15
00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:55.850
<v Speaker 1>blessed shall be the Lord God of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chairman.</v>

16
00:00:55.851 --> 00:00:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Canaan shall be his servant and God </v>
<v Speaker 1>shall enlarge Japheth.</v>

17
00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:02.690
<v Speaker 1>And he shall dwell in the tents of Shem </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Canaan be his servant.</v>

18
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.723
<v Speaker 1>And no one lived after the flood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>350 years and all the days of Noah were </v>

19
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:09.470
<v Speaker 1>950 years and he died</v>

20
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.930
<v Speaker 1>and the whole earth was of one language </v>
<v Speaker 1>and of one speech.</v>

21
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I remember thinking about this story,</v>

22
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.750
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be 30 years ago</v>

23
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.230
<v Speaker 1>and I think the meaning of the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>stood out for me.</v>

24
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when you read complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>material,</v>

25
00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:33.904
<v Speaker 1>sometimes a piece of it will stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for some reason it's like it </v>

26
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.743
<v Speaker 1>glitters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that might be one way of </v>

27
00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's it,</v>

28
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.213
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in sync with it and you can </v>

29
00:01:43.391 --> 00:01:45.730
<v Speaker 1>understand what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've really experienced that reading the</v>

30
00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Tao Te Ching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is document I would really like to</v>

31
00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:52.480
<v Speaker 1>do a lecture on at some point because </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the verses I don't understand,</v>

32
00:01:52.481 --> 00:01:54.640
<v Speaker 1>but others stand right out and I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand them.</v>

33
00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:57.430
<v Speaker 1>And I think I understood what this part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the story of no amount.</v>

34
00:01:57.431 --> 00:01:59.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.800
<v Speaker 1>we talked a little bit about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>nakedness meant in the story of Adam and</v>

36
00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:03.634
<v Speaker 1>eve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea essentially was that to </v>

37
00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:10.360
<v Speaker 1>know yourself naked is to become aware </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your vulnerability,</v>

38
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.593
<v Speaker 1>the physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your physical boundaries in time and </v>

39
00:02:13.571 --> 00:02:15.730
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your,</v>

40
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.120
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your physiological,</v>

41
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.433
<v Speaker 1>your fundamental physiological </v>
<v Speaker 1>insufficiencies as they make might be </v>

42
00:02:23.321 --> 00:02:24.340
<v Speaker 1>judged by others.</v>

43
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.173
<v Speaker 1>So there's biological insufficiency </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of built into you because </v>

44
00:02:27.611 --> 00:02:28.444
<v Speaker 1>you're a fragile mortal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable half insane creature and </v>

45
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.760
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just an existential truth.</v>

46
00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:38.110
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even merely as a human being,</v>

47
00:02:38.111 --> 00:02:38.944
<v Speaker 1>even with all those faults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are faults that you have that are </v>

48
00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:45.160
<v Speaker 1>particular to you that might be judged </v>
<v Speaker 1>harshly by the group while might be,</v>

49
00:02:45.161 --> 00:02:47.920
<v Speaker 1>we'll definitely be judged harshly by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the group.</v>

50
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.470
<v Speaker 1>And so to become aware of your nakedness</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to become self conscious and,</v>

51
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.640
<v Speaker 1>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to,</v>

52
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.670
<v Speaker 1>to know your limits and to know your </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability.</v>

53
00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:59.671
<v Speaker 1>And that's what is revealed to when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes across his father naked.</v>

54
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>

55
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to see your father </v>
<v Speaker 1>naked?</v>

56
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.923
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially in an inappropriate </v>

57
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>manner like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

58
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.903
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

59
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

60
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.773
<v Speaker 1>it's as if ham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does the same thing that happens in </v>

61
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:19.954
<v Speaker 1>the Mesopotamian creation myth when when</v>
<v Speaker 1>timeout an absolute give rise to the </v>

62
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:25.024
<v Speaker 1>first God's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the father of the eventual </v>

63
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.053
<v Speaker 1>deity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

64
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>of redemption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marduk there are very careless and noisy</v>

65
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:34.954
<v Speaker 1>and the kill app,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their father and attempt to inhabit his </v>

66
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>corpse.</v>

67
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.573
<v Speaker 1>And that makes timeout enraged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she bursts forth from the </v>

68
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 1>darkness to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do the men.</v>

69
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like a precursor to the flood story</v>
<v Speaker 1>or an analog to the flood story.</v>

70
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>And I see the same thing happening here </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him is that he's,</v>

71
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.960
<v Speaker 1>he's insufficiently respectful of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

72
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.350
<v Speaker 1>And the question is exactly what does </v>
<v Speaker 1>the farther represent.</v>

73
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's,</v>

74
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.413
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the father that you have and </v>

75
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.930
<v Speaker 1>that's a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

76
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:07.300
<v Speaker 1>that's a man like other men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man among men.</v>

77
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.810
<v Speaker 1>But then there's the father as such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the spirit of the father.</v>

78
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>And in so far as you have a father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have both at the same time.</v>

79
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 1>You have the personal father that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>man among other men,</v>

80
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 1>just like anyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's father,</v>

81
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 1>but in so far as that man is your </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

82
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:24.724
<v Speaker 1>that means that he's something different</v>
<v Speaker 1>than just another person and what he is </v>

83
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:33.121
<v Speaker 1>is the incarnation of the spirit of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>father and to see that,</v>

84
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>to take it to what to disrespect that </v>
<v Speaker 1>carelessly.</v>

85
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe even like no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes a mistake,</v>

86
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:41.644
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He produces wine and gets himself drunk </v>

87
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

88
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he sprawled out there for everyone to</v>

89
00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:49.414
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hardly hams fault if he stumbles </v>

90
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:51.334
<v Speaker 1>across it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the book is laying out a danger and </v>

91
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 1>the danger is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

92
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.233
<v Speaker 1>maybe you catch your father at his most </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable moment and if you're </v>

93
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:02.523
<v Speaker 1>disrespectful then you transgress </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the spirit of the father and if </v>

94
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:10.870
<v Speaker 1>you transgress against the spirit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>father and lose the spirit of the father</v>

95
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 1>and lose respect for the spirit of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

96
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 1>then that is likely to transform you </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a slave.</v>

97
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a very interesting idea and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's particularly interesting.</v>

98
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not particularly interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

99
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:25.683
<v Speaker 1>It's particularly Germane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to our current cultural </v>

100
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:28.834
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think that were pushed </v>

101
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.920
<v Speaker 1>constantly to see the nakedness of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

102
00:05:33.921 --> 00:05:34.754
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the intense criticism that's </v>

103
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.630
<v Speaker 1>directed towards our culture and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal culture,</v>

104
00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:44.464
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

105
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.963
<v Speaker 1>We're constantly exposing its weaknesses</v>
<v Speaker 1>and vulnerabilities and let's say </v>

106
00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>nakedness and there's nothing wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism,</v>

107
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:53.884
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about criticism is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose of criticism is to separate the </v>

108
00:05:57.081 --> 00:05:57.914
<v Speaker 1>wheat from the chaff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the burn everything to the </v>

109
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

110
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:02.030
<v Speaker 1>It's to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

111
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 1>we're going to carefully look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to carefully differentiate.</v>

112
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 1>We're going to keep what's good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna move away from what's bad,</v>

113
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>but the point of the criticism isn't to </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify everything is bad.</v>

114
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:13.214
<v Speaker 1>It's two separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's good from what's bad so that you </v>

115
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:16.394
<v Speaker 1>can retain what's good and move towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and to be careless at that is deadly </v>

116
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 1>because you inhabited by the spirit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the father.</v>

117
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.053
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In so far as you're a cultural </v>

118
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:29.140
<v Speaker 1>construction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course is something that the.</v>

119
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.383
<v Speaker 1>That the postmodern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neo Marxists are absolutely in phatic </v>

120
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:36.110
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a cultural construction in so far</v>

121
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:36.944
<v Speaker 1>as you're a cultural construction than </v>
<v Speaker 1>your inhabited by the spirit of the </v>

122
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:40.124
<v Speaker 1>father and to be disrespectful towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means to undermine the very </v>

123
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 1>structure that makes you not all of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

124
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Certainly certainly not all of what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

125
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:50.444
<v Speaker 1>but a good portion of what you are in so</v>
<v Speaker 1>far as you're a socialized cultural </v>

126
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:54.854
<v Speaker 1>entity and if you pull out the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you pull the foundation out from </v>

127
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:01.460
<v Speaker 1>underneath that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you have left?</v>

128
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.750
<v Speaker 1>You can hardly manage on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

129
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.683
<v Speaker 1>it's just not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a cultural creation and so hamm </v>

130
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:11.114
<v Speaker 1>makes this desperate error and is </v>
<v Speaker 1>careless about exposing himself to the </v>

131
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:19.850
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability of his father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

132
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:20.684
<v Speaker 1>He does it without sufficient respect </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the judgment is that not only will </v>

133
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:29.300
<v Speaker 1>he be a slave but so will all of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>descendants and he's contrasted with the</v>

134
00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:30.134
<v Speaker 1>other two sons who I suppose are willing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give their father the benefit of the </v>

135
00:07:34.491 --> 00:07:35.750
<v Speaker 1>doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

136
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.630
<v Speaker 1>And so when they see him in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>compromising position,</v>

137
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.100
<v Speaker 1>they handle it with respect and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

138
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.480
<v Speaker 1>and don't capitalize on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that makes them strong.</v>

139
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:48.853
<v Speaker 1>That's what it seems to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that's what that story </v>

140
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:52.244
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>
