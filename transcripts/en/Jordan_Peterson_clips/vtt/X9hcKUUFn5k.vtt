1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a subset of males are are biologically </v>

2
00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:04.284
<v Speaker 1>hyper aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can identify them at two years of </v>

3
00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:06.924
<v Speaker 1>age and they are the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you put a bunch of two year olds </v>

4
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:09.990
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a small subset.</v>

5
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:10.824
<v Speaker 1>They're almost all males,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about five percent of males who will </v>

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.290
<v Speaker 1>kick hit bite and steel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:18.300
<v Speaker 1>So that's their biological programming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

8
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:19.134
<v Speaker 1>But the vast majority of them are </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialized by the time they're four </v>

9
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:24.660
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's amazing.</v>

10
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

11
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely it is.</v>

12
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

13
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about about boys like that</v>

14
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>is that if you socialize them properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite a bit of work because they're</v>

15
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>very combative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My son was like that.</v>

16
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.583
<v Speaker 1>And if you socialize them properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they can become unbelievably </v>

17
00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're courageous,</v>

18
00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 1>they're forthright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

19
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

20
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to back down from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge.</v>

21
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.143
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of massive utility in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and that's this proper interplay </v>

22
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>between the biological circuitry and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>socialization.</v>

23
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.160
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

24
00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>and with James Demaurice memo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.253
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

26
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>he's been accused of taking a biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>essential list route,</v>

27
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>which is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things James said is,</v>

28
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:07.980
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's credible evidence that there are</v>

29
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:08.814
<v Speaker 1>biologically mediated differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>between men and women at the level of </v>

30
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:12.054
<v Speaker 1>temperament and interest that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually large and profound and I would </v>

31
00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:20.181
<v Speaker 1>say the science on that is sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 1>settled so that someone can come out and</v>

32
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>say that scientifically credible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean it's right because</v>

33
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:25.554
<v Speaker 1>the scientists could be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you can say is that what James </v>

34
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Damore said was scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 1>uninformed.</v>

35
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 1>It was scientifically informed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he also said,</v>

36
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's make the assumption.</v>

37
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.043
<v Speaker 1>I'm paraphrasing slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's make the assumption that we </v>

38
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a society,</v>

39
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:44.820
<v Speaker 1>we want to extract maximum useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic value from talented people.</v>

40
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.253
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things we want to do is if</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those people are women and some </v>

41
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:49.344
<v Speaker 1>of them are men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to understand the actual </v>

42
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>differences between women and men so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can set up the workplace so that</v>

43
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.583
<v Speaker 1>both women and men can contribute to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>maximum economically so that they can </v>

44
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>benefit as individuals and everybody can</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit socially.</v>

45
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.490
<v Speaker 1>So you can use the biological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

46
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.870
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things,</v>

47
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a biological problem,</v>

48
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.330
<v Speaker 1>on average women are more agreeable than</v>
<v Speaker 1>men and I think that's because agreeable</v>

49
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:13.164
<v Speaker 1>people are self sacrificing and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a woman you need to be wired to be </v>

50
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>self sacrificing or you won't be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerate taking care of infants.</v>

51
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>That's my sense of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

52
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Now there's some problems with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

53
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.300
<v Speaker 1>let's say that a huge part of female </v>
<v Speaker 1>wiring is,</v>

54
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.223
<v Speaker 1>is tilted in the direction of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity of self sacrifice for infant </v>

55
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

56
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't equip women very well for </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with aggressive meant because of</v>

57
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.860
<v Speaker 1>aggressive men and infants are not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same creatures.</v>

58
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.530
<v Speaker 1>So women play a pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a price beat,</v>

59
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>being optimized to some degree for </v>
<v Speaker 1>infant care.</v>

60
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:46.480
<v Speaker 1>They pay a price that they're less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>what would you call prepared?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

62
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Indeed with dealing with hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive and competitive meant.</v>

63
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.443
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the consequences of that is that </v>

64
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>agreeable people don't make as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

65
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

66
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:00.394
<v Speaker 1>You actually have to be disagreeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to go to your boss and </v>

67
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:03.124
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me some bloody money or something </v>

68
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>you don't like will happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to leave.</v>

69
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.640
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to fight</v>

70
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.980
<v Speaker 2>for an idea too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But so there is something that,</v>

71
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.320
<v Speaker 2>this is a perfect test case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So biologically speaking,</v>

72
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.543
<v Speaker 2>there's a very good reason for certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of wisdom to be biased in the </v>

73
00:03:21.091 --> 00:03:24.750
<v Speaker 2>direction of manifesting in females,</v>
<v Speaker 2>females,</v>

74
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.733
<v Speaker 2>because they have the capacity to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>fewer offspring in a lifetime than </v>

75
00:03:29.581 --> 00:03:30.480
<v Speaker 2>males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

76
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.970
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

77
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.840
<v Speaker 2>obligated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>

78
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

79
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.263
<v Speaker 2>to care in a particular way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that care and human beings </v>

80
00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:43.290
<v Speaker 2>take so many years has resulted in </v>
<v Speaker 2>menopause emerging and menopause.</v>

81
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Essentially when a woman is done </v>
<v Speaker 2>producing new offspring,</v>

82
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 2>her interests in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

83
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.560
<v Speaker 2>her evolutionary interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which in this case I think our honorable</v>

84
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.573
<v Speaker 2>becomes synonymous with the lineage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the population because her offspring </v>

85
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.800
<v Speaker 2>will either do well or do poorly based </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the population that they're in.</v>

86
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.030
<v Speaker 2>So women have a kind of farsightedness </v>
<v Speaker 2>about lineage.</v>

87
00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:07.950
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think it has anything to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with human women.</v>

88
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.690
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a trait that we can see,</v>

89
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in females,</v>

90
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of other species,</v>

91
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.940
<v Speaker 2>so it's an ancient thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas males are high variance.</v>

92
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.600
<v Speaker 2>That is to say a male can have many </v>
<v Speaker 2>offspring in a lifetime.</v>

93
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.640
<v Speaker 2>Many males have no offspring in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifetime.</v>

94
00:04:23.641 --> 00:04:24.474
<v Speaker 2>And that high variance means that to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>extent that there's wisdom that </v>

95
00:04:27.061 --> 00:04:30.660
<v Speaker 2>surrounds risk taking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has traveled historically,</v>

96
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>along the male path.</v>

97
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.503
<v Speaker 2>Now in modern times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason that we can't look at </v>

98
00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:39.330
<v Speaker 2>these two kinds of wisdom and </v>
<v Speaker 2>democratize them both,</v>

99
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.333
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact is there's no reason if you're </v>

100
00:04:42.361 --> 00:04:43.194
<v Speaker 2>born female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can't tune into what has </v>

101
00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:49.320
<v Speaker 2>historically been a male biased wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 2>and take advantage of that.</v>

102
00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:52.530
<v Speaker 2>And we should be encouraging this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason that people have to.</v>

103
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.863
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we can't actually have a </v>

104
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:57.930
<v Speaker 1>reasonable discussion about it because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:04:57.931 --> 00:05:00.180
<v Speaker 1>the discussion is often for stalled by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the claim that,</v>

106
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women are exactly the same.</v>

107
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

108
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.810
<v Speaker 1>that's not a helpful discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

109
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.530
<v Speaker 1>with the agreeableness issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what should be done</v>

110
00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:08.364
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the consequences of it is is </v>

111
00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:13.710
<v Speaker 1>that there's many reasons why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the pay,</v>

112
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.663
<v Speaker 1>there's pay differential between men and</v>
<v Speaker 1>women and the issue itself is very </v>

113
00:05:16.681 --> 00:05:17.514
<v Speaker 1>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we do know that agreeable people </v>

114
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.973
<v Speaker 1>overall make less money in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions and it's because they don't </v>

115
00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:26.580
<v Speaker 1>negotiate on their own behalf very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's conceivable that you could have</v>

116
00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:27.414
<v Speaker 1>an intelligent public policy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate policy discussion about what </v>

117
00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:32.010
<v Speaker 1>to do about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe,</v>

118
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.873
<v Speaker 1>maybe the rule is something like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>review male salaries once a year and </v>

119
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.320
<v Speaker 1>female salaries every eight months or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

120
00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:42.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying that's a good idea.</v>

121
00:05:42.031 --> 00:05:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that if you,</v>

122
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.250
<v Speaker 1>if you take the facts on the ground into</v>
<v Speaker 1>account,</v>

123
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.250
<v Speaker 1>there are ways that you might be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use them so that you could,</v>

124
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.353
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not gonna say level the playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>field because I think that's an </v>

125
00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:56.790
<v Speaker 1>appalling phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maximize the possibility of economic</v>

126
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.213
<v Speaker 1>across the genders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously in everyone's best </v>

127
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:01.004
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>
