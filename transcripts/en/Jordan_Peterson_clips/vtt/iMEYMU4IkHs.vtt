00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.143
<v Speaker 1>Could you please offer advice for </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals with high intelligence but </v>

2
00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:04.294
<v Speaker 1>low extroversion and low agreeableness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and making and maintaining social </v>

3
00:00:06.851 --> 00:00:11.050
<v Speaker 1>connections and friendships?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Roger,</v>

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Roger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say make a plan.</v>

6
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.373
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.790
<v Speaker 1>spend some time on it weekly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to things like meetups.</v>

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>There's a site called meetup.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good place to meet people.</v>

9
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Do whatever you have to to meet people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a course,</v>

10
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>strike up a conversation and ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions and listen.</v>

11
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 1>That's particularly good if you're low </v>
<v Speaker 1>in agreeableness,</v>

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people really like to be listened to.</v>

13
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to pester them with </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions too badly,</v>

14
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.374
<v Speaker 1>but you can get an awful long ways by </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to people and asking them </v>

15
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:47.124
<v Speaker 1>questions people hardly ever get </v>
<v Speaker 1>listened to and they're so damn happy </v>

16
00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:52.510
<v Speaker 1>when you do it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

17
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're likely to open themselves.</v>
