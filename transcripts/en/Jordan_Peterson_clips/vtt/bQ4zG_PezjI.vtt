1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>I've dealt with lots of strange people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my life if I'm a clinical </v>

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:05.640
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that isn't to say that everyone that</v>

3
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:07.980
<v Speaker 1>I've dealt with with strange because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the case,</v>

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.820
<v Speaker 1>but I have encountered some very strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and you know,</v>

5
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.310
<v Speaker 1>the way to deal with strange people is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

6
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.610
<v Speaker 1>You never lie to a strange person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.073
<v Speaker 1>Especially if they're paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never lie to someone who's paranoid </v>

8
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will come back to bite you.</v>

9
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.780
<v Speaker 1>And if you're in an extreme situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone who's very unpredictable,</v>

10
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>the only thing you have that works is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth that works.</v>

11
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a little story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is in my book.</v>

12
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.643
<v Speaker 1>So I had this landlord in Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lived next door to me and he was an </v>

13
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:43.974
<v Speaker 1>ex hell's angels biker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd spent a lot of time in prison and </v>

14
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:47.784
<v Speaker 1>his wife had borderline personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder and she committed suicide when </v>

15
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:51.444
<v Speaker 1>I lived there.</v>

16
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.080
<v Speaker 1>And he's a rough guy and he was at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Quebec Quebecois and he spoke ul,</v>

17
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>which I could hardly understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

18
00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't really know what to make of me</v>

19
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't really know what to make of</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

20
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we got along,</v>

21
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very careful talking to him as,</v>

22
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>as you might imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I was,</v>

23
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 1>it was very unwieldy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went over,</v>

24
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.340
<v Speaker 1>my wife and I went over there and we had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a spaghetti dinner one night and we sort</v>

25
00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:17.174
<v Speaker 1>of communicated and I bought a poster </v>
<v Speaker 1>from him because he made these wooden </v>

26
00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 1>posters that had neon on them and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he made a living.</v>

27
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:24.600
<v Speaker 1>He'd kind of trained himself to be a bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an electronics guy.</v>

28
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:25.434
<v Speaker 1>And so we made these things and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to quit drinking and we talked </v>

29
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a lot older than me.</v>

30
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.680
<v Speaker 1>He was like 20 years older than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was about 25 at this point.</v>

31
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got along pretty well.</v>

32
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.920
<v Speaker 1>But every now and then he'd go out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a drink and he could really drink,</v>

33
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:41.754
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was one of these guys who could </v>

34
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>drink like 60 beer and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

35
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>no one can drink that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're wrong,</v>

36
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>I studied alcohol for like 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of my subjects,</v>

37
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:51.384
<v Speaker 1>father's drank 40 ounces of vodka a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and had been doing it for 20 years so </v>

38
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>you can drink a lot and he could drink a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

39
00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>And what would happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to,</v>

40
00:01:58.231 --> 00:01:59.064
<v Speaker 1>not drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he'd go out and go on a binge and </v>

41
00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:00.924
<v Speaker 1>then he'd be gone for like three days </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he drink up all his money and then </v>

42
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.563
<v Speaker 1>we'd hear him out in the backyard </v>
<v Speaker 1>howling at the moon with this little </v>

43
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>little ugly dog he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.710
<v Speaker 1>and he'd held and the dog would howl and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd howl and the dog would howl and,</v>

45
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.020
<v Speaker 1>and it was a rather unsettling and made </v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife nervous.</v>

46
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.373
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

47
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but worse,</v>

48
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:24.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

49
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:27.940
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd come to the door at like </v>
<v Speaker 1>three in the morning,</v>

50
00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:28.774
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he'd knock on the door and he'd be </v>

51
00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:30.984
<v Speaker 1>standing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how much experience </v>

52
00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>you've had with rough guys who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic and who are drunk,</v>

53
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:38.244
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can be upright and unconscious at </v>

54
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:45.054
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was the state that he was </v>

55
00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:47.030
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.863
<v Speaker 1>he'd be just swaying and he'd asked me </v>
<v Speaker 1>if I would like to buy his toaster or </v>

57
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>his microwave because he needed some </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to keep drinking and you know,</v>

58
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really want to buy his toaster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas microwave.</v>

59
00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:03.231
<v Speaker 1>But when the x Hell's Angel Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all speaking 60 beard,</v>

60
00:03:03.631 --> 00:03:04.464
<v Speaker 1>drunk Quebecois biker shows up at your </v>
<v Speaker 1>door at three in the morning and offers </v>

61
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>you to sell offers to sell you his </v>
<v Speaker 1>microwave.</v>

62
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 1>The easiest thing is to say I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>need a microwave.</v>

63
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

64
00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:21.804
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought the microwave and toaster and </v>

65
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>some other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then.</v>

66
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>But then my wife talked to me and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>liked my landlord,</v>

67
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:35.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though she was afraid of him,</v>

68
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:39.270
<v Speaker 1>she liked him and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't buy any more,</v>

69
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.670
<v Speaker 1>any more appliances because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for him.</v>

70
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>

71
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

72
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 1>so what the hell am I going to do about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

73
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:51.364
<v Speaker 1>Because no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to buy your microwave just </v>

74
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to be the right answer at </v>
<v Speaker 1>three in the morning.</v>

75
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.333
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one time he took me out on his </v>

76
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.240
<v Speaker 1>sevenfifty Honda and he put me on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back of it.</v>

77
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.103
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to show me his layer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess his hangouts and I got his </v>

78
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 1>wife's helmet on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't fit it just sit on the top</v>

79
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:15.121
<v Speaker 1>of my head and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to the bike and he said if the cops</v>

80
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 1>chase us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not stopping.</v>

81
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 1>And then away we went and we went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

82
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:24.480
<v Speaker 1>like these bars downtown on sending the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

83
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>They were very rough places and you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>into like four fights that night because</v>

84
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 1>he was a rough guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:30.664
<v Speaker 1>and these kind of punk guys would come </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to them and sort of challenge them </v>

86
00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:34.264
<v Speaker 1>and act stupidly around him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was very skeptical and if you </v>

87
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:39.070
<v Speaker 1>were acting stupidly around him for any </v>
<v Speaker 1>length of time,</v>

88
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:41.920
<v Speaker 1>he just hit you because he felt that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you deserved.</v>

89
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:43.820
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps he was right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.683
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had a firsthand opportunity to </v>

91
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 1>observe him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

92
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:49.744
<v Speaker 1>he sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a week or two after we had this </v>

93
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he showed up at the door,</v>

94
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.361
<v Speaker 1>knock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knock,</v>

95
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:56.194
<v Speaker 1>knock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.740
<v Speaker 1>open the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing there with his eyes,</v>

97
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.430
<v Speaker 1>half closed and he was swaying and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>

98
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what the appliance was </v>
<v Speaker 1>this time,</v>

99
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.040
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted to sell it to me and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

100
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm not Paul.</v>

101
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.120
<v Speaker 1>I can buy this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to buy this because I know</v>

102
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.900
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to quit drinking and if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>give you this money then you're going to</v>

103
00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:21.090
<v Speaker 1>go and drink it up and it's not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be good for you.</v>

104
00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:21.924
<v Speaker 1>And what else did I tell them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I told him as well that this </v>

105
00:05:27.631 --> 00:05:28.464
<v Speaker 1>whole thing of him coming to my house at</v>
<v Speaker 1>like two in the morning was scaring my </v>

106
00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:34.650
<v Speaker 1>wife who he liked and that it had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop and believe me,</v>

107
00:05:34.651 --> 00:05:35.484
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about what I was saying </v>

108
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.483
<v Speaker 1>because he was watching me like a rough </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy watches you and a rough guy watches </v>

109
00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:43.644
<v Speaker 1>you like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks if you say one thing that </v>

110
00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:51.300
<v Speaker 1>indicates contempt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to bloody well paid for it.</v>

111
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Speaker 1>And so I was finding my words like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

112
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I was crossing a swamp and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look for the,</v>

113
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 1>for the rocks underneath the surface.</v>

114
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 1>And I said what I had to say very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very carefully.</v>

115
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.523
<v Speaker 1>And he looked at me for about 15 seconds</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a long time to be locked out </v>

116
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:09.523
<v Speaker 1>at three in the morning and he left and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he never came back to sell me anything </v>

117
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we got along fine.</v>

118
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.303
<v Speaker 1>But that's a good illustration of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue with regards to truth and success </v>

119
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 1>in the strange land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I was in the strange land when I</v>

120
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 1>was talking to my neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my landlord than.</v>

121
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 1>And I managed to say what was true </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully enough.</v>

122
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:40.874
<v Speaker 1>So despite the fact that he was a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>violent person and that he was a very </v>

123
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:45.944
<v Speaker 1>intoxicated person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he had every reason to be </v>

124
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:49.184
<v Speaker 1>suspicious of me and we couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate very well and I didn't do </v>

125
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:53.234
<v Speaker 1>what he wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That he took it and he left and there </v>

126
00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 1>was no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And life went on just fine after that.</v>

127
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:08.170
<v Speaker 1>And so we don't want to underestimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the utility of establishing this bounded</v>

128
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:15.461
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the ideal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to live with some nobility in</v>

129
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 1>truth will aiming at the highest ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing about that.</v>

130
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 1>That's anything but strengthening and </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>

131
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.393
<v Speaker 1>and it's exactly what you need to set </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the catastrophe and uncertainty </v>

132
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:33.944
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>
