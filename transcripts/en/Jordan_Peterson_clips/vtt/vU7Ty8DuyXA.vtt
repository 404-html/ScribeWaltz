<v Speaker 2>last year.</v>

<v Speaker 2>fatherly directives or wisdom.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So some might say,</v>

21
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.880
<v Speaker 2>gIven that we are a couple of primates </v>
<v Speaker 2>full of snakes,</v>

22
00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty miraculous that we haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed each other,</v>

23
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.303

<v Speaker 2>I think I'm ready now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to commit to a life with you </v>

26
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 2>of sorting ourselves out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to clean some rooms with you.</v>

27
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.450

<v Speaker 1>you're going to shackle yourself to me.</v>

35
00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:52.561
<v Speaker 1>I'd never run away then I shall suffer </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of my life with you.</v>
