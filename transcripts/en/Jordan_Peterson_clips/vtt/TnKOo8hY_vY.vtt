1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>It's very necessary for people at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in their life to dedicate </v>

2
00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:05.670
<v Speaker 1>themselves to a single game of some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort,</v>

3
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:07.320
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of what you're doing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>

4
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.343
<v Speaker 1>you know you have to become one thing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>some point in your life and the </v>

5
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:12.744
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice of course is that you give up </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other things that you could </v>

6
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the.</v>

7
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.453
<v Speaker 1>You don't really have a choice because </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't decide voluntarily to </v>

8
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:21.180
<v Speaker 1>become one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:22.014
<v Speaker 1>to become a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a disciplined adherent of some specific </v>

10
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:30.141
<v Speaker 1>practice or profession or viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you risk just aging chaotically and</v>

11
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.393
<v Speaker 1>you don't get away with not aging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might as well age into something </v>

12
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:36.324
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually something rather than </v>

13
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:40.710
<v Speaker 1>just remaining or then just becoming an </v>
<v Speaker 1>old child,</v>

14
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:43.860
<v Speaker 1>which is really not a not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good thing to see.</v>

15
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Especially by the time people hit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>40.</v>

16
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

17
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.433
<v Speaker 1>It's not pretty for them or anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even at 30 it's getting pretty old </v>

18
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:54.180
<v Speaker 1>at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>40.</v>

19
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's almost a repairable at 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is you run,</v>

20
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.600
<v Speaker 1>you start running out of opportunities </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're young and stupid.</v>

21
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 1>People don't care because they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

22
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

23
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.973
<v Speaker 1>You've got decades of of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of possibility still ready to unfold in </v>

24
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:10.764
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're in the same unspecified </v>

25
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>position at 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are much less forgiving.</v>

26
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.193
<v Speaker 1>Especially because if they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hire someone who doesn't know what's </v>

27
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:20.724
<v Speaker 1>going on or or employ them or or sorry </v>
<v Speaker 1>or engage them in some sort of </v>

28
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:24.444
<v Speaker 1>productive activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might as well take a chance on </v>

29
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:26.844
<v Speaker 1>someone young and full of potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than someone who's really lived </v>

30
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>more than half of their life already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of course you have,</v>

31
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>by the time you're 40.</v>
