00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.190
<v Speaker 1>What is my opinion on open </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>

2
00:00:02.191 --> 00:00:05.010
<v Speaker 1>polyamory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other forms of non monogamy?</v>

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.173
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that as a medium to longterm </v>

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.383
<v Speaker 1>strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're completely untenable because </v>

5
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.680
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

6
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>are fundamentally pair bonding and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

7
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>if you're just talking about casual sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

8
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I think casual sex is a contradiction in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>

9
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:22.194
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything about sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's casual and I think that people </v>

10
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>are deceiving themselves badly whenever </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think so.</v>

11
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>They might like to live in a 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies,</v>

12
00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>playboy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescent fantasy,</v>

13
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:31.974
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
