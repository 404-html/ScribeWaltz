1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.730
<v Speaker 1>The system is rigged against you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.230
<v Speaker 1>you're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be ill like it's rough,</v>

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.093
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you don't want to lay that at the </v>

4
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>feet of the social structure because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>social structure,</v>

5
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is trying to have you not die,</v>

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.771
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:17.604
<v Speaker 1>that's why we have walls and electricity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that and works pretty damn </v>

8
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:21.024
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're probably going to live </v>

9
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:22.464
<v Speaker 1>till you're 80 and the only reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to live longer is </v>

10
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:27.480
<v Speaker 1>because we can't figure out how to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to live longer.</v>

11
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're not going to starve to</v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

12
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Wild animals aren't gonna tear you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces.</v>

13
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Tyrants aren't going to rip you from </v>
<v Speaker 1>limb to limb.</v>

14
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:34.824
<v Speaker 1>It's like these are good things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you still got a big problem because </v>

15
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>the cosmic system is rigged against you </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sense,</v>

16
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>but okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>

17
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The off,</v>

18
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>you know you're vulnerable and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

19
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:47.424
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

20
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can be broken and you will be in</v>

21
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 1>many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't blame someone for that.</v>

22
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the structure of reality.</v>

23
00:00:56.941 --> 00:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do about that?</v>

24
00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>

25
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.120
<v Speaker 1>and I've always looked as a psychologist</v>
<v Speaker 1>for optimistic ideas and and I'm not,</v>

26
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.463
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an easy sell with regards to </v>

27
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>optimistic ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because of my basic belief in</v>

28
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:14.800
<v Speaker 1>the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>the most profound truth is that life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

30
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.031
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

31
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Life is suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't blame that on anyone.</v>

32
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do about it?</v>

33
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe nothing,</v>

34
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the jigs up,</v>

35
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>it's hopeless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe here's something.</v>

37
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>What do you have against the suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the malevolence.</v>

38
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you have possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have potential in front of you,</v>

39
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>inside of you even whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the question,</v>

40
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.813
<v Speaker 1>what would your life be like if you made</v>
<v Speaker 1>use of all the potential that you were </v>

41
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:46.674
<v Speaker 1>offered?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the optimistic question because </v>

42
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>you can test it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

43
00:01:50.731 --> 00:01:52.120
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'll just try that for a year.</v>

44
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>

45
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.133
<v Speaker 1>Do the best I can at everything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>offers itself to me just as an </v>

46
00:01:58.021 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 1>experiment and then I'm going to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

47
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>is my life better or as my life worse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you try it for a year.</v>

48
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:03.980
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

49
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>So actually better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friendships are better.</v>

50
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>My family's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

51
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm less anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more positively oriented.</v>

52
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm less resentful and bitter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>jealous and angry,</v>

53
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more physically healthy.</v>

54
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

55
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you still,</v>

56
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>you're not that good at it.</v>

57
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>So what happens if you did that for five</v>
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>

58
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>That's a good addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an addiction.</v>

59
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 1>It's an addiction to possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's also an exponential thing.</v>

60
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:29.184
<v Speaker 1>And this is actually technically true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know this beyond a shadow of the </v>

61
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:32.244
<v Speaker 1>doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this principle that economists </v>

62
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:34.974
<v Speaker 1>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They often call it the matthew </v>

63
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is based on a statement in the new</v>

64
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>testament from those who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

65
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.270
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.153
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to those who have everything more will </v>

67
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:47.010
<v Speaker 1>be given.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from those who have nothing,</v>

68
00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:50.160
<v Speaker 1>everything will be taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a vicious statement.</v>

69
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.540
<v Speaker 1>But what it means is as you go downhill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go downhill faster and faster,</v>

70
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.670
<v Speaker 1>and people know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it isn't linear,</v>

71
00:02:56.671 --> 00:02:58.410
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exponential.</v>

72
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>You do one thing stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then two stupid things happen.</v>

73
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Then for stupid things happen and as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know before you know it,</v>

74
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.883
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

75
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.873
<v Speaker 1>But the reverse of that is also true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do one good thing and then you get </v>

76
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>to opportunities and you fix them up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get four,</v>

77
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.893
<v Speaker 1>and this is how the world works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fundamental economic principle </v>

78
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>and you see because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a small proportion of people have,</v>

79
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>most of the gains accrue to them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones they're healthy.</v>

80
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>That's luck often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.523
<v Speaker 1>they didn't get run over by a bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's lots of arbitrary things </v>

82
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 1>about life that have to go right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But after that,</v>

83
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.583
<v Speaker 1>it's like those are also people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalizing on what they're being </v>

84
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 1>offered without bitterness or </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment.</v>

85
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe it won't work for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have a better.</v>

86
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a better plan in that.</v>
