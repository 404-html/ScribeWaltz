1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.313
<v Speaker 1>You're always contrasting what you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>and happy with what you think is that </v>

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.980
<v Speaker 1>they're both more and wherever there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>deviation,</v>

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>wherever what you want to happen isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

4
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:13.603
<v Speaker 1>Then you feel anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity as well here in pell to </v>

5
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:16.884
<v Speaker 1>explore the anxiety is the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes up first and the larger the </v>

6
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>magnitude of the unexpected occurrence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greater the amount of anxiety.</v>

7
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>One of the things we're going to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine in the courses,</v>

8
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.790
<v Speaker 1>how you can understand how large a </v>
<v Speaker 1>disruption and given unexpected event is</v>

9
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>minor thing.</v>

10
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to this other diner for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Here's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a way of looking at it.</v>

12
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.690
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>you're going to wear three plans to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and this plan doesn't work,</v>

14
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.643
<v Speaker 1>so that means that produces outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't what you envisioned and this </v>

15
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>plan doesn't work.</v>

16
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>It produces on a normal civilian as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

17
00:00:56.851 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>But this plan does work well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's no problem.</v>

18
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean those are pretty minor league </v>
<v Speaker 1>disruptions.</v>

19
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.703
<v Speaker 1>All you do is you keep the same vision </v>
<v Speaker 1>of yourself and the same vision of the </v>

20
00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:06.144
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just switched between plants and </v>

21
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.573
<v Speaker 1>you're really in trouble if none of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>plans work or if someone messes around </v>

22
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:17.490
<v Speaker 1>with your representation of this for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

23
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>so you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

24
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.513
<v Speaker 1>you want to get into medical school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need 30 courses to get into medical </v>

25
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:31.341
<v Speaker 1>school and you should have a's on all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and you get a b plus on one course.</v>

26
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.421
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

27
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>he's done all these other courses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not such a big deal.</v>

28
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.643
<v Speaker 1>It's a minor league disruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It causes you a certain mode of anxiety </v>

29
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 1>and produces a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory behavior.</v>

30
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps go with the professor and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why isn't that I got this being the last</v>

31
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:46.280
<v Speaker 1>one is expecting a don't.</v>

32
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't what that's going to do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision of the ideal future and so on and</v>

33
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one sort of disruption.</v>

34
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>You're a bit anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>

35
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>you have 29 other courses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not such a big deal.</v>

36
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Now instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write down cap and You score in the 50th</v>

37
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.183
<v Speaker 1>percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now you're in trouble because you </v>

38
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:06.294
<v Speaker 1>have a vision of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think this is your version of the </v>

39
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:08.874
<v Speaker 1>unbearable present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know a doctor that's a pain in the </v>

40
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:13.230
<v Speaker 1>neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're a potential doctor.</v>

41
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.153
<v Speaker 1>You have the intellectual resources at </v>
<v Speaker 1>your disposal and the educational </v>

42
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:21.651
<v Speaker 1>background and and and the familial push</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps to make him into a doctor,</v>

43
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>and so that's what you perceived </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself as.</v>

44
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:28.314
<v Speaker 1>That's your story about yourself because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the person with this set number </v>

45
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>of potentials and you also have a visual</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what it is that you're going,</v>

46
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.063
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am score comes back and you're in the </v>

47
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:36.980
<v Speaker 1>15th percentile.</v>

48
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

49
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.343
<v Speaker 1>your ideal future is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem because that means </v>

50
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>that all of the events that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded you,</v>

51
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>that surround you now and as far back as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can remember,</v>

52
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.943
<v Speaker 1>that were given determinant significance</v>
<v Speaker 1>by this particular plan have all been </v>

53
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:57.714
<v Speaker 1>cast into chaos because everything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done up to that point has been </v>

54
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the notion that this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you were going and that means that</v>

55
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.170
<v Speaker 1>the significance that you attributed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

56
00:03:06.171 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>everything was attributed to everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to that goal.</v>

57
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.010
<v Speaker 1>You blow out the goal and all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant,</v>

58
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.300
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back up in the air,</v>

59
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.313
<v Speaker 1>you have to modify your version of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself like what the hell are you </v>

60
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 1>going to do now they're going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor.</v>

61
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.010
<v Speaker 1>He put a lot of work into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's your whole self conception.</v>

62
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 1>Well this is gone.</v>

63
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>This is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is irrelevant,</v>

64
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the other 29 courses,</v>

65
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.123
<v Speaker 1>why the hell are you even here now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one example of the levels at </v>

66
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:39.160
<v Speaker 1>which normally occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minor League anomalies,</v>

67
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just screwed around with when you go</v>

68
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:43.260
<v Speaker 1>to the same place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>major league anomalies,</v>

69
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.113
<v Speaker 1>it's a new ideal future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the reason that people </v>

70
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:52.831
<v Speaker 1>are so prone to ideological conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is an ideology can say it</v>

71
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>has a particular version of the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are.</v>

72
00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Knowing a little bit for me to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>college is pretty.</v>

73
00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.493
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty explicit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the unbearable presence so to </v>

74
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:02.944
<v Speaker 1>speak?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

75
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.413
<v Speaker 1>I know this is a bit dated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're running out of hard line </v>

76
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:07.174
<v Speaker 1>etiologies to fund that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the time the unbearable present </v>

77
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 1>is the class struggle and we kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons for that,</v>

78
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>it's basically the fault of the are </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploring before the ideal future is the</v>

79
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:23.520
<v Speaker 1>point at which those unfair divisions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>capital are eliminated debt.</v>

80
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.090
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole bunch of means to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

81
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.133
<v Speaker 1>That's that's an ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While someone else has a different </v>

82
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.060
<v Speaker 1>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different version of the significance of</v>

83
00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:31.894
<v Speaker 1>current events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different version of the significance </v>

84
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.923
<v Speaker 1>and the nature of the ideal future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they completely different </v>

85
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:39.070
<v Speaker 1>apprehension of how to transform one and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>

86
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 1>With those two cultures come into </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with how,</v>

87
00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:43.054
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make each other anxious because </v>

88
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.060
<v Speaker 1>they're not convinced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>commensurate pools,</v>

89
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.410
<v Speaker 1>and if this is the structure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulates emotion,</v>

90
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.483
<v Speaker 1>well what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just give up your damn plans </v>

91
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 1>because then your emotions are </v>
<v Speaker 1>dysregulated.</v>

92
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.263
<v Speaker 1>We fall into chaos so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where you are and you </v>

93
00:04:58.961 --> 00:04:59.794
<v Speaker 1>don't know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what to do and you don't </v>

94
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 1>know where you're going because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you anxious.</v>

95
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Neither side is going to give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give up near certainty.</v>

96
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.483
<v Speaker 1>The only thing left and under what </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances is conflict and you see </v>

97
00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>this look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do arguments escalate?</v>

98
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 1>An argument with someone that you love </v>
<v Speaker 1>even they want one thing.</v>

99
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Speaker 1>You want another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you discuss it.</v>

100
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.503
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting anywhere your tempers raised </v>

101
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.380
<v Speaker 1>because the abstract discussion isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>

102
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you give up,</v>

103
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.020
<v Speaker 1>maybe move to to violence to solve your </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

104
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.540
<v Speaker 1>to hammer out story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak and do that,</v>

105
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 1>but still oppressing the person who has </v>
<v Speaker 1>the different different.</v>
