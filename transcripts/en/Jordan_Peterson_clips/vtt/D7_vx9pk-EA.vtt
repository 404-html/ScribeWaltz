1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.010
<v Speaker 1>To what extent do you believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse with moderate Muslims can lead</v>

2
00:00:03.011 --> 00:00:03.844
<v Speaker 1>to reform of the ideology such that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gap between Islamic and Western beliefs </v>

3
00:00:07.781 --> 00:00:09.400
<v Speaker 1>can be bridged?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.383
<v Speaker 1>I guess we're going to find out about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because that's one of the things I </v>

5
00:00:12.131 --> 00:00:13.750
<v Speaker 1>want to do over the next couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

6
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>

7
00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:18.670
<v Speaker 1>there's only three states of being there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is tyranny,</v>

8
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.990
<v Speaker 1>there's slavery and there's negotiation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

9
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.720
<v Speaker 1>tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyranny and slavery are forms of war.</v>

10
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.793
<v Speaker 1>So we either enter into discourse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully with the moderate Muslims or </v>

11
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.760
<v Speaker 1>we're the tyrants or they're the tyrants</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're the slaves,</v>

12
00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:35.950
<v Speaker 1>or they're the slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's war.</v>

13
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.993
<v Speaker 1>And so we bloody well better have </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse because war is what happens </v>

14
00:00:40.181 --> 00:00:42.940
<v Speaker 1>when discourse fails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

15
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.070
<v Speaker 1>we actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways,</v>

16
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>we can't really go to war anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're so armed.</v>

17
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.560
<v Speaker 1>And increasingly that's also the case in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Muslim world.</v>

18
00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at Pakistan,</v>

19
00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:55.444
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's developing a pretty decent nuclear </v>

20
00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our movement of nuclear,</v>

21
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.310
<v Speaker 1>a deterrent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

22
00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:01.144
<v Speaker 1>which is quite terrifying because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan is one unstable and dangerous </v>

23
00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:05.980
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

24
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.873
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go to war with people </v>

25
00:01:07.991 --> 00:01:09.400
<v Speaker 1>who have hydrogen bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

26
00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:12.520
<v Speaker 1>that's not gonna work out very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we bloody well better learn to talk.</v>

27
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm hoping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this biblical series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which some of you may be no,</v>

29
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.900
<v Speaker 1>but in parallel without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing,</v>

30
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.380
<v Speaker 1>I want to do a very long series of </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions with moderate Muslims,</v>

31
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.350
<v Speaker 1>theological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical,</v>

32
00:01:26.351 --> 00:01:27.184
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>practical to see if the gap between </v>

33
00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Islamic and western beliefs can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>bridged.</v>

34
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.740
<v Speaker 1>I better be able to be bridged because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're on the same planet man.</v>

35
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.480
<v Speaker 1>And there's lots of both of us.</v>

36
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.313
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

37
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.630
<v Speaker 1>capitulation on either side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't going to work.</v>

38
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.340
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like blind ignorance of the,</v>

39
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.293
<v Speaker 1>of the dangers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mutual dangers that our society's post </v>

40
00:01:48.311 --> 00:01:49.144
<v Speaker 1>to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

41
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.193
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic societies are functional </v>

42
00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:53.884
<v Speaker 1>traditional societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're threatened in that functional </v>

43
00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:58.084
<v Speaker 1>traditionalism by radical western </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological and philosophical </v>

44
00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:05.380
<v Speaker 1>revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like worth threatened as Westerners</v>

45
00:02:05.381 --> 00:02:08.890
<v Speaker 1>ourselves by our own technological and </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical,</v>

46
00:02:08.891 --> 00:02:13.891
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary nature discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truthful discourse,</v>

47
00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

48
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.200
<v Speaker 1>that's the hope for the salvation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

49
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.570
<v Speaker 1>And so hopefully we'll put it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>

50
00:02:19.571 --> 00:02:20.404
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met a number of moderate Muslims </v>

51
00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:22.894
<v Speaker 1>already in Canada who are extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in this sort of thing and </v>

52
00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:27.340
<v Speaker 1>some in the u s as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that,</v>

53
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:30.970
<v Speaker 1>it's worth a try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

55
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.383
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
