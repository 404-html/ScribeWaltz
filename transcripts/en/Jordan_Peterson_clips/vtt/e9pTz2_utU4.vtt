1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the example of rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I love.</v>

2
00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:03.594
<v Speaker 1>This is Jaak Panksepp work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wrote a book called affective </v>

3
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:06.770
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would I,</v>

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.820
<v Speaker 1>which I would highly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly recommend.</v>

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 1>I have a list of readings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recommended readings on my website.</v>

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant book and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant psychologist,</v>

7
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>really one of the top top psychologist </v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

8
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:22.290
<v Speaker 1>both theoretically and experimentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real genius.</v>

9
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.410
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy who discovered that rats </v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh when you tickle them.</v>

10
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>They loud laugh ultrasonically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can't actually hear them,</v>

11
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:29.754
<v Speaker 1>but if you record it and slow it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can hear them giggling away </v>

12
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:33.054
<v Speaker 1>when you tickle them with an eraser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of like their mother's </v>

13
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.234
<v Speaker 1>tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's often what lab people use as a </v>

14
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>substitute for the licking of the little</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrapped by the mother.</v>

15
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

16
00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>and he discovered the place circuit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in mammals,</v>

17
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:46.530
<v Speaker 1>which is like a major deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

18
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.363
<v Speaker 1>He should get a Nobel prize for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal to discover an entire </v>

19
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:54.250
<v Speaker 1>motivational circuit whose existence no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one had really predicted,</v>

20
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from the fact that obviously </v>

21
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:58.760
<v Speaker 1>mammals play and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even lizards,</v>

22
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>maybe some of the more social lizards </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to play,</v>

23
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyhow,</v>

24
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.673
<v Speaker 1>but panksepp observed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a brilliant piece of </v>

25
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that first of all,</v>

26
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>juvenile male routes in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like too rough and tumble play.</v>

27
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 1>They like to wrestle and they actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>pin each other just like little kids do.</v>

28
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:18.174
<v Speaker 1>Or like adult wrestlers do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pin their shoulders down and that </v>

29
00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>basically means you win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

30
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's pretty cool.</v>

31
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:27.180
<v Speaker 1>But what's even cooler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think while there's three things,</v>

32
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:28.014
<v Speaker 1>one is the rats will work for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to get into an arena where </v>

33
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>they know that play might occur.</v>

34
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.320
<v Speaker 1>And so that's one of the scientific ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>of testing in animals motivation,</v>

35
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you have a starving wrath and</v>

36
00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:43.140
<v Speaker 1>it knows that it's got food down the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a corridor.</v>

37
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.183
<v Speaker 1>You can put a little spring on its tail </v>
<v Speaker 1>and measure how hard it pulls and that </v>

38
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:49.260
<v Speaker 1>gives you an indication of it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational force.</v>

39
00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:50.094
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine the starving rat that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get to some food and you have </v>

40
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>a little spring on his tail and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked in some cat odor,</v>

41
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.090
<v Speaker 1>so now that route is starving and wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get out of there.</v>

42
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.790
<v Speaker 1>He's going to try to pull even farther </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the food,</v>

43
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>so getting away plus getting forward are</v>
<v Speaker 1>separate motivational systems and if you</v>

44
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:07.464
<v Speaker 1>can add them together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real potent and part of the reason </v>

45
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.513
<v Speaker 1>why in the future authoring exercise </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you guys are going to do as the </v>

46
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:14.904
<v Speaker 1>class progresses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're asked to outline the place you'd </v>

47
00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:19.020
<v Speaker 1>like to end up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is your desired future,</v>

48
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:19.854
<v Speaker 1>and also the place that you could end up</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you let everything fall apart is so </v>

49
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:28.821
<v Speaker 1>that your anxiety chases you and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach systems pull you forward.</v>

50
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>You're maximally motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>

51
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.033
<v Speaker 1>and it's important because otherwise you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be afraid of pursuing the things </v>

52
00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>that you want to pursue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

53
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.923
<v Speaker 1>And that's very common and so then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear inhibits you as the promise pulls </v>

54
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:42.444
<v Speaker 1>you forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it makes you weak because you're </v>

55
00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to get your fear behind you,</v>

56
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>pushing you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what you want to be as afraid,</v>

57
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>more afraid of not pursuing your goals </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you are of pursuing them.</v>

58
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very helpful.</v>

59
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.343
<v Speaker 1>And lots of times in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something really worth </v>

60
00:02:57.781 --> 00:02:59.090
<v Speaker 1>knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the advantages to being </v>
<v Speaker 1>an tournament's adult,</v>

62
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>is you don't get to pick the best thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to pick your poison.</v>

63
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.023
<v Speaker 1>You have two bad choices and you get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick which one you're willing to suffer </v>

64
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:10.744
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every choice has a bit of that </v>

65
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>element in it.</v>

66
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.713
<v Speaker 1>And so if you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really freeing because otherwise </v>

67
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>you torture yourself by thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

68
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a good solution to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

69
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>compared to the bad solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

70
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes there's just risky solution,</v>

71
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:25.924
<v Speaker 1>one and risky solution to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes both of them are really </v>

72
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:30.754
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you at least get to pick which one </v>

73
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.060
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to suffer through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

74
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>that actually makes quite a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference because you're also facing it</v>

75
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily then instead of it chasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

76
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>And that is an entire different entirely</v>
<v Speaker 1>different psychophysiological response.</v>

77
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.873
<v Speaker 1>Challenge versus threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same even if the magnitude </v>

78
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.073
<v Speaker 1>of the problem is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so putting yourself in a </v>

79
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 1>challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it mind frame,</v>

80
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.873
<v Speaker 1>you can't just do that by magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putting yourself in a challenging </v>

81
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.193
<v Speaker 1>mindframe is much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much easier on you psychophysiological </v>

82
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>because you don't produce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't go into the generalized stress</v>

83
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:04.984
<v Speaker 1>response to the same degree and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>activating your exploratory and seeking </v>

84
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:09.034
<v Speaker 1>systems which are dopaminergic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we mediated and that involved positive </v>

85
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you can face something voluntarily</v>

86
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:16.294
<v Speaker 1>rather than having to chase you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way better for you cycle </v>

87
00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:19.554
<v Speaker 1>physiologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's partly why it's worthwhile to </v>

88
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:27.490
<v Speaker 1>go find the dragon in its layer instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>of waiting for it to come and eat you.</v>

89
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.863
<v Speaker 1>So and especially when you also add the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that if you go find the dragon in </v>

90
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:32.854
<v Speaker 1>it's layer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might find it when it's a baby </v>

91
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 1>instead of a full fledged bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>

92
00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:38.470
<v Speaker 1>That is definitely going to take you </v>
<v Speaker 1>down</v>

93
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.480
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
