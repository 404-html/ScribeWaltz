00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Your authentic leftism is populist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.000
<v Speaker 1>It is based in working class style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working class language,</v>

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:07.893
<v Speaker 1>working class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>direct emotion and an openness and </v>

4
00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:11.860
<v Speaker 1>brushing some speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.873

<v Speaker 1>contorted jargon of the pseudo leftist </v>

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.310
<v Speaker 1>of academe who are frauds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people,</v>

7
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.263
<v Speaker 1>these people who managed to manage to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rise to the top and ended at Berkeley </v>

8
00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:24.340
<v Speaker 1>and Harvard and Princeton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.960
<v Speaker 1>You have any of these people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical.</v>

10
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.480
<v Speaker 1>They are career people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their corporate types.</v>

11
00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:29.314
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then who like who succeeded in and they </v>

12
00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:31.384
<v Speaker 1>love the institutional context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know how to manipulate the </v>

13
00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy which has totally invaded in</v>
<v Speaker 1>usurped.</v>

14
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The or they have an academe everywhere.</v>

15
00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are company poor players.</v>

16
00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.000
<v Speaker 1>They could have done well in any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any field,</v>

17
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.310
<v Speaker 1>and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love to sit in endless committees.</v>

18
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.680
<v Speaker 1>They love bureaucratic regulation and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

19
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.560
<v Speaker 1>There's not one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not one leftist.</v>

20
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.393
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And American academe raised his or her </v>

21
00:00:53.111 --> 00:00:53.944
<v Speaker 1>voice against obscene growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Growth of tuition costs which have </v>

22
00:00:57.761 --> 00:00:59.920
<v Speaker 1>bankrupted a whole generation of young </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

23
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not one voice.</v>

24
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To challenge that.</v>

25
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.350
<v Speaker 1>That invasion by the bureaucrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

26
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Actual fascist bureaucrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if whoever added the cancerous,</v>

28
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many of them can.</v>

29
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:15.340
<v Speaker 1>If they told the faculty have completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost any power in American academia.</v>

30
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.203
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's us.</v>

31
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.133
<v Speaker 1>It's a scandal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What has happened and they deserve the </v>

32
00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:21.160
<v Speaker 1>president's servitude that they're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

33
00:01:21.161 --> 00:01:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they never protested.</v>

34
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.180
<v Speaker 1>When I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first job at Bennington College,</v>

35
00:01:25.181 --> 00:01:26.014
<v Speaker 1>1976.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there when there was an uprising </v>

36
00:01:28.031 --> 00:01:28.864
<v Speaker 1>by the faculty against encroachment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the board of trustees and the </v>

37
00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:32.104
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

38
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.700
<v Speaker 1>And it was a huge thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

39
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.553
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was reported on the New York Times </v>

40
00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:36.430
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we.</v>

41
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.293
<v Speaker 1>And we pushed that president out and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's not been a single uprising </v>

42
00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:42.490
<v Speaker 1>of mankind against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>against encroachment,</v>

43
00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:45.910
<v Speaker 1>by the trustees and by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrations and all these decades.</v>

44
00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Passive slaves.</v>

45
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They deserve their slavery.</v>

46
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't agree more.</v>

47
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.230
<v Speaker 2>I thought the same thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>university professors for a long time is</v>

48
00:01:56.231 --> 00:02:00.130
<v Speaker 2>that they get exactly what they deserve </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they never stand up and say no.</v>

49
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.210
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not quite as bad in Canada,</v>

50
00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:07.690
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that the students have been</v>

51
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.703
<v Speaker 2>essentially handed a bill of indentured </v>
<v Speaker 2>servitude here for the student loans is </v>

52
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:13.660
<v Speaker 2>absolutely beyond comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

53
00:02:13.661 --> 00:02:14.494
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that the bureaucracy has </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically conspired to determine how to </v>

54
00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:21.490
<v Speaker 2>pick the pockets of the students' future</v>
<v Speaker 2>earnings.</v>

55
00:02:21.491 --> 00:02:22.324
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they do that by offering them an </v>

56
00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:26.560
<v Speaker 2>extended adolescence with no quality </v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

57
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.290
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a real bargain with the devil.</v>
