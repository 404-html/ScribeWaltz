1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.760
<v Speaker 1>At some point we weren't linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures at all,</v>

2
00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:03.594
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We separated from the common ancestors </v>

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.510
<v Speaker 1>between us and chimpanzees about 6 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million years ago.</v>

4
00:00:08.511 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>And sometime during that 6 million year </v>
<v Speaker 1>process we started to be able to imitate</v>

5
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:13.854
<v Speaker 1>ourselves first and then represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in image and action and then </v>

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>only after that to start to articulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

7
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the knowledge that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>is grounded in our embodiment,</v>

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.143
<v Speaker 1>but also in the shaping of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodiment across extraordinary long </v>

9
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like there's an implicit way of being</v>

10
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 1>in your form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your embodied form,</v>

11
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:38.334
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an implicit way of being that's </v>

12
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:41.634
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of the fact that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed within hierarchical social </v>

13
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:47.304
<v Speaker 1>structures for far longer than we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>even sharing a common ancestor say with </v>

14
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:55.920
<v Speaker 1>great apes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's for maybe hundreds of millions</v>

15
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.200
<v Speaker 1>of years with regards to being embedded </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a hierarchy.</v>

16
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.210
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

17
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>for embedded in the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have been forever,</v>

18
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.040
<v Speaker 1>that's about 350 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

19
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 1>is there a set of attributes that tends </v>
<v Speaker 1>reliably to move you up the hierarchy?</v>

20
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Because if there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see being going up,</v>

21
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:19.350
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy increases the probability </v>
<v Speaker 1>of reproductive success.</v>

22
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.933
<v Speaker 1>So there's actually nothing more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to determine over the course </v>

23
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:28.131
<v Speaker 1>of 350 million years inside a hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then how it is that you ratchet yourself</v>

24
00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:29.844
<v Speaker 1>up the hierarchy reliably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could think about that in some </v>

25
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:33.294
<v Speaker 1>sense as the source of ideals here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a kind of a concrete way of </v>

26
00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 1>thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:42.540
<v Speaker 1>if you get a hundred men together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to,</v>

28
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>they're going to organize themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a hierarchical structure.</v>

29
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.663
<v Speaker 1>They have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they're going to stay chaotic and </v>

30
00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>fight that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other alternative.</v>

31
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.560
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way that,</v>

32
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the people who are going to rise to</v>

33
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:57.144
<v Speaker 1>the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might rise to the top because of </v>

34
00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>their sheer physical prowess and power.</v>

35
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.303
<v Speaker 1>But they also might rise to the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're very competent at </v>

36
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:05.424
<v Speaker 1>certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's as if all the men are going to </v>

37
00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:08.184
<v Speaker 1>get together and vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that would actually happen to </v>

38
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:11.724
<v Speaker 1>determine who best embodies the spirit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the group and who should be granted </v>

39
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in an evolutionary context,</v>

40
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:18.204
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would also help ensure that that </v>

41
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>person would propagate their genes into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next generation.</v>

42
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:26.490
<v Speaker 1>And it's not a trivial effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially among men.</v>

43
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a big effect because roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

44
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>half half of all men or are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductively successful.</v>

45
00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>So there's a wicked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a wicked,</v>

46
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calling,</v>

47
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>let's say among men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you can see this among chimpanzees</v>

48
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have dominance hierarchies.</v>

49
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of chimps rise to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

50
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:45.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

51
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>like caveman chimp who's best at </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounding out all the,</v>

52
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>all the rivals.</v>

53
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.453
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out that that's not exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>the case in France to wall has done a </v>

54
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:54.294
<v Speaker 1>very good job of detailing this with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>work on chimpanzees in particular and </v>

55
00:02:57.541 --> 00:03:02.541
<v Speaker 1>he's found that the power hungry tyrant </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of chimp can rule for a while,</v>

56
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:03.604
<v Speaker 1>but he tends to have a very unstable </v>
<v Speaker 1>kingdom and the reason for that is is </v>

57
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>it's not very good at mutually grooming </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not good.</v>

58
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:10.744
<v Speaker 1>It's socially connecting with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>males and he isn't popular among the </v>

59
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 1>females and doesn't attend to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the young essentially.</v>

60
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is even if he's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meanest,</v>

61
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 1>toughest guy on the block to subordinate</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps team up,</v>

62
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>they make friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they groom each other and they have each</v>

63
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:27.814
<v Speaker 1>other's backs and in a one day he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>having an off day because he ate too </v>

64
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>many fermented bananas the night before </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like they just tear them into pieces</v>

65
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>and chimps are unbelievably strong and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably brutal.</v>

66
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.393
<v Speaker 1>They seem to have absolutely no internal</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulation whatsoever of their </v>

67
00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:44.154
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That all seems to be manifested outside </v>

68
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>in terms of dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

69
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:48.844
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know that because they go on </v>

70
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:50.944
<v Speaker 1>raiding parties into other chimp </v>
<v Speaker 1>territories and when they find chimps </v>

71
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>that aren't part of their hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just ripped them into pieces.</v>

72
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.960
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a scary thing if you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about our similarity with chimpanzees,</v>

73
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 1>cause we like to think we have internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>controls over our aggression,</v>

74
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's not so bloody obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that.</v>

75
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.943
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the wall found was that it's </v>

76
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:13.360
<v Speaker 1>actually chimps that are more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

77
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 1>you might say humane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although Champaign,</v>

78
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what the equivalent is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say humane that managed to produce</v>

79
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies that are more stable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually managed to stay alive on top of</v>

80
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:26.494
<v Speaker 1>them for much longer periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he thinks about that as the </v>

81
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 1>emergence of an implicit morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

82
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>So morality that's acted out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>

83
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

84
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>there are different ways of climbing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hierarchy.</v>

85
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 1>There are worse and better ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The better ways allow you to live longer</v>

86
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:42.184
<v Speaker 1>in a more stable hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the evolutionary payoff for that is </v>

87
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 1>that you leave more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more descendants.</v>

88
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.543
<v Speaker 1>And so the hierarchy itself becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very powerful shaping mechanism that </v>

89
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:53.224
<v Speaker 1>determines how it is that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to adapt because it's the primary </v>

90
00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 1>method of selection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's an ethic in there.</v>

91
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.110
<v Speaker 1>There's an ethic that emerges from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social interactions,</v>

92
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 1>but that's rapidly transformed into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological selection device.</v>

93
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.143
<v Speaker 1>And so were selected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's especially true among human </v>

94
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:14.641
<v Speaker 1>beings because with chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the females are indiscriminant maters,</v>

95
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that a female champion </v>
<v Speaker 1>heat,</v>

96
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:19.414
<v Speaker 1>we'll meet with any mail chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the dominant males chase the </v>

97
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:24.394
<v Speaker 1>subordinate males away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's still more likely to leave </v>

98
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 1>offspring than the subordinates.</v>

99
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.030
<v Speaker 1>But it's not because of the females,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but human females are different.</v>

100
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Human females exert choice and quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal choice.</v>

101
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:38.260
<v Speaker 1>You might put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very choosy.</v>

102
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:42.010
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the things that seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have distinguished us from chimpanzees.</v>

103
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:42.844
<v Speaker 1>And what roughly seems to happen is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the male dominance hierarchy elects men </v>

104
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 1>to the higher say rungs of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

105
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:50.764
<v Speaker 1>And then the females peel from the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that what you can say </v>

106
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 1>is that human beings are the consequence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of intense male dominance competition.</v>

107
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's competition for the upper rungs</v>

108
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>of the hierarchy mediated by female </v>
<v Speaker 1>selection.</v>
