00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.860
<v Speaker 1>If you're not united within yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to be united in relationship to</v>

2
00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 1>a higher purpose to be united within </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:07.554
<v Speaker 1>then you're weak and the world will take</v>
<v Speaker 1>you apart and and and the reason it </v>

4
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:15.030
<v Speaker 1>takes you apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think as partly because life is,</v>

5
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.013
<v Speaker 1>is rife with suffering and it certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>bounded by mortality and those are very </v>

6
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:20.304
<v Speaker 1>grim fats and unless you have hammered </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself together to find a destiny </v>

7
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>that's of sufficient nobility so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the so that those negative elements</v>

8
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:31.044
<v Speaker 1>become tolerable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the suffering will take you apart </v>

9
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:34.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

10
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.550
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and demolish you.</v>

11
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not optional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is you might say,</v>

12
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that have to do with God?</v>

13
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose that depends on what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

14
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you interpret God,</v>

15
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:50.100
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly at least has to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the finding of a transcendent purpose.</v>

16
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.503
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do that through consultation </v>

17
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

18
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.783
<v Speaker 1>and you're yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a kind of a way of looking </v>

19
00:00:57.301 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>at things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that curl you can develop your self that</v>

20
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about is the higher self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That tells you,</v>

21
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:05.004
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when your pursuit of impulsive pleasure </v>

22
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:08.514
<v Speaker 1>has demeaned you or or interfered with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your proper motive being and people </v>

23
00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:14.154
<v Speaker 1>understand that experience very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to talk to someone very </v>

24
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>long until you can discover what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>ashamed of.</v>

25
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:20.574
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why be ashamed if you aren't doing </v>

26
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:26.520
<v Speaker 1>something that demeans you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why have contempt for yourself if you're</v>

27
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:27.354
<v Speaker 1>not missing the mark and with and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that you have shame and self </v>

28
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:31.734
<v Speaker 1>contempt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He indicates that there's something in </v>

29
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:36.870
<v Speaker 1>you that striving beyond what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently investigating and and for your</v>

30
00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>libertarian types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I would say,</v>

31
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to Kowtow to an arbitrary</v>

32
00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:43.614
<v Speaker 1>external authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although often there's use in that from </v>

33
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:47.124
<v Speaker 1>a disciplinary perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I could say just as </v>

34
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.293
<v Speaker 1>straightforwardly and usefully that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewers and listeners could merely stop </v>

35
00:01:57.661 --> 00:02:00.300
<v Speaker 1>doing what they know themselves to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

36
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.763
<v Speaker 1>Forget about what anyone else thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you know when you've </v>

37
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 1>transgressed against your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your being and we we could say,</v>

38
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an ethical.</v>

39
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>It's an ethical necessity to limit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transgressions,</v>

40
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.910
<v Speaker 1>transgressions that you can identify </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the nature of your being,</v>

41
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>and I don't see that that's a disputable</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

42
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Unless someone can step forward and </v>
<v Speaker 1>claim.</v>

43
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.260
<v Speaker 1>While I never feel any shame and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything I do,</v>

44
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:26.094
<v Speaker 1>I believe to be 100 percent right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like get away from that person </v>

45
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:30.720
<v Speaker 1>unless they're the Buddha.</v>
