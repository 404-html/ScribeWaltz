00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>There's a chapter in my book called </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't ever don't let your children do </v>

2
00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:08.250
<v Speaker 1>anything that makes you dislike them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty happy about this chapter,</v>

3
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:13.251
<v Speaker 1>although I suspect it will be rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial and it's predicated on the</v>

4
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:18.270
<v Speaker 1>observation that many people hurt their </v>
<v Speaker 1>children physically and psychologically,</v>

5
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.633
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everyone gets sentimental about </v>

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between parents and </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

7
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:26.640
<v Speaker 1>But that's especially in relationship to</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves because they think,</v>

8
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:27.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.613
<v Speaker 1>of course I'm going to be a good parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not so bloody obvious </v>

10
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to be a good parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

11
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:34.554
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what I see happening with </v>

12
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:37.464
<v Speaker 1>people who don't know how to discipline </v>
<v Speaker 1>their children is that the children run </v>

13
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:41.724
<v Speaker 1>roughshod over them in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call them a hierarchical disputes </v>

14
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:46.374
<v Speaker 1>because children push for position and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and they do that behaviorally </v>

15
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>to sort of feel out the contours of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social structure.</v>

16
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.560
<v Speaker 1>So you know your kid locked perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine at home,</v>

17
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:56.394
<v Speaker 1>let's say at the dinner table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you take them to a stranger's </v>

18
00:00:58.651 --> 00:00:59.484
<v Speaker 1>dinner table and all of a sudden they </v>
<v Speaker 1>act out and you think what's up with </v>

19
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:02.784
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your little monster and what's up is </v>

20
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:07.280
<v Speaker 1>that they're trying to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the power structure is in the new.</v>

21
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>They don't know this of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're acting this out there trying</v>

22
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:11.034
<v Speaker 1>to figure out if the same rules apply in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this new situation as apply in the old </v>

23
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 1>situation and they can't ask that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even know that they are rules</v>

24
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>exactly there regularities that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned and so they'll test and test and</v>

25
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>then you have to show them that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

26
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 1>it's the same here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same in this situation,</v>

27
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>but lots of parents are very uneasy with</v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplining their children.</v>

28
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:32.844
<v Speaker 1>Partly because there they believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you give a child infinite freedom </v>

29
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>that's best for them and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraints are inappropriate,</v>

30
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>which is really just.</v>

31
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.603
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to say about that </v>

32
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:43.314
<v Speaker 1>except it's so untrue that that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to think of anything </v>

33
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:49.430
<v Speaker 1>that's more untreated now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the thing is,</v>

34
00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>is if you let your children take </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of you,</v>

35
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>if you have an ounce of spine and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ounce of aggression,</v>

36
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>which you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you don't admit it,</v>

37
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>then you will take revenge on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

38
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.033
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if they have a temper tantrum in a </v>

39
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 1>grocery store and embarrass you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which Gerald,</v>

40
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 1>who's can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can do quite effectively,</v>

41
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you wouldn't let them have that </v>

42
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:14.700
<v Speaker 1>pack of crayons or a chocolate bar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know you,</v>

43
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.920
<v Speaker 1>you tell yourself it's okay and that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>

44
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>you know that that really didn't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that angry and it's okay,</v>

45
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:20.784
<v Speaker 1>but you're fuming inside and then you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>home and half an hour later maybe the </v>

46
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:26.760
<v Speaker 1>child is doing some interesting little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of work,</v>

47
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.653
<v Speaker 1>maybe artwork or something or does </v>
<v Speaker 1>something good and comes up for a </v>

48
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:30.480
<v Speaker 1>reward.</v>

49
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.313
<v Speaker 1>It's like the probability that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to reward that child properly </v>

50
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>under those circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>

51
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.090
<v Speaker 1>You're going to take the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take your revenge,</v>

52
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're not much of the parent.</v>

53
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.133
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the trick with kids is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if your child is doing something </v>

54
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:49.224
<v Speaker 1>that makes you dislike them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to figure out how to stop </v>

55
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>them from doing that and teach them how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it properly.</v>

56
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:56.580
<v Speaker 1>And you have to talk to your wife to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that you're not being too much</v>

57
00:02:56.581 --> 00:02:57.780
<v Speaker 1>of a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

58
00:02:57.781 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>And the same with her.</v>
