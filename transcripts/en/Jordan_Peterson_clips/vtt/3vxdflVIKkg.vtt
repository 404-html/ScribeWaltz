<v Speaker 1>To what extent do you think your tips </v>
<v Speaker 1>for young people clean your room mate </v>

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.920
<v Speaker 1>deschedule read great books are </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on your own personality?</v>

3
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.713
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're predicated on my </v>

4
00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:13.024
<v Speaker 1>personality to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that a lot of my </v>

5
00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:19.030
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness such as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been learned.</v>

6
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.330
<v Speaker 1>I think our disciplined myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in graduate school,</v>

7
00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:27.310
<v Speaker 1>so I don't think it was necessarily an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic part of my personality.</v>

8
00:00:27.311 --> 00:00:28.144
<v Speaker 1>I think it's something that I learned to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do because I felt that I had something </v>

9
00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:32.830
<v Speaker 1>that was worthwhile to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

10
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.223
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to answer it beyond </v>

11
00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:40.360
<v Speaker 1>that because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.270
<v Speaker 1>I am affected by my own personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

13
00:00:43.271 --> 00:00:44.104
<v Speaker 1>Although I think that I give advice </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty balanced across all the </v>

14
00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:48.430
<v Speaker 1>dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:49.264
<v Speaker 1>like I think that you should be capable </v>
<v Speaker 1>of speaking in public fluently and that </v>

16
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.970
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups of people.</v>

17
00:00:57.971 --> 00:01:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I think that you should be able to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>solitary work on your own.</v>

18
00:01:00.971 --> 00:01:01.804
<v Speaker 1>So that covers it.</v>
