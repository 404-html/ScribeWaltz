00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.630
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you can be virtually </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain of in life is that you don't get</v>

2
00:00:03.631 --> 00:00:06.930
<v Speaker 1>something you don't aim at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that's interesting</v>

3
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:07.764
<v Speaker 1>about that is often people will keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>their goals fuzzy because one of the </v>

4
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>problems with specifying your goals as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you specify your failures,</v>

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the goal is really fuzzy,</v>

6
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>you're not sure when you fail and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can fool yourself.</v>

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.061
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

8
00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>but you can kind of keep it foggy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you make your goal sharp and clear,</v>

9
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 1>then well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

10
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:28.374
<v Speaker 1>then you know what to aim at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's interesting is you know your </v>

11
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 1>brain is set up so that it reorganizes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world around your aims.</v>

12
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.873
<v Speaker 1>And that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also written about this and 12 </v>

13
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:39.480
<v Speaker 1>rules for life quite extensively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not a.</v>
