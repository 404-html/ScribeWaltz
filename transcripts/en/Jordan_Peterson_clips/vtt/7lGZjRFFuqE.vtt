1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.410
<v Speaker 1>So I got a story to tell you that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might like,</v>

2
00:00:02.411 --> 00:00:04.780
<v Speaker 1>because I've thought a lot about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>use of language,</v>

3
00:00:04.781 --> 00:00:05.614
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because language can be used as </v>

4
00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:09.280
<v Speaker 1>camouflage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here's the story.</v>

5
00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:10.114
<v Speaker 1>I think I got this from Robert Sapolsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was talking about zebras and </v>

6
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.903
<v Speaker 1>zebras of course have stripes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically that's associated with </v>

7
00:00:18.341 --> 00:00:19.174
<v Speaker 1>camouflage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a straightforward </v>

8
00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:24.880
<v Speaker 1>association because zebras are black and</v>
<v Speaker 1>white and they're on the velt along with</v>

9
00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:25.714
<v Speaker 1>the lions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lions are camouflage because their </v>

10
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.353
<v Speaker 1>grasp colored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the bloody zebras are black and </v>

11
00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see them like 15 miles away.</v>

12
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>So okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So biologists go out to study zebras and</v>

13
00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:39.820
<v Speaker 1>they're like making notes on a zebra and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they watch it and then they look down at</v>

14
00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:41.440
<v Speaker 1>their notes and then they look up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>

15
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.483
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know which Zebra I was looking </v>

16
00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:45.010
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

17
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>So the camouflage is actually against </v>
<v Speaker 1>the herd because the zebras,</v>

18
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.870
<v Speaker 1>a herd animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not an individual.</v>

19
00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:50.704
<v Speaker 1>And so the black and white stripes </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakup the animal against the herd so </v>

20
00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:54.454
<v Speaker 1>you can't identify it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this was a quandary for the </v>

21
00:00:56.381 --> 00:00:58.420
<v Speaker 1>biologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they did one of two things,</v>

22
00:00:58.421 --> 00:01:01.180
<v Speaker 1>one was drive a jeep up to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the zebra,</v>

23
00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:04.450
<v Speaker 1>heard and use a dab of red paint and Dab</v>
<v Speaker 1>the horn.</v>

24
00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Should the zebra or tag it with an ear </v>
<v Speaker 1>tag like used for cattle.</v>

25
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.950
<v Speaker 1>The lions would kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as it became identifiable the</v>

26
00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

27
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.890
<v Speaker 1>the predators could organize their hunt </v>
<v Speaker 1>around that.</v>

28
00:01:17.891 --> 00:01:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Identify all about animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you know there's the old idea</v>

29
00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:23.530
<v Speaker 1>that lions and predators take down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weak animals,</v>

30
00:01:23.531 --> 00:01:26.380
<v Speaker 1>but they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take down the identifiable animals.</v>

31
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.470
<v Speaker 1>So that's the thing is if you stick your</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn head up,</v>

32
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.510
<v Speaker 1>you get picked off by predators.</v>

33
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.343
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that academics </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to do is congregate together in </v>

34
00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:37.900
<v Speaker 1>heard like entities and then they share </v>
<v Speaker 1>a language,</v>

35
00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:38.734
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the language unites them and also </v>

36
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.093
<v Speaker 1>keeps them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as they share the same set of </v>

37
00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:44.674
<v Speaker 1>linguistic tools among themselves there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know that there isn't anybody in </v>

38
00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:48.694
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the codery that's going to attack </v>

39
00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:53.140
<v Speaker 1>them or deed destabilize the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>herd.</v>

40
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.920
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to me to account for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>impenetrable use of language.</v>

41
00:01:56.921 --> 00:01:57.850
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

42
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.713
<v Speaker 1>it's group protection strategy and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>has absolutely nothing to do with the </v>

43
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.673
<v Speaker 1>search for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the search for security within a </v>

44
00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:07.510
<v Speaker 1>system and not the desire to expand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
