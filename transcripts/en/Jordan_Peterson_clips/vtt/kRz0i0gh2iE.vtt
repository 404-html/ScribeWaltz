00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Just one or two questions I have a gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>male.</v>

2
00:00:05.591 --> 00:00:07.100
<v Speaker 1>I want to say thank you for speaking the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.233
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely ballistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next two questions I want to get </v>

4
00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:15.184
<v Speaker 1>your social contract and the safe space </v>
<v Speaker 1>that university I turned to push on us </v>

5
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.483
<v Speaker 1>as well as what your view on this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>white privilege thing is that </v>

6
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.820
<v Speaker 1>universities like unt Rogerson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gail,</v>

7
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 1>all these other universities in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>crandall?</v>

8
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.953
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea of white privilege is </v>

9
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 2>absolutely reprehensible</v>

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 3>and it's not because people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>traveling.</v>

11
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.943
<v Speaker 2>You know we have all sorts of privileges</v>
<v Speaker 2>and most people have privileges of all </v>

12
00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:43.844
<v Speaker 2>sorts and you should be grateful for </v>
<v Speaker 2>your privileges and work to deserve </v>

13
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:46.994
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

14
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.193
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that you can target an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnic group with a collective crime </v>

15
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:53.623
<v Speaker 2>regardless of the specific innocence or </v>
<v Speaker 2>guilt of the constituent elements of </v>

16
00:00:56.871 --> 00:00:57.704
<v Speaker 2>that group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is absolutely nothing that's more </v>

17
00:00:59.451 --> 00:01:01.780
<v Speaker 2>racist than not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely</v>

18
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.960
<v Speaker 3>boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

19
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.913
<v Speaker 3>You're not.</v>

20
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.953
<v Speaker 2>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you really want to know more about </v>

21
00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should read about the Kulaks in the.</v>

22
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.610
<v Speaker 2>In the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 19 twenties,</v>

23
00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:17.810
<v Speaker 2>k,</v>
<v Speaker 2>U L A,</v>

24
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.190
<v Speaker 2>k,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s because they were.</v>

25
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.740
<v Speaker 2>They were farmers who were very </v>
<v Speaker 2>productive.</v>

26
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.940
<v Speaker 2>They were the most productive element of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the agricultural strata in,</v>

27
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.823
<v Speaker 2>in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were virtually all killed or </v>

28
00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:30.014
<v Speaker 2>raped and robbed by the collectivists </v>
<v Speaker 2>who insisted that because they showed </v>

29
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.353
<v Speaker 2>signs.</v>
