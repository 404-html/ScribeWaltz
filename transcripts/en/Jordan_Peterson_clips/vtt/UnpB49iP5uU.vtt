1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.193
<v Speaker 1>So let's start with postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing to understand about the </v>

2
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:09.000
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists are that they are by no </v>
<v Speaker 1>means unintelligent.</v>

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacques Derrida,</v>

4
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Michel Foucault for that matter,</v>

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.073
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous French public intellectuals who </v>

6
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:18.384
<v Speaker 1>are both at or near the head of what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might describe as the postmodern </v>

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.063
<v Speaker 1>intellectual revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are extraordinarily intellectually </v>

8
00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>capable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean they're correct by any</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch of the imagination,</v>

10
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly means that they're more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than able to put together a,</v>

11
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 1>an argument that's difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>disentangle.</v>

12
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll start with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I think is the most central power,</v>

13
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.930
<v Speaker 1>the most powerful central claim of </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism.</v>

14
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>A claim which I think is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

15
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 1>And which also has be devil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many other fields,</v>

16
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>including surprisingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence.</v>

17
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.703
<v Speaker 1>The claim is something like there is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of ways to interpret </v>

18
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even finite set of phenomena.</v>

19
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.950
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

20
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>and that actually happens to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the reason why it's been so</v>

21
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:11.064
<v Speaker 1>difficult for human beings to develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence and for them to </v>

22
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:17.310
<v Speaker 1>develop machines that could operate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>real world environments.</v>

23
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:18.144
<v Speaker 1>Because it turns out that the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>so complex that perceiving it all </v>

24
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>appears virtually impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technically speaking.</v>

25
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.613
<v Speaker 1>We heard a little bit earlier that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous talk about embodied cognition </v>

26
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:29.664
<v Speaker 1>and one of the ways psychologists are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to address the issue of the </v>

27
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:32.334
<v Speaker 1>impossibility of perception is to note </v>
<v Speaker 1>that perception isn't possible without </v>

28
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>situating the mind in a body that has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain set of constraints.</v>

29
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.913
<v Speaker 1>We also devote a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our neurological landscape to see to </v>

30
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 1>sensory processing so that when we look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the world that can manifest itself in</v>

31
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 1>this self evident way that it appears to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

32
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that it's a simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

33
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a very complicated problem and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernist we're technically correct.</v>

34
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:55.854
<v Speaker 1>There's there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a near infinite number of ways </v>

35
00:01:57.661 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 1>to to perceive and interpret a finite </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of phenomena.</v>

36
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.283
<v Speaker 1>Now you see the thing that's interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that claim apart from the fact </v>

37
00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:07.854
<v Speaker 1>that it happens to be technically true </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you can use it to mountain </v>

38
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:13.044
<v Speaker 1>assault on any interpretation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything whatsoever because there is a </v>

39
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.573
<v Speaker 1>tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very variability in the number of </v>

40
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>interpretations that you could bring to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear on a situation.</v>

41
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.883
<v Speaker 1>Then you can instantly jump to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion or expound the proposition </v>

42
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.000
<v Speaker 1>that none of those interpretation should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be privileged,</v>

43
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Amal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>above all,</v>

44
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.530
<v Speaker 1>above any others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's actually wrong,</v>

45
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.123
<v Speaker 1>and this is why postmodernism is correct</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's central assumption but </v>

46
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:41.724
<v Speaker 1>incorrect in its secondary assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the reason it's wrong is because </v>

47
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>although there is a very large number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential interpretations of the world,</v>

48
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.953
<v Speaker 1>that does not mean that there is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>equally large number of viable </v>

49
00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>interpretations of the world.</v>

50
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

51
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:58.080
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes constraints on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>viability of an interpretation?</v>

52
00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

53
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.333
<v Speaker 1>there's a number of them and I think you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to understand this in the context </v>

54
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 1>of living creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewing and interpreting the world,</v>

55
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>and also within a broader evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>

56
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.413
<v Speaker 1>the way that evolution solves the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of the infinite number of </v>

57
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.653
<v Speaker 1>potential interpretations is by killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>every single thing that interprets </v>

58
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 1>things badly enough to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

59
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

60
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:21.394
<v Speaker 1>this is actually one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful arguments for the necessity of </v>

61
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:24.783
<v Speaker 1>the evolutionary reason for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity of the accuracy of the </v>

62
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.820
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

63
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.743
<v Speaker 1>it's that it's taken three and a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion years of evolution to produce </v>

64
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>creatures of our sort who can interpret </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

65
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:37.474
<v Speaker 1>which is impossible to interpret well </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to live for approximately 80 </v>

66
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:41.644
<v Speaker 1>years and to have some reasonable chance</v>
<v Speaker 1>of propagating during that period of </v>

67
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three and a half billion years.</v>

68
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's the best we've been able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

69
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.363
<v Speaker 1>It's a very complicated problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And evolution solves that problem by </v>

70
00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:51.724
<v Speaker 1>producing a tremendous number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>variance and then killing almost all of </v>

71
00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:55.114
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so death is the solution to the </v>

72
00:03:57.521 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>problem of interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a terrible solution,</v>

73
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:00.694
<v Speaker 1>but the point I'm trying to make there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that interpretations are constrained </v>

74
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:04.714
<v Speaker 1>by such things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primary things that happened to be </v>

75
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>relevant to living beings like suffering</v>
<v Speaker 1>and death.</v>

76
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>So those are the first sets of </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraints.</v>

77
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.033
<v Speaker 1>Your interpretations of the world should</v>
<v Speaker 1>shield you to the degree possible from </v>

78
00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:16.534
<v Speaker 1>excess suffering and death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't seem to be too debatable </v>

79
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.610
<v Speaker 1>proposition unless you're aimed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicidal direction.</v>

80
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 1>And so we can start by merely pointing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that out.</v>

81
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.923
<v Speaker 1>We also might point out that such things</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the necessity for cooperating and </v>

82
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:30.334
<v Speaker 1>competing with others also constraints </v>
<v Speaker 1>the interpretations that you're allowed </v>

83
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:33.754
<v Speaker 1>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially given that not only do you </v>

84
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 1>have to cooperate and compete with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people one time,</v>

85
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:39.154
<v Speaker 1>but that you have to cooperate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete with often the same people many </v>

86
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:43.414
<v Speaker 1>times in many different contexts and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that not only do you have to interpret </v>

87
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 1>the world so that you can cooperate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete with those people.</v>

88
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.013
<v Speaker 1>You have to do it in a manner that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be iterated and repeated and that </v>

89
00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:55.360
<v Speaker 1>constitutes also an extraordinary series</v>
<v Speaker 1>constraints.</v>

90
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:56.194
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to suffer too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't want to die and you want </v>

91
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:01.330
<v Speaker 1>to be able to cooperate with people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be able to compete with them</v>

92
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:03.730
<v Speaker 1>and you want to be able to do that over </v>
<v Speaker 1>long periods of time.</v>

93
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.690
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you also want to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>with an aim in mind because generally we</v>

94
00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:08.524
<v Speaker 1>have aims in mind and so there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we'd like to have more than </v>

95
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:12.064
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we aim at those and then we have </v>

96
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:17.470
<v Speaker 1>to constrain our interpretation so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we enact them in the world,</v>

97
00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>the probability that what we're aiming </v>
<v Speaker 1>at is going to happen will improve.</v>

98
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.120
<v Speaker 1>And all of those constraints operates </v>
<v Speaker 1>operate simultaneously.</v>

99
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 1>And what that implies.</v>

100
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:27.723
<v Speaker 1>And I think John Piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the developmental psychologists maybe </v>

101
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.870
<v Speaker 1>went farther along this line of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>than anyone else I knew about anyways.</v>

102
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.670
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of an elaboration of cons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental,</v>

103
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.780
<v Speaker 1>ethical maximum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was something like,</v>

104
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.913
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>act as if the thing that you're doing </v>

105
00:05:40.391 --> 00:05:41.800
<v Speaker 1>will be done by everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

106
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.693
<v Speaker 1>but the pig and sense was more like act </v>
<v Speaker 1>as if the thing that you will be doing </v>

107
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.073
<v Speaker 1>needs to be repeated endlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a manner that moves up instead of </v>

108
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that,</v>

109
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:52.743
<v Speaker 1>but the point is is that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's tremendous constraints on the </v>

110
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 1>manner in which we can interpret the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world from any realistic perspective.</v>

111
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:02.480
<v Speaker 1>So the criticism that there are an </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of interpretations falls</v>

112
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:04.660
<v Speaker 1>apart on closer examination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

113
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.910
<v Speaker 1>that's the first place that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists are seriously wrong.</v>

114
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>They radically underestimated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic constraints on,</v>

115
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on interpretation.</v>
