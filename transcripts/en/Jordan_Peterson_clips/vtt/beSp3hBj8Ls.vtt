00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.473
<v Speaker 1>What do I think of Paul Joseph Watson </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposition that populism is the new </v>

2
00:00:04.451 --> 00:00:08.140
<v Speaker 1>punk slash counterculture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.153
<v Speaker 1>I mean you see that you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say some indication of that on </v>

4
00:00:11.531 --> 00:00:12.364
<v Speaker 1>Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's not easy to get an </v>

5
00:00:13.991 --> 00:00:14.824
<v Speaker 1>unbiased sample of what's going on on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube because of course youtube tends </v>

6
00:00:19.031 --> 00:00:19.864
<v Speaker 1>to present you with things that are akin</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the things that you're already </v>

7
00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:23.854
<v Speaker 1>watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does appear to me that the </v>

8
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.273
<v Speaker 1>conservative commentators on youtube are</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing somewhat of the same role that </v>

9
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.000
<v Speaker 1>the counterculture played.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's call it more traditionally,</v>

10
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.460
<v Speaker 1>even though that's a funny thing to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the counterculture.</v>

11
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.623
<v Speaker 1>What I'm wondering more is whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not not so much whether it's a </v>

12
00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:44.614
<v Speaker 1>counterculture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's something that's more </v>

13
00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:48.790
<v Speaker 1>specifically associated with a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>that men,</v>

14
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.030
<v Speaker 1>young men are finding their new </v>
<v Speaker 1>political voice online.</v>

15
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason that I'm wondering </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that,</v>

16
00:00:55.181 --> 00:00:56.014
<v Speaker 1>although there are a number of female </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative commentators who also </v>

17
00:00:58.241 --> 00:00:59.074
<v Speaker 1>become popular online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because many of the commentators </v>

18
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.130
<v Speaker 1>appear to be man and many of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are following them also appear to be</v>

19
00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:07.720
<v Speaker 1>mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

20
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.800
<v Speaker 1>and it's not obvious to me that men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy now for men,</v>

21
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.880
<v Speaker 1>especially young men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a political voice on campus,</v>

22
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.190
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps even in public.</v>

23
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.653
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so maybe they're turning to youtube </v>

24
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.473
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find these viewpoints that aren't </v>

25
00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:29.830
<v Speaker 1>being destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disseminated widely in the,</v>

26
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.690
<v Speaker 1>in the popular media.</v>
