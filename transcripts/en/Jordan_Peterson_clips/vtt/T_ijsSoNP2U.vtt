1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw the same thing with social knits</v>

2
00:00:02.591 --> 00:00:03.424
<v Speaker 1>and his description of the gulags </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were running in large part </v>

3
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:06.384
<v Speaker 1>by the inmates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that that's a really good </v>

4
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>metaphor for totalitarian states in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

5
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:11.214
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we like to think that a </v>

6
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:14.970
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian state is made up of </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent,</v>

7
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>oppressed individuals who are under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thumb of a,</v>

8
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.553
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an evil tyrant and that all of the </v>

9
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes are cascading from the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

10
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:24.894
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's more like a </v>

11
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:30.720
<v Speaker 1>holographic structure where the tyranny </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists at every single level.</v>

12
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:31.554
<v Speaker 1>So it exists psychologically and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists within the family and it exists </v>

13
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:37.770
<v Speaker 1>within the mid level organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

14
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.031
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:39.864
<v Speaker 1>when eastern Germany for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one out of every three people was a </v>

16
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:43.134
<v Speaker 1>government informer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that meant is if you had a </v>

17
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:46.344
<v Speaker 1>family of six people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that two of them you couldn't trust and </v>

18
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just say that.</v>

19
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a consequence of the top down </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

20
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.233
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tyranny is something that exists </v>

21
00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>everywhere simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once it,</v>

22
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>once it gets a grip and it's easy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to say things like,</v>

23
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:01.974
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just following orders and you </v>

24
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:04.224
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

25
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.453
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to put myself in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>position where I'm claiming that if I </v>

26
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:09.984
<v Speaker 1>was in that position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have followed orders in the </v>

27
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:12.211
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

28
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>God only knows until you get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

29
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

30
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>but what that did to me was focused my </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention more and more on,</v>

31
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.223
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.870
<v Speaker 1>the necessity of individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

33
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:25.704
<v Speaker 1>I thought if it was individuals in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>final analysis who were responsible for </v>

34
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:29.334
<v Speaker 1>the great evils of the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a reasonable way of </v>

35
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.503
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it might be individuals who could </v>

36
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.923
<v Speaker 1>be responsible for whatever good there </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be in mankind that could help us </v>

37
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>avoid those situations in the future.</v>

38
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.633
<v Speaker 1>And I thought of that as an alternative </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense to nihilistic disbelief </v>

39
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:51.750
<v Speaker 1>and ideological possession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>because if your group identity is too </v>
<v Speaker 1>tight,</v>

41
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.530
<v Speaker 1>then you start acting like they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they a,</v>

42
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.523
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

43
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 1>like a cog in a mob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not so very bad thing.</v>

44
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>But then if your group identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappears completely,</v>

45
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:07.650
<v Speaker 1>well then you're left alone and bereft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so those are bad alternatives,</v>

46
00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:08.484
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're sort of damned if you do and </v>

47
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>damned if you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it it was.</v>

48
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.293
<v Speaker 1>It was very difficult to understand that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there might be a third path between </v>

49
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:16.990
<v Speaker 1>those two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't see the,</v>

50
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.090
<v Speaker 1>the existence of anything because people</v>
<v Speaker 1>need belief systems in order to exist,</v>

51
00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:22.944
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To maintain psychological stability and </v>

52
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:25.164
<v Speaker 1>domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maintain sociological stability as </v>

53
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then if the beliefs get too rigid,</v>

54
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:33.090
<v Speaker 1>then they turn into a raging </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian mob.</v>

55
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you let that go because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to play that game,</v>

56
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:38.880
<v Speaker 1>but then you dissolve because you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>no identity.</v>

57
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not acceptable either.</v>

58
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.293
<v Speaker 1>When I first laid that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that clearly it was really hard on me </v>

59
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Speaker 1>because I couldn't see a third path to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

60
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.643
<v Speaker 1>But then I started to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was a consequence of reading </v>

61
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:54.450
<v Speaker 1>the sorts of things that we already </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>

62
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:55.284
<v Speaker 1>but also starting to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying structure of mythology and </v>

63
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.200
<v Speaker 1>what a heroic path man essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that meant adoption of supreme moral</v>

64
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:07.890
<v Speaker 1>responsibility as an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's,</v>

65
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this idea in the new testament,</v>

66
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>which is a really interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

67
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of these bottomless ideas and I</v>

68
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:15.814
<v Speaker 1>mean that literally you could study it </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever and never get to the bottom of </v>

69
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:19.324
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that Christ is the </v>

70
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 1>person who takes the sins of mankind on </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself and there's something redemptive</v>

71
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:27.274
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

72
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.173
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually a really dark idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what it means as far as I can </v>

73
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:32.734
<v Speaker 1>tell what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least what it means psychologically </v>

74
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:36.790
<v Speaker 1>is that when you read these terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

75
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading about you.</v>

76
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>If you don't understand that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading about you,</v>

77
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:44.350
<v Speaker 1>then you don't actually understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

78
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you put yourself in the position</v>

79
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:47.944
<v Speaker 1>where you're automatically the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who would never do anything like </v>

80
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then these other people are,</v>

81
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 1>while they're devils in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

82
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>And it's very easy for people to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>that division,</v>

83
00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.773
<v Speaker 1>but it's a horrific realization when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that that devil that you see </v>

84
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 1>outside is the same thing that's inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you don't know until you're put</v>

85
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 1>in a situation like that what you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

86
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.630
<v Speaker 1>And then it's even worse because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the historical evidence,</v>

87
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

88
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.943
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was ordinary people in some sense </v>

89
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.570
<v Speaker 1>that produced the catastrophes of Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany and the Soviet Union and China.</v>

90
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might not have originated it,</v>

91
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.670
<v Speaker 1>but they certainly had the option to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>no at different parts of different steps</v>

92
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:32.140
<v Speaker 1>along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they didn't,</v>

93
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these things do happen.</v>

94
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:35.134
<v Speaker 1>One horrible thing at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this great book called ordinary </v>

95
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

96
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.170
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which describes the descent of,</v>

97
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 1>of a German police force from ordinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>bourgeois middleclass men.</v>

98
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:46.864
<v Speaker 1>Essentially just ordinary policemen who </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually were raised before the Hitler </v>

99
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 1>youth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't indoctrinated,</v>

100
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as young people.</v>

101
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were,</v>

102
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.853
<v Speaker 1>they were brought into Poland to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mock pop after the Germans had walked </v>

103
00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it describes how they descended into</v>

104
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:05.040
<v Speaker 1>the sort of people who would take naked </v>
<v Speaker 1>women out,</v>

105
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.913
<v Speaker 1>naked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prayed pregnant women out into the </v>

106
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.040
<v Speaker 1>middle of fields and shoot them in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back of the head.</v>

107
00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Speaker 1>And what's horrifying about the book is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the author,</v>

108
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:14.743
<v Speaker 1>I'm Browning a details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stages by which this occurred and </v>

109
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.610
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

110
00:05:21.611 --> 00:05:22.444
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the commander of this unit told the man </v>

111
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:29.170
<v Speaker 1>that they were going to have to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible things,</v>

112
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.330
<v Speaker 1>but that they could go home if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to.</v>

113
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's a,</v>

114
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>there's an out but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then if you really think about it,</v>

115
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:37.024
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

116
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.303
<v Speaker 1>there are tight tightly knit cause a </v>
<v Speaker 1>military organization and one of the </v>

117
00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:44.980
<v Speaker 1>natural thoughts under that circumstance</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be,</v>

118
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to leave my comrades to do</v>

119
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:48.814
<v Speaker 1>all the dirty work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would just be a matter of </v>

120
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:52.690
<v Speaker 1>cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can see that you know that,</v>

121
00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:55.750
<v Speaker 1>that there's an ethical requirement that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would keep you there to begin with.</v>

122
00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:57.090
<v Speaker 1>And then they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

123
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing what you just said.</v>

124
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Which is taking the burden of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>sinful activity on yourself.</v>

125
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 1>If you let everyone else do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're not,</v>

126
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>you're not acting heroically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

127
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.863
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it was easy for the men to get </v>

128
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.773
<v Speaker 1>entrapped into that and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the requirements for their horrific </v>

129
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:15.434
<v Speaker 1>action kept ramping up and like each </v>
<v Speaker 1>time the accepted the requirement of </v>

130
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:19.454
<v Speaker 1>doing one horrific thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that they would accept </v>

131
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 1>the next requirement increased.</v>

132
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.003
<v Speaker 1>And what is also really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that book of ordinary men is that </v>

133
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.180
<v Speaker 1>it's not like these men didn't suffer </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they were suffering terribly.</v>

134
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 1>They were physically ill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were vomiting,</v>

135
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:34.964
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were tearing themselves apart </v>

136
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:37.460
<v Speaker 1>psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

137
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a,</v>

138
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a great book because if you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to know how you walk down the how you,</v>

139
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.740
<v Speaker 1>how you can be enticed to walk down a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible path.</v>

140
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the book to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very frightening because if you</v>

141
00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:53.960
<v Speaker 1>read it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

142
00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:55.850
<v Speaker 1>you have to read it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

143
00:06:55.851 --> 00:06:58.850
<v Speaker 1>is if you're one of the people to whom </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is happening,</v>

144
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 1>not the victim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the oppressor,</v>

145
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>

146
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 1>you can also read it as the victim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fair enough.</v>

147
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.200
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's ordinary people who participate</v>

148
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 1>in these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's very,</v>

149
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 1>very terrifying thought.</v>
