1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Going to tell you a story from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union,</v>

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.040
<v Speaker 1>it's Solzhenitsyn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He introduces it with the whole from the</v>

3
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:13.041
<v Speaker 1>Russian poet laureate cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sympathizer with cohesion,</v>

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>construction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grit and repression.</v>

5
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Wring the neck of this gang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.570
<v Speaker 1>That's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pole socialists and wonderful.</v>

7
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Who was the gay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the question.</v>

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.303
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to make 66 million people died </v>

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>between 1970 and 1950.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nine.</v>

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.273
<v Speaker 1>Socialists are also estimated that </v>
<v Speaker 1>substantially larger number of in </v>

11
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Communist China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one really knows the staff's on map.</v>

12
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.843
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a debatable statistic as social </v>

13
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>next one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Points out spoke business from the Gulag</v>

14
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:43.794
<v Speaker 1>archipelago as soon as the official </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics are released to revise their </v>

15
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:52.260
<v Speaker 1>estimates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This includes,</v>

16
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.333
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>separate millions billion hasn't pushed </v>

17
00:00:56.581 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>into the Tundra forced relocation at </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly $26 million trainings.</v>

18
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.320
<v Speaker 1>We've famines in 1930.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second preview story.</v>

19
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.923
<v Speaker 1>So this is the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll tell you a little bit about his </v>

20
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>life story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a three volume.</v>

21
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.953
<v Speaker 1>The second volume of which you will read</v>
<v Speaker 1>a story about blue light system of </v>

22
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>forced labor camps set up in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

23
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Soon after Lennon died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

24
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.853
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them were set up before he died </v>

25
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.523
<v Speaker 1>and upon which the Soviet economy brand </v>
<v Speaker 1>for much of what constituted it's nets </v>

26
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.220
<v Speaker 1>and started his travels through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gulag originally as a Russian front line</v>

27
00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:53.914
<v Speaker 1>soldier storing sense thrown into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>German prisoner of war camp and when he </v>

28
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:04.941
<v Speaker 1>was repatriated to the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 1>styling through later in a concentration</v>

29
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>camp and the reason why is as he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all of the return Russian prisoners</v>

30
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:09.954
<v Speaker 1>of war who were treated by the week </v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly in the German prisoners of war </v>

31
00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:14.274
<v Speaker 1>camps because Stalin refused to sign the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geneva Convention on the treatment of </v>

32
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>prisoners.</v>

33
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>So not only were they in prisoners of </v>
<v Speaker 1>war camps,</v>

34
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.873
<v Speaker 1>which was miserable enough that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were starved to the degree that the </v>

35
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>other ally prisoners used to give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

36
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.590
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have much food themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was a front line soldier.</v>

37
00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:32.424
<v Speaker 1>Then he got thrown into German prisoner </v>
<v Speaker 1>of war camp and then when he finally </v>

38
00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:35.574
<v Speaker 1>returned to Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell him through when it comes to </v>

39
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:38.064
<v Speaker 1>training camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that was that the </v>

40
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:42.354
<v Speaker 1>Russians who were in German prisoners of</v>
<v Speaker 1>war camp had been contaminated by their </v>

41
00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:50.010
<v Speaker 1>exposure to western ideas and that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>his rationale.</v>

42
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.593
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's spent a decade and a half of </v>

43
00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:54.684
<v Speaker 1>their boats in concentration camps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he got out and developed </v>

44
00:02:56.581 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>stomach cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a brief summary of some of the</v>

45
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:03.090
<v Speaker 1>highlights of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

46
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.933
<v Speaker 1>In this scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's being transported from one camp to </v>

47
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:11.521
<v Speaker 1>another rail car and it's been roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>outfitted for transporting human beings.</v>

48
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.600
<v Speaker 1>He's sitting with a friend that he calls</v>
<v Speaker 1>panic.</v>

49
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.483
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to read you this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Pat and I are lying on the </v>

50
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Middle Shelf of a stall up into cattle </v>
<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>

51
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:23.044
<v Speaker 1>Basically they're refitted for fema </v>
<v Speaker 1>transport and have set ourselves up </v>

52
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 1>constantly talk to our assault herring </v>
<v Speaker 1>in her pocket.</v>

53
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>So we don't need water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go to sleep,</v>

54
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.460
<v Speaker 1>but at some station or other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shoved into our compartment.</v>

55
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.383
<v Speaker 1>A Marxist scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can tell this from his guilty and </v>

56
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>spectacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't hide the fact.</v>

57
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.980
<v Speaker 1>So He's been arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a devout communist,</v>

58
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>been arrested by the Columbias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't hide the fact.</v>

59
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:51.100
<v Speaker 1>He's a former professor of the communist</v>
<v Speaker 1>academy.</v>

60
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>We have down in the square,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut out from his very first words.</v>

61
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:57.124
<v Speaker 1>We see that comedians impenetrable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have been serving time for a very </v>

62
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 1>long time and have a long time lift </v>
<v Speaker 1>serve and we value of Mary joke.</v>

63
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.993
<v Speaker 1>We'd been fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's ample space left in the </v>

64
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:12.784
<v Speaker 1>compartment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we exchanged places with someone in </v>

65
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.413
<v Speaker 1>crown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian.</v>

66
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

67
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too crowded.</v>

68
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all right.</v>

69
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Have you been in the jug a long time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Long enough?</v>

70
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Are you past the halfway mark?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just look over there.</v>

71
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:34.680
<v Speaker 1>How poverty stricken or villages are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Straw thatch,</v>

72
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.673
<v Speaker 1>crooked hugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an inheritance Harrington's from </v>

73
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:44.260
<v Speaker 1>the czarist regime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we've already had 30 Soviet years.</v>

74
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.230
<v Speaker 1>That's an insignificant period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Historically.</v>

75
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible that the collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>farmers are starving at older.</v>

76
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Just ask any collective farmer in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>compartment,</v>

77
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>put everyone in jail is the bitter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudice,</v>

78
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.190
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen collective farms myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means they were on characteristic.</v>

79
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 1>The goatee had never been in any way </v>
<v Speaker 1>simpler.</v>

80
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Just ask the old folks desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were well Fed,</v>

81
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.230
<v Speaker 1>well upload,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they used to have many holidays.</v>

82
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.053
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even going to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a subjective trait of human memory </v>

83
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:28.564
<v Speaker 1>to praise everything past the cow that </v>
<v Speaker 1>died is the one that gave twice the </v>

84
00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:34.780
<v Speaker 1>milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes even say,</v>

85
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 1>and our people don't like qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like to work.</v>

86
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Why is there a shortage of brand in many</v>
<v Speaker 1>cities when right before the war,</v>

87
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:49.090
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not true before the war,</v>

88
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.350
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

89
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.190
<v Speaker 1>he worked at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen at that time in all the cities on</v>

90
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:55.024
<v Speaker 1>the pool guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were accused of thousands of </v>

91
00:05:56.711 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a local failure in supply.</v>

92
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 1>More likely your memory's failing you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is a shortage now.</v>

93
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.223
<v Speaker 1>Old Wives Tales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hear it from seven to 8 billion </v>

94
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:12.300
<v Speaker 1>bushels of grain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The grain is rotten,</v>

95
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.250
<v Speaker 1>not so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been very successful in developing</v>

96
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.084
<v Speaker 1>new species and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in her term of speaks in the </v>

97
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:23.234
<v Speaker 1>language which requires no effort of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mining and arguing with him is like </v>

98
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 1>walking through a desert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about people like that,</v>

99
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:32.870
<v Speaker 1>but they say he made the rounds of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the blocks,</v>

100
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:33.704
<v Speaker 1>miss and came home unsure when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>write in their obituaries perished </v>

101
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>tragically during the period of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stout on this cult,</v>

102
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.453
<v Speaker 1>it should be corrected to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parish comically had worked out </v>

103
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would have never learned what a dry,</v>

104
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:53.210
<v Speaker 1>insignificant little man he really was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would have respectfully made his name</v>

105
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:54.660
<v Speaker 1>in the newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would have.</v>

106
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:55.693
<v Speaker 1>He would have become a people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>commissar or even venture to represent </v>

107
00:06:58.311 --> 00:06:59.360
<v Speaker 1>all of Russia abroad.</v>

108
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.143
<v Speaker 1>To argue with him was useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was much more interested in playing </v>

109
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.340
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a chess,</v>

110
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.433
<v Speaker 1>but at the game really is such a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very simple game play off to him a </v>

111
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:13.994
<v Speaker 1>couple of times or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use some of his own pet words and </v>

112
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:17.684
<v Speaker 1>phrases like that phrase growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>accustomed to find all around who were </v>

113
00:07:21.601 --> 00:07:22.434
<v Speaker 1>in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's become weary of star like it </v>

114
00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:25.584
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mind to tell his stories because</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them will be twisted and thrown </v>

115
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:31.700
<v Speaker 1>right back into space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if he takes you for one of his own,</v>

116
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.983
<v Speaker 1>he will quite disclose to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you seeing that the station </v>

117
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.490
<v Speaker 1>people are passing by?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talking,</v>

118
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.110
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life goes on.</v>

119
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.680
<v Speaker 1>The party is providing leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are being moved from job to job.</v>

120
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.533
<v Speaker 1>You and I are languishing in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are only a handful of us and we </v>

121
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:50.114
<v Speaker 1>must write and write petitions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>begging a review of our cases being a </v>

122
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:58.220
<v Speaker 1>part or he will tell you something </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting in the Communist Academy,</v>

123
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.860
<v Speaker 1>they just started to devour one cobra.</v>

124
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.860
<v Speaker 1>We decided he wasn't going to Jannie </v>
<v Speaker 1>with one of our own.</v>

125
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.303
<v Speaker 1>Somehow they could manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are no errors and his assets and </v>

126
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.110
<v Speaker 1>his biography was clean and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden going through the archives,</v>

127
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:15.973
<v Speaker 1>what I find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they ran across an old brochure written </v>

128
00:08:18.711 --> 00:08:21.880
<v Speaker 1>by his comrade in which Bladimir Lennon </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

129
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:22.773
<v Speaker 1>He held in his hands and in the margin </v>
<v Speaker 1>of which he had written in his own </v>

130
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.090
<v Speaker 1>handwriting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The notation as an economist is shit,</v>

131
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.310
<v Speaker 1>well now you understand our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything smiled eventually,</v>

132
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:35.623
<v Speaker 1>but after that it's no trouble at all to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make short work of that month we foster </v>

133
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.980
<v Speaker 1>he was expelled from the academy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>deprived to the scholar,</v>

134
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.100
<v Speaker 1>a communist professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This exchange,</v>

135
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:48.993
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to think because he has </v>

136
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:53.710
<v Speaker 1>an ideological system worked out.</v>

137
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.723
<v Speaker 1>He won't admit any evidence whatsoever </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists to suggest some of these </v>

138
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:06.900
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions are wrong for every bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of evidence that exists.</v>

139
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:07.763
<v Speaker 1>There is a counter argument that </v>
<v Speaker 1>justifies it or excuse it or makes it </v>

140
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.560
<v Speaker 1>disappear in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first part.</v>

141
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 1>The second part of the story is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>being like this,</v>

142
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.960
<v Speaker 1>he's also extraordinarily clannish in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sense.</v>

143
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.253
<v Speaker 1>Can you tell us a brief story about </v>
<v Speaker 1>being in the academy where everyone </v>

144
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:29.874
<v Speaker 1>shares that you Ologie and finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside so that you can essentially </v>

145
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.313
<v Speaker 1>destroy their specific reasons why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>two halves of that narrative who stuck </v>

146
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.413
<v Speaker 1>together because the first attitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>leads an exorbitant to the second </v>

147
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:51.630
<v Speaker 1>attitude to say the adoption of </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian ideology,</v>

148
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.150
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the presumption of </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocence.</v>

149
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:55.603
<v Speaker 1>If your Nav along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that what you think is the </v>

150
00:09:58.111 --> 00:09:58.944
<v Speaker 1>right thing thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't anything else that needs to </v>

151
00:10:00.781 --> 00:10:01.440
<v Speaker 1>be thought.</v>

152
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.970
<v Speaker 1>It's you that has the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

153
00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:06.360
<v Speaker 1>you might go to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think that it's your leader or</v>

154
00:10:06.361 --> 00:10:07.194
<v Speaker 1>the ideology in and of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what it is you're the one that's in </v>

155
00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:10.044
<v Speaker 1>possession of the truth and every fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that might exist to dispute that is </v>

156
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.703
<v Speaker 1>eliminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with the fact is that </v>

157
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.570
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they come in and body forms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the same.</v>

158
00:10:21.571 --> 00:10:23.730
<v Speaker 1>We tend to think of ideas as </v>
<v Speaker 1>disembodied,</v>

159
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:28.710
<v Speaker 1>abstracted entities of truth of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter is that ideas are representations</v>

160
00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:33.540
<v Speaker 1>of human patterns of action and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the enemy idea is actually the</v>

161
00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:34.374
<v Speaker 1>enemy and there's very little difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the practical perspective between </v>

162
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:43.290
<v Speaker 1>repressing thoughts that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable and repressing.</v>

163
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.950
<v Speaker 1>People whose viewpoints or even styles </v>
<v Speaker 1>of existence are equal.</v>
