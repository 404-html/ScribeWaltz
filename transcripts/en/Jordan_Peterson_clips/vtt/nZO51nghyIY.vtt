00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Clease Noren how to use the results in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new personality test for progress in</v>

2
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:05.604
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to compensate some sites that </v>

3
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>that received fewer points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well at the risk of sounding self.</v>

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 1>That's actually why we developed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>self authoring suite,</v>

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>was to help people improve their website</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance and mental health.</v>

6
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have direct evidence that will,</v>

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 1>that will improve personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I suspected that evidence would take</v>

8
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:29.124
<v Speaker 1>a very long time to accumulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we do know is that the self </v>

9
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>authoring suite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the future authoring suite,</v>

10
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helps people,</v>

11
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>helps university students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

12
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:39.624
<v Speaker 1>stay enrolled in university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It increases the probability of that by </v>

13
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:45.700
<v Speaker 1>about 25 percent and increase his grade </v>
<v Speaker 1>point average by about the same.</v>

14
00:00:45.701 --> 00:00:46.534
<v Speaker 1>Then there's good theoretical reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>for assuming that writing is a good way </v>

15
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:52.344
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

16
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.253
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing about yourself and about your </v>

17
00:00:55.021 --> 00:01:00.021
<v Speaker 1>past and about your future is a good way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of catalyzing personality transformation</v>

18
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:01.524
<v Speaker 1>because it appears that personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human psyche is organized at the </v>

19
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>highest level of abstraction.</v>

20
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.953
<v Speaker 1>Using something like self narrative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a well-developed narrative makes the </v>

21
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 1>frame for your life and helps you </v>
<v Speaker 1>stabilize your negative emotions.</v>

22
00:01:15.511 --> 00:01:16.344
<v Speaker 1>And also experience more positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions because you only experienced </v>

23
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:19.404
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion in relationship to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal and that can make goal directed </v>

24
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>activity lot more rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

25
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:26.814
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot easier to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities that aren't intrinsically </v>

26
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>rewarding if they're linked to something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you really find important.</v>

27
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say if you want to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your personality,</v>

28
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>well the first thing you have to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out who it is that you want to be</v>

29
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.793
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to make the plan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have to clean up your past as </v>

30
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:44.844
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the self authoring suite was </v>

31
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:46.794
<v Speaker 1>designed no quite carefully in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help people do that with a relative </v>

32
00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>minimum of effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that it's easy because it's not,</v>

33
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 1>but a relative minimum minimum of effort</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to other technologies,</v>

34
00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:00.640
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

35
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.620
<v Speaker 1>like longterm psychotherapy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 1>to make it cost effective as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
