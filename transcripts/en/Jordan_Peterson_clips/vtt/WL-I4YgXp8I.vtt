00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interested in your comments on this</v>

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>fridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Western is committing suicide.</v>

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Why is that happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.650
<v Speaker 1>What do it badly?</v>

5
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.043
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's lots for people to be guilty </v>

6
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:22.840
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

7
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.703
<v Speaker 2>I mean you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what degree should you bear the </v>

8
00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:29.660
<v Speaker 2>horrendous guilt of your ancestors?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a.</v>

9
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.460
<v Speaker 2>that's a really hard question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

10
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.513
<v Speaker 2>because of the radical left answer would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be to the degree that you're privileged </v>

11
00:00:35.421 --> 00:00:37.520
<v Speaker 2>by your ancestry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should bear their guilt.</v>

12
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

13
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.760
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is then what do you do?</v>

14
00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you should do is,</v>

15
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.213
<v Speaker 2>what I suggested today I would say is </v>
<v Speaker 2>take responsibility for your lives and </v>

16
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.173
<v Speaker 2>understand that what you have came at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible cost and that you have an </v>

17
00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:54.704
<v Speaker 2>ethical obligation to use it properly </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that would be sufficient to pay for </v>

18
00:00:58.041 --> 00:00:59.990
<v Speaker 2>the sins of your ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

19
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.033
<v Speaker 2>I think it's absolutely reprehensible </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the radical left there's to </v>

20
00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:10.130
<v Speaker 2>attribute to to ethnically identified </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups,</v>

21
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.820
<v Speaker 2>collective guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's absolutely no excuse for that.</v>

22
00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:17.690
<v Speaker 2>It's completely murderous and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be rejected out of hand.</v>

23
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.213
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's independent of the issue </v>

24
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:21.464
<v Speaker 2>about what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Given that part of your wealth is a </v>

25
00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:25.214
<v Speaker 2>consequence of historical catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you should try to sort that out </v>

26
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.570
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking and for everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit,</v>

27
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.540
<v Speaker 2>but not necessarily because you're any </v>
<v Speaker 2>more guilty.</v>

28
00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:37.940
<v Speaker 2>Personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're guilty as hell personally,</v>

29
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.260
<v Speaker 2>but so is everyone else.</v>
