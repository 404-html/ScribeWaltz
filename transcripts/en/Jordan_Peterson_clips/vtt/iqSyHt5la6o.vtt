00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.250
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that there's always a group of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friends who always criticize what I'm</v>

2
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:10.150
<v Speaker 1>saying and not even try to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm,</v>

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.590
<v Speaker 1>where I'm coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.963
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always wondered how to deal with </v>

5
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:15.910
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I want to listen to what they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not understanding what.</v>

7
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to listen to what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

8
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>So what would you do in that situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And very briefly,</v>

9
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.860
<v Speaker 1>there's a line in the New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>
