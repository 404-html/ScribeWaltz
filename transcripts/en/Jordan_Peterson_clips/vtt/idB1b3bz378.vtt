1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.133
<v Speaker 1>Many of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume have seen breaking bad and </v>

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:04.483
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good example of the of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the incorporation at least in part or </v>

3
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>maybe the possession by the shadow from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Union perspective,</v>

4
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:12.834
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you have this ordinary high </v>

5
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:18.000
<v Speaker 1>school teacher who really thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an ax and his family as well.</v>

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your typical persona,</v>

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just a normal guy,</v>

8
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.060
<v Speaker 1>but part of the reason that he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal guy is because he actually hasn't</v>

9
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:27.894
<v Speaker 1>been put in abnormal circumstances and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden he is and he has a </v>

10
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:32.160
<v Speaker 1>genuine moral conundrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

11
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>He's going to die of lung cancer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his.</v>

12
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.453
<v Speaker 1>He has a son who's got a lot of health </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems and he's terrified that he's </v>

13
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:40.674
<v Speaker 1>going to leave his wife and his child </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind with nothing and then of course </v>

14
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:45.144
<v Speaker 1>as the story and so he decides to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that temporarily that he </v>

15
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:49.344
<v Speaker 1>regards as what they would normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>regard as reprehensible and of course </v>

16
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>you just gets tangled up in that.</v>

17
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>But then as the story unfolds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that there's.</v>

18
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>It's more complicated because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was just innocent.</v>

19
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:01.314
<v Speaker 1>Good guy and he decided to turn bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's also very resentful and angry and </v>

20
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:06.054
<v Speaker 1>it's partly because he's a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushover at the beginning or maybe more </v>

21
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.883
<v Speaker 1>than a bit of a pushover and also that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't really fulfill his own </v>

22
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:13.560
<v Speaker 1>potential and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.423
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had friends who walked down the </v>

24
00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial path and maybe they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't quite fair to him,</v>

25
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>but whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ends up not very successful as a high</v>

26
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>school teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's really angry about that.</v>

27
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:27.504
<v Speaker 1>And so there's more motivation for him </v>
<v Speaker 1>opening up the door to the terrible </v>

28
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:33.174
<v Speaker 1>elements of his personality than just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he's got good motivations </v>

29
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>to do so and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that unfolds,</v>

30
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:39.894
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he would see that warps and </v>

31
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:42.294
<v Speaker 1>twists and is resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Character increasingly manifest </v>

32
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:48.870
<v Speaker 1>themselves as he walks down this road to</v>
<v Speaker 1>really total brutality.</v>

33
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.750
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

34
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite good.</v>

35
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.833
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a book called ordinary men </v>

36
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've mentioned that to you</v>

37
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ordinary men is a book about.</v>

38
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 1>It's the best book of it's type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the only book of its type.</v>

39
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 1>It's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's plotted,</v>

40
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:06.024
<v Speaker 1>much like breaking bad in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a story about these German </v>

41
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:10.494
<v Speaker 1>policemen in early stages of World War </v>
<v Speaker 1>II and they were guys who were old </v>

42
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:20.661
<v Speaker 1>enough to be raised in Germany really </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the hitlarian propaganda came out</v>

43
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>in full force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:23.860
<v Speaker 1>if you were a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in the 1930,</v>

45
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.703
<v Speaker 1>so you were going to be pulled right </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the propaganda machine and maybe </v>

46
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 1>you were part of the Hitler youth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were raised in that,</v>

47
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:29.844
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you were older than you were </v>

48
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>raised before that and you're not as </v>
<v Speaker 1>amenable to propaganda once you're older</v>

49
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 1>than a boat.</v>

50
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.570
<v Speaker 1>While I would say about 22 or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

51
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty young actually.</v>

52
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.533
<v Speaker 1>If you're gonna make a soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to get a soldier young because </v>

53
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>once people are in their early twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say they're kind of.</v>

54
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>They already have their personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>

55
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.203
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These policemen were sent into Poland </v>

56
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:57.210
<v Speaker 1>after the Germans marched through and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was war time and there is this </v>

58
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis in Germany that the Jews in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

59
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:04.984
<v Speaker 1>we're operating as a fifth column and </v>
<v Speaker 1>undermining the German war effort </v>

60
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:08.104
<v Speaker 1>because of course the Germans blame the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews and a variety of other people for </v>

61
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>actually setting up the conditions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>made the war necessary.</v>

62
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>And so when the police were sent into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Poland,</v>

63
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>they were also required to make peace </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

64
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:21.214
<v Speaker 1>And so they started up by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started out by rounding up all the </v>

65
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Jewish men between 18 and 65 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gathering them in,</v>

66
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>in stadiums and then shipping them off </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the trains.</v>

67
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't where they ended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ended in,</v>

68
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>in very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dark place.</v>

69
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:36.064
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys were going out in the field </v>

70
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:38.794
<v Speaker 1>with naked pregnant women and shooting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in the back of the head by the end </v>

71
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.990
<v Speaker 1>of their training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's really interesting about that</v>

72
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:44.824
<v Speaker 1>is that is that their commander told </v>
<v Speaker 1>them that they could go home at any </v>

73
00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>

74
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.263
<v Speaker 1>this is not one of those examples of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people following orders and the reason </v>

75
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:57.640
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

76
00:03:57.641 --> 00:03:58.474
<v Speaker 1>there's many reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the reasons they didn't is </v>

77
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't think it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>comradely,</v>

78
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.380
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to leave there,</v>

79
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.570
<v Speaker 1>the guys they were working with to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the dirty work and run off,</v>

80
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.140
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really,</v>

81
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>that's really an interesting fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>because you're in different </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>

83
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't think about that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible,</v>

84
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.871
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd think,</v>

85
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:17.704
<v Speaker 1>well that's part of teamwork and under </v>
<v Speaker 1>rough circumstances and that's at least </v>

86
00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:22.534
<v Speaker 1>in part how they viewed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were also made physically ill </v>

87
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.833
<v Speaker 1>multiple times physically and </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically ill by the things that </v>

88
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:30.730
<v Speaker 1>they had to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they kept doing them anyways.</v>

89
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.283
<v Speaker 1>So it's one step at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing is that you end up </v>

90
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:39.580
<v Speaker 1>in very bad places one step at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you gotta watch those steps.</v>
