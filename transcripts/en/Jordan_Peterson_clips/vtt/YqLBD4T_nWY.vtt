00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.590
<v Speaker 1>What is your opinion on the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural appropriate?</v>

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two questions.</v>

4
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:10.224
<v Speaker 1>What's my opinion on the alt right and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's my opinion on cultural </v>

5
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:13.224
<v Speaker 1>appropriation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of cultural appropriation is </v>

6
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:16.320
<v Speaker 1>absolute nonsense.</v>

7
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.080
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>

8
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.363
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference between cultural </v>

9
00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:27.730
<v Speaker 1>appropriation and learning from one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

10
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.090
<v Speaker 1>The same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean I can't.</v>

11
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.870
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that there's no theft </v>
<v Speaker 1>between people.</v>

12
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.213
<v Speaker 1>There is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that just because you </v>

13
00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:39.394
<v Speaker 1>encounter someone else's ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an immediate right to those </v>

14
00:00:41.951 --> 00:00:42.784
<v Speaker 1>ideas as if they were your own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that manifesting in your </v>

15
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:50.050
<v Speaker 1>own behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some element of another culture,</v>

16
00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:52.960
<v Speaker 1>the idea that that's somehow immoral is </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane.</v>

17
00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>It's actually one of the bases of peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

18
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.853
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that the various </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups of human beings that exist have </v>

19
00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:03.010
<v Speaker 1>to offer each other is the tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>value of their culture.</v>

20
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been really interesting to me,</v>

21
00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:06.484
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to watch the response of ball of </v>

22
00:01:10.181 --> 00:01:12.250
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for this argument to you,</v>

23
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.280
<v Speaker 1>for young Caucasian males to hip hop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:15.281 --> 00:01:16.114
<v Speaker 1>there's an aggressiveness about hip hop </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really attractive to young </v>

25
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Caucasian males and there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>observed about,</v>

26
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.543
<v Speaker 1>about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spectacle of the young Caucasian </v>

27
00:01:25.781 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 1>males taking on the persona of inner </v>
<v Speaker 1>city black gang members,</v>

28
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

29
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.560
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sympathetic to it because there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is an aggressiveness to that,</v>

30
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.693
<v Speaker 1>to that art form that's a necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrective to the insistence that the </v>

31
00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:45.070
<v Speaker 1>highest moral virtue for a modern man is</v>
<v Speaker 1>harmlessness,</v>

32
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>which is observed.</v>

33
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Women don't even like harmless man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hate them.</v>

34
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.940
<v Speaker 1>They liked them apart.</v>
