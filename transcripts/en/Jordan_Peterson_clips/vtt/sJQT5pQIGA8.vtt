00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.490
<v Speaker 1>How does it feel to be viewed as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>father figure by many people who grew up</v>

2
00:00:03.491 --> 00:00:04.870
<v Speaker 1>without one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an unbelievable honor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>

4
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:09.663
<v Speaker 1>And that is really what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tremendous honor and I'm doing </v>

5
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.630
<v Speaker 1>absolutely everything I can to be worthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

6
00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:17.464
<v Speaker 1>And I would like to say to all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people out there who grew up without a </v>

7
00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:23.020
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really too bad because you need a</v>

8
00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:26.320
<v Speaker 1>father there to encourage you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what fathers do,</v>

9
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.010
<v Speaker 1>is they encourage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they help make you courageous,</v>

10
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.083
<v Speaker 1>and if I can help people develop the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to be courageous and to learn </v>

11
00:00:35.021 --> 00:00:38.290
<v Speaker 1>to tell the truth and to be responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's great.</v>

12
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine a better outcome for me.</v>

13
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.030
<v Speaker 1>And so if people are willing to help me </v>
<v Speaker 1>play that role and to use what I've been</v>

14
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.550
<v Speaker 1>teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to guide them in that manner,</v>

15
00:00:48.551 --> 00:00:49.384
<v Speaker 1>then hooray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't possibly imagine a better </v>

16
00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:53.080
<v Speaker 1>outcome than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
