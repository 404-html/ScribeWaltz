<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson,</v>

2
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.900
<v Speaker 1>I heard you recently say that if a woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want a baby by age 30,</v>

3
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.890
<v Speaker 1>that something is unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take no offense to that assertion.</v>

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.143
<v Speaker 1>Rather I am taking it very seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 34 years old in a longterm </v>

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.550
<v Speaker 1>relationship but don't feel desire to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have children.</v>

6
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.623
<v Speaker 1>I always thought that I would one day </v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm getting older and that I'm </v>

7
00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:22.190
<v Speaker 1>getting older and that day still hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>come.</v>

8
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.623
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrified of raising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing too late that I should have </v>

9
00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:26.414
<v Speaker 1>had a family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm also terrified of having them </v>

10
00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:31.100
<v Speaker 1>and regretting it because I never truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>want it to be a mother.</v>

11
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I have any ideology of </v>
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>

12
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a feminist or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

13
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.180
<v Speaker 1>When you say something might be wrong or</v>
<v Speaker 1>unhealthy,</v>

14
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.270
<v Speaker 1>where might I look?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any advice on how to make this change?</v>

15
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.800
<v Speaker 1>What won't make this choice?</v>

16
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.413
<v Speaker 1>Ps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my boyfriend and I both had he depaul </v>

17
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:50.150
<v Speaker 1>mothers perhaps that is relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it might be relevant given that you</v>

18
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.070
<v Speaker 1>saw fit to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>include it as a potential detail.</v>

19
00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:55.904
<v Speaker 1>And one of the rules that I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>operate by as a psychotherapist is that </v>

20
00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:03.080
<v Speaker 1>if a client is inclined to add a detail </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

21
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.623
<v Speaker 1>to the formulation of a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the details are likely to be </v>

22
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:09.930
<v Speaker 1>relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.270
<v Speaker 1>but I can't tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Because of course I can't use it a rule </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thumb.</v>

25
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:15.560
<v Speaker 1>And so you might object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

26
00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:19.040
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have used to rule of thumb </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say something like if a woman doesn't</v>

27
00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:21.710
<v Speaker 1>want a baby by the age of 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that something is unhealthy.</v>

28
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.843
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be exceptions to every </v>

29
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.333
<v Speaker 1>general rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my attitude to this essentially is </v>

30
00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:33.920
<v Speaker 1>that we have all come from an unbroken </v>
<v Speaker 1>string of 3.5</v>

31
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:36.290
<v Speaker 1>million years of successful mothers.</v>

32
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.130
<v Speaker 1>And so the probability that that's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be part and parcel of,</v>

33
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.473
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy woman's desire and not only a </v>

34
00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:45.501
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

35
00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Obviously men desire to have a family </v>
<v Speaker 1>too and often very intensely.</v>

36
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.293
<v Speaker 1>It's just that men have a much longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>time span over which to consider such </v>

37
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:54.554
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

38
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.680
<v Speaker 1>so perhaps the chips are down so rapidly</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to the same degree for men.</v>

39
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.763
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be so bold as to say that </v>

40
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:09.020
<v Speaker 1>there's anything wrong with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the questioner specifically.</v>

41
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.183
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have the sort of temperament </v>

42
00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:14.390
<v Speaker 1>that isn't particularly inclined towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>maternal behavior.</v>

43
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.323
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be someone who's low in </v>

44
00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:19.910
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the primary issue.</v>

45
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I wouldn't take my word for it,</v>

46
00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:26.150
<v Speaker 1>that if you don't want to have a child </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your 30,</v>

47
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.480
<v Speaker 1>that there is necessarily something </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically wrong with you.</v>

48
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:32.230
<v Speaker 1>But I would say as a rule of thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

49
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.700
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the normal panoply of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>desires and values.</v>

50
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.220
<v Speaker 1>And so if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

51
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>if there's violent objection to having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

52
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.263
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then generally that seems to me to be </v>

53
00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:49.910
<v Speaker 1>indicative of something that might be at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least worth looking into.</v>
