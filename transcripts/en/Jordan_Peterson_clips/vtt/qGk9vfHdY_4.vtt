1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that made marks wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>was Marx believed that capital would </v>

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.023
<v Speaker 1>flow into the hands of fewer and fewer </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and that the association between </v>

3
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:18.621
<v Speaker 1>the rich and the poor would become more </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme as capitalism developed and like</v>

4
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.610
<v Speaker 1>so many things that mark said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it's kind of true.</v>

5
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of true in that</v>

6
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.673
<v Speaker 1>the distribution of wealth and in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>the distribution of anything that's </v>

7
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.150
<v Speaker 1>produced follows a peritoneal pattern </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the prieto pattern basically is that</v>

8
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.343
<v Speaker 1>a small proportion of people end up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bulk of the goods and it isn't just </v>

9
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:41.304
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

10
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.153
<v Speaker 1>it's anything that people produce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatively ends up in that distribution </v>

11
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.413
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually the economists </v>
<v Speaker 1>called out the matthew principle and </v>

12
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:51.924
<v Speaker 1>they take that from US statement in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>New Testament and the statement is to </v>

13
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>those who have everything more will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>given and from those who have nothing.</v>

14
00:00:57.721 --> 00:00:58.554
<v Speaker 1>Everything will be taken and it's a map </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the manner in which the world </v>

15
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:03.744
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where human creative production is </v>

16
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:07.194
<v Speaker 1>involved in the map seems to indicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as you start to produce and you're </v>

17
00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:10.704
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you will continue </v>

18
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:17.170
<v Speaker 1>to be successful or accelerate increases</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you're successful and as you fail,</v>

19
00:01:17.171 --> 00:01:19.530
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you will fail </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to accelerate.</v>

20
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.510
<v Speaker 1>So in your progress through life looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this or like this,</v>

21
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.673
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that Marx was right was </v>

22
00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>because he noted that as a feature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the capitalist system.</v>

23
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.463
<v Speaker 1>The reason that he was wrong is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a feature that's specific to a </v>

24
00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:38.424
<v Speaker 1>capitalist system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a feature that's general to all </v>

25
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:45.540
<v Speaker 1>systems of creative production that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>known and so it's like a natural law and</v>

26
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:46.374
<v Speaker 1>it's enough of a natural law by the ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the distribution of wealth can be </v>

27
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:51.204
<v Speaker 1>modeled by physical models using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same equations that govern the </v>

28
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>distribution of gas molecules in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vacuum.</v>

29
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.923
<v Speaker 1>So it's a really profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fundamentally profound </v>

30
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:01.794
<v Speaker 1>observation about the world way the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world lays itself out and it's </v>

31
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:05.334
<v Speaker 1>problematic because if resources accrue </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfairly to a small minority of people </v>

32
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.070
<v Speaker 1>and there's a natural law like element </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that that has to be dealt with from a</v>

33
00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:23.930
<v Speaker 1>social perspective because if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality becomes too extreme,</v>

34
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.943
<v Speaker 1>then the whole system will destabilize </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you can have an intelligent </v>

35
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.473
<v Speaker 1>discussion about how to mitigate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>effects of the transfer of creative </v>

36
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.120
<v Speaker 1>production into the hands of a small </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of people.</v>

37
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other reason,</v>

38
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.540
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>

39
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.300
<v Speaker 1>the other reason that Marx was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a number of them.</v>

40
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.420
<v Speaker 1>One is that even though</v>

41
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.610
<v Speaker 1>creative products end up in the hands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small number of people,</v>

42
00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:58.030
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same people consistently </v>
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>

43
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>It's the same of people and that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>

44
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.213
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like imagine that there's water going </v>

45
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>down a drain and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

46
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 1>look at the spiral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's permanent.</v>

47
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.921
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

48
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 1>the spirals permanent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the water molecules aren't.</v>

49
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:12.034
<v Speaker 1>They're moving through it and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same in some sense with the prieto </v>

50
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:15.394
<v Speaker 1>distribution is that there's a one </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent and there's always a one </v>

51
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same people.</v>

52
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.130
<v Speaker 1>It's the stability of a diy differs from</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture to culture,</v>

53
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of movement in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>upper one percent,</v>

54
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>a tremendous amount of movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the reasons for that movement</v>

55
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:37.021
<v Speaker 1>is that things get large and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get too large and then they collapse,</v>

56
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.513
<v Speaker 1>and so in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the politicians said too big to </v>

57
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:43.534
<v Speaker 1>fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got something truly backwards as </v>

58
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:49.070
<v Speaker 1>far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was.</v>

59
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 1>It was a reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The statement was reversed.</v>

60
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 1>It should have been so big it had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fail.</v>
