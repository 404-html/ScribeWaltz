1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that you're looking for a stable</v>
<v Speaker 1>partner,</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.440
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might think,</v>

3
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:06.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want in a stable partner,</v>

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.883
<v Speaker 1>and at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you don't want is too </v>

5
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:16.020
<v Speaker 1>much mismatch between you and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person on the five fundamental dementia.</v>

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:16.883
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're really extroverted and you </v>

7
00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:20.184
<v Speaker 1>have a really introverted partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to engage in continual </v>

8
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.623
<v Speaker 1>conflict about how much social activity </v>
<v Speaker 1>the two of you should what subject </v>

9
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 1>yourself to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very,</v>

10
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:34.761
<v Speaker 1>very difficult for people who broadly </v>
<v Speaker 1>differ widely differ on those dimensions</v>

11
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:38.340
<v Speaker 1>to come to consensus because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a matter of opinion,</v>

12
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a matter of different.</v>

13
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>If you're looking at extremes of really </v>
<v Speaker 1>different types of people,</v>

14
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.323
<v Speaker 1>and the thing about introverts is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't enjoy large scale social </v>

15
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That much one on one,</v>

16
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.393
<v Speaker 1>they're often fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a group they don't like that and </v>

17
00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:53.280
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

18
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>It tires them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a real extrovert,</v>

19
00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:56.514
<v Speaker 1>it's like you isolate them and they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>wither on the vine because a huge part </v>

20
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.043
<v Speaker 1>of what actually motivates them in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive way is tangled up with social </v>

21
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're an agreeable person and</v>

22
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>you have a particularly disagreeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner,</v>

23
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:11.124
<v Speaker 1>you're also going to run into problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the agreeable person will say </v>

24
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:14.664
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever and the agreeable or </v>

25
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable person will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

26
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:19.584
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to know what the hell you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a change and be much more harsh and </v>

27
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:23.634
<v Speaker 1>much more demanding in the situation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the agreeable person is going to find </v>

28
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:29.370
<v Speaker 1>the disagreeable person harsh and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant,</v>

29
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>and the disagreeable person who's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to find the agreeable person wishy washy</v>

30
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>and unable to stand up for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

31
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:37.164
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually one of the primary </v>

32
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:39.114
<v Speaker 1>sources of tension between men and women</v>
<v Speaker 1>because women tend to be higher in </v>

33
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.140
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness than men.</v>

34
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>It's about half a standard deviation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite,</v>

35
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.033
<v Speaker 1>quite a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a large difference by </v>

37
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.990
<v Speaker 1>psychological standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that means fundamentally,</v>

38
00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:56.350
<v Speaker 1>just so you have some sense of how large</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fact that is,</v>

39
00:01:56.351 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 1>is that if you have a group of men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women and you pick out random pairs,</v>

40
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>the woman is going to be more agreeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the man 60 percent of the time.</v>

41
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>So that's not an overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportion,</v>

42
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.523
<v Speaker 1>but it's reliable and it's quite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite large by psychological </v>

43
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:10.794
<v Speaker 1>standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the problem with </v>

44
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness with conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

45
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.643
<v Speaker 1>if you're conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're industrious and orderly and </v>

46
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.323
<v Speaker 1>orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People seem to be sensitive to </v>

47
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:23.184
<v Speaker 1>discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something we'll talk about in </v>

48
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>detail later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've had a hard time specifying exactly</v>

49
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>what makes industrious people </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrious because it's hard to come up</v>

50
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>with an animal model for that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and there's no theoretical model,</v>

51
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.880
<v Speaker 1>but our latest idea is that it's not my </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

52
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.620
<v Speaker 1>It's actually the idea of my graduate </v>
<v Speaker 1>student,</v>

53
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:41.454
<v Speaker 1>Christine Brophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that industrious people find it </v>

54
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant and unsettling to to not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something so it isn't so much that</v>

55
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.170
<v Speaker 1>industriousness makes them happy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>fills them with positive emotion.</v>

56
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.033
<v Speaker 1>That would be more extroversion because </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion is the positive emotion </v>

57
00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an industrious.</v>

58
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 1>People can't stand sitting around doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

59
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is speculation,</v>

60
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:07.414
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are obviously always </v>

61
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:10.174
<v Speaker 1>engaged in the exchange of labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the reciprocal exchange of </v>

62
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:13.984
<v Speaker 1>labor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can imagine that in a community </v>

63
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>where everyone knows everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who work hard are going to be</v>

64
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 1>pretty irritated on a fairly chronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis with the people who are completely</v>

65
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:24.874
<v Speaker 1>unproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my suspicions are that plenty of </v>

66
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:30.520
<v Speaker 1>people who were completely unproductive </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the history of,</v>

67
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.413
<v Speaker 1>of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the evolution of our species were </v>

68
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 1>wiped out by people who were unhappy </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their lack of productivity.</v>

69
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.713
<v Speaker 1>And so I think generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings have this sense of ethical </v>

70
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:42.574
<v Speaker 1>obligation with regards to one another </v>
<v Speaker 1>to share labor and people who are </v>

71
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:47.344
<v Speaker 1>conscientious really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really feel that so they feel bad if </v>

72
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 1>they're not busily working on something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's productive all the time.</v>

73
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>And so the advantage to being with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone conscientious is,</v>

74
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to work like mad,</v>

75
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>but the disadvantages there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to work like mad.</v>

76
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking for a partner that you</v>

77
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:05.134
<v Speaker 1>want to relax with or have fun with or </v>
<v Speaker 1>who isn't uptight than a conscientious </v>

78
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:10.360
<v Speaker 1>person is probably not a very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>

79
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:11.523
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a conscientious person and </v>

80
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>you're living with someone who's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscientious,</v>

81
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.430
<v Speaker 1>that's good because they might be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to help you relax,</v>

82
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:19.264
<v Speaker 1>but you're not going to be happy with it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't work nearly as hard </v>

83
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 1>as you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even worse on the orderly dimension,</v>

84
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.933
<v Speaker 1>you know some of you have had roommates </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you're more orderly than your </v>

85
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 1>roommate.</v>

86
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.493
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean means you're annoyed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by mess before they are and you don't </v>

87
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:36.034
<v Speaker 1>have to be annoyed by mess much before </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're less orderly roommate for you to </v>

88
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Speaker 1>be the one that's always running around </v>
<v Speaker 1>picking things up.</v>

89
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.173
<v Speaker 1>And so actually one of the things that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerged from the psychometric analysis </v>

90
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:46.924
<v Speaker 1>is that women are slightly more orderly </v>
<v Speaker 1>than men and I suspect that has </v>

91
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 1>something to do with the UN.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you call it?</v>

92
00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Inequitable distribution of housework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because even if you're imagine that your</v>

93
00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.473
<v Speaker 1>proclivity is to be triggered by </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder 25 seconds before your </v>

94
00:05:01.841 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 1>partners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

95
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.413
<v Speaker 1>you're going to end up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't take much difference for you </v>

96
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 1>to be the one that's always concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the mess first.</v>

97
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you're a really orderly person</v>

98
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 1>and you live with a disorderly person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well good luck getting along with them.</v>

99
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>They're going to regard you as like </v>
<v Speaker 1>uptight and,</v>

100
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

101
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over concerned with details and,</v>

102
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.373
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

103
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unwilling to relax,</v>

104
00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:26.440
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

105
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.200
<v Speaker 1>And there are going to regard you as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

106
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Just a bloody mess and how can anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly live with someone like you.</v>

107
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.053
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so another reason why it's useful to </v>

108
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:37.204
<v Speaker 1>understand your personality is because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it gives you a better crack at </v>

109
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 1>finding someone that you can actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>live with over the long run.</v>

110
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:45.124
<v Speaker 1>And we don't know what the optimal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you want to live with </v>

111
00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 1>someone who is exactly like you because </v>
<v Speaker 1>then both of you have the same strengths</v>

112
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>and weaknesses and there's a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem there,</v>

113
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:54.544
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because maybe an agreeable person can </v>

114
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:57.454
<v Speaker 1>use a of a disagreeable person around </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to balance each other out and vice </v>

115
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:01.184
<v Speaker 1>versa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

116
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.610
<v Speaker 1>So we don't understand the optimal </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance for,</v>

117
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.030
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for longterm thriving in a relationship.</v>

118
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:08.864
<v Speaker 1>But I think we do understand the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you're too different in your </v>

119
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:13.520
<v Speaker 1>traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that those,</v>

120
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 1>that where you're different is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitute a chronic source of conflict.</v>
