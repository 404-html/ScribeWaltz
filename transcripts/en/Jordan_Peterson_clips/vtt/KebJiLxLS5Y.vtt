1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that nature was the philosopher</v>

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:04.620
<v Speaker 1>who announced the death of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:05.454
<v Speaker 1>and who is a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great critic of Christianity at vicious </v>

4
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>critic of Institutional Christianity in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best sense,</v>

5
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he announced the death of God and he</v>

6
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>said that we'd never find enough water </v>
<v Speaker 1>to wash away the blood.</v>

7
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:17.784
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a triumphant proclamation even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though it's often read that way and </v>

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>niches conclusion from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the death of God,</v>

9
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>the fact that our ethical systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to collapse.</v>

10
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>When the foundation was pulled out from </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath him,</v>

11
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.050
<v Speaker 1>he believed that human beings would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find their own values to create their</v>

12
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:34.884
<v Speaker 1>own values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a problem with that because </v>

13
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:37.434
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something Carl young was very </v>

14
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.823
<v Speaker 1>thorough in investigating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really look like people are </v>

15
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.493
<v Speaker 1>capable of creating their own values </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not really capable of </v>

16
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:48.780
<v Speaker 1>molding yourself just any old way.</v>

17
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>You want to be like you have a nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to contend with,</v>

18
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.973
<v Speaker 1>and so it isn't a matter of creating our</v>
<v Speaker 1>own values because we don't have that </v>

19
00:00:56.611 --> 00:00:57.444
<v Speaker 1>capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be a matter of rediscovering </v>

20
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>those values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what [inaudible] was attempting</v>

21
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 1>to do now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

22
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.633
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I think Nietzsche was actually </v>

23
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>profoundly wrong in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that recommendation.</v>

24
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>I think he was psychologically wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

25
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was [inaudible] wrote in many ways</v>

26
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Speaker 1>in parallel to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nisha was a great influence on Ninja.</v>

27
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:18.284
<v Speaker 1>Their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives parallel each other to a </v>

28
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>degree that's somewhat miraculous and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some senses it's quite uncanny.</v>

29
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky was obviously a literary </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure,</v>

30
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:28.290
<v Speaker 1>whether whereas nature was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher,</v>

31
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.163
<v Speaker 1>a literary philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still a philosopher and Dostoevsky </v>

32
00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>wrestled with exactly the same problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

33
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.280
<v Speaker 1>that nature wrestled with and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he did it in a different way.</v>

34
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.263
<v Speaker 1>He didn't literary manner and he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>this great book and the brothers </v>

35
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:43.734
<v Speaker 1>Karamazov.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that book there's a hero of the </v>

36
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:48.390
<v Speaker 1>book is really Leo Show Who's a monastic</v>
<v Speaker 1>novitiate,</v>

37
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 1>a very good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a,</v>

38
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.290
<v Speaker 1>not an intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not an intellect,</v>

39
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:53.170
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>a person of great character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:56.380
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he has a brother Ivan,</v>

42
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.370
<v Speaker 1>who's his older brother who a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect and,</v>

43
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.900
<v Speaker 1>and a very handsome soldier and a brave </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

44
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 1>And like Dostoyevsky's villains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivan isn't exactly a villain,</v>

45
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:05.544
<v Speaker 1>but that's close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivan or Dostoevsky makes his villains </v>

46
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if Dostoevsky's trying to work out an</v>

47
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:12.054
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

48
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.860
<v Speaker 1>he clothes the argument in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the flesh of one of his characters,</v>

49
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.933
<v Speaker 1>and if it's an argument he doesn't agree</v>
<v Speaker 1>with and he makes that character as </v>

50
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:21.084
<v Speaker 1>strong as he possibly can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as strong and as attractive and </v>

51
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>intelligent as he possibly can.</v>

52
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.793
<v Speaker 1>And then he let him just have outer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Ivan is constantly attacking Lee </v>

53
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Osha and from every direction trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>knock him off his perch of faith,</v>

54
00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:36.260
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Osha Lee.</v>

55
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Osha can't address a single one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivan's criticisms and,</v>

56
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 1>and he doesn't have the intellect for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

57
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:43.000
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

58
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.760
<v Speaker 1>and Ivan has a devastating intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's devastating to him himself as well.</v>

59
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 1>What happens in the brothers Karamazov </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially is the daily.</v>

60
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Alicia continues to act out his </v>
<v Speaker 1>commitment to the good,</v>

61
00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:56.760
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that manner,</v>

62
00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:57.594
<v Speaker 1>he's triumphant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter that he loses the </v>

63
00:02:59.041 --> 00:03:01.350
<v Speaker 1>arguments because the arguments aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the point.</v>

64
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 1>The arguments in some sense are aside.</v>
