1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.400
<v Speaker 1>The sociopathic types too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they prey on the elderly,</v>

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.260
<v Speaker 1>like they're bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3
00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Well this is a big problem now with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>

4
00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:07.034
<v Speaker 1>So I mean close to my grandma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she calls me up and out of the blue </v>

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.853
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just got a call from you and Mexico </v>

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>saying that you were stranded there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed me to send you 1500 bucks.</v>

7
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:19.824
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the.</v>

8
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.903
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

9
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's associated sociopath,</v>

10
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:25.723
<v Speaker 1>sociopath to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they're just like opportunistic </v>

11
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:32.241
<v Speaker 1>people or what's the difference to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the real psychopathic types state.</v>

12
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 1>They have no conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're there to be plucked.</v>

13
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.880
<v Speaker 1>You're an MPC in a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's had been described.</v>

14
00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

15
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:39.714
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're relatively rare and they do </v>

16
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:42.084
<v Speaker 1>have to move around and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can be successful in </v>

17
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily corrupt environments for</v>
<v Speaker 1>short periods of time,</v>

18
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:49.440
<v Speaker 1>but it's just not a stable solution.</v>

19
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.330
<v Speaker 1>I can give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

20
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.003
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about like the high </v>

21
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>ranking officers in the Nazi party where</v>
<v Speaker 1>these psychopaths that were thriving and</v>

22
00:00:57.781 --> 00:00:58.614
<v Speaker 1>a unstable corrupt situation or these </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise decent people that just got </v>

23
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.510
<v Speaker 1>twisted up and the and while they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

24
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.840
<v Speaker 1>a little of column a and a little of </v>
<v Speaker 1>column b,</v>

25
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was certainly openings in the</v>

26
00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:12.644
<v Speaker 1>Nazi hierarchy's for people who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionless and cruel and vengeful </v>

27
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:16.970
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

28
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.550
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The SS is a good example of that.</v>

29
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.150
<v Speaker 1>But there's a great book that I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>recommend to your,</v>

30
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.420
<v Speaker 1>to your listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your viewers called ordinary men,</v>

31
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Christopher Browning.</v>

32
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.470
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a great book and it tracks </v>
<v Speaker 1>the development of.</v>

33
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.783
<v Speaker 1>So when the Nazis moved through Poland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they left policeman behind to maintain </v>

34
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:40.011
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

35
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:40.844
<v Speaker 1>but it was still under wartime and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Browning track the behavior of this one </v>

36
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.480
<v Speaker 1>unit of policemen.</v>

37
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.333
<v Speaker 1>They were all middle aged guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just typical middleclass [inaudible] </v>

38
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.920
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd grown up really before Hitler.</v>

39
00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:58.820
<v Speaker 1>So they weren't thoroughly indoctrinated</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Nazi youth say.</v>

40
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.163
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were sent to Poland and their </v>

41
00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:05.090
<v Speaker 1>commander said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

42
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.040
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's war time and you know,</v>

43
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:09.710
<v Speaker 1>there are traders everywhere and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have to do some pretty horrible</v>

44
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:12.680
<v Speaker 1>things here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't have to,</v>

45
00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:15.410
<v Speaker 1>you can go home if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think that's just too much.</v>

46
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.750
<v Speaker 1>And none of them did and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why not?</v>

47
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:20.270
<v Speaker 1>They had the opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reason was,</v>

48
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.900
<v Speaker 1>well they were comrades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say in arms,</v>

49
00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:26.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they had that spree decor thing going</v>

50
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:27.404
<v Speaker 1>and they were all thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm not gonna like run away and </v>

51
00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:31.580
<v Speaker 1>leave my colleagues to do all the dirty </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

52
00:02:31.581 --> 00:02:34.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a war and duty to have a duty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

53
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:34.820
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

54
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.920
<v Speaker 1>So fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

55
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 1>they started by rounding up all the Jews</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were between 18 and 65,</v>

56
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:44.510
<v Speaker 1>the man and shipping them away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they ended up by,</v>

57
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.830
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is rough,</v>

58
00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:46.664
<v Speaker 1>it's a rough book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ended up taking naked pregnant </v>

59
00:02:48.861 --> 00:02:51.710
<v Speaker 1>women out into the middle of fields and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting them in the back of the head.</v>

60
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.851
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

61
00:02:52.851 --> 00:02:56.960
<v Speaker 1>how does a man transform in that manner </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Browning shows you like,</v>

62
00:02:56.961 --> 00:02:57.794
<v Speaker 1>it's not pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went psychological hell each step </v>

63
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 1>of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they went,</v>

64
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so lots of times it was ordinary men who</v>

65
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.833
<v Speaker 1>went down the bad path one step at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and sometimes it was like people </v>

66
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:12.424
<v Speaker 1>who were rotten to the core,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the minister of propaganda or </v>

67
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Magali the doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.303
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a sadistic psychopaths of the </v>

69
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:20.824
<v Speaker 1>highest order</v>

70
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.820
<v Speaker 2>is um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a mastermind at,</v>

71
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.720
<v Speaker 2>it seems so complicated to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

72
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 2>to transform an ordinary man as the book</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

73
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 2>and to just someone who's willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to execute a pregnant,</v>

74
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.623
<v Speaker 2>innocent woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a mastermind that plots the </v>

75
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 2>course of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is it just,</v>

76
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm circle like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just happened naturally as the,</v>

77
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.990
<v Speaker 2>along with the objectives of the like </v>
<v Speaker 2>how did,</v>

78
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.950
<v Speaker 2>how do they orchestrate something so </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated?</v>

79
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

80
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.153
<v Speaker 1>the Germans were an organized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are organized people were an organized </v>

81
00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:56.720
<v Speaker 1>people and Hitler really didn't give out</v>
<v Speaker 1>directives precisely.</v>

82
00:03:56.721 --> 00:03:57.554
<v Speaker 1>He sort of hinted at what he might want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then his minions would get together </v>

83
00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:03.260
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lay out policies in accordance with what</v>

84
00:04:03.261 --> 00:04:05.600
<v Speaker 1>they thought were his wishes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean there's a book,</v>

85
00:04:05.601 --> 00:04:09.230
<v Speaker 1>another book I would recommend called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Eichmann in Jerusalem.</v>

86
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 1>And Eichmann was really the architect of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the final solution in many ways and it's</v>

87
00:04:14.991 --> 00:04:15.824
<v Speaker 1>a character or logical analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Eichmann and Eichmann was in no way a </v>

88
00:04:19.101 --> 00:04:20.450
<v Speaker 1>psychopath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:04:20.451 --> 00:04:22.790
<v Speaker 1>he was perfectly capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

90
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:23.803
<v Speaker 1>I think this is actually a true story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might have it confused with another </v>

91
00:04:26.541 --> 00:04:28.310
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter really.</v>

92
00:04:28.311 --> 00:04:29.000
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

93
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.833
<v Speaker 1>it's the same idea he won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a story about him driving home </v>

94
00:04:33.201 --> 00:04:37.220
<v Speaker 1>after work one day and running over a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cat and having like a terrible emotional</v>

95
00:04:37.221 --> 00:04:38.330
<v Speaker 1>reaction to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.690
<v Speaker 1>and it's not like his kids didn't love </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and you know,</v>

97
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.240
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wasn't out there actually killing</v>

98
00:04:44.241 --> 00:04:46.160
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just making the plans.</v>

99
00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:46.994
<v Speaker 1>He was the bureaucrats behind the scenes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was the sort of guy who had his </v>

100
00:04:49.101 --> 00:04:51.920
<v Speaker 1>mum do his laundry when he went off to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the army,</v>

101
00:04:51.921 --> 00:04:53.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a.</v>

102
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.130
<v Speaker 1>He was a faceless bureaucrat and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have worked in any bureaucracy.</v>

103
00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:58.964
<v Speaker 1>He was worried about his next promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't thinking about the larger </v>

104
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 1>consequences and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's Hannah Arendt and she.</v>

105
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.990
<v Speaker 1>That's a very classic book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Eichmann in Jerusalem and that's,</v>

106
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.930
<v Speaker 1>that's very much worth reading if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in this sort of thing.</v>

107
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.083
<v Speaker 2>One of the interesting things I always </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard about the Nazis that really </v>

108
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:18.280
<v Speaker 2>humanizes them in a way is that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

109
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 2>and you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong about this,</v>

110
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:22.780
<v Speaker 2>but they were passing out alcohol to all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the soldiers,</v>

111
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:23.614
<v Speaker 2>especially those in the concentration </v>
<v Speaker 2>camps to keep them intoxicated all the </v>

112
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 2>time so that they could not confront the</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible things they were doing.</v>

113
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

114
00:05:31.041 --> 00:05:32.360
<v Speaker 1>they had all sorts of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

115
00:05:32.361 --> 00:05:34.910
<v Speaker 1>of les learned how to do it across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

116
00:05:34.911 --> 00:05:36.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

117
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.073
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

118
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.720
<v Speaker 1>So Hitler started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things Hitler started.</v>

119
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.103
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange story in many ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Hitler was obsessed with order </v>

120
00:05:46.431 --> 00:05:47.264
<v Speaker 1>and cleanliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a very orderly person and he was </v>

121
00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:52.730
<v Speaker 1>very sensitive to discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

122
00:05:52.731 --> 00:05:53.451
<v Speaker 1>because you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

123
00:05:53.451 --> 00:05:55.220
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis were afraid of the Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:56.930
<v Speaker 1>because they were out there and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not right.</v>

125
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 1>What's more accurate is that the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially Hitler,</v>

126
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:01.311
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

127
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

128
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 1>he was very sensitive to discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like.</v>

129
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>And if you're disgusted by something </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you want to eradicate it.</v>

130
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're afraid of something,</v>

131
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:10.890
<v Speaker 1>you want to run away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're disgusted by it,</v>

132
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>you want to burn it to the damn ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to get rid of it.</v>

133
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.133
<v Speaker 1>And his writings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read a book called Hitler's table </v>

134
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:19.634
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was his spontaneous discussions </v>

135
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:27.671
<v Speaker 1>during dinner time from 1939 to 1942.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really another amazing book.</v>

136
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.310
<v Speaker 1>And we had been doing some work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspired a bit by Jonathan Heit,</v>

137
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:34.724
<v Speaker 1>who's done a lot of work on disgust and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between trait </v>

138
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:38.624
<v Speaker 1>personality and I was reading this book </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time and it was just </v>

139
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:42.434
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable how often Hitler referred </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the people he was eradicating the </v>

140
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:47.534
<v Speaker 1>Slavs and the Gypsies and the Jews and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the people he went after as </v>

141
00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 1>parasites and as rats and insects and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

142
00:06:53.991 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Speaker 1>So they were kind of put into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

143
00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:56.834
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's the horrifying part of that </v>

144
00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when Hitler came to power,</v>

145
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 1>he put it in a lot of public health </v>
<v Speaker 1>initiatives,</v>

146
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:04.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including master book,</v>

147
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.833
<v Speaker 1>tuberculosis screening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which actually turned out to be a good </v>

148
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:08.270
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

149
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:13.270
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time he went on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautify the factories campaign.</v>

150
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.960
<v Speaker 1>And so he convinced the German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

151
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>factory owners and so forth to,</v>

152
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.260
<v Speaker 1>to increase the levels of hygiene in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>factories to get rid of the rats and the</v>

153
00:07:24.261 --> 00:07:26.120
<v Speaker 1>mice to plant flowers out front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:28.310
<v Speaker 1>to make everything look neat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly.</v>

155
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.580
<v Speaker 1>And the insecticide they used was Zike </v>
<v Speaker 1>lawn.</v>

156
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as icon to,</v>

157
00:07:33.861 --> 00:07:34.694
<v Speaker 1>so to eradicate the routes and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>insects cycle on slightly different </v>

158
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:39.980
<v Speaker 1>formulation was the gas that was used in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the concentration camps.</v>

159
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:40.814
<v Speaker 1>And so Hitler went from cleaning up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rats and the mice in the factories and </v>

160
00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:47.120
<v Speaker 1>the insects and then he went into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental hospitals and started cleaning up</v>

161
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 1>in there and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just went broader and broader again,</v>

162
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:54.330
<v Speaker 1>sort of one step at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.130
<v Speaker 1>when the Germans had plenty of reason to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be resentful and hateful because I mean,</v>

164
00:07:58.131 --> 00:07:59.270
<v Speaker 1>think about what they went through.</v>

165
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 1>We can't even imagine it the first of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

166
00:08:01.521 --> 00:08:02.354
<v Speaker 1>there was world war one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was many men like Hitler </v>

167
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:08.210
<v Speaker 1>himself who served in the trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's one story about Hitler.</v>

168
00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

169
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:10.813
<v Speaker 1>he won a medal for heroism in World War </v>
<v Speaker 1>One and he was sitting around with a </v>

170
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:17.540
<v Speaker 1>group of his buddies and went off to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

171
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:18.374
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he came back they were all dead </v>

172
00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:20.160
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

173
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mine and not a mine,</v>

174
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:23.263
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what's kind of some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of shell Atlanta did middler and </v>

175
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:28.610
<v Speaker 1>killed them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like that changes you,</v>

176
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then afterwards there was all these </v>

177
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:33.200
<v Speaker 1>brutalized men who'd come out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trenches.</v>

178
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:34.034
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just can't imagine what it must've </v>

179
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 1>been like in the trenches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

180
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:38.900
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're there for like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years,</v>

181
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.240
<v Speaker 1>you aren't the same person get out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

182
00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:43.190
<v Speaker 1>you're unemployed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your countries in ruins.</v>

183
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.293
<v Speaker 1>Then the hyperinflation hits and every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single person in Germany who ever saved </v>

184
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:49.880
<v Speaker 1>any money at all is flat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody broke.</v>

185
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.983
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a communist revolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>brewing in Russia and it's like it's </v>

186
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Nazis came along and said,</v>

187
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:56.994
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only are we going to restore order </v>

188
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:00.774
<v Speaker 1>in greatness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to bloody well tell you </v>

189
00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 1>whose fault this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

190
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:04.763
<v Speaker 1>and Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've studied him a lot trying to </v>

191
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:10.170
<v Speaker 1>understand what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Hitler was Carl Jung called them the</v>

192
00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:13.200
<v Speaker 1>mouthpiece of the collective unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the German people.</v>

193
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.153
<v Speaker 1>So imagine there's all this resentment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hatred brewing underneath the </v>

194
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:17.394
<v Speaker 1>surface and all of this chaos is there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the desire for order is like </v>

195
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:24.300
<v Speaker 1>clamoring and everyone's minds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler comes along and he's,</v>

196
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.373
<v Speaker 1>he's a very powerful emotional oratory </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's watching the crowd and he </v>

197
00:09:30.211 --> 00:09:33.990
<v Speaker 1>listened and when he says thing a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing happens.</v>

198
00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.870
<v Speaker 1>When he says thing B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody roars.</v>

199
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.830
<v Speaker 1>And so he takes note of that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not even conscious exactly right because</v>

200
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:41.664
<v Speaker 1>he's being molded by the crowd and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they roar and so we think so that's a </v>

201
00:09:45.361 --> 00:09:47.070
<v Speaker 1>reinforcement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a reward.</v>

202
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.233
<v Speaker 1>And so then he goes down that line a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit farther and they roar some </v>

203
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:53.300
<v Speaker 1>more and then he tries something else </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's silent what they want.</v>

204
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.760
<v Speaker 1>You Bet exactly that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

205
00:09:55.761 --> 00:10:00.761
<v Speaker 1>he acts out the dark desire of the mob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he becomes the embodiment of the dark</v>

206
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 1>desire of the mob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly,</v>

207
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.003
<v Speaker 1>that's partly why he had the charisma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right because there's this </v>

208
00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:11.760
<v Speaker 1>unconscious fantasy brewing in the back </v>
<v Speaker 1>of everyone's minds.</v>

209
00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 1>You see that to some degree now with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Antifa for example,</v>

210
00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:17.850
<v Speaker 1>and their proclivity towards violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what you asked what?</v>

211
00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Just exactly what's going on there.</v>

212
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.773
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hip there came to embody the desire of </v>

213
00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:27.150
<v Speaker 1>the German people for order and revenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

214
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.330
<v Speaker 1>he embodied that fully know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could say,</v>

215
00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:33.630
<v Speaker 1>so what happened was a collaboration </v>
<v Speaker 1>between him and the people.</v>

216
00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:36.090
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't Hitler turned everyone into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazis.</v>

217
00:10:36.091 --> 00:10:37.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

218
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.213
<v Speaker 1>that's not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there was a lot of good people </v>

219
00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:44.781
<v Speaker 1>still left over who got just overrun by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mania to well were disgusted.</v>

220
00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>

221
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.070
<v Speaker 1>the other thing too is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

222
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:52.290
<v Speaker 1>people are not that brave in everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks this is one of the things I teach</v>

223
00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:54.060
<v Speaker 1>in my maps of meaning class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

224
00:10:54.061 --> 00:10:55.020
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

225
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:57.480
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at Nazi Germany in the thirties</v>

226
00:10:57.481 --> 00:10:58.314
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'd be one of the heroes who </v>

227
00:10:59.671 --> 00:11:00.504
<v Speaker 1>rescued the Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like statistically that's very </v>

228
00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:03.760
<v Speaker 1>improbable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

229
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:04.763
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I've learned in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last year with all this strange </v>

230
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.270
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say,</v>

231
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:15.223
<v Speaker 1>this strange situation that I've been in</v>
<v Speaker 1>is how unlikely it is for people to </v>

232
00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:19.974
<v Speaker 1>speak up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just won't even tenured professors </v>

233
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.020
<v Speaker 1>who are tenured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're protected.</v>

234
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.303
<v Speaker 1>It's like the probability they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll pop their head up and say </v>

235
00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:31.260
<v Speaker 1>something that might make them </v>
<v Speaker 1>identifiable is very,</v>

236
00:11:31.261 --> 00:11:33.220
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So scary.</v>

237
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you're right.</v>

238
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that time,</v>

239
00:11:35.671 --> 00:11:38.400
<v Speaker 1>and you know Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stakes were as high as it could get.</v>

240
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.440
<v Speaker 1>They didn't tolerate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

241
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.290
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even when the stakes are low,</v>

242
00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:44.410
<v Speaker 1>people won't speak up.</v>
