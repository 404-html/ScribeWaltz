1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.370
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend at one point who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very bitter person and he had a bunch of</v>

2
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:06.204
<v Speaker 1>problems and some of them were self </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflicted in some of them were fate I </v>

3
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:12.400
<v Speaker 1>suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had his.</v>

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>He had become very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very destructive,</v>

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.810
<v Speaker 1>murderously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destructive,</v>

6
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:17.700
<v Speaker 1>genocidally destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

7
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:18.534
<v Speaker 1>You could see it in his dreams and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he lived with me for awhile and I </v>

8
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:25.524
<v Speaker 1>knew him very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a friend of mine from the time I </v>

9
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:31.881
<v Speaker 1>was 12 until the time he committed </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide when he was 40 and when he lived</v>

10
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>with me I was trying to help him get on </v>
<v Speaker 1>his feet,</v>

11
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>which was why he had come to live with </v>
<v Speaker 1>me because he thought maybe I could help</v>

12
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:43.821
<v Speaker 1>him get on his feet and he could only </v>
<v Speaker 1>take relatively low level jobs.</v>

13
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he had some mechanical ability.</v>

14
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't get educated.</v>

15
00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Although he's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart person.</v>

16
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>He probably had an Iq of about 135 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

17
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>He's very smart and so he was bitter too</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he hadn't educated themselves to</v>

18
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>the level that has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

19
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>his intellect would have demanded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we had to take jobs that were beneath</v>

20
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>him intellectually and he had a re.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had that real intellectual arrogance,</v>

21
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:04.254
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was smart and really smart </v>

22
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:06.954
<v Speaker 1>people often come to believe that only </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart matters and if they're smart and </v>

23
00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:12.714
<v Speaker 1>all that and all that matters is smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the world is sort of laying </v>

24
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:19.700
<v Speaker 1>itself at their feet and they've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly betrayed and,</v>

25
00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>and then they claim to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence which is more like a talent</v>

26
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>or a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like it's an idol,</v>

27
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a false idol,</v>

28
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what it is in a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous one.</v>

29
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.953
<v Speaker 1>And get cynical about the stupidity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and the fact that there are </v>

30
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:35.364
<v Speaker 1>talents weren't properly recognized and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not that helpful because </v>

31
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>smart is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you,</v>

32
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:41.334
<v Speaker 1>if you don't use it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will devour you just like all </v>

33
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.080
<v Speaker 1>arbitrarily assigned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell it right.</v>

34
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>So you might have a talent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's your friend.</v>

35
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>If you use it properly and you misuse </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

36
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.313
<v Speaker 1>it will be your enemy and maybe that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how God keeps the cosmic scales </v>

37
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>adjusted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyhow,</v>

38
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:58.044
<v Speaker 1>my friend was a very smart person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although not as smart as he thought he </v>

39
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:01.524
<v Speaker 1>was unfortunately and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he hadn't done what would have been </v>

40
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:05.334
<v Speaker 1>necessary with that intelligence to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it manifest itself properly in the </v>

41
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:09.504
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that also embittered him because he </v>

42
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:15.600
<v Speaker 1>also knew that there was more that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have done if he would have done it</v>

43
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.643
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps more that he could still do </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I was suggesting to him while he </v>

44
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>was living with us because he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.293
<v Speaker 1>two levels from homeless by that point </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that he should find a job that he </v>

46
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:31.620
<v Speaker 1>could find working in a garage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working in a shop,</v>

47
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:32.454
<v Speaker 1>something like that because he had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanical ability and that he should </v>

48
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.373
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

49
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.973
<v Speaker 1>He should separate himself from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrogance that made him presumed that </v>

50
00:02:41.441 --> 00:02:46.441
<v Speaker 1>such a job would be beneath him because </v>
<v Speaker 1>at that point no job was beneath him.</v>

51
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>

52
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>it's not so obvious that jobs are </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneath people,</v>

53
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.600
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because even if you're a,</v>

54
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.050
<v Speaker 1>even if you imagine you have a job as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>checkout person in a grocery store,</v>

55
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:05.340
<v Speaker 1>you know as a fairly unskilled job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be in some miserable,</v>

56
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 1>resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrid bastard doing that job.</v>

57
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:08.824
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you can come in there just </v>

58
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:10.564
<v Speaker 1>exuding resentment and bitterness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>making mistakes and making sure that </v>

59
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:15.514
<v Speaker 1>every customer that passes by you has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly worse day than they need to </v>

60
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.043
<v Speaker 1>write and pilfering time and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>pilfering goods and being resentful </v>

61
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:26.404
<v Speaker 1>about the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who gave you the position because </v>

62
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>they're above you in the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and talking bad things.</v>
