1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.553
<v Speaker 1>I started watching a lot of pornography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pornography that I was watching had </v>

2
00:00:05.891 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>to fit in with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't just watch anything.</v>

3
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became very limited to watching a very</v>

4
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:15.921
<v Speaker 1>specific type and I read the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain that changes itself by Dr.</v>

5
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.140
<v Speaker 1>no dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see that exactly.</v>

6
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:19.974
<v Speaker 1>And I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though I knew that the more </v>

7
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:26.490
<v Speaker 1>times you give in your building up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuitry and the last times you give in</v>

8
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.310
<v Speaker 1>your getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

9
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.183
<v Speaker 1>I've had issues with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I've recently done that </v>

10
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:32.124
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've stopped watching pornography for </v>

11
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.680
<v Speaker 1>about a month now.</v>

12
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let,</v>

13
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.630
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you about that because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

14
00:00:37.631 --> 00:00:38.464
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a big undergrown conversation </v>

15
00:00:40.181 --> 00:00:42.280
<v Speaker 2>about pornography that's happening on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the web,</v>

16
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and with,</v>

17
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.780
<v Speaker 2>with many man and it's hard to tell how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many deciding to stop using pornography.</v>

18
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.603
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've made some comments publicly about </v>

19
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.730
<v Speaker 2>pornography use being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it sub optimal,</v>

20
00:00:57.731 --> 00:00:59.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it.</v>

21
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it,</v>

22
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.593
<v Speaker 2>I think that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't good for the women who were </v>

23
00:01:02.951 --> 00:01:05.710
<v Speaker 2>involved in it and it's not good for </v>
<v Speaker 2>young men because it's,</v>

24
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.800
<v Speaker 2>it's too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives you access to something,</v>

25
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.810
<v Speaker 2>gives you access to part of something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but denies you access to all of it.</v>

26
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's dangerous because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

27
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:21.150
<v Speaker 2>because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it offers immediate gratification,</v>

28
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:22.090
<v Speaker 2>but no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's it.</v>

29
00:01:22.091 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 2>It offers immediate gratification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no medium to longterm development of</v>

30
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:27.690
<v Speaker 2>character or life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's it.</v>

31
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.850
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that seems to be a dangerous kind of</v>

32
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 2>trap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing is that it's also A.</v>

33
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 2>Norman has talked about this Dr Doidge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

34
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:36.624
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know what that kind of massive </v>

35
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:43.310
<v Speaker 2>exposure to multiple virtual sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>partners and,</v>

36
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.203
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and does two to the development of the </v>

37
00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:48.644
<v Speaker 2>sexual sexual behavior and sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>gratification and sexual impulse in </v>

38
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 2>relationship in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in young men at all.</v>

39
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.933
<v Speaker 2>So it's a technological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technological marvel that's very </v>

40
00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 2>dangerous I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least it has the potential to be.</v>

41
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.660
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think the pornography use</v>
<v Speaker 2>did to you and what utility,</v>

42
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:11.060
<v Speaker 2>if any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has there been in stopping?</v>

43
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I found that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's just,</v>

44
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:15.624
<v Speaker 1>that's one issue that I've had or have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>major issue that I've had in many </v>

45
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:19.734
<v Speaker 1>different facets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been looking for instant </v>

46
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:23.820
<v Speaker 1>gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me it's been food,</v>

47
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.983
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>TV in pornography and I just found that </v>

48
00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>my thoughts would be always just looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>for one of those and it in,</v>

49
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.570
<v Speaker 1>as soon as they experience was over </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

50
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.523
<v Speaker 1>you'd have just had this little quick </v>
<v Speaker 1>release where you feel good and then </v>

51
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.573
<v Speaker 1>back in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've sort of realized that my </v>

52
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 1>pleasure was just getting rid of pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pain and pleasure are two sides,</v>

53
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.313
<v Speaker 1>sides of the same coin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was just flipping the same coin </v>

54
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:56.961
<v Speaker 1>over and over and how I felt now without</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

55
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first decided stop,</v>

56
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.533
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I'd try writing down every </v>

57
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:06.150
<v Speaker 1>time a thought came to watch pornography</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

58
00:03:06.151 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it the first day.</v>

59
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Like it seemed like almost like once a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

60
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Like I just have a thought saying watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

61
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:14.344
<v Speaker 1>watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my thoughts would try to trick me </v>

62
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

63
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.053
<v Speaker 1>but just by observing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what you think about </v>

64
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:23.764
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I would do is when I get the </v>

65
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>thought to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

66
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.583
<v Speaker 1>I bite down on my thumb in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular spot and then I found that </v>

67
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>the next few days the thoughts were just</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming less and less.</v>

68
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>And now that it's been a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rarely have the thought.</v>

69
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.043
<v Speaker 1>And the benefits I find is that I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel so much more aware and I'm not </v>

70
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>seeking pleasure as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just enjoying going,</v>

71
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 1>going for walks and being in nature.</v>

72
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.780
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

73
00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:53.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

74
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.133
<v Speaker 2>your report is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is really quite reminiscent of an </v>

75
00:03:57.841 --> 00:03:58.674
<v Speaker 2>addiction actually because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you mentioned this and you did a </v>

76
00:04:01.681 --> 00:04:03.090
<v Speaker 2>good job of explaining it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

77
00:04:03.091 --> 00:04:03.924
<v Speaker 2>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you engage in a behavior and then </v>

78
00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:08.820
<v Speaker 2>it's followed by a burst of pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an orgasmic release,</v>

79
00:04:08.821 --> 00:04:09.654
<v Speaker 2>then that behavior is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerfully reinforced and the circuitry </v>

80
00:04:14.011 --> 00:04:14.844
<v Speaker 2>that that drives you to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that behavior is going to become </v>

81
00:04:17.101 --> 00:04:17.934
<v Speaker 2>dominant because behavior that </v>
<v Speaker 2>culminates in a reward tends to become </v>

82
00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:22.644
<v Speaker 2>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that includes attitudes and ideas </v>

83
00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:27.510
<v Speaker 2>and thoughts and impulses and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationalizations,</v>

84
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:28.344
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of exactly the sort that you were </v>

85
00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:29.934
<v Speaker 2>describing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you said that it really plagued </v>

86
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.263
<v Speaker 2>badly for the first day or two and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>started to decrease quite precipitously </v>

87
00:04:36.541 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 2>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

88
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 2>that's a good example of how behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>extinguishes if you cease rewarding it.</v>

89
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.633
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what does that freed you up to do </v>

90
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:47.664
<v Speaker 2>and what do you think that's going to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of your willingness or ability </v>

91
00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:55.020
<v Speaker 2>to pursue longterm a longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship?</v>

92
00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:55.680
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

93
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.450
<v Speaker 1>For Free Time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

94
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made a schedule after watching your,</v>

95
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:00.663
<v Speaker 1>your personality lectures and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have obviously I have a lot more time </v>

96
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 1>on my hands to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do those things.</v>

97
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.193
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in terms of finding a partner since </v>

98
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:11.854
<v Speaker 1>I've been back in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't even for a lot of times I </v>

99
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:16.414
<v Speaker 1>haven't approached women because I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel that no matter what it leads to </v>

100
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 1>just have difficulties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On one occasion there was a girl who was</v>

101
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:29.810
<v Speaker 1>hitting on me and we went on a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>dates and it went great.</v>

102
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>She was attracted to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was attracted to her,</v>

103
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 1>we had a great time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it came time to be intimate,</v>

104
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:38.920
<v Speaker 1>adjust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was shaking like a leaf,</v>

105
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.950
<v Speaker 1>like I just because I was so used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>using the same stimulus of imagining,</v>

106
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.490
<v Speaker 1>I had a very strict thing that I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine in my mind.</v>

107
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:50.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for most guys,</v>

108
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:52.870
<v Speaker 1>what they have to think of when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch pornography.</v>

109
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.123
<v Speaker 1>I had to imagine entire backstory </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I had this issue with trust </v>

110
00:05:56.711 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 1>because of what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

111
00:05:58.341 --> 00:05:59.750
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are we?</v>

112
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Why did we meet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going to happen after like I.</v>

113
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.130
<v Speaker 1>So because of all that I've just sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>been avoiding it.</v>

114
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.453
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

115
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me ask you a question.</v>

116
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:13.244
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd been trying to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable guidelines might be with </v>

117
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:21.731
<v Speaker 2>regards to initiating sexual activity </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a new partner.</v>

118
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:22.574
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me that you probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't initiate anything that you </v>

119
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:30.830
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't talk to the person about </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what that might mean is that you</v>

120
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:34.070
<v Speaker 2>don't know them well enough to go that </v>
<v Speaker 2>far with them physically.</v>

121
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 2>And there's dangers in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You outlined some of them,</v>

122
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean sex is powerful and it can,</v>

123
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're inexperienced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can hurt you and hurt can be,</v>

124
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:45.543
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long term or permanent and that's kind </v>

125
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:49.664
<v Speaker 2>of what you're relating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that I might </v>

126
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 2>suggest is that when you initiate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next relationship that you.</v>

127
00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:59.423
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that this is an easy </v>

128
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 2>thing to do because it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

129
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:03.613
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing wrong with not moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward sexually until you've been able </v>

130
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:12.521
<v Speaker 2>to discuss what your life personally in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to sexual behavior,</v>

131
00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:14.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like because you might say,</v>

132
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:15.704
<v Speaker 2>well maybe you shouldn't be engaging in </v>
<v Speaker 2>intimate behavior with a person before </v>

133
00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:23.210
<v Speaker 2>you can tell them the story about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to you and in the South Pacific</v>

134
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 2>and lay out your personal history and be</v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable with that.</v>

135
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.323
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems to me that sort of emotional </v>

136
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:31.950
<v Speaker 2>intimacy seems to be the proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>precursor to physical intimacy.</v>

137
00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:32.784
<v Speaker 2>And I know that our culture has pushed </v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard probably since about the </v>

138
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.950
<v Speaker 2>year or since about the emergence of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>birth control pill.</v>

139
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:40.963
<v Speaker 2>It's pushed pretty hard on this idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that casual sex is first of all </v>

140
00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:46.094
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it can be casual and also </v>

141
00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 2>desirable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that that.</v>

142
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.640
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe either of those.</v>

143
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:53.474
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that there is such a thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>as casual sex and I don't think that </v>

144
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:56.534
<v Speaker 2>it's desirable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it causes people a lot more </v>

145
00:07:58.431 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 2>trouble than they realize.</v>
