1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Tell me if you disagree with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:01.811 --> 00:00:04.990
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a sociologist,</v>

3
00:00:04.991 --> 00:00:05.824
<v Speaker 1>and so I'm dabbling in things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of my field of expertise and </v>

4
00:00:08.231 --> 00:00:10.160
<v Speaker 1>there is some danger in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

5
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.403
<v Speaker 1>the central postmodernists claim seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me that because there's a near </v>

6
00:00:14.471 --> 00:00:15.304
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of ways to interpret a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex set of phenomena which which </v>

7
00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:19.534
<v Speaker 1>actually happens to be the case that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't make a case that any of those </v>

8
00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:23.974
<v Speaker 1>modes of interpretation are canonical </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if they're not canonical and if </v>

9
00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:32.290
<v Speaker 1>that canonical element isn't based in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of reality than it serves some</v>

10
00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:35.140
<v Speaker 1>other master,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the master that it hypothetically</v>

11
00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:35.974
<v Speaker 1>serves for the postmodernists is nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>but power because that seems to be </v>

12
00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:41.500
<v Speaker 1>everything that they believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe in competence.</v>

13
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.453
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe in authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't seem to believe in an </v>

14
00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:47.020
<v Speaker 1>objective world because everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>language mediated.</v>

15
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.210
<v Speaker 1>So it's an extraordinarily cynical </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective that that because there's an</v>

16
00:00:52.211 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of interpretations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of them are canonical.</v>

17
00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:57.520
<v Speaker 1>You can attribute it to everything to </v>
<v Speaker 1>power and dominance.</v>

18
00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.563
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that that seemed like a reasonable </v>

19
00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:04.741
<v Speaker 1>summary of the radical relativism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a radical relativism now,</v>

20
00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:07.240
<v Speaker 1>but the strange thing is despite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

21
00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:08.074
<v Speaker 1>and so what goes along with that is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>demolition of grand narratives and so </v>

22
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>that would be associated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

23
00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:15.670
<v Speaker 1>with the rejection of thinkers like Don </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Eric Norman,</v>

24
00:01:15.671 --> 00:01:16.504
<v Speaker 1>because of course their foundational </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinkers in relationship to the idea </v>

25
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:24.160
<v Speaker 1>that there are embodied grand narratives</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's never touched,</v>

26
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.180
<v Speaker 1>but then despite the fact that the grand</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative is rejected,</v>

27
00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:32.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a neo Marxism that's tightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tightly allied with postmodernism.</v>

28
00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:34.570
<v Speaker 1>That also seems to shade into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange identity.</v>

29
00:01:34.571 --> 00:01:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Politics and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two things.</v>

30
00:01:37.391 --> 00:01:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the causal </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship there.</v>

31
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Like the skeptical part of me thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>that postmodernism was a,</v>

32
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.333
<v Speaker 1>was an intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's intellectual camouflage for the </v>

33
00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:49.084
<v Speaker 1>continuation of the kind of pathological</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxism that produced the Soviet Union </v>

34
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.470
<v Speaker 1>and that it has no independent existence</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an intellectual field whatsoever.</v>

35
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.663
<v Speaker 1>But I still can't understand how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists can make the no grand </v>

36
00:02:01.691 --> 00:02:02.524
<v Speaker 1>narrative claim but then immerse </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in this grand narrative </v>

37
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.090
<v Speaker 1>without anyone pointing out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>

38
00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Contradictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't understand that.</v>

39
00:02:12.221 --> 00:02:13.510
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think about?</v>

40
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.793
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can only speak about literary know </v>

41
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.133
<v Speaker 2>professors really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they seem to me almost universally </v>

42
00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:21.540
<v Speaker 2>in theU ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s to being very naive or they,</v>

43
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:22.374
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they seem to know nothing about actual </v>

44
00:02:23.741 --> 00:02:26.140
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political science or economics.</v>

45
00:02:26.141 --> 00:02:28.180
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is simply an attitude.</v>

46
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.193
<v Speaker 2>They have an attitude of Marxism become </v>
<v Speaker 2>simply a badge by which they telegraph </v>

47
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.810
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

48
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.110
<v Speaker 2>their solidarity with the working class </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they have nothing to do with,</v>

49
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.963
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

50
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.900
<v Speaker 1>and generally nothing but contempt.</v>

51
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.541
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

52
00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:42.850
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is that the,</v>

53
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.690
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the campus leftists are almost notorious</v>

54
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:46.750
<v Speaker 2>for their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

55
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.200
<v Speaker 2>for their rather snobbish treatment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>staff.</v>

56
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

57
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.310
<v Speaker 2>they don't have any rapport with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual working class members of the,</v>

58
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the infrastructure,</v>

59
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 2>the janitor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the janitor is,</v>

60
00:02:56.971 --> 00:02:57.920
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the,</v>

61
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.823
<v Speaker 2>even the secretaries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of high and mighty </v>

62
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 2>aristocracy and there were just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are people who um,</v>

63
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.853
<v Speaker 2>who have wandered into the English </v>
<v Speaker 2>department and our were products of a </v>

64
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:09.904
<v Speaker 2>time when I'm doing the new criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were when history with history and </v>

65
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 2>psychology had been excluded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me and my ambition.</v>

66
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:18.274
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was,</v>

67
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean I love the new criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

68
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:22.780
<v Speaker 2>As a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a style of textual analysis.</v>

69
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.371
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

70
00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 2>and the and the new criticism had </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple interpretations.</v>

71
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That were possible and we're encouraged.</v>

72
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.423
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the great projects was made in </v>

73
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Max series.</v>

74
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 2>Twentieth Century views were what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>had at least some books.</v>

75
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:36.454
<v Speaker 2>I adored them in college and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Jane Austin or about Emily Bronte </v>

76
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:40.624
<v Speaker 2>or about wordsworth and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>collections of alternate views of the </v>

77
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:45.424
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that there were no alternative </v>

78
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:48.394
<v Speaker 2>views and there was no relativistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>situational kinds of interpretive </v>

79
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.833
<v Speaker 2>approach is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point was we needed to restore </v>

80
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 2>history to literary literary study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

81
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 2>And we needed to add psychology to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was,</v>

82
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 2>it was great animus against Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I arrived in,</v>

83
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:06.520
<v Speaker 2>in graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

84
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:07.354
<v Speaker 2>I actually went into the director of </v>
<v Speaker 2>graduate studies and protesting the way </v>

85
00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:10.774
<v Speaker 2>Freud and Freudian were used as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as negative terms pay in a sneering way </v>

86
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:16.260
<v Speaker 2>by that very wasp professors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

87
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.820
<v Speaker 2>So we need to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

88
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 2>it seemed like we were moving there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get in there early.</v>

89
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:24.190
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen seventies was a great period of</v>
<v Speaker 2>psycho biography about great.</v>

90
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 2>About political figures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

91
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought it's happening in all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden they all got short circuited</v>

92
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.963
<v Speaker 2>by this arrival of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of poststructuralism and postmodernism </v>

93
00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:33.891
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

94
00:04:33.891 --> 00:04:35.480
<v Speaker 2>in the 19 seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

95
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

96
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

97
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 2>I feel I'm an old historicist okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now not a new historical.</v>

98
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.600
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think new stores.</v>

99
00:04:41.601 --> 00:04:43.440
<v Speaker 2>So it was an absolute scam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

100
00:04:43.441 --> 00:04:44.260
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

101
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.730
<v Speaker 2>it's just a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like tweezers you'd like just,</v>

102
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.970
<v Speaker 2>you pick a little bit of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of that,</v>

103
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:49.804
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of that you make a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny salad and someone that is atomized </v>

104
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.040
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

105
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to mean something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all can be very superficial,</v>

106
00:04:57.311 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 2>very cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very distance.</v>

107
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.241
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

108
00:05:00.241 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

109
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.290
<v Speaker 2>I am the product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

110
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Of Old historicism German philology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I decide my,</v>

111
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.400
<v Speaker 2>my first choice of profession when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a child.</v>

112
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.650
<v Speaker 2>What was Egyptology archeology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] I'm.</v>

113
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Everything I ever think about or say is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is related to an enormous time scheme.</v>

114
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:17.104
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From from antiquity and indeed from the </v>

115
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.803
<v Speaker 2>Stone Age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is the problem with these </v>

116
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're their male educated.</v>

117
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 2>The postmodernist and academic Marxists </v>
<v Speaker 2>are male educated,</v>

118
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.290
<v Speaker 2>embarrassingly so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

119
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:34.291
<v Speaker 2>They know nothing before the present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so call okay is absolutely a joke before</v>

120
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:36.500
<v Speaker 2>the enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

121
00:05:36.501 --> 00:05:40.430
<v Speaker 2>You mean per perhaps he might be useful </v>
<v Speaker 2>to people to talk about what happened at</v>

122
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.490
<v Speaker 2>after Neil classicism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>

123
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:45.880
<v Speaker 2>he failed to notice a lot of what he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

124
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:46.714
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turns out to CB simply the hangover of </v>

125
00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:50.110
<v Speaker 2>neoclassicism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

126
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.080
<v Speaker 2>This is how ignorant that man was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

127
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.220
<v Speaker 2>his head was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was not talented as a researcher.</v>

128
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 2>He knew absolutely nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

129
00:05:55.871 --> 00:05:56.470
<v Speaker 2>What stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

130
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.303
<v Speaker 2>nothing about antiquity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can you make any kind of large </v>

131
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.203
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>large mechanism to analyze western </v>

132
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 2>culture without knowing about classical </v>
<v Speaker 2>antiquity?</v>

133
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did not see anything from some person</v>

134
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 2>who had no business making large </v>
<v Speaker 2>theoretical statements about anything.</v>

135
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

136
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.670
<v Speaker 1>maybe part of it is that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you generate an intelligible doctrine</v>

137
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.083
<v Speaker 1>of radical relativism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there is no reason to assume that </v>

138
00:06:22.781 --> 00:06:23.614
<v Speaker 1>there are distinctions between </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories of knowledge or between </v>

139
00:06:25.601 --> 00:06:27.340
<v Speaker 1>different levels of quality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

140
00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:28.174
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've seen the same thing in the </v>

141
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.430
<v Speaker 1>psychology departments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although we have the,</v>

142
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

143
00:06:34.871 --> 00:06:35.704
<v Speaker 1>The luxury of being bounded at least to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree by the empirical method and </v>

144
00:06:38.681 --> 00:06:39.640
<v Speaker 1>by biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

145
00:06:39.641 --> 00:06:43.270
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that keeps most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the branches of psychology relatively</v>

146
00:06:43.271 --> 00:06:44.440
<v Speaker 1>sane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

147
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.620
<v Speaker 1>because the real world is actually built</v>
<v Speaker 1>into it to some degree.</v>

148
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.360
<v Speaker 1>But if you accept the postmodernist </v>
<v Speaker 1>claim of radical relativism,</v>

149
00:06:52.361 --> 00:06:53.194
<v Speaker 1>then you completely demolished the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are quality levels that are </v>

150
00:06:55.931 --> 00:06:58.900
<v Speaker 1>associated with education because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything becomes the same.</v>

151
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.800
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to me to be a perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable justification for maintaining</v>

152
00:07:02.801 --> 00:07:03.634
<v Speaker 1>ignorance.</v>

153
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:04.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Food Co.</v>

154
00:07:04.631 --> 00:07:07.240
<v Speaker 1>I actually found him the most readable </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the lecan.</v>

155
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.780
<v Speaker 1>There are de fuko trIad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can read fuko.</v>

156
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.853
<v Speaker 1>I read madison civilization and a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his other books and I thought they </v>

157
00:07:15.311 --> 00:07:16.144
<v Speaker 1>were painfully obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the idea that mental disorder </v>

158
00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:19.954
<v Speaker 1>is in part a social construct is self </v>
<v Speaker 1>evident to anybody who has even a </v>

159
00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:23.734
<v Speaker 1>smattering of psychiatric training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the real narrow medical types </v>

160
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:28.264
<v Speaker 1>tend to to think of a mental disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say as something that might be </v>

161
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.260
<v Speaker 1>purely biological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a peer disease model,</v>

162
00:07:35.261 --> 00:07:36.094
<v Speaker 1>but nobody's who's a sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinker ever thinks that it's a bit </v>

163
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.890
<v Speaker 1>partly because medicine is a brand of </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering,</v>

164
00:07:41.891 --> 00:07:42.724
<v Speaker 1>not a brand of science because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with health and the </v>

165
00:07:45.251 --> 00:07:46.084
<v Speaker 1>diagnostic categories are hybrids </v>
<v Speaker 1>between physiological observation and </v>

166
00:07:49.271 --> 00:07:50.104
<v Speaker 1>sociocultural condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows that and so when I read </v>

167
00:07:52.961 --> 00:07:54.730
<v Speaker 1>madness and civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

168
00:07:54.731 --> 00:07:57.790
<v Speaker 1>well that's not radical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just bloody self evident.</v>

169
00:07:58.570 --> 00:07:59.403
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that he began know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire turn toward a total theological </v>

170
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:07.800
<v Speaker 2>grounding of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of modern psychology,</v>

171
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.670
<v Speaker 2>social psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and was was well,</v>

172
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.800
<v Speaker 2>well launcher the 19 twenties for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

173
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:12.723
<v Speaker 2>know the levels of ignorance of these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people moving with all original </v>

174
00:08:16.231 --> 00:08:17.064
<v Speaker 2>have not read durkheim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've not read mocks of or are they </v>

175
00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:20.550
<v Speaker 2>not read erving goffman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

176
00:08:20.551 --> 00:08:21.384
<v Speaker 2>so in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me for everything is the costing of </v>

177
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:24.913
<v Speaker 2>the estimate because I had read the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sources from which he was borrowing </v>

178
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.980
<v Speaker 2>without attribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

179
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.690
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know these people,</v>

180
00:08:30.691 --> 00:08:32.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've met him in some cases,</v>

181
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.290
<v Speaker 2>knew them in graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who went onto become these,</v>

182
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.340
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these admirers of fico,</v>

183
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.560
<v Speaker 2>lack on dairy dot and I know what their </v>
<v Speaker 2>training was there.</v>

184
00:08:40.561 --> 00:08:42.720
<v Speaker 2>Training was pureLy within the english </v>
<v Speaker 2>department.</v>

185
00:08:42.721 --> 00:08:43.554
<v Speaker 2>That's all they ever knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never made it any research outside </v>

186
00:08:45.301 --> 00:08:46.180
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

187
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.340
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea for coal is simply this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a mechanism,</v>

188
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.383
<v Speaker 2>it's like a little tiny kit by which </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can approach everything in culture </v>

189
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 2>and then with the contortions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>language that deliberate labyrinthine,</v>

190
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 2>elitist language at the same time as </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretending to be a leftist.</v>

191
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the biggest frauds.</v>

192
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:05.400
<v Speaker 2>every practice.</v>
