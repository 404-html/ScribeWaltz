00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.013
<v Speaker 1>The realization that pleasure could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>usefully for stole dawn with a </v>

2
00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:04.224
<v Speaker 1>difficulty that's almost impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overstate a realization runs absolutely </v>

3
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:11.274
<v Speaker 1>contrary to our ancient fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal instincts which demand immediate </v>

4
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:15.744
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly under conditions of </v>

5
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:18.594
<v Speaker 1>deprivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are both inevitable and </v>

6
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:22.290
<v Speaker 1>commonplace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to complicate the matter,</v>

7
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.513
<v Speaker 1>such delay only becomes useful when </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization has stabilized itself </v>

8
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:30.120
<v Speaker 1>enough to guarantee the existence of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>delayed reward.</v>

9
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>If everything you save will be destroyed</v>
<v Speaker 1>or worse,</v>

10
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:34.760
<v Speaker 1>stolen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no point saving.</v>

11
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.733
<v Speaker 1>It's for this reason that a wolf will </v>
<v Speaker 1>down 20 pounds of raw meat in a single </v>

12
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:41.280
<v Speaker 1>meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He isn't thinking,</v>

13
00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate it when I binge.</v>

14
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.900
<v Speaker 1>I should save some of this for next </v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

15
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Here's a developmental progression from </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal to human.</v>

16
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt in the details,</v>

17
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's sufficiently correct for our </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes in theme.</v>

18
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's excess food.</v>

19
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.093
<v Speaker 1>Large carcasses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mammoths are other massive herbivores </v>

20
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:02.600
<v Speaker 1>might provide that way.</v>

21
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>A lot of mammoth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe all of them with a large animal.</v>

22
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>There's some left for later after a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill.</v>

23
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.393
<v Speaker 1>That's accidental at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eventually the utility of for later </v>

24
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.573
<v Speaker 1>starts to be appreciated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some provisional notion of sacrifice </v>

25
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 1>develops at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I leave some now,</v>

26
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 1>even if I want it now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't have to be hungry later.</v>

27
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.980
<v Speaker 1>That provisional notion then develops to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next level.</v>

28
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.023
<v Speaker 1>If I leave some for later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't have to go hungry and neither </v>

29
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:39.030
<v Speaker 1>will those I care for and then to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next level.</v>

30
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.553
<v Speaker 1>I can't possibly eat all this mammoth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't store the rest for too long </v>

31
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:44.574
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I should feed some to other </v>

32
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:47.214
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they'll remember and feed me some </v>

33
00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>of their mammoth when they have some and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have none.</v>

34
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Then I'll get some mammoth now and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>mammoth later.</v>

35
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.473
<v Speaker 1>That's a good deal and maybe those I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharing with will come to trust me more </v>

36
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:02.364
<v Speaker 1>generally.</v>

37
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Maybe then we could trade forever in </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a manner.</v>

38
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Mammoth becomes future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mammoth and future.</v>

39
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:11.574
<v Speaker 1>Mammoth becomes personal reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the emergence of the social </v>

40
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:20.721
<v Speaker 1>contract to share does not mean to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>away something you value and get nothing</v>

41
00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:23.250
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's only instead what?</v>

42
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:24.084
<v Speaker 1>Every child who refuses to share his </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid that it means to share means </v>

43
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>properly to initiate the process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade.</v>

44
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.150
<v Speaker 1>A child who can't share,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can't trade,</v>

45
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.450
<v Speaker 1>can't have any friends because having </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends is a form of trade.</v>

46
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.643
<v Speaker 1>Benjamin Franklin once suggested that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>newcomer to a neighborhood ask a new </v>

47
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Speaker 1>neighbor to do him or her a favor citing</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old maxim.</v>

48
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 1>He that has once done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have kindness,</v>

49
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.313
<v Speaker 1>will be more ready to do you another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he whom you yourself have obliged </v>

50
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.480
<v Speaker 1>in Franklin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so opinion.</v>

51
00:02:57.481 --> 00:02:58.314
<v Speaker 1>Asking something for someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking someone for something not too </v>

52
00:03:01.651 --> 00:03:02.484
<v Speaker 1>extreme.</v>
