<v Speaker 1>How do you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that people make this association</v>

2
00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:05.770
<v Speaker 1>with you because I've seen it when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have guests come on,</v>

3
00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:06.604
<v Speaker 1>we have a thread on our reddit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people post their questions and I've </v>

4
00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:10.114
<v Speaker 1>seen it before people associate you with</v>
<v Speaker 1>pandering to like white supremacists or </v>

5
00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:16.444
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've even seen the suggestion that you </v>

6
00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:21.010
<v Speaker 1>are a white supremace per supremacist </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

7
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.070
<v Speaker 1>So how do you feel about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

8
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.320
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be like a somewhat widely </v>
<v Speaker 1>held.</v>

9
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to think about that.</v>

10
00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:30.580
<v Speaker 2>It's completely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for example,</v>

11
00:00:30.581 --> 00:00:31.414
<v Speaker 2>I'm the member of A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an honorary member of a native </v>

12
00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:35.920
<v Speaker 2>American tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got inducted last year.</v>

13
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.650
<v Speaker 2>I have an Indian name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a native American name,</v>

14
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.710
<v Speaker 2>like it's completely preposterous and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been buying carvings from this like</v>

15
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.563
<v Speaker 2>isolated tribe in northern Vancouver for</v>
<v Speaker 2>northern northern Vancouver Island for </v>

16
00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:48.190
<v Speaker 2>15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

17
00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 2>And so and I've had lot might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>

18
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.610
<v Speaker 2>it's preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

19
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.600
<v Speaker 2>and I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

20
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.613
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's evidence that it's preposterous </v>

21
00:00:56.021 --> 00:01:01.021
<v Speaker 2>and the evidence is that I have 260 </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos on youtube and they must total at</v>

22
00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:04.300
<v Speaker 2>least 600 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

23
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.493
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by now people have been over them </v>

24
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.673
<v Speaker 2>essentially with a fine tooth comb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Virtually everything I've said in my </v>

25
00:01:11.411 --> 00:01:15.070
<v Speaker 2>classes to my students in the last 25 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years is on video.</v>

26
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.413
<v Speaker 2>And so if there was anything in there </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was even remotely associated with </v>

27
00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:21.450
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would come out and,</v>

28
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.353
<v Speaker 2>but it's even worse than that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually the opposite because the </v>

29
00:01:25.991 --> 00:01:26.824
<v Speaker 2>reason I've been teaching students for </v>
<v Speaker 2>since 1993 about the Holocaust and what </v>

30
00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 2>happened in the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

31
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.150
<v Speaker 2>and I've been trying to make them </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand how that's associated with,</v>

32
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.523
<v Speaker 2>with the unwillingness to accept </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal responsibility and educating </v>

33
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:47.830
<v Speaker 2>them as deeply as I can about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrors of,</v>

34
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.230
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of exactly that sort of thing.</v>

35
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.090
<v Speaker 2>I could say obsessed me ever since I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

36
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.010
<v Speaker 2>while ever since I was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very young.</v>

37
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.070
<v Speaker 2>And so not only is it not true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

38
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.850
<v Speaker 2>it's anti true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's seriously untrue.</v>

39
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.903
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
