00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.170
<v Speaker 1>What's my advice to young men seeking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman for marriage and family?</v>

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>You can't eliminate the necessity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being attracted to one another.</v>

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>That's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's mysterious,</v>

4
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:12.720
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a funny thing.</v>

6
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.983
<v Speaker 1>One of the things we know that attracts </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to one another is bilateral </v>

7
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:19.014
<v Speaker 1>symmetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you take men and you ranked </v>

8
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:23.274
<v Speaker 1>them by the symmetry of their faces and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you give the asymmetrical men tee </v>

9
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:30.114
<v Speaker 1>shirts to wear clean tee shirts for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and the symmetrical men clean t </v>

10
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:34.344
<v Speaker 1>shirts to wear for a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you give the t shirts to women </v>

11
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>and you have them rate the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the older,</v>

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.283
<v Speaker 1>the women rate the odor of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>symmetrical men as more attractive than </v>

13
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:44.814
<v Speaker 1>the odor of the asymmetrical men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were other factors that </v>

14
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>determined sexual attractiveness that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are based on biological factors that are</v>

15
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.690
<v Speaker 1>so that deeply embedded in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>smell,</v>

16
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

17
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.480
<v Speaker 1>So a women also tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>not be sexually attracted to the old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the scent of men whose,</v>

19
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>who have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

20
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:11.211
<v Speaker 1>it's rh factors that would make for </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential trouble in childbirth.</v>

21
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.253
<v Speaker 1>And the often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that the women give for not </v>

22
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:16.914
<v Speaker 1>preferring the scent of those men is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they smell too much like their </v>

23
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

24
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>So there was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mysterious things that determine whether</v>

25
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:26.640
<v Speaker 1>or not people are sexually and </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically attracted to each other.</v>

26
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:30.360
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's very important that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of a marital relationship.</v>

27
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.720
<v Speaker 1>The next most important thing is trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

28
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.613
<v Speaker 1>It's like there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no marriage that's successful </v>

29
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>without trust you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to tell each other the truth.</v>

30
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.113
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons that you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that marriage as a and an oath </v>

31
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 1>and Carl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uhm,</v>

32
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>as a bond was necessary.</v>

33
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>It's really wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

34
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling the truth to someone is no </v>

35
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.920
<v Speaker 1>simple thing because there's a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about all of us that are terrible</v>

36
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>in weak and reprehensible and shameful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of those things.</v>

37
00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>And they kind of have to be brought out </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the open and dealt with.</v>

38
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.223
<v Speaker 1>And you're not going to tell the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>about yourself to someone who can run </v>

39
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 1>away screaming when you reveal who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

40
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the marriage bond is something like,</v>

41
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.430
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the deal,</v>

42
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.703
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to handcuff myself to you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to handcuff yourself to me </v>

43
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.610
<v Speaker 1>and then we're going to tell each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth and neither of us are going to</v>

44
00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>get to run away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so our,</v>

45
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>once we know the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're either going to live together</v>

46
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:29.094
<v Speaker 1>in mutual torment or we're going to try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with that truth and straighten </v>

47
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 1>ourselves out and straighten ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>out jointly.</v>

48
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.213
<v Speaker 1>And that's going to make us more </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful and more resilient and deeper </v>

49
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:41.820
<v Speaker 1>and wiser as we progress together </v>
<v Speaker 1>through life.</v>

50
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.063
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's absolutely brilliant </v>

51
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:46.110
<v Speaker 1>because if you leave the backdoor open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

52
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>you're going to use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

53
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.593
<v Speaker 1>And the oath is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was young's commentary on the </v>

54
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.083
<v Speaker 1>spiritualization of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the human pair of bond and by </v>

55
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Christian marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

56
00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:58.720
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which emphasized,</v>

57
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subordination of both members of the</v>

58
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:03.304
<v Speaker 1>marital union to a higher order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a personality that was embodied in the </v>

59
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:09.964
<v Speaker 1>figure of the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that in an in an in the </v>

60
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Christian marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

61
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>the man isn't the boss and the woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the boss.</v>

62
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.410
<v Speaker 1>The boss is the mutual personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>composed by the seeking of truth in both</v>

63
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:26.250
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's conceptualized as their,</v>

64
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>their joint subjugation to the logos.</v>

65
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.450
<v Speaker 1>And that is absolutely dead on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the ruler of your marital life</v>

66
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:34.624
<v Speaker 1>should be your vow to tell each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth because like in hard times </v>

67
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:39.964
<v Speaker 1>during your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you've done something stupid and </v>

68
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:42.214
<v Speaker 1>idiotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might take you down and you don't </v>

69
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:45.860
<v Speaker 1>have anybody that you can turn to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

70
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>if you have a partner that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>trust,</v>

71
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 1>you can go say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

72
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:49.504
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a big financial mistake man and </v>

73
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:52.024
<v Speaker 1>it's really torturing me and I feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a complete idiot and it's really </v>

74
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:55.144
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the person there is going to help </v>

75
00:03:56.951 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 1>you figure out what to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're going to know that when they</v>

76
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 1>make a stupid mistake and they're bloody</v>
<v Speaker 1>well going to,</v>

77
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 1>that they can come and talk to you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you guys are going to work your way</v>

78
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>

79
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.963
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a couple of things our </v>

80
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 1>culture gets really wrong and one is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>devalues marriage.</v>

81
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 1>That's really a very bad idea because </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriages,</v>

82
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.013
<v Speaker 1>marriages like a third of your life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe more and kids are a third of your </v>

83
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:22.610
<v Speaker 1>life and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

84
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.350
<v Speaker 1>your life outside of marriage and kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a third of your life,</v>

85
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.633
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>approximately speaking and to miss any </v>

86
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 1>of that is a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive mistake.</v>

87
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>

88
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.603
<v Speaker 1>I will also say that for some people </v>
<v Speaker 1>missing one or more of those is </v>

89
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 1>necessary because they have a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

90
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:44.164
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're brilliantly creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists and they need to devote </v>

91
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 1>themselves entirely to their career or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're outstanding in some way.</v>

92
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:50.524
<v Speaker 1>And so they need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can justify the sacrifice of one </v>

93
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:55.780
<v Speaker 1>part of that triad of being to another </v>
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>

94
00:04:55.781 --> 00:04:58.790
<v Speaker 1>But for a generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very dangerous thing.</v>

95
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:59.623
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

96
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't be done.</v>

97
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 1>And also kids get an absolutely terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>rap,</v>

98
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because kids are delightful if they're </v>

99
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:08.014
<v Speaker 1>well behaved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the chapters in my new book is </v>

100
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:12.970
<v Speaker 1>called don't let your children do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that makes you dislike them.</v>

101
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.013
<v Speaker 1>And you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you discuss it thoroughly </v>

102
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:17.164
<v Speaker 1>with your spouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the person that's helping you </v>

103
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:19.774
<v Speaker 1>discipline the kids and children are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best company because they're really </v>

104
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:26.320
<v Speaker 1>enthusiastic about everything they love </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing new things.</v>

105
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.140
<v Speaker 1>They really love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're happy that you're around.</v>

106
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.543
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is make sure they're </v>

107
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:35.110
<v Speaker 1>not too hot and they're not too cold and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've had something to eat and they're</v>

108
00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:35.944
<v Speaker 1>not too tired and you don't expect them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stay engaged in something for longer </v>

109
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:41.764
<v Speaker 1>than they can manage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we used to take our kids when </v>

110
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>they were little out to restaurants for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

111
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.843
<v Speaker 1>And they could sit there no problem and </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave really nicely when they were two </v>

112
00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:48.874
<v Speaker 1>and three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they couldn't do it for more than </v>

113
00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:52.660
<v Speaker 1>about 45 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't push your luck.</v>

114
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.853
<v Speaker 1>But I also noticed with little kids is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they got antsy and unreasonable </v>

115
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 1>about five to 10 minutes before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>adults did too.</v>

116
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 1>It's just the adults were too stupid to </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice.</v>

117
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 1>The kids would notice right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So back to marriage,</v>

118
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 1>when you look for someone that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to,</v>

119
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.693
<v Speaker 1>that you love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you look for someone that you </v>

120
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:09.674
<v Speaker 1>can bloody well trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you tell them the truth and </v>

121
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.993
<v Speaker 1>that way maybe you can get through life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can have someone to weave the </v>

122
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:18.314
<v Speaker 1>rope of your being with and together to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make to make your joint ropes stronger </v>

123
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:23.564
<v Speaker 1>and you can have some continuity in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative and you can have children and </v>

124
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:26.984
<v Speaker 1>then you can have grandchildren and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have a life man and there's </v>

125
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:30.884
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

126
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 1>You're so fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can manage that and also,</v>

127
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:35.084
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marry someone you think would be a good </v>

128
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:38.990
<v Speaker 1>mother and that has enough sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>

129
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:40.850
<v Speaker 1>to know that she wants children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

130
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:41.743
<v Speaker 1>some women don't want children and fair </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough and some women perhaps shouldn't </v>

131
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:48.200
<v Speaker 1>have children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also possible.</v>

132
00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:52.660
<v Speaker 1>But the general rule of thumb is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially once a woman's,</v>

133
00:06:52.661 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in her mid twenties,</v>

134
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 1>if she doesn't know that she wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>children or won't admit it,</v>

135
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 1>unless she has a viciously important </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

136
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.800
<v Speaker 1>then she's not oriented properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychologically she,</v>

137
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she isn't.</v>

138
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.100
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't know what's important in </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

139
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might also be the case with you,</v>

140
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:14.450
<v Speaker 1>and it probably is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as a rule of thumb,</v>

141
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good one.</v>
