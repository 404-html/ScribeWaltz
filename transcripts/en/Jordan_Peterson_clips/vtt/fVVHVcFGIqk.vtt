1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.953
<v Speaker 1>What do we do with once our ego is </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped us climb in the dominance </v>

2
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:04.314
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy is secure a bait?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why then should we keep looking for a </v>

3
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:10.080
<v Speaker 1>mate and how to curtail that instinct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the way that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>curtailed headings,</v>

5
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.123
<v Speaker 1>instinct is that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this sort of life that you </v>

6
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:17.700
<v Speaker 1>would have with a mate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

7
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.553
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the purpose of pair bonding and </v>

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 1>one of the fundamental purposes of pair </v>
<v Speaker 1>bonding.</v>

9
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:24.084
<v Speaker 1>Well there's a couple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that it solves the sexual access </v>

10
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:27.174
<v Speaker 1>problems so that you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to obsess about who you're </v>

11
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>going to be with him and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

12
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and where,</v>

13
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:35.394
<v Speaker 1>and how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can get on with other </v>

14
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 1>elements of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean with,</v>

15
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>with your mate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to decide,</v>

16
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:41.364
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean that you're not </v>

17
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.743
<v Speaker 1>together?</v>

18
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your companionship.</v>

19
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Obviously in friendship and their shared</v>
<v Speaker 1>interests,</v>

20
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>you have to decide what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that you should continue</v>

21
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:51.684
<v Speaker 1>dating your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your partner at least once a week or </v>

22
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>perhaps twice a week because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>the romance goes out of your life.</v>

23
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.703
<v Speaker 1>But then also you have to decide about </v>
<v Speaker 1>children and eventually about trench </v>

24
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:03.344
<v Speaker 1>Hildrun because you know you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get old and you're going to get older </v>

25
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>and more mature and children are a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of life and they get a bad rap,</v>

26
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>which is really unfortunate because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm different in this regard.</v>

28
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.493
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps I am to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never regretted having kids for </v>

29
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:19.914
<v Speaker 1>even one second because they're so mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you have an intimate </v>

30
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:24.864
<v Speaker 1>relationship with new people that is as </v>
<v Speaker 1>close as any relationship that you've </v>

31
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.004
<v Speaker 1>ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the opportunity to make that </v>

32
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:34.050
<v Speaker 1>relationship as pristine as you possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>can mean.</v>

33
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 1>It can be a lot of catastrophe involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

34
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.343
<v Speaker 1>But it's a great opportunity and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just nothing wrong with having some </v>

35
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>additional people that love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

36
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.133
<v Speaker 1>And so what you do is you turn your </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to the issues of maturity in </v>

37
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.833
<v Speaker 1>your junior year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Attention away from the issues of being </v>

38
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:51.654
<v Speaker 1>a juvenile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do that partly by knowing that </v>

39
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>it's actually better to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

40
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:59.550
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing more observed at the 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>year old 20 year old.</v>

41
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.693
<v Speaker 1>It gets ugly and there's something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something like spoiled milk </v>

42
00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:05.174
<v Speaker 1>bone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes off and you have to gracefully </v>

43
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:09.264
<v Speaker 1>accept the challenges of each stage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and things work a lot better when </v>

44
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>you do that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much better.</v>

45
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:15.684
<v Speaker 1>And you also have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say we're calling it perfect </v>

46
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>your sex life with your partner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>express what you need and want and teach</v>

47
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 1>each other what's necessary to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>things exciting and,</v>

48
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.570
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and new.</v>

49
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.303
<v Speaker 1>It's not an easy thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very much worthwhile because </v>

50
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:32.724
<v Speaker 1>then you can combine sexual excitement </v>
<v Speaker 1>with intimacy and there's no better </v>

51
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>combination than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

52
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>and love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can all be nested,</v>

53
00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:42.310
<v Speaker 1>up inside love inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

54
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>a destiny that's intertwined together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the best you've got,</v>

55
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:46.920
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

56
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.110
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what life has to offer.</v>

57
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.370
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.703
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do is you accept the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of the next stage of </v>

59
00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't mourn the past.</v>

60
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that also means that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're young,</v>

61
00:03:00.361 --> 00:03:03.270
<v Speaker 1>you do what young people do and so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do it again.</v>

62
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.673
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
