1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.300
<v Speaker 1>You know there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.380
<v Speaker 1>there's good study published recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that six month old infants,</v>

3
00:00:05.381 --> 00:00:06.214
<v Speaker 1>I think it was six month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are already showing fear of snakes and </v>

4
00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:12.430
<v Speaker 1>spiders and that's before they've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed to them,</v>

5
00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:16.180
<v Speaker 1>so there's not an argument about amongst</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist for a long time,</v>

6
00:00:16.181 --> 00:00:17.014
<v Speaker 1>whether fears were only learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thought would be the behavioral </v>

7
00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:23.320
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're prepared to learn certain</v>

8
00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:24.154
<v Speaker 1>fears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of a mediator between the </v>

9
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.913
<v Speaker 1>behavioral perspective and a perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>that takes into account inherited </v>

10
00:00:30.581 --> 00:00:31.414
<v Speaker 1>structures or whether they're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>innate and the evidence keeps accruing </v>

11
00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:40.060
<v Speaker 1>that some of these fundamental fears are</v>
<v Speaker 1>innate and that's a very strange thing.</v>

12
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 2>More more hardware than firmware,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if exactly that.</v>

13
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well and metaphor and I mean the,</v>

14
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the archetypes,</v>

15
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 1>the symbolic representations we have say</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Reptilian predators.</v>

16
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Dragon in particular are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very deep.</v>

17
00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>That dragon is a symbol that you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere in the world.</v>

18
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>There was a good book written about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>

19
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy who wrote the book,</v>

20
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:04.044
<v Speaker 1>whose name I can't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately thought that a dragon was </v>

21
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:08.034
<v Speaker 1>a cat snake bird and so well on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because the major predators of of </v>

22
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>tree dwelling primates are predatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>cats,</v>

23
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>snakes and wrap doors,</v>

24
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Keyword.</v>

25
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.310
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

26
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.470
<v Speaker 2>the way I'm interpreting it is tree </v>
<v Speaker 2>dwelling.</v>

27
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Like that's how far back $6.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Million</v>

28
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>nears least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>So on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at least $60,</v>

30
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:31.670
<v Speaker 1>million years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could,</v>

31
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.550
<v Speaker 1>it could be longer than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but snakes and human beings,</v>

32
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.670
<v Speaker 1>snakes and the ancestors of human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>co evolved.</v>

33
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.973
<v Speaker 1>And Lynn is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bell has demonstrated that down and you </v>

34
00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:45.730
<v Speaker 1>know she's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a scientist and in with,</v>

35
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.743
<v Speaker 1>in the California state system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she's at Ucla and she was very </v>

36
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:53.420
<v Speaker 1>interested in white human beings have </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a cute vision.</v>

37
00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:54.254
<v Speaker 1>And so she did a study looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between primate acuity of </v>

38
00:01:58.821 --> 00:01:59.654
<v Speaker 1>primate vision and presence of predatory</v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes and found a pretty powerful </v>

39
00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:03.770
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

40
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.510
<v Speaker 1>And we can really detect snake like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>camouflage patterns,</v>

41
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:10.850
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the lower half of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual field.</v>

42
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.440
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things are.</v>

43
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.300
<v Speaker 1>See the way it looks to me is that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop this Predator detection system,</v>

44
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:20.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's in the unknown Predator?</v>

45
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.850
<v Speaker 1>What's the Predator?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a cat snake bird,</v>

46
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.100
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

47
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:25.791
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

48
00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:26.830
<v Speaker 1>that's not a category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

49
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.673
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

50
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a low resolution category that </v>
<v Speaker 1>apply.</v>

51
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.890
<v Speaker 2>It's the same category as Predator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right ad from a cognitive,</v>

52
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.680
<v Speaker 2>anthropological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of,</v>

53
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way I tend to look towards things.</v>

54
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.670
<v Speaker 2>It's actually the most functional </v>
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>

55
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.980
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it all the relevant elements.</v>

56
00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:43.814
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's more differentiated than you </v>

57
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:45.414
<v Speaker 2>have to make the assumption that you all</v>
<v Speaker 2>will automatically know what's about to </v>

58
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:48.500
<v Speaker 2>attack you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you don't know,</v>

59
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Speaker 2>the unknown.</v>

60
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a cat snake burden.</v>

61
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:51.783
<v Speaker 1>It breathes fire and you know that could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a reference to the poisonous to a </v>

62
00:02:55.301 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>poisonous snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also could be the inclusion of in</v>

63
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:00.274
<v Speaker 1>the dangers because of course fire was </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly a danger on the velt at </v>

64
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>certain danger in the forests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so fire breathing,</v>

65
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>cat snake bird covers a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>

66
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's even better than that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

67
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's in the unknown?</v>

68
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>So you project the contents of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination into the unknown to fill it.</v>

69
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is is that we're not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>prey animals,</v>

70
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>we're also predatory and exploratory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the Dragon,</v>

71
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>the cat snake bird that breathes fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't only a Predator,</v>

72
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>it's also the thing that guards virgins </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing that guards gold.</v>

73
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's also fascinating because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that the,</v>

74
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 1>the are the ancestral males who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at,</v>

75
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.030
<v Speaker 1>at keeping the cat snake bird at bay.</v>

76
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>We're much more likely to propagate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

77
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.363
<v Speaker 1>that's just seemed self evident I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you tell people that everyone </v>

78
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:51.430
<v Speaker 1>thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well obviously,</v>

79
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the gladiatorial type or </v>

80
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 1>maybe the person who went out and found </v>
<v Speaker 1>out where the nests of these things were</v>

81
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got rid of the nests.</v>

82
00:03:58.811 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then.</v>

83
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.863
<v Speaker 1>And so we also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this bifurcated image of the </v>

84
00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Predator which is the Predator slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown,</v>

85
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>which is also the place of new useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

86
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>And so when it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

87
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.580
<v Speaker 1>It's very articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like in the Mesopotamian story,</v>

88
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:26.581
<v Speaker 1>one of the names for Margo who goes out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and confronts Tiamat,</v>

89
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.723
<v Speaker 1>who's basically a cat snake bird is he </v>
<v Speaker 1>who makes ingenious things out of the </v>

90
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>body of Tire Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

91
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.463
<v Speaker 1>how can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get any more direct </v>

92
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.240
<v Speaker 1>illustration of the idea than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he has battled with ty Matt,</v>

93
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.810
<v Speaker 1>who's come back with all the monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are including the king of evil out</v>

94
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:51.310
<v Speaker 1>there at their forefront to destroy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>society of the Gods.</v>

95
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>He cuts her into pieces and makes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

96
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.340
<v Speaker 1>And so it's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

97
00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.530
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

98
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.020
<v Speaker 1>the savior of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

99
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:02.854
<v Speaker 1>is he who confronts the chaotic unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiates it and makes the </v>

100
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:10.450
<v Speaker 1>habitable world.</v>
