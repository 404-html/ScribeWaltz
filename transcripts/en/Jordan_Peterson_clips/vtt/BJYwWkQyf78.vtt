1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.993
<v Speaker 1>What it means to be a conservative in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nineties and especially 2000 has </v>

2
00:00:03.791 --> 00:00:07.480
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is true that you know that,</v>

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.540
<v Speaker 1>that the conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not in any way anti-science,</v>

4
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until much more recent times.</v>

5
00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Now actually both sides are anti science</v>
<v Speaker 1>about different sciences,</v>

6
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.780
<v Speaker 1>but I'm in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right wing,</v>

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.760
<v Speaker 1>the Republican Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ha,</v>

8
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.283
<v Speaker 1>it's controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do believe that the polarization </v>

9
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.770
<v Speaker 1>starts with the right moving further </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

10
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>So what it means to be conservative to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the anti anti evolutionary,</v>

11
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>which is actually what's happening on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left now to exactly.</v>

12
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.313
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This modern Bret Weinstein the other </v>

13
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.410
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

14
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

15
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.823
<v Speaker 1>one of his claims is that evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>biology has something in it to offend </v>

16
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

17
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:46.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a science that's very likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>targeted by extremists.</v>

18
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.603
<v Speaker 1>You also brought up something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually touches on the eye on the </v>

19
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.773
<v Speaker 1>difficult problem of how it is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might define someone who is </v>

20
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:56.910
<v Speaker 1>ideologically possessed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

21
00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 1>or ideologically rigid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the idea was that you can make a</v>

22
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:02.304
<v Speaker 1>valid case for the utility of free </v>
<v Speaker 1>information flow and the free flow of </v>

23
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:07.284
<v Speaker 1>people that would go along with that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could make a good case for the </v>

24
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 1>danger of that.</v>

25
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.543
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea might be that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>only making a case for the danger of </v>

26
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're tilted too far to the right.</v>

27
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>And if you're only making a case for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>utility of that,</v>

28
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:21.160
<v Speaker 1>then you're tilted too far to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

29
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.143
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we can look at immigration as a </v>

30
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:24.514
<v Speaker 1>nice example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a recent essay in the </v>

31
00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was by Peter Beinart,</v>

32
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.200
<v Speaker 1>where he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.840
<v Speaker 1>he reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

34
00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:32.674
<v Speaker 1>it starts with a lot of quotes that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty nuanced positions about </v>

35
00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:37.630
<v Speaker 1>immigration from Barack Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Krugman,</v>

36
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.330
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of other people on the left who </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be able to say,</v>

37
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.710
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:41.711 --> 00:01:43.210
<v Speaker 1>compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic,</v>

39
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.770
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:49.090
<v Speaker 1>we have to have a legal process and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a threat to low wage workers,</v>

41
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.013
<v Speaker 1>so people on the left used to bill to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about immigration and talk about </v>

42
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.670
<v Speaker 1>the pros and cons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pluses and minuses,</v>

43
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.090
<v Speaker 1>but beinart shows how in the last four </v>
<v Speaker 1>or five years you can't,</v>

44
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.800
<v Speaker 1>if you so much as suggest that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe immigration is Annette.</v>

45
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.633
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might have some deleterious </v>

46
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:08.560
<v Speaker 1>effects on certain classes of low wage </v>
<v Speaker 1>American workers.</v>

47
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.810
<v Speaker 1>You could get in big trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:11.644
<v Speaker 1>Because that's instantly prejudicial </v>
<v Speaker 1>because immigration has become a sacred </v>

49
00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:15.904
<v Speaker 1>topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the key thing that I want </v>

50
00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:20.950
<v Speaker 1>everyone to keep in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are fundamentally religious creatures</v>

51
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.053
<v Speaker 1>were built for religion and it's a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>achievement to create a scientific </v>

52
00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:26.104
<v Speaker 1>establishment and an academic </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment that keeps that way of </v>

53
00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:29.404
<v Speaker 1>thinking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientific thinking is not natural </v>

54
00:02:31.391 --> 00:02:32.224
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Religious thinking is natural thinking </v>

55
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.320
<v Speaker 1>and what's happening to us in the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>few years especially is a flooding in of</v>

56
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.183
<v Speaker 1>religious thinking and so let's get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of social scientists talk about </v>

57
00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:44.050
<v Speaker 1>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they going to do?</v>

58
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Look at the data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way up.</v>

59
00:02:45.611 --> 00:02:47.320
<v Speaker 1>The pluses and minuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

60
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.663
<v Speaker 1>they're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of them feel they're on a team and </v>

61
00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:53.110
<v Speaker 1>that team is fighting the right.</v>

62
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.570
<v Speaker 1>The right is anti-immigrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It includes racist elements,</v>

63
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.920
<v Speaker 1>therefore that justifies us in being pro</v>
<v Speaker 1>and social sciences are always.</v>

64
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>There's always ambiguity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always conflicting studies,</v>

65
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.213
<v Speaker 1>multiple causal factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that always in the social science </v>

66
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 1>study?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

67
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.323
<v Speaker 1>So beinart point was that the left used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to think straight about </v>

68
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly it had a,</v>

69
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was generally pro immigration,</v>

70
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 1>but it used to be able to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight,</v>

71
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>but in the last few years a religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>orthodox mindset has overtaken it.</v>

72
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.033
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we might as well also pointed out </v>

73
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>that it's a primordial religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>mindset,</v>

74
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.623
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I mean there are Christian or </v>

75
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean ancient tribal,</v>

76
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:34.620
<v Speaker 1>small scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of gods.</v>

77
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

78
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then one of the things that you might</v>

79
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>suggest is that when you throw out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated religious structure,</v>

80
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 1>unsophisticated religious structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in to fill the gap.</v>

81
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.540
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's true.</v>

82
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's definitely worth thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

83
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's right.</v>

84
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:54.860
<v Speaker 1>The thing to write with religions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to clarify fundamentalism is the</v>

85
00:03:54.861 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not religion.</v>

86
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 1>And so if you did a close tribalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

87
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 1>If you get a fundamentalist know I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy to say,</v>

88
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.993
<v Speaker 1>and if you have people applying to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Grad program in psychology and I find </v>

89
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 1>out that they're Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

90
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 1>There's no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they're fundamentalist Christian,</v>

91
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.603
<v Speaker 1>I would think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's say let's say it's not </v>

92
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:14.720
<v Speaker 1>psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suppose it's you know,</v>

93
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 1>geology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So someone applies to a geology program.</v>

94
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 1>There are fundamentalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

95
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:22.810
<v Speaker 1>earth creationist or you gonna admit </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

96
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should.</v>

97
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.640
<v Speaker 1>They're not able to do the right kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking based on what we know to be the</v>

98
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:30.874
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

99
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>They're not in the scientific paradigm </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the type that's right.</v>

100
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if we wouldn't admit a fundamentalist</v>

101
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.263
<v Speaker 1>Christian to a geology program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would we admit someone who is just </v>

102
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:41.884
<v Speaker 1>as fundamentalist about certain moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>and political issues into a sociology </v>

103
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:45.274
<v Speaker 1>program or into a psychology program if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they come in knowing what the right </v>

104
00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:50.920
<v Speaker 1>answer is committed to that right </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>

105
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.390
<v Speaker 1>likely to get angry at anyone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>contravenes that right answer.</v>

106
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

107
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 1>and showing signs of close mindedness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they belong to grab the.</v>

108
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:02.494
<v Speaker 1>I guess the question is how in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you set up mechanisms to ensure that </v>

109
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:09.610
<v Speaker 1>you're not swamped by fundamentalists of</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort?</v>

110
00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>So those are people who are reducing </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything to a single cause.</v>

111
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:13.384
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you implement a structure that </v>

112
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.073
<v Speaker 1>protects the organization against that </v>
<v Speaker 1>without the structure itself becoming </v>

113
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because these things,</v>

114
00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:24.650
<v Speaker 1>these things spin out of control so </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>

115
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 1>But so I think what we have to realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the academy is that we face,</v>

116
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.813
<v Speaker 1>I think we face an existential crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We rely on an enormous amount on public </v>

117
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.280
<v Speaker 1>goodwill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get enormous tax subsidies,</v>

118
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.353
<v Speaker 1>a direct research support and recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>polling shows that while Democrats have </v>

119
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:46.354
<v Speaker 1>always had a higher opinion of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities than Republicans until two </v>

120
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:49.324
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody thought universities are a </v>

121
00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:52.270
<v Speaker 1>good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make life better.</v>

122
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.030
<v Speaker 1>So Americans had been very supportive of</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher education.</v>

123
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.730
<v Speaker 1>There have been rising grapes on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

124
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.753
<v Speaker 1>but it's only between 2015 and 2017 that</v>
<v Speaker 1>now republicans go from saying mostly </v>

125
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>universities are good things in two </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

126
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 1>They go way down and say universities </v>
<v Speaker 1>are bad things.</v>

127
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 1>They're making things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

128
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:12.600
<v Speaker 1>how is this news greeted?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pundits on the left are saying,</v>

129
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those republicans are so anti science.</v>

130
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Look how ignorant they are.</v>

131
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 1>They now hate universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

132
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.973
<v Speaker 1>Anybody's been watching the news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who's seen the mobs to shout </v>

133
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 1>downs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the illiberal behavior,</v>

134
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the metaphor I use is like,</v>

135
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:29.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans on the right and left are </v>

136
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 1>really supportive of the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have.</v>

137
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the few institutions that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>still hold in high esteem on both sides.</v>

138
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 1>And so the Republicans more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats.</v>

139
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.610
<v Speaker 1>So suppose you had Gallup poll and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

140
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 1>showing Republicans liked the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than Democrats,</v>

141
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:44.024
<v Speaker 1>but both really like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then suddenly in 2015 we started seeing </v>

142
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.123
<v Speaker 1>video from all over military bases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the military academies in which the </v>

143
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.160
<v Speaker 1>military leaders are overtly right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are there.</v>

144
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.063
<v Speaker 1>They're saying terrible things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>leftists and progressives and the </v>

145
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:02.084
<v Speaker 1>midshipmen and the cadets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody is mobbing the occasional </v>

146
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:07.370
<v Speaker 1>liberal and to behaving in a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>despicable,</v>

147
00:07:07.371 --> 00:07:08.204
<v Speaker 1>scary and intimidating way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the left would now </v>

148
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:13.820
<v Speaker 1>think about the military?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously support for the military would</v>

149
00:07:13.821 --> 00:07:14.654
<v Speaker 1>plummet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's happening in America with </v>

150
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:17.234
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are losing the support of half the </v>

151
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:21.410
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is unsustainable,</v>

152
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 1>especially in red states where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>control the purse strings.</v>

153
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.750
<v Speaker 1>So I think we have a major crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we've got to go into crisis mode</v>

154
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Speaker 1>and we've got to clean up our act.</v>
