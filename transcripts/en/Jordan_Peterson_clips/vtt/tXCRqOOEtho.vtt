1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.953
<v Speaker 1>In Milton's Paradise Lost Satan as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual figure and you see that </v>

2
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:09.480
<v Speaker 1>motif emerge very frequently by the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>in popular culture.</v>

3
00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:11.460
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the lion king,</v>

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.683
<v Speaker 1>the figure of scar who's a titanic </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure is also hyper intellectual and </v>

5
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:17.934
<v Speaker 1>that's very common that the evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist Motif for the or the evil </v>

6
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:23.010
<v Speaker 1>advisor to the king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same motif.</v>

7
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.853
<v Speaker 1>It encapsulate something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality and what it seems to </v>

8
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:31.161
<v Speaker 1>encapsulate as the idea that rationality</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Satan is the highest angel in God's</v>

9
00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:34.710
<v Speaker 1>heavenly kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a psychological idea.</v>

10
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:35.544
<v Speaker 1>You know that the most powerful sub </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of the human psyche is the </v>

11
00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:40.314
<v Speaker 1>intellect and and it's the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shines out above all within the domain </v>

12
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>of humanity and maybe across the the </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain of life itself.</v>

13
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.723
<v Speaker 1>The human intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something absolutely remarkable </v>

14
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:52.884
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has a flaw and the floor is that </v>

15
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:55.314
<v Speaker 1>it tends to fall in love with its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>productions and to assume that their </v>

16
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.393
<v Speaker 1>total solzhenitsyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was writing the Gulag </v>

17
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:06.231
<v Speaker 1>archipelago had a warning about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to totalitarian ideology.</v>

18
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.903
<v Speaker 1>And he said that the price of selling </v>
<v Speaker 1>your God given sole to the entrapments </v>

19
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 1>of of human dogma was slavery and death </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

20
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.500
<v Speaker 1>And Satan in May in Milton's paradise </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost.</v>

21
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Satan decides that he can do without the</v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent,</v>

22
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 1>he can do without God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why foment rebellion.</v>

23
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.340
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the consequence of that,</v>

24
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.693
<v Speaker 1>the immediate consequence from Milton's </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective was that as soon as Satan </v>

25
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.423
<v Speaker 1>decided that what he knew was sufficient</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that he could do without the </v>

26
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:47.154
<v Speaker 1>transcendent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you might think about as the </v>

27
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:51.600
<v Speaker 1>domain outside of what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

28
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Immediately he was inhale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I read paradise lost,</v>

29
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I was studying totalitarianism and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

30
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poet,</v>

31
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.363
<v Speaker 1>the true poet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a prophet is someone who has </v>

32
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:07.014
<v Speaker 1>intimations of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's because the poetic </v>

33
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:13.200
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the philosophical or prophetic mind is a</v>

34
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:14.190
<v Speaker 1>pattern detector.</v>

35
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.830
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

36
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>and there are people who can detect the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying.</v>

37
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like the melody of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a nation.</v>

38
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.163
<v Speaker 1>Melody has in song the song of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation and can see how it's going to </v>

39
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>develop across the centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see this,</v>

40
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>you see that nature because nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

41
00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>in the mid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around 18,</v>

42
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:31.224
<v Speaker 1>60 or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he prophesied what was going to </v>

43
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:33.714
<v Speaker 1>happen in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that he said specifically that </v>

44
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.950
<v Speaker 1>the specter of communism would kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of people in the 20th century.</v>

45
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.023
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing prophecy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that in the notes that became </v>

46
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>willpower and Dostoevsky was of the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of mind.</v>

47
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Someone who was in touch enough with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental patterns of,</v>

48
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

49
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.803
<v Speaker 1>of human movement that they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>extrapolate out into the future and see </v>

50
00:02:57.871 --> 00:02:59.880
<v Speaker 1>what was coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

51
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.010
<v Speaker 1>some people are very good at detecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns,</v>

52
00:03:02.011 --> 00:03:02.844
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

53
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.043
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Milton I think was of that.</v>
