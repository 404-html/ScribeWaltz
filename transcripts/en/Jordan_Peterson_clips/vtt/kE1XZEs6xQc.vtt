00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.900
<v Speaker 1>There's some lovely representations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Paradise.</v>

2
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.540
<v Speaker 1>This is a garden of earthly delights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's his name?</v>

3
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Say That Bosh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Hieronymus Bosch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a crazy.</v>

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.353
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he didn't get burnt at the stake is </v>

6
00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:21.460
<v Speaker 1>absolutely beyond me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you know about Salvador Dali,</v>

8
00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:24.784
<v Speaker 1>I suppose most of you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean delis a piker compared to </v>

9
00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Hieronymus Bosch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

10
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>you could spend because there's three </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces of this particular painting.</v>

11
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>You could spend a very bizarre and </v>
<v Speaker 1>surreal month looking at that painting.</v>

12
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.833
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was with Bosch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was some sort of creature that </v>

13
00:00:43.391 --> 00:00:46.570
<v Speaker 1>only popped up once and probably for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>

14
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.603
<v Speaker 1>And so there's been very many </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of Paradise Mean God </v>

15
00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:57.601
<v Speaker 1>only knows what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I could probably guess,</v>

16
00:00:57.701 --> 00:01:00.340
<v Speaker 1>but I won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then look,</v>

17
00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

18
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.460
<v Speaker 1>that's the lion lying down with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lamb.</v>

19
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.293
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's this idea that's maybe </v>

20
00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:09.100
<v Speaker 1>projected back in time that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>time or maybe will be a time when,</v>

21
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.353
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the horrors of life are no longer </v>

22
00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:15.490
<v Speaker 1>necessary for life itself to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

23
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.613
<v Speaker 1>And the horrors of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or of course that everything eats </v>

24
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.330
<v Speaker 1>everything else and that everything dies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that everything is born in the whole</v>

25
00:01:22.331 --> 00:01:23.164
<v Speaker 1>bloody places at charnel house and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a catastrophe from beginning to </v>

26
00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:27.310
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

27
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.340
<v Speaker 1>this is the vision of it being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other than that.</v>

28
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.070
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a strong idea.</v>

29
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.933
<v Speaker 1>This was also in implicit in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alchemical ideas and I think it's also </v>

30
00:01:36.731 --> 00:01:37.564
<v Speaker 1>implicit in the scientific revolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>that human beings can interact with </v>

31
00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:43.744
<v Speaker 1>reality in such a way so that the tragic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and evil elements of it can be </v>

32
00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:47.464
<v Speaker 1>mitigated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that we can move somewhat closer </v>

33
00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:51.940
<v Speaker 1>to a state that might be characterized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

34
00:01:51.941 --> 00:01:52.774
<v Speaker 1>that's obviously imagistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might be characterized by </v>

35
00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:58.240
<v Speaker 1>something like that where we have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits of actual existence without all</v>

36
00:01:58.241 --> 00:02:00.490
<v Speaker 1>of the catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to go along with it.</v>
