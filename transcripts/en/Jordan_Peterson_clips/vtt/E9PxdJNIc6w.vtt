1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Thing about free speech is that like I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a free speech advocate.</v>

2
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:04.764
<v Speaker 1>Let's say I'm a true speech advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that I believe that </v>

3
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:11.640
<v Speaker 1>people should say what they believe to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be true.</v>

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your obligation.</v>

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>It's also you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it comes with an obligation,</v>

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.803
<v Speaker 1>but I don't believe that true speech as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible without free speech because </v>

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.913
<v Speaker 1>you're just not very good at thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you have to stumble around when </v>

8
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:27.084
<v Speaker 1>you were first formulating ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wander into territory that's not </v>

9
00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:30.654
<v Speaker 1>necessarily productive and manifest your</v>
<v Speaker 1>biases and in short you have to be a </v>

10
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:34.614
<v Speaker 1>fool and the only way that you you </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve upon that performances by well </v>

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.533
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stumbling through it to begin with and </v>

12
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:41.634
<v Speaker 1>then second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by observing carefully what sort of </v>

13
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 1>reactions you're getting and having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue around it so that you can start</v>

14
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:48.264
<v Speaker 1>to sharpen up your ideas and improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>their focus and find out where you've </v>

15
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>made a mistake and all of those things.</v>

16
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.903
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of what's necessary with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to thinking is the freedom to </v>

17
00:00:57.361 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>make mistakes because what are you going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it right the first time?</v>

18
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

19
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>that's why for Carl Young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

20
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 1>the fool was a mythological precursor to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

21
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.743
<v Speaker 1>to the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tricksters and mythological </v>

22
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>precursor to the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because unless you're willing to stumble</v>

23
00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:15.380
<v Speaker 1>around badly to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 1>and to be a fool when you first start </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something which is always the case</v>

25
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:19.674
<v Speaker 1>when you're learning something new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're not going to make any </v>

26
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so practically speaking,</v>

27
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>free speech has to be as untrammeled as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible so that people can be wrong and</v>

28
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:29.244
<v Speaker 1>they can be biased and they can still </v>
<v Speaker 1>express their opinions including their </v>

29
00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:32.514
<v Speaker 1>darker ones and then allow themselves to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be subject partly to improvement by the </v>

30
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

31
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Because if you say things that are too </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid and then act the mouth,</v>

32
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:41.814
<v Speaker 1>the world's smacks you a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's also the social </v>

33
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:45.714
<v Speaker 1>intermediaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other people that you're </v>

34
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 1>communicating with who will also do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

35
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.063
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're always broadcasting </v>

36
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:52.644
<v Speaker 1>information at each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly trying to shape each other's </v>

37
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:55.734
<v Speaker 1>behavior and what we're trying to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring forth from other people that </v>

38
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>which we would like to see them </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest.</v>

39
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:03.324
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an implicit ideal as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are broadcasting at each </v>

40
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:07.164
<v Speaker 1>other all the time and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous social pressure generally </v>

41
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:11.334
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to manifest that implicit ideal as </v>

42
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:14.394
<v Speaker 1>closely as possible because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>people disapprove of you or lack </v>

43
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.230
<v Speaker 1>interest in what you're saying or </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticize you or and so on.</v>

44
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.083
<v Speaker 1>And you have to be allowed to be exposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that kind of corrective feedback </v>

45
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:27.144
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you drift and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll become subject to your own </v>

46
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>idiosyncratic insanity.</v>

47
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.961
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

48
00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:35.700
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that very many times in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical practice because,</v>

49
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.571
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

50
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>I have some isolated people that come to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see me and all they do is talk.</v>

51
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.363
<v Speaker 1>I just listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean because they don't have anyone </v>

52
00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>else around and they need someone to run</v>
<v Speaker 1>their narrative by,</v>

53
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.233
<v Speaker 1>to keep their minds organized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't do it themselves and they </v>

54
00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>can't do it without listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves talk.</v>

55
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Even because for most people talking is </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they think and,</v>

56
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>and talking socially is even more how </v>
<v Speaker 1>they think.</v>

57
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:00.454
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean that metaphorically is </v>

58
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:03.124
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's true for almost </v>

59
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:05.340
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are people who are trained </v>
<v Speaker 1>academically who can actually think,</v>

61
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.013
<v Speaker 1>but to think you have to divide yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>into subpersonalities I suppose each of </v>

62
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>which has a differing opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>well elucidated differing opinion.</v>

64
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.283
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to let those different</v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of your personality have an </v>

65
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>internal dialogue and you have to draw </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusions from that.</v>

66
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult for people to do that.</v>

67
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 1>And we radically overestimate the degree</v>
<v Speaker 1>to which they do.</v>

68
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.933
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young said at one point that people </v>

69
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:34.414
<v Speaker 1>don't think so much is as thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 1>appear in their head and they believe </v>

70
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:38.494
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a much more accurate </v>

71
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:42.670
<v Speaker 1>way of describing the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the general.</v>

72
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Because true thought is not only that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thoughts arise in your mind,</v>

73
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>it's that you look at the thought and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you critique it,</v>

74
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:50.663
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to separate yourself from the </v>

75
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:54.170
<v Speaker 1>thought and decide whether or not it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable.</v>

76
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Now it's more like an editing function </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

77
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.510
<v Speaker 1>it takes a long time to be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>editor,</v>

78
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>a tremendous amount of time and it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't happen.</v>

79
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say,</v>

80
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:06.364
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without free speech there's no true </v>

81
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

82
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:09.904
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the hell cares whether or not we </v>

83
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the answer to that is fairly</v>

84
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 1>straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

85
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 1>you might think it's so obvious that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't need explanation,</v>

86
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:21.580
<v Speaker 1>but there are very few things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>so obvious they don't need explanation.</v>

87
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.773
<v Speaker 1>So the reason you think is so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world doesn't smack you as hard as it </v>

88
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 1>might fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:28.954
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really mean this technically </v>

90
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.420
<v Speaker 1>because the way that people evolved the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to thought for thought was that</v>

91
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.260
<v Speaker 1>the prefrontal cortex which mediates a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of,</v>

92
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.450
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of voluntary linguistic ability actually</v>

93
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 1>emerged over the course of evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>history out of the motor cortex.</v>

94
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a very interesting thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand because it means that,</v>

95
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals basically think by moving and </v>

96
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>the problem with that is if you think by</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving and you make the wrong move,</v>

97
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 1>then your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas what human beings can do is they</v>

98
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:57.904
<v Speaker 1>can generate fictional avatars of </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in fictional worlds and they </v>

99
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:05.980
<v Speaker 1>can run the avatars as simulations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that get killed,</v>

100
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:07.810
<v Speaker 1>they don't express in behavior.</v>

101
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 1>And I mean you could do that with words </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

102
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:13.180
<v Speaker 1>although people know originally would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have done it mostly with images.</v>

103
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:17.620
<v Speaker 1>They do the same thing with drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the reason that you think,</v>

104
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.483
<v Speaker 1>and I think it was George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it Alfred North Whitehead that said </v>

105
00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:22.631
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

106
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:23.464
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not absolutely sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason you think is so that your </v>

107
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:28.850
<v Speaker 1>thoughts can die instead of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a brilliant,</v>

108
00:05:28.851 --> 00:05:29.684
<v Speaker 1>so brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant phrase and absolutely the </v>

109
00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:34.870
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you think properly,</v>

110
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.800
<v Speaker 1>then you kill off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that if you act it out would</v>

111
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:39.634
<v Speaker 1>kill you or at least cause you suffering</v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps caused suffering to the </v>

112
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 1>people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since it's more or less obvious,</v>

113
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:47.374
<v Speaker 1>a priority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that suffering is worse than not </v>

114
00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:49.744
<v Speaker 1>suffering under most circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems reasonable to act in a manner </v>

115
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:56.440
<v Speaker 1>that will minimize it to the degree that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's possible.</v>

116
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.543
<v Speaker 1>And so you need clarity of thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that helps guide you through a </v>

117
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 1>world that's in shrouded in fog and full</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sharp objects.</v>

118
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't want to stumble into </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and impale yourself,</v>

119
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 1>then you should have sharp vision and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharp capacity to communicate.</v>

120
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things I tell students</v>

121
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:16.304
<v Speaker 1>when I'm trying to teach them to write </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they had no one ever tells them </v>

122
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:19.094
<v Speaker 1>why they should learn to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you learn to write so you can </v>

123
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>think and you learn to think so that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world doesn't treat you any more harshly</v>

124
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:28.310
<v Speaker 1>than it absolutely has to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's no joke.</v>

125
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.540
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

126
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>if you're a person who's been around a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>

127
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 1>you see very rapidly that people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharpen their arguments properly and can</v>

128
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 1>articulate their position and defendant </v>
<v Speaker 1>are always,</v>

129
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.440
<v Speaker 1>always the people who are most </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful and most compelling.</v>

130
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:43.274
<v Speaker 1>And that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that changed the way structures </v>

131
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 1>function and and that also helped things</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue in the proper path when they're</v>

132
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:50.504
<v Speaker 1>running down the proper path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no joke to be articulate and to be </v>

133
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 1>able to think there isn't anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more powerful than that.</v>
