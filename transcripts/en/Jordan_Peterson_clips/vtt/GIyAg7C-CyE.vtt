00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.013
<v Speaker 1>Where are you living right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm close to chilliwack in British </v>

2
00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there speed dating,</v>

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.683
<v Speaker 1>speed dating all available there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there's services like </v>

4
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:11.004
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know a lot of people are using </v>

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.493
<v Speaker 1>apps on your phone like tinder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I like about speed </v>

6
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:17.454
<v Speaker 1>dating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at least once is because it gives </v>

7
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>you a chance to talk to a very large </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of women very rapidly.</v>

8
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.321
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

9
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:27.210
<v Speaker 1>that's a good way of it's exposure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

10
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:30.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a good way of overcoming that fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>of initial contact,</v>

11
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:30.834
<v Speaker 1>but I think it also introduces you in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very blunt way to the diversity of </v>

12
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

13
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Because what you'll find if you go on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>speed dating,</v>

14
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what retreat,</v>

15
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.683
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there'll be nothing between you </v>

16
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>and the girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In many cases there'll be something,</v>

17
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>there are sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that's okay.</v>

18
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be attracted,</v>

19
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.793
<v Speaker 1>attracted to or attracted to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone forcing exposure to that wide </v>

20
00:00:56.701 --> 00:00:57.534
<v Speaker 1>variety of experience in a short period </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time can be a good way of overcoming </v>

21
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.823
<v Speaker 1>your fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that's just an experience </v>

22
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>that fear too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

23
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>So you got to figure out how to overcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

24
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>And then I would say with apps like </v>
<v Speaker 1>tinder,</v>

25
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.763
<v Speaker 1>it's trickier because the degree to </v>
<v Speaker 1>which sexual activity is implied in the </v>

26
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:16.820
<v Speaker 1>initial meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.320
<v Speaker 1>in the initial agreement to hook up is </v>
<v Speaker 1>unclear,</v>

28
00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:22.080
<v Speaker 1>but it might be worthwhile just to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>a rule for yourself,</v>

29
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:23.240
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.083
<v Speaker 1>you'll go on 25 tinder dates but you </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't engage in any physical contact </v>

31
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.620
<v Speaker 1>because it'll get you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll,</v>

32
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>it'll solve that problem for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

33
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>And then you can concentrate on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation and you can concentrate on,</v>

34
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.150
<v Speaker 1>on overcoming this inexperienced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

35
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:39.984
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

36
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 1>that's interfering with your progress </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

37
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>But that good a rule like that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it simple.</v>

38
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you need rules like that.</v>

39
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.710
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably know this,</v>

40
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:50.544
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you don't mean your experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to being avoidant and </v>

41
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 1>afraid of contact with women is by no </v>
<v Speaker 1>means rare.</v>

42
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.430
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably common among young </v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

43
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>And I think it is exacerbated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors that you just described,</v>

44
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:06.324
<v Speaker 1>which is that you were taught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young men are taught in particular that </v>

45
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:11.004
<v Speaker 1>any show of even confidence on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>part might be interpreted as part of </v>

46
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:18.150
<v Speaker 1>this toxic masculinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that,</v>

47
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.853
<v Speaker 1>well that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that would have to be </v>

48
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:22.284
<v Speaker 1>unpacked for hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what I would say is that women </v>

49
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>generally like men who have power but </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't need to use it.</v>

50
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.990
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And women who are,</v>

51
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.033
<v Speaker 1>who are uncertain and unsettled in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships with men would rather for </v>

52
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:39.000
<v Speaker 1>their own safety that all men be </v>
<v Speaker 1>rendered powerless.</v>

53
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>But that's not helpful because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroys erotic attraction.</v>

54
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:44.940
<v Speaker 1>And then all that happens is that men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dap useless.</v>

55
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>like to destroy someone's power is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution to taming them.</v>

57
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want someone powerful but civilized,</v>

58
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:56.880
<v Speaker 1>not someone we so weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't do anything wrong.</v>

59
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.463
<v Speaker 1>And I think the message that young men </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a lot in our society is you should </v>

60
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>be so weak that you can't do anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

61
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really bad message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't do anyone any good.</v>

62
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

63
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:09.244
<v Speaker 1>I've been seeing that like it seems like</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are being told to be more </v>

64
00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:13.224
<v Speaker 1>masculine and that if it's a negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing for women to be feminine and </v>

65
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 1>negative for men to be masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even in,</v>

66
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:21.630
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Brampton where I was living,</v>

67
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.350
<v Speaker 1>I saw these posters around the mall </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

68
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.690
<v Speaker 1>who says women can't be leaders?</v>

69
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with throwing like a girl?</v>

70
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:33.180
<v Speaker 1>And because it was being pushed on me so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

71
00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:37.620
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I was just accepting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now I've sort of seen through that.</v>

72
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.420
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use it.</v>

73
00:03:39.421 --> 00:03:41.190
<v Speaker 1>I think that's great advice that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just gave a minute.</v>

74
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As well.</v>

75
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:46.170
<v Speaker 1>We also have to account for the stunning</v>
<v Speaker 1>popularity of 50 shades of gray.</v>

76
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.623
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all this surface talk about </v>

77
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.000
<v Speaker 1>about toxic masculinity and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.843
<v Speaker 1>the overbearing rape culture that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of men and that the </v>

79
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>attempt to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

80
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.423
<v Speaker 1>what would you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose castrate would be the wrong </v>

81
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe I'll use it anyways.</v>

82
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:05.254
<v Speaker 1>But then there's this underground desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's manifest in the attraction of </v>

83
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 1>that sort of literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

84
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:10.864
<v Speaker 1>that was the fastest selling book in </v>
<v Speaker 1>human history and so there's really </v>

85
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:15.064
<v Speaker 1>something to be said about that and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that those two things can coexist </v>

86
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:18.724
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the same culture is an indication of </v>

87
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:21.334
<v Speaker 1>just how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much conversation there needs to be </v>

88
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:25.234
<v Speaker 1>about what the proper role of </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinity and femininity as and also </v>

89
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.720
<v Speaker 1>how to organize sexual behavior so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are not pathologized by it.</v>

90
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:35.723
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so interesting to me to watch </v>

91
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:38.290
<v Speaker 1>what's happening on the campuses </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

92
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

93
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>and that's emblematic of what happens in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the broader world.</v>

94
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:42.934
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time we have discussions </v>

95
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 1>about how absolutely every form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual desire and behavior whatsoever is</v>

96
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>entirely permissible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the increasing multiplication of</v>

97
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>regulations about every single aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sexual interaction between a man and</v>

98
00:04:57.341 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 1>a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those two things.</v>

99
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.253
<v Speaker 1>The fact that those two things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening at the same time means that </v>

100
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:06.060
<v Speaker 1>something is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

101
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.903
<v Speaker 1>maybe we should back off on the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that absolutely every form of sexual </v>

102
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:11.014
<v Speaker 1>interaction whatsoever is permissible </v>
<v Speaker 1>and desirable and simultaneously back </v>

103
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:15.814
<v Speaker 1>off on the increasing enclosure of every</v>
<v Speaker 1>of every physical interaction in a web </v>

104
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:22.054
<v Speaker 1>of of laws and regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of which are going to be </v>

105
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive and caused all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of trouble.</v>
