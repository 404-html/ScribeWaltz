1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Where I went into a restaurant the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>day in Toronto when this kid came up and</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.043
<v Speaker 1>he shook my hand and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want you to know that since I'd </v>

3
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:07.794
<v Speaker 1>been listening to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got three promotions at this </v>

4
00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

5
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:12.384
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>good work man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like way to be.</v>

7
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:16.591
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

8
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:17.424
<v Speaker 1>well I started coming in on time and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>working really hard and I'm trying to </v>

9
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 1>figure out how I can do a good job here </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of being above the job,</v>

10
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:24.294
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take this until I get something </v>

11
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:26.910
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of beneath me.</v>

12
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

13
00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

14
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:30.924
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy to do most jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually hard to do most jobs </v>

15
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:35.094
<v Speaker 1>especially to do them well and it turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that the world is constituted if </v>

16
00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>society is set up well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you do a good job,</v>

17
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.220
<v Speaker 1>invisible doors open in front of you.</v>

18
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Because people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know this,</v>

19
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:46.974
<v Speaker 1>I've had lots of contact with businesses</v>
<v Speaker 1>and academic institutions and like the </v>

20
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:55.941
<v Speaker 1>people who run things competently are </v>
<v Speaker 1>often but not always interested.</v>

21
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Very interested in finding young people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can mentor and move forward.</v>

22
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:05.370
<v Speaker 1>It's actually one of the pleasures of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being competent than something.</v>

23
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>And so if they see someone who's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>going that extra mile,</v>

24
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>busy people have lots of opportunities </v>

25
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 1>around them and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

26
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:17.760
<v Speaker 1>I've got that opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't really do it,</v>

27
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:19.770
<v Speaker 1>but I can funnel it over to this kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

28
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Like let's see how he or she does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

29
00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>And so he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

30
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>you want to try this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the person says,</v>

31
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time.</v>

32
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:27.564
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

33
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.780
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the smart kid says,</v>

34
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

35
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.440
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that.</v>

36
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 1>And then the person with opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks watches and thinks,</v>

37
00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:38.004
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's,</v>

38
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.650

<v Speaker 1>see if the person does it.</v>

39
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.940
<v Speaker 1>And if they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

40
00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:42.774
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's four more opportunities that I </v>

41
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:47.400
