1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.420
<v Speaker 1>This was a statistic that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely shocked and staggered me when</v>

2
00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I went through the Intel intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>

3
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:06.234
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is illegal in the United States to </v>

4
00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:09.294
<v Speaker 1>induct anybody who has an Iq of less </v>
<v Speaker 1>than 83 and the reason for that is you </v>

5
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:14.214
<v Speaker 1>know that the American armed forces have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been conducting intelligence research </v>

6
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:18.054
<v Speaker 1>for like more than 100 years and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was partly because they needed a way of </v>

7
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:25.170
<v Speaker 1>sorting people rapidly during times of </v>
<v Speaker 1>military expansion during war time.</v>

8
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:29.490
<v Speaker 1>But it was also because Iq tests and </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the early part of the 20th</v>

9
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:30.324
<v Speaker 1>century were used to identify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the deserving poor who could </v>

10
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:34.434
<v Speaker 1>really benefit from additional </v>
<v Speaker 1>educational attainment and advancement </v>

11
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:38.024
<v Speaker 1>in the unit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the military was hoping to identify </v>

12
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 1>people from lower class strata that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be streamed into say,</v>

13
00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:47.660
<v Speaker 1>officer training programs and so forth </v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

14
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>or even skills training programs to.</v>

15
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.413
<v Speaker 1>To move people from the underclass into </v>
<v Speaker 1>at least the working class and maybe </v>

16
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>above.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had a bloody stake in this man.</v>

17
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.283
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to find people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want it to sort them properly and </v>

18
00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to do social good when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't just trying to win a war,</v>

19
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which often also is social good,</v>

20
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.573
<v Speaker 1>but what happened was that by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember when this legislation </v>

21
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>was introduced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't.</v>

22
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>It was in the later part of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

23
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 1>but there are basic finding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that by say the 19 eighties,</v>

24
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>they had determined that if you had an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq of less than 83,</v>

25
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>there was not a damn thing that the unit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the army could do,</v>

26
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:25.194
<v Speaker 1>the armed forces could do to transform </v>
<v Speaker 1>you into someone who could do something </v>

27
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>that was more productive than </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonproductive,</v>

28
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.653
<v Speaker 1>and the terrible thing about that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's about 10 percent of the </v>

29
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 1>population and so they look at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistic like that and you think,</v>

30
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.690
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got this,</v>

31
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.040
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

32
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.973
<v Speaker 1>this enterprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this massive enterprise that's </v>

33
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:47.880
<v Speaker 1>chronically hungry for people.</v>

34
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always,</v>

35
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.943
<v Speaker 1>they're always looking for people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are really oriented towards taking </v>

36
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>people from the underclass and lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>working class and pushing them up.</v>

37
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:56.664
<v Speaker 1>The societal strata and during war time </v>
<v Speaker 1>there actually desperate to bring in </v>

38
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:00.954
<v Speaker 1>recruits period and their conclusion is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that 10 percent of the population can't </v>

39
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.783
<v Speaker 1>be trained to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything sufficiently useful to make </v>

40
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Speaker 1>them militarily operable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>

41
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.013
<v Speaker 1>I just read that my jaw just dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like in the United States we have </v>

42
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:22.281
<v Speaker 1>about 330 million people and because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the distribution,</v>

43
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 1>the relatively normal distribution of Iq</v>
<v Speaker 1>scores about 16 percent of 85 or what?</v>

44
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.640
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to graduate school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

45
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.010
<v Speaker 1>it means that from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from what I've read practically,</v>

46
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>it means the wanderlust company has </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually done a really.</v>

47
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.230
<v Speaker 1>They have a nice Iq tests from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial perspective,</v>

48
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:45.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually psychometrically valid and</v>

49
00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:50.691
<v Speaker 1>they've linked Iq levels to a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Specifically the job categories,</v>

50
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know not a lot.</v>

51
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.940
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say is they're not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to graduate school,</v>

52
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to find a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stable</v>

53
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 2>job that pays a livable wage.</v>

54
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Especially even given that so many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the service jobs now require fair,</v>

55
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.650
<v Speaker 1>high degree of computational savvy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader built.</v>

56
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.030
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not computation,</v>

57
00:03:14.031 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 1>but ability to interact with complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>computational technology,</v>

58
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.973
<v Speaker 1>the typical till ladder at a checkout </v>
<v Speaker 1>market or or the Mcdonald's because the </v>

59
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.603
<v Speaker 1>dongles is actually very complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is often far beyond the ability of </v>

60
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:28.984
<v Speaker 1>people who are on the low end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence distribution and they </v>

61
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 1>claimed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was wonderlic,</v>

62
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 1>although it might know it might've been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might've been hunt.</v>

63
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.660
<v Speaker 1>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These ICU researcher.</v>

64
00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:40.494
<v Speaker 1>Is it earl haunt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think possibly what he claimed that </v>

65
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 1>that if you have an Iq of below 90,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's.</v>

66
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.053
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult for you to read well </v>

67
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 1>enough to translate what you're reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>into action,</v>

68
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 1>so you can't actually read instructions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and follow them.</v>

69
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>You don't have that level of literacy.</v>

70
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 2>That's correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

71
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say that in in the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>

72
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.300
<v Speaker 2>this bottom 16 percent translates into </v>
<v Speaker 2>51 million people,</v>

73
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 2>including $13 million children who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>in school.</v>

74
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a very difficult problem.</v>

75
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Now I knew earl hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He passed away.</v>

76
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:20.613
<v Speaker 2>I knew him pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also would say that there is this a </v>

77
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.903
<v Speaker 2>cognitive segregation in society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a point that Charles Murray </v>

78
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:35.880
<v Speaker 2>makes an often asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

79
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:36.723
<v Speaker 2>when's the last time you had someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>over for dinner who wasn't a college </v>

80
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:41.314
<v Speaker 2>graduate?</v>

81
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.573
<v Speaker 1>Well that was something that Marie and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernstein wrote about in their book the </v>

82
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:45.814
<v Speaker 1>bell curve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really struck me because I read </v>

83
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:51.280
<v Speaker 1>that book twice unlike most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people criticized it and you know,</v>

84
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.070
<v Speaker 1>we're one of the things that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed out in there,</v>

85
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:54.904
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look the typically the typical educated </v>

86
00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:03.091
<v Speaker 1>person thinks that someone isn't very </v>
<v Speaker 1>bright if they have an Iq of 150.</v>

87
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.490
<v Speaker 1>So you at graduate level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phd Level Research Institutions,</v>

88
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:09.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because 115,</v>

89
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 1>there's as many people at 115 and above </v>
<v Speaker 1>as there are at 85 and below.</v>

90
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.180
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a minority of the population</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the top 15 percent.</v>

91
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.610
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

92
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.950
<v Speaker 1>that's the dollar undergraduate people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

93
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.790
<v Speaker 1>See I'm a clinical psychologist and I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealt with people who had,</v>

94
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:28.624
<v Speaker 1>I ranges in the low eighties and tried </v>
<v Speaker 1>to find them jobs and tried to train </v>

95
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:32.611
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

96
00:05:32.611 --> 00:05:33.444
<v Speaker 1>I have some real knowledge about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stunning gap between people at the low </v>

97
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 1>end of the ICU distribution and the high</v>
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>

98
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no bloody wonder,</v>

99
00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:41.854
<v Speaker 1>people hate Iq research and intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 1>research because it reveals a set of </v>

100
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:46.234
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dismal facts about the incredible </v>

101
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:52.330
<v Speaker 1>range of ability among human beings.</v>

102
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

103
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.503
<v Speaker 2>this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And moreover I would add to this that </v>

104
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.913
<v Speaker 2>people in universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professors and a couple of graduate </v>

105
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 2>students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

106
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.110
<v Speaker 2>have a hard time understanding what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what everyday life is like.</v>

107
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.720
<v Speaker 2>If you have an Iq of 84,</v>
<v Speaker 2>85 and we're making your way,</v>

108
00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 2>you're living independently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were making your way in the world</v>

109
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.570
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a challenge.</v>

110
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

111
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.860
<v Speaker 1>just barely begins to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

112
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.843
<v Speaker 1>I had a client who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably had an Iq of under 80 </v>

113
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.910
<v Speaker 1>nonverbal portion of it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

114
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.890
<v Speaker 1>he was indistinguishable in physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>appearance from,</v>

115
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.730
<v Speaker 1>from let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to use the frame normal person,</v>

116
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:44.564
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing more that marked him</v>
<v Speaker 1>out about particularly intellectually </v>

117
00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 1>impaired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

118
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried at one point,</v>

119
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.120
<v Speaker 1>this is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was so,</v>

120
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:58.150
<v Speaker 1>so telling to me I got him a volunteer </v>
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>

121
00:06:58.311 --> 00:06:59.144
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's harder to get a volunteer job in a </v>

122
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:02.084
<v Speaker 1>real job because you have to do police </v>
<v Speaker 1>screening and all sorts of things and </v>

123
00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:06.050
<v Speaker 1>the selection process is just as </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme.</v>

124
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:09.350
<v Speaker 1>But I eventually ended up getting him a </v>
<v Speaker 1>job at a bike store,</v>

125
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.933
<v Speaker 1>bike slash bookstore and at that place </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't hold him once the subsidy </v>

126
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:16.370
<v Speaker 1>program had expired.</v>

127
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.203
<v Speaker 1>And then I got him a job at a charity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and his job was to fold letters into </v>

128
00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 1>three so that they can be put into </v>
<v Speaker 1>envelopes.</v>

129
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds easy except that he also had</v>

130
00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:29.654
<v Speaker 1>a bit of a motor tremor and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took me about 30 hours to train him </v>

131
00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:34.544
<v Speaker 1>to fold up a piece of paper with </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient precision so that it can be </v>

132
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:43.250
<v Speaker 1>put in an envelope rapidly so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>envelope wasn't so mangled that it would</v>

133
00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:45.260
<v Speaker 1>get stuck in the automatic sorting </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>

134
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.360
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>

135
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.193
<v Speaker 1>high performance demands on him too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to whip through those letters </v>

136
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:54.371
<v Speaker 1>pretty quickly and then sometimes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>letters would have a photograph appended</v>

137
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:56.114
<v Speaker 1>to them that was stapled on and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't always stapled on in the same </v>

138
00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:00.044
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then he had to calculate how to fold </v>

139
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:02.294
<v Speaker 1>the paper over the photograph without </v>
<v Speaker 1>bending the photograph in precise third </v>

140
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:07.634
<v Speaker 1>so that would still fit in the envelope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he had to separate the French </v>

141
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.440
<v Speaker 1>letters from the English letters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>associate them with the proper envelopes</v>

142
00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:18.390
<v Speaker 1>and that level of complexity just did </v>
<v Speaker 1>him in.</v>

143
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:20.440
<v Speaker 1>Let</v>

144
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.090
<v Speaker 2>me say two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is I hope common sense and the other</v>

145
00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:25.924
<v Speaker 2>is pretty provocative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The common sense thing is we have to be </v>

146
00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:29.884
<v Speaker 2>very careful when we have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussions not to devalue the human </v>

147
00:08:34.661 --> 00:08:35.494
<v Speaker 2>dignity of people who are in the upper </v>
<v Speaker 2>end of the distribution and if there's </v>

148
00:08:40.511 --> 00:08:41.344
<v Speaker 2>one criticism that is fair is sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>in these conversations it sounds like </v>

149
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.343
<v Speaker 2>we're devaluing people at the lower end </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the distribution and we have to be </v>

150
00:08:51.941 --> 00:08:56.460
<v Speaker 2>very careful that we don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A human has dignity</v>

151
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.293
<v Speaker 1>and Iq is not the most important thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that defines human beings even </v>

152
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.093
<v Speaker 1>associated with wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily associated with </v>

153
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:07.374
<v Speaker 1>truth or with courage or with many </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtues that how did it all with being </v>

154
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:14.664
<v Speaker 1>likable or on the psychometric </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychometric relationship between </v>

155
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:23.010
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and conscientiousness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>

156
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to make that point.</v>

157
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

158
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:27.840
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

159
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.903
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to make the point about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult it is for people who are on </v>

160
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:34.740
<v Speaker 1>the low end of the cognitive spectrum to</v>
<v Speaker 1>survive in a,</v>

161
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.910
<v Speaker 1>in an increasingly complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitively sophisticated environment,</v>

162
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 1>jobs are just disappearing.</v>
