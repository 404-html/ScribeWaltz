1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.013
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to study political </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctness and so what the first thing </v>

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:06.420
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to figure out was is there </v>
<v Speaker 1>even such a thing?</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the political dialogue,</v>

4
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:10.764
<v Speaker 1>what you find is that people on the side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the political spectrum who have been </v>

5
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:14.874
<v Speaker 1>defined as politically correct tend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that it doesn't exist and that that </v>

6
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:18.384
<v Speaker 1>category is just a pejorative term that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was invented by people who hold </v>

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>alternative political opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the first question is,</v>

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean some does it exist?</v>

9
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by exist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

10
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>How do you tell if a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept is real?</v>

11
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Like his anger is anger or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that exists objectively.</v>

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Is it done an objective phenomena?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy to determine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

14
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:44.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

15
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>we act like it is and we understand what</v>
<v Speaker 1>anger means,</v>

16
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.583
<v Speaker 1>but no one goes along round in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and says anger without saying anything </v>

17
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>else or you'd run away from them.</v>

18
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they do is they,</v>

19
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.063
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they placed the word anger into a </v>

20
00:00:58.111 --> 00:00:58.944
<v Speaker 1>sentence and place the sentence within a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation and they enable you to </v>

21
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 1>infer exactly what they mean by the word</v>
<v Speaker 1>anger,</v>

22
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>by listening to the surrounding context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

23
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.673
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're going to turn that into </v>

24
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:10.554
<v Speaker 1>something like an objective term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you pull out the term </v>

25
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 1>anger and then you make the hypothesis </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it represents something real in the</v>

26
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:17.724
<v Speaker 1>objective world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that easy to determine if </v>

27
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:20.904
<v Speaker 1>something does exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's a psychological </v>

28
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 1>phenomena in the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by exist?</v>

29
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem of construct </v>
<v Speaker 1>validation.</v>

30
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:30.234
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's another term you really need </v>

31
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>to know if you're interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>experimental psychology,</v>

32
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.613
<v Speaker 1>especially on the personality and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct is a representation of </v>

33
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:42.090
<v Speaker 1>something psychological that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically exists.</v>

34
00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:42.924
<v Speaker 1>Objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you establish its existence </v>

35
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:45.450
<v Speaker 1>objectively?</v>

36
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does fear exist?</v>

37
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.003
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does you have the problem with all the </v>

38
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Speaker 1>emotional terms?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does joy exist to surprise exist?</v>

39
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Does embarrassment exist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does guilt exist?</v>

40
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Shame?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are they related to one another?</v>

41
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Guilt and shame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

42
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:01.290
<v Speaker 1>seem quite similar to one another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

43
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:04.550
<v Speaker 1>and pain and fear and anger all seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>share the,</v>

44
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

45
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>the attribute of unpleasant to negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions and so how similar,</v>

46
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>how something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if something exists,</v>

47
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:13.584
<v Speaker 1>it should be the same as some things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>different from other things and that's </v>

48
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>part of construct validation as well to </v>
<v Speaker 1>specify how the construct is the same as</v>

49
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.110
<v Speaker 1>some things and different from others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anger should be reliably distinguishable</v>

50
00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>from joy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

51
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:27.654
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise they're not different </v>
<v Speaker 1>and anger and fear should be somewhat </v>

52
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:33.030
<v Speaker 1>the same if they're both negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

53
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.960
<v Speaker 1>So it's extraordinarily complex to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

54
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 1>to validate a construct.</v>

55
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.543
<v Speaker 1>And so here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what we did with political </v>

56
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

57
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.683
<v Speaker 1>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I'm using the political </v>

58
00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:43.614
<v Speaker 1>examples is because that's an obvious </v>
<v Speaker 1>place where self serving bias can enter </v>

59
00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:51.030
<v Speaker 1>the scientific arena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

60
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.163
<v Speaker 1>So if I wanted to make a point about </v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness or if I wanted to </v>

61
00:02:56.341 --> 00:02:57.174
<v Speaker 1>make a point about right wing fascism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could build my biases into the </v>

62
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 1>measurement instruments accidentally and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they would produce as output what I</v>

63
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:05.254
<v Speaker 1>put into them as input.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I want to protect myself against </v>

64
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>that if I actually want to do this </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific investigation properly.</v>

65
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.463
<v Speaker 1>So what we did when we started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct our measures of political </v>

66
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.963
<v Speaker 1>correctness was employ a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to go through as many news </v>

67
00:03:21.151 --> 00:03:26.151
<v Speaker 1>sources as they could get their hands on</v>
<v Speaker 1>to identify any attitude or behavior,</v>

68
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.633
<v Speaker 1>some roughly that that had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>described by anyone at all as </v>

69
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>potentially politically correct.</v>

70
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>So it was kind of agnostic and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do it as randomly as possible,</v>

71
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:37.114
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get as many new sources as we </v>

72
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:43.051
<v Speaker 1>possibly could so that we were sampling </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the environment without bias.</v>

73
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then we came up with,</v>

74
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple hundred,</v>

75
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.323
<v Speaker 1>maybe more a couple hundred items that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were roughly indicative of what you </v>

76
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:54.820
<v Speaker 1>might describe as political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not good enough,</v>

77
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:55.654
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because just because you have this </v>

78
00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:57.334
<v Speaker 1>random assemblage of items doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate at all that they're all </v>

79
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:04.690
<v Speaker 1>measuring something that was similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just implicit.</v>

80
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:05.524
<v Speaker 1>They're all cold political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know if those attitudes </v>

81
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:08.884
<v Speaker 1>covariate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is if you held one </v>

82
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:12.034
<v Speaker 1>attitude of that list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were you more likely to hold another or </v>

83
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>multiple others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

84
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 1>So is the conditional probability of </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding multiple items?</v>

85
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Is there a high probability of holding </v>
<v Speaker 1>true multiple items simultaneously while</v>

86
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>you figure that out with factor </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis?</v>

87
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.943
<v Speaker 1>So what we did is we turned that into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire using different question </v>

88
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:33.604
<v Speaker 1>types and we administered it to several </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred people and we did a factor </v>

89
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:37.744
<v Speaker 1>analysis and we found actually that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was such a thing as political </v>

90
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 1>correctness because the questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>clumped together,</v>

91
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>people would reliably answered them in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern manner,</v>

92
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 1>but that there were actually two </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions that were quite separate.</v>

93
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>So there isn't one political </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctness.</v>

94
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:51.874
<v Speaker 1>There seems to be two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we looked at the personality </v>

95
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:55.294
<v Speaker 1>predictors in the ICU predictors and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of other predictors that would </v>

96
00:04:58.301 --> 00:04:59.134
<v Speaker 1>enable us to come to some understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the temperamental proclivity towards </v>

97
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>those political attitudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if any.</v>

98
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.160
<v Speaker 1>We knew already that political </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives tended to be low in trade,</v>

99
00:05:11.831 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 1>openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the creativity dimension and high</v>

100
00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:15.994
<v Speaker 1>in trait conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas political liberals tended to be </v>

101
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:22.030
<v Speaker 1>high in trait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness and low in conscientiousness,</v>

102
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.200
<v Speaker 1>and so one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily interesting to know from</v>

103
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:27.034
<v Speaker 1>the big five perspective is that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>political proclivities are very </v>

104
00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 1>powerfully influenced by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament.</v>

105
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.543
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you can think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about with regards to ongoing political </v>

106
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:37.024
<v Speaker 1>discussions in the real world is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>those discussions are actually attempts </v>

107
00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:43.390
<v Speaker 1>by people of different temperaments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

108
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:47.680
<v Speaker 1>to impose their temperamental viewpoints</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the world and to,</v>

109
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.693
<v Speaker 1>to engage in a dialogue with people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are actually quite different than they </v>

110
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:52.354
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
