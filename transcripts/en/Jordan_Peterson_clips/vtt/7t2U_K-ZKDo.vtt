1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.400
<v Speaker 1>That's Michelangelo's famous Sistine </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chapel Representation.</v>

2
00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:05.320
<v Speaker 1>And there's some cool things about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.300
<v Speaker 1>you got to wonder this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

4
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.163
<v Speaker 1>this is a side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if it's a credible </v>

5
00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:13.240
<v Speaker 1>aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an interesting aside.</v>

6
00:00:13.241 --> 00:00:14.800
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a form of credible.</v>

7
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.990
<v Speaker 1>What the Hell is God doing in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

8
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.161
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

9
00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:21.260
<v Speaker 1>what is this exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's,</v>

10
00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:23.980
<v Speaker 1>there's been some interesting answers to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and this is one of them.</v>

11
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.680
<v Speaker 1>So there was a group of scientists about</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago that,</v>

12
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.050
<v Speaker 1>that were remarked on the precise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.453
<v Speaker 1>the precise analogy between this </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and the brain bisected down </v>

14
00:00:37.541 --> 00:00:38.650
<v Speaker 1>the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

15
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Michael Angelo was one of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who did detailed dissections.</v>

16
00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:46.000
<v Speaker 1>And so they felt that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

17
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.130
<v Speaker 1>that Michelangelo had put God inside the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain for some reason.</v>

18
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.330
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.060
<v Speaker 1>that seems to me to be associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion that there's,</v>

20
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

21
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.123
<v Speaker 1>there's an analogy or a metaphorical </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity between the notion of whatever </v>

22
00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:02.830
<v Speaker 1>God is and the structures that give rise</v>
<v Speaker 1>to consciousness.</v>

23
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.113
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I think we really underestimate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree to which consciousness is,</v>

25
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.410
<v Speaker 1>is both same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miraculous.</v>

26
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.390
<v Speaker 1>And not understood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

28
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.763
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have what appears to be an entirely </v>

29
00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:18.610
<v Speaker 1>material substrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

30
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.473
<v Speaker 1>Here you are aware and self aware and </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to generate the world merely in </v>

31
00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:24.244
<v Speaker 1>some sense by looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is remarkable in that </v>

32
00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:27.064
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is dependent on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on something that wells up from deep </v>

33
00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:33.430
<v Speaker 1>within that material substrate that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand at all.</v>

34
00:01:33.431 --> 00:01:36.250
<v Speaker 1>It's really a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazily remarkable thing.</v>

35
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you hear,</v>

36
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.110
<v Speaker 1>you hear a lot about scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>reductionism,</v>

37
00:01:41.111 --> 00:01:44.230
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you something that's kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of interesting and it's a tangent to,</v>

38
00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:46.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy that discovered Dna,</v>

39
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Watson and Watson and </v>
<v Speaker 1>crick,</v>

40
00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:50.410
<v Speaker 1>but I don't remember who wrote this </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

41
00:01:50.411 --> 00:01:54.160
<v Speaker 1>but one of them I don't remember which </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

42
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.180
<v Speaker 1>he believed that DNA was so complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it had to come from space.</v>

43
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.520
<v Speaker 1>He didn't believe it could have possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved on earth.</v>

44
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.060
<v Speaker 1>And so like a lot of these people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are used</v>

45
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.140
<v Speaker 1>as exemplars of scientific reductionism </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't like that at all.</v>

46
00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:09.670
<v Speaker 1>When you actually read what they had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

47
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:10.051
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

48
00:02:10.051 --> 00:02:10.884
<v Speaker 1>they were very aware of the limits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own knowledge and I mean DNA is </v>

49
00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:17.260
<v Speaker 1>something really quite spectacularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable.</v>

50
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.320
<v Speaker 1>It's an eternal substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been around for a very long time.</v>

51
00:02:20.321 --> 00:02:21.154
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that we understand it is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very stupid idea and I would say that I </v>

52
00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:27.460
<v Speaker 1>would say that the same thing applies to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain.</v>

53
00:02:27.461 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

54
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.050
<v Speaker 1>we're scratching away at the surface of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something we don't understand at all.</v>

55
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.850
<v Speaker 1>And so it's quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

56
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.580
<v Speaker 1>and maybe Michelangelo had enough goal </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

57
00:02:36.581 --> 00:02:37.414
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had enough goal to do </v>

58
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.790
<v Speaker 1>dissections when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the cost of that was death,</v>

59
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.643
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had this rob corpses essentially to </v>

60
00:02:45.281 --> 00:02:47.170
<v Speaker 1>go and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was,</v>

61
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.430
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

62
00:02:48.431 --> 00:02:51.060
<v Speaker 1>not particularly politically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

63
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.413
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of interesting and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is another representation of the same </v>

64
00:02:55.661 --> 00:03:00.661
<v Speaker 1>thing and that's a funny one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to throw that in.</v>

65
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>

66
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.003
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this joke in the atheistic </v>

67
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.903
<v Speaker 1>atheist community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it might've been started by </v>

68
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Richard Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that might be wrong,</v>

69
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.923
<v Speaker 1>that it was just as reasonable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in the flying spaghetti monster </v>

70
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:14.554
<v Speaker 1>as it was to believe in God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the flying spaghetti monster </v>

71
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.703
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

72
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:18.723
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.563
<v Speaker 1>and so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's called touched by his noodly </v>

74
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:26.730
<v Speaker 1>appendage and anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fun.</v>

75
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not very sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is funny.</v>

76
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.173
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
