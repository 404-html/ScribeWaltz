00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.133
<v Speaker 1>Question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is capitalism compatible with your </v>

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:03.654
<v Speaker 1>definition of good if it requires ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing use of the finite resources </v>

3
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>of the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where once depleted would mean our end?</v>

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.513
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say capitalism isn't compatible </v>

5
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:14.394
<v Speaker 1>with my definition of good if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>requires every increasing uses of the </v>

6
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>finite resources of the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's by no means self evident even</v>

7
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:23.910
<v Speaker 1>though the Scuttlebutt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

8
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:24.744
<v Speaker 1>especially among the environmentalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented types who might have some </v>

9
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 1>sympathy for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

10
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:31.740
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to ocean </v>
<v Speaker 1>depletion.</v>

11
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.083
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a huge argument and there has </v>

12
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:35.034
<v Speaker 1>been for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years between the economists and </v>

13
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:39.090
<v Speaker 1>the biologists and this is a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>important thing to know.</v>

14
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:43.770
<v Speaker 1>And The economist point out that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingenuity is such that we're continually</v>

15
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>able to make more with less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And certainly over the last well,</v>

16
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>500 years that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the last 150 years,</v>

17
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>that's just absolutely evident.</v>

18
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.953
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people say we're going to run out </v>

19
00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:57.084
<v Speaker 1>of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's absolutely </v>

20
00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:59.230
<v Speaker 1>preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's,</v>

21
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy as thinking we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>run out of mattered.</v>

22
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.903
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going through a bit of a </v>

23
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:04.914
<v Speaker 1>bottleneck right now because you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>the population is going to increase to </v>

24
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>about 9 billion and then it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>decrease.</v>

25
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the most reliable projections and</v>

26
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.320
<v Speaker 1>9 billion isn't the law more than we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have now and you know,</v>

27
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be some environmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>disruption as a consequence of that,</v>

28
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:21.234
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think there's any reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that all that capitalism </v>

29
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:28.470
<v Speaker 1>necessarily requires ever increasing use</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the finite resources of the planet.</v>

30
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.663
<v Speaker 1>It's also not obvious to what degree the</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources of the planet are actually </v>

31
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.110
<v Speaker 1>finite because we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can continually think up new uses for</v>

32
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>things that nobody thought had any use </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

33
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.833
<v Speaker 1>So it depends to some degree on whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not you're willing to bet on human </v>

34
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:49.251
<v Speaker 1>imaginativeness or you're going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>male Uzi and pessimist.</v>

35
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons for both.</v>

36
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:52.794
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that it is by no means </v>
<v Speaker 1>self evident that things are getting </v>

37
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

38
00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>like I can give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

39
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last,</v>

40
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.513
<v Speaker 1>in the last 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the millennium goal for the UN was to </v>

41
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>have world poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like absolute poverty,</v>

42
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:09.174
<v Speaker 1>so that's less than a dollar 50 a day by</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 percent within 15 years that was </v>

43
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:13.794
<v Speaker 1>actually reached ahead of schedule and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've lifted hundreds of millions of </v>

44
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Speaker 1>people into the middleclass over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last 30 years.</v>

45
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:20.484
<v Speaker 1>And so there is an increasing inequality</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the west because the working classes </v>

46
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>taken the brunt of that say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>redistribution to third world countries.</v>

47
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:30.030
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.193
<v Speaker 1>there's no starvation in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore except really for reasons of </v>

49
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>misdistribution and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

50
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.980
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and political purpose.</v>

51
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>And people are becoming richer and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>educated all the time.</v>

52
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.413
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we are waking up to our planetary </v>

53
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.473
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once people stopped starving to death </v>

54
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>and having to burn like dirt and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and eat,</v>

55
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>substandard food that they've scraped </v>

56
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:56.190
<v Speaker 1>out into the Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do start to turn their attention to</v>

57
00:02:56.191 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>things that might be more aesthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so look,</v>

58
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't think any reason to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>pessimistic,</v>

59
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.953
<v Speaker 1>not fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess the reason that capitalism </v>

60
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:07.200
<v Speaker 1>is compatible with my definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

61
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.223
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that I don't see an </v>

62
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:11.854
<v Speaker 1>alternative that has manifested itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't have far more negative </v>

63
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

64
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a minimal pessimism issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

65
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.553
<v Speaker 1>well this is the best devil that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do believe it is because the </v>

66
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>successful societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by any stretch of the imagination,</v>

67
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 1>by virtually any metric are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalist societies.</v>

68
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

69
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>that the Soviet Union demolished far </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of its natural resources.</v>

70
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:43.411
<v Speaker 1>Too Far less a productive consequence </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the west did hearsay evidence.</v>

71
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.203
<v Speaker 1>There's suggestions that between 10 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>15 percent of the total area of the </v>

72
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union has been rendered more or </v>
<v Speaker 1>less permanently uninhabitable.</v>

73
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to what.</v>
