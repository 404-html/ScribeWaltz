00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.160
<v Speaker 1>I saw you tweet this recently and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shook me a little bit.</v>

3
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>I was shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was shocked to see this.</v>

4
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>I like this one a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll introduce this.</v>

5
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.823
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you said those who consider </v>

6
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:13.704
<v Speaker 1>themselves my enemies had been posting </v>
<v Speaker 1>these all around my home neighborhood </v>

7
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>and it says here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Community Safety Bulletin,</v>

8
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.763
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Pearson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a local man teaching at the University </v>

9
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>of Toronto has been championing against </v>
<v Speaker 1>the human rights of women,</v>

10
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>people of color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslims and l,</v>

11
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:28.380
<v Speaker 1>G,</v>
<v Speaker 1>b t people for over a year.</v>

12
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.453
<v Speaker 1>Peterson has opened association with Neo</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazis and the outright even being </v>

13
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:32.724
<v Speaker 1>referred to as a Nazi philosopher by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>leader of the new constitution party of </v>

14
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Canada due to pressure from Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson's alright.</v>

15
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.073
<v Speaker 1>Fan Base,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the University of Toronto has not taken </v>

16
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>any action to fire him or disavow his </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks on minority groups.</v>

17
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is awful.</v>

18
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's something where there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of things about it that I really,</v>

19
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.310
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are really creative.</v>

20
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.143
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the first is they posted it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my neighborhood which is really nasty </v>

21
00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.980
<v Speaker 1>and it's really underhanded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

22
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

23
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 1>and like thoughtfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

24
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a double message there,</v>

25
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:06.384
<v Speaker 1>it's like we know where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know where your family is and we're </v>

26
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:10.720
<v Speaker 1>perfectly willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.810
<v Speaker 1>make that known and to hypothetically </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrass you in front of your neighbors</v>

28
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>and the community safety bulletin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really a little stroke of genius,</v>

29
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people are going to watch that.</v>

30
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>And then one of the most underhanded </v>
<v Speaker 1>things they did,</v>

31
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

32
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.603
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can't really tell by looking </v>

33
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:32.751
<v Speaker 1>at the poster because I look kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry there and it looks like exactly.</v>

34
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to choose something off there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

35
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.073
<v Speaker 1>but what's really interesting about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that that picture was taken at a </v>

36
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.890
<v Speaker 1>rally that I spoke out in favor of free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>

37
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was invited to speak at.</v>

38
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.333
<v Speaker 1>And during the rally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same kind of activist who put up </v>

39
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.473
<v Speaker 1>this poster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took the mic and shut off the PA system </v>

40
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>and blasted everyone with white noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in order to be heard,</v>

41
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.430
<v Speaker 1>I had to raise my voice a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they took a picture.</v>

42
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:03.264
<v Speaker 1>So really here I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they baby to essentially made it </v>

43
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>impossible for me to speak unless I </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoke very loudly and so that's what I'm</v>

44
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:12.234
<v Speaker 1>doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they actually took a picture of me </v>

45
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.280
<v Speaker 1>reacting appropriately in the situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>to provocation from them to make me look</v>

46
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

47
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.033
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

48
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

49
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:24.980
<v Speaker 1>like an angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

50
00:02:24.981 --> 00:02:27.570
<v Speaker 1>like an angry guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you just want to,</v>

51
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.870
<v Speaker 1>you want to round up some minorities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look of it.</v>

52
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is some impressive propaganda,</v>

53
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>mean genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

54
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impressive.</v>

55
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:41.220
<v Speaker 1>It's disturbing that people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be so consciously manipulative.</v>
