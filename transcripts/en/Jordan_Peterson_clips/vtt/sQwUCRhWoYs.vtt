1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something I learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Hitler,</v>

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.850
<v Speaker 1>which really I haven't recovered from my</v>
<v Speaker 1>shock from this,</v>

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>so we've been looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between political belief in</v>

4
00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

5
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 1>and your political belief is strongly </v>
<v Speaker 1>determined by your temperament.</v>

6
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>So liberal left types are high in trait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness,</v>

7
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>that's creativity and low in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

8
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:19.674
<v Speaker 1>but you can fragment conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>up into industriousness and orderliness </v>

9
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.770
<v Speaker 1>and the real predictor for conservatism </v>
<v Speaker 1>is an orderliness,</v>

10
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:27.840
<v Speaker 1>not industriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might think,</v>

11
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>well that's no surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right wingers are more orderly,</v>

12
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.400
<v Speaker 1>hence Hitler's call for order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

13
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's one thing to to to posit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and another thing to measure it.</v>

14
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.403
<v Speaker 1>Now it's measurable and it appears that </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness is associated with </v>

15
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity to discussed and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a really big deal.</v>

16
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a really big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a paper that was published in</v>

17
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:49.584
<v Speaker 1>Plos one about three years ago looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the relationship between the </v>

18
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:53.814
<v Speaker 1>prevalence of infectious diseases and </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian political attitudes and </v>

19
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>they did it country by country and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>within countries by state or province,</v>

20
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.213
<v Speaker 1>and the correlation between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevalence of infectious diseases and </v>

21
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian slash right wing political</v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs.</v>

22
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>At the local individual level was point </v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

23
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>and so I want to take this apart a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

24
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the idea is that this is part of what</v>

25
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:17.694
<v Speaker 1>you might describe as the extended </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral immune system and one of the </v>

26
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:21.294
<v Speaker 1>problems with the interactions between </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups of human beings in our </v>

27
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary past was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well exactly what happened to the native</v>

28
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:27.684
<v Speaker 1>Americans is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came out and shook hands with the </v>

29
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Spanish can keystone doors and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>within a couple of generations,</v>

30
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>90 percent of them were dead of smallpox</v>
<v Speaker 1>and measles and mumps.</v>

31
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:36.714
<v Speaker 1>And so it's been a truism in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary past that if you meet a </v>

32
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 1>group of isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a group of isolated humans and</v>

33
00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:46.860
<v Speaker 1>you meet another group of isolated </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans and you trade pathogens,</v>

34
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.723
<v Speaker 1>there's a real possibility that you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone you know are going to be dead </v>

35
00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:51.324
<v Speaker 1>in no time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we have a disgust mechanism that </v>

36
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>that produces this implicit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it racist,</v>

37
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Speaker 1>racial and ethnic bias.</v>

38
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>That is part and parcel of the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive landscape.</v>

39
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:04.734
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>rooted in a disgust mechanism that </v>

40
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>actually serve as a protective function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

41
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.253
<v Speaker 1>when I was sorting this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading Hitler's table talk and </v>

42
00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Hitler's table talk is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting book.</v>

43
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:15.624
<v Speaker 1>It's a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a book of his spontaneous mealtime </v>

44
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:19.164
<v Speaker 1>utterances from 1939 to 1942.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went through with this new </v>

45
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:24.024
<v Speaker 1>knowledge because people think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives as like or fascist as </v>

46
00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:29.100
<v Speaker 1>afraid of those who are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not afraid,</v>

47
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>they're disgusted and that's not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing because you burn things,</v>

48
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:33.624
<v Speaker 1>you're disgusted by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was terrifying to me to read </v>

49
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>it because then I also thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well disgust,</v>

50
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:39.624
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity is associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness and you need order in a </v>

51
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:43.074
<v Speaker 1>society in order to maintain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Germans are very orderly and </v>

52
00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>that was actually a canonical part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their civilization.</v>

53
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:48.684
<v Speaker 1>And part of actually what makes them </v>
<v Speaker 1>great and powerful and that just had to </v>

54
00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>tilt a little farther than necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden everything needed to</v>

55
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:57.780
<v Speaker 1>be get cleaned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

56
00:02:57.781 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Hitler talked about cleanliness all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and he actually meant</v>

57
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this thing that's emerging,</v>

58
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talked about its biological basis,</v>

59
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 2>it's evolutionary basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

60
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:07.384
<v Speaker 2>it's part of this deeply rooted disgust </v>
<v Speaker 2>system that protects us from dangerous </v>

61
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:11.794
<v Speaker 2>pathogens that can manifest itself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and does manifest itself in the </v>

62
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 2>political realm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>

63
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know exactly how to tease </v>
<v Speaker 2>this apart,</v>

64
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.034
<v Speaker 2>but I agree with your point about </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an actual danger when </v>

65
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:24.334
<v Speaker 2>populations meet like a literal pathogen</v>
<v Speaker 2>danger and that that is liable to have </v>

66
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:32.590
<v Speaker 2>produced a certain instinctive fear of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the other,</v>

67
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't have to be limited to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing,</v>

68
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:35.884
<v Speaker 2>but that's enough to generate a </v>
<v Speaker 2>selective force that would cause a </v>

69
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 2>certain reluctance to meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I want,</v>

70
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.413
<v Speaker 2>I want to point out that at least in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>West and probably universally human </v>

71
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:48.184
<v Speaker 2>beings when they go to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to dehumanize the other population </v>

72
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.923
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so of course calling the other </v>

73
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.670
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subhuman,</v>

74
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.250
<v Speaker 2>vermin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is that,</v>

75
00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.433
<v Speaker 2>that human beings do.</v>

76
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.483
<v Speaker 2>And my concern is that we are doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly this with the Nazis are defacto </v>

77
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.230
<v Speaker 2>Nazis who were showing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

78
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.470
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

79
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.363
<v Speaker 2>on our screens at this point that what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we are doing is we are comforting </v>

80
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 2>ourselves by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

81
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:17.140
<v Speaker 2>that's a small outbreak of something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes these people subhuman,</v>

82
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 2>justifies punching them or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

83
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:20.344
<v Speaker 2>I'm not squeamish about there being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>right to violence when somebody is </v>

84
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 2>threatening a way of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that.</v>

85
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:28.984
<v Speaker 2>But my concern is that if you take the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathogen model and you imagine that all </v>

86
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:37.090
<v Speaker 2>those folks who showed up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlottesville that that is a contagion</v>

87
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.983
<v Speaker 2>and it needs to be isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you will have the sense that as </v>

88
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:40.954
<v Speaker 2>long as you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to show up somewhere </v>

89
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas,</v>

90
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.963
<v Speaker 2>which I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual hazard is that that's </v>

91
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:51.124
<v Speaker 2>actually a latent program that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>served populations in past </v>

92
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 2>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's indefensible,</v>

93
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.243
<v Speaker 2>but it has served populations and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>populations that we come from have it </v>

94
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:04.510
<v Speaker 2>therefore on reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when certain characteristics show up</v>

95
00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:07.120
<v Speaker 2>in the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that program can emerge.</v>

96
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 2>And so my concern is that that's where </v>
<v Speaker 2>we are in history,</v>

97
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:13.120
<v Speaker 2>can't be isolated as a phenomena that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with the other.</v>
