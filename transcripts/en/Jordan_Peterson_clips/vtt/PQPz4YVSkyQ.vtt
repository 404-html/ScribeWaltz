00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Any tips on avoiding booze?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>that's a real tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>I would say a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a drug.</v>

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.963
<v Speaker 1>If you're a binge drinker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a drug called naltrexone that </v>

5
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:14.930
<v Speaker 1>you could consider and you take </v>
<v Speaker 1>naltrexone every day.</v>

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.780
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really have any psychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on you,</v>

7
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.220
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a nail trucks don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>respond.</v>

8
00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:21.054
<v Speaker 1>Or what will happen is that it will </v>
<v Speaker 1>dampen your positive response to </v>

9
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some people who are alcoholic,</v>

10
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>many of them have a very pronounced </v>
<v Speaker 1>opiate is uh,</v>

11
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.513
<v Speaker 1>an opiate effect from alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's mediated by Beta </v>

12
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>endorphin and now trucks into is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opiate blocker.</v>

13
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.173
<v Speaker 1>what naltrexone seems to do is dampen </v>
<v Speaker 1>the positive response and the positive </v>

15
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:47.274
<v Speaker 1>response which would be opiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then dopaminergic is the same </v>

16
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>response that makes you want to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking when you start drinking.</v>

17
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>So if you're one of those people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a drink and then has to have another</v>

18
00:00:57.571 --> 00:00:58.404
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then has to have another one and you </v>

19
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soon all your money's gone.</v>

20
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Then the probability that you have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opiate response is pretty high.</v>

21
00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:07.450
<v Speaker 1>And now trucks can help with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>generally when people take Naltrexone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nick,</v>

23
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>keep drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to control but to keep drinking</v>

24
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>it and they learn over time that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol doesn't have the same punch,</v>

25
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.023
<v Speaker 1>still pleasant but doesn't have the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming punch than it did at one </v>

26
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:23.730
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be one suggestion.</v>

27
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>And it's worth drawing the other reasons</v>
<v Speaker 1>like makeup plan,</v>

28
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:29.780
<v Speaker 1>I would say do the future authoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>

29
00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:30.614
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't that you're trying to </v>

30
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>avoid booze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

31
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>It's that you're trying to restructure </v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole life,</v>

32
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.313
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're a drinker than all </v>

33
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:39.804
<v Speaker 1>your friends are drinkers and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're used to drinking in every </v>

34
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:43.494
<v Speaker 1>social situation and the places that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to socialize or places that you </v>

35
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:47.634
<v Speaker 1>drank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tim,</v>

36
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 1>like it's really built in as a whole set</v>
<v Speaker 1>of habits.</v>

37
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>And so what you have to do is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>redesign your life.</v>

38
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>And you have to think of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just stop drinking.</v>

39
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out what you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to start doing instead of drinking.</v>

40
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.903
<v Speaker 1>There's a hole that you have to fill in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know the future authoring </v>

41
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:06.984
<v Speaker 1>program will also helped you figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what your life could look like in the </v>

42
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:10.404
<v Speaker 1>absence of alcohol and what kind of Hell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could end up being if you keep </v>

43
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:19.410
<v Speaker 1>drinking and it causes all the problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it can cause and I think you really</v>

44
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:20.244
<v Speaker 1>need to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to think through the hell that </v>

45
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:23.514
<v Speaker 1>can occur and you have to think through </v>
<v Speaker 1>how your life could be valuable without </v>

46
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.980
<v Speaker 1>alcohol so that you can be motivated </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to to try to,</v>

47
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.233
<v Speaker 1>to regulate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say if you fail and </v>

48
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:36.684
<v Speaker 1>slip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't berate yourself and beat yourself </v>

49
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:39.570
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

50
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.403
<v Speaker 1>Just start quitting again because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know if you can cut your alcohol intake </v>

51
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>down 75 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of lot better than zero.</v>

52
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.563
<v Speaker 1>And often people go all or nothing just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they do with their quitting </v>

53
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes and she quit for a month and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then have a cigarette and say,</v>

54
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:57.780
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm now I've broken the pact.</v>

55
00:02:57.781 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll smoke a whole pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd be smoking again.</v>

56
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.833
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just decide that you slept and </v>

57
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:05.224
<v Speaker 1>that you're going gonna get back on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wagon again and now it can take a long </v>

58
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:09.514
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do believe that you need a better </v>

59
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 1>vision of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

60
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.833
<v Speaker 1>You have to find something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better than alcohol and that might </v>

61
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>take some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some real consideration,</v>

62
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>especially if alcohol is a very potent </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug for you.</v>

63
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.960
<v Speaker 1>Then I would also say don't hesitate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>try the NALTREXONE.</v>

64
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.853
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got a pretty decent clinical </v>

65
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 1>history and it's basically harmless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
