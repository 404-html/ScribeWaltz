1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.903
<v Speaker 1>It's really useful to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are actual reasons why people see </v>

2
00:00:04.661 --> 00:00:05.494
<v Speaker 1>the world differently and that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>just easily say that one is right and </v>

3
00:00:08.351 --> 00:00:11.680
<v Speaker 1>the other is wrong because the liberals </v>
<v Speaker 1>are correct when it comes to borders,</v>

4
00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:14.710
<v Speaker 1>that if you thicken them too much and </v>
<v Speaker 1>diminish the information flow,</v>

5
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:15.783
<v Speaker 1>you risk making the society so static </v>
<v Speaker 1>that any radical environmental </v>

6
00:00:19.211 --> 00:00:21.820
<v Speaker 1>transformation will sink it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the case,</v>

7
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.803
<v Speaker 1>but the conservatives are right in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you pay a big price with regards to </v>

8
00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:26.584
<v Speaker 1>newcomers and new information with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to risk to exposure to </v>

9
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.900
<v Speaker 1>contaminating while to contamination </v>
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>

10
00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:35.650
<v Speaker 1>but also to contaminating ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I've always thought,</v>

11
00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:36.484
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

12
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.400
<v Speaker 1>the environment itself moves back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth like a snake in some sense.</v>

13
00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:43.480
<v Speaker 1>And what we're trying to do is stay on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the center of its back.</v>

14
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.940
<v Speaker 1>And the only way we can do that is by </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

15
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.830
<v Speaker 1>by having people pull to the right and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

16
00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:48.520
<v Speaker 1>be careful.</v>

17
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.410
<v Speaker 1>And people pull to the left and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

18
00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:55.411
<v Speaker 1>but be open with that dialogue and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exchange of information that,</v>

19
00:00:55.631 --> 00:00:56.464
<v Speaker 1>that dialogue allows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can maybe specify the center of that </v>

20
00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:03.280
<v Speaker 1>moving target and stay and stay well and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay on the back.</v>

21
00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

22
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.873
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a really complicated metaphor </v>

23
00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:06.374
<v Speaker 1>with the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's a perfect way in to </v>

24
00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:11.840
<v Speaker 1>what's going on on campus and to why </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint diversity is so important.</v>

25
00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree exactly with what you just said.</v>

26
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.853
<v Speaker 1>And so what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the view that I've come to in studying </v>

27
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.290
<v Speaker 1>moral psychology is that we is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans are ultra social apes.</v>

28
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

29
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.380
<v Speaker 1>we evolved to live in these small groups</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are fighting with each other.</v>

30
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.663
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we evolve to have these low level </v>

31
00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:36.140
<v Speaker 1>animistic religions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's our steady state.</v>

32
00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:39.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the way we were for at least a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred thousand years are much more,</v>

33
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably closer to million in some form.</v>

34
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's sort of our design.</v>

35
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.290
<v Speaker 1>That's what we were designed for in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

36
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.573
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in that sense were as individuals </v>

37
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.660
<v Speaker 1>really kind of stupid tribal creatures </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to do post hoc reasoning.</v>

38
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.913
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you put us together in the right </v>

39
00:01:56.781 --> 00:01:59.690
<v Speaker 1>way with the right checks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the right,</v>

40
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.940
<v Speaker 1>the right systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

41
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.180
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole can be vastly smarter than the</v>

42
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.073
<v Speaker 1>components that go into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is true of the brain to the brain </v>

43
00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:09.194
<v Speaker 1>is composed of neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each neuron is really kind of stupid </v>

44
00:02:10.641 --> 00:02:11.474
<v Speaker 1>little switch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you put them together in the right </v>

45
00:02:12.921 --> 00:02:14.660
<v Speaker 1>way and you get something really </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>

46
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.610
<v Speaker 1>And in the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

47
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.473
<v Speaker 1>I don't know all the history here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my understanding is that science </v>

48
00:02:19.821 --> 00:02:20.654
<v Speaker 1>begins or the culture of science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientific revolution begins in </v>

49
00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Europe in the 17th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you begin getting,</v>

50
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.400
<v Speaker 1>you get the printing press so people can</v>
<v Speaker 1>share their ideas,</v>

51
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.460
<v Speaker 1>but you get communities of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are challenging each other's ideas.</v>

52
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.713
<v Speaker 1>And that's what makes it so brilliant is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is that people have to do their </v>

53
00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:39.734
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're really bad at this confirming our </v>

54
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:41.924
<v Speaker 1>own ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to make it very hard to </v>

55
00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:44.054
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you put your ideas out there and </v>

56
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:47.720
<v Speaker 1>then everyone else is motivated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge them.</v>

57
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.330
<v Speaker 1>And so if you put us together in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right way,</v>

58
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.223
<v Speaker 1>the truth comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so adversarial systems of law </v>

59
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.090
<v Speaker 1>journalists know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to listen to both sides.</v>

60
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Scientists know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social scientists should know this.</v>

61
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

62
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.513
<v Speaker 1>the academy has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has always leaned left in the 20th </v>

64
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but leaning isn't the problem.</v>

65
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 1>So people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

66
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint diversity we need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need everybody.</v>

67
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 1>We need Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need every view.</v>

68
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't need everybody.</v>

69
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>What we need is no orthodoxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's fatal orthodoxy.</v>

70
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.010
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have to feel it like sociology or</v>

71
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>social psychology in which it's two or </v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

72
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one left to right,</v>

73
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.383
<v Speaker 1>that's totally fine with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's totally fine because if someone </v>

74
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>makes some claim that's just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologically blind,</v>

75
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>someone will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

76
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>common sense,</v>

77
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>other evidence that you've missed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the system works.</v>

78
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.843
<v Speaker 1>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I learned when I started down this </v>

79
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:45.004
<v Speaker 1>road in 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave a talk at the big conference of </v>

80
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:48.214
<v Speaker 1>social psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave a talk about this problem that </v>

81
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:51.304
<v Speaker 1>we're losing our diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I could only find one conservative </v>

82
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 1>and the entire field and they gave a </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk on this.</v>

83
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

84
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.383
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what I've learned since then is </v>

85
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:09.001
<v Speaker 1>that the ratio in psychology was between</v>
<v Speaker 1>two to one and four to one left,</v>

86
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the way up to the early nineties.</v>

87
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 1>We've gathered together all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies we could find.</v>

88
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:14.860
<v Speaker 1>So all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to the early nineties,</v>

89
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>it's only three or four to one left to </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

90
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:18.360
<v Speaker 1>which would be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

91
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.430
<v Speaker 1>but then between 1995 or four and 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes to a 14 to one.</v>

92
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.223
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have any idea why and why that </v>

93
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:29.290
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

94
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

95
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.140
<v Speaker 1>so you get the same story.</v>

96
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Whether you look at Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrat ratios or liberal conservative,</v>

97
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tell the same story.</v>

98
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.163
<v Speaker 1>So the two of the big things going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are one is that the greatest </v>

99
00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which had a lot of Republicans,</v>

100
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of men go off to World War II.</v>

101
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.283
<v Speaker 1>They are there on the Gi bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They entered the academy in the 1950s a </v>

102
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 1>lot of them are conservative or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican.</v>

103
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have a lot of them.</v>

104
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.653
<v Speaker 1>But in the sixties and seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the main reasons to go to Grad </v>

105
00:04:57.971 --> 00:04:58.804
<v Speaker 1>school and the social sciences is either</v>
<v Speaker 1>a to stay in school to escape the </v>

106
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam war draft or be to fight for </v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice and against racism.</v>

107
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.970
<v Speaker 1>So in sociology and psychology in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular in political science,</v>

108
00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:10.804
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure you get a huge influx of </v>

109
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 1>left leaning people who are there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue social justice.</v>

110
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.703
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the motives are fine and if it was </v>

111
00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 1>balanced and be totally fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as you get these young junior people</v>

112
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:25.084
<v Speaker 1>on the left come in in the 70s and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties and then you get the older </v>

113
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:28.840
<v Speaker 1>people that are more politically </v>
<v Speaker 1>balanced,</v>

114
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:30.280
<v Speaker 1>retiring in the eighties and nineties.</v>

115
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.170
<v Speaker 1>By the time you get to the late </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>

116
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.220
<v Speaker 1>it's all baby boomers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so do you get a,</v>

117
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 1>you get a positive feedback loop </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing in there.</v>

118
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like three to one.</v>

119
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>It's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe when it hits four to one,</v>

120
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:43.700
<v Speaker 1>it goes to like 20 to one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you stay.</v>

121
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>

122
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.870
<v Speaker 1>so then you start getting hostile </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate.</v>

123
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.720
<v Speaker 1>So I wrote a review paper on this with </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

124
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.880
<v Speaker 1>with Joe Duarte and Phil tetlock and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lead Justin,</v>

125
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.440
<v Speaker 1>jared Crawford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

126
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

127
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>

128
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:58.723
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we reviewed everything that we could </v>

129
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>find and we concluded that most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on is self selection.</v>

130
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>That is people on the left are more open</v>
<v Speaker 1>to experience.</v>

131
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>They're always going to get self </v>
<v Speaker 1>selection.</v>

132
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>But then there's really good evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's also hostile climate.</v>

133
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.153
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's undeniable now that if you are not </v>

134
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:15.974
<v Speaker 1>on the left in a Grad program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just constant little subtle or </v>

135
00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 1>not so subtle reminders that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>belong.</v>

136
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 1>And look in the academy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all about saying,</v>

137
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.033
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there are subtle hints here and </v>

138
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:27.620
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't succeed.</v>

139
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.161
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

140
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>that's what we do for a living is we say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little things will stop people.</v>

141
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.781
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

142
00:06:32.781 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>little things are put in the way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone who doesn't fit politically.</v>

143
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you do get hostile climate.</v>

144
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.890
<v Speaker 1>You do get over discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's evidence of that.</v>
