1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.160
<v Speaker 1>The case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is practically speaking,</v>

2
00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:03.994
<v Speaker 1>is that it is not at all unreasonable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of God the father as the spirit </v>

3
00:00:08.861 --> 00:00:11.860
<v Speaker 1>that arises from the crowd that exists </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the future.</v>

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.113
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's we talked about that in </v>

5
00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:16.540
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the idea of sacrifice at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least a little bit more,</v>

6
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.610
<v Speaker 1>or we're going to make sacrifices in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>present so that the future is happy with</v>

7
00:00:21.611 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

8
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:25.770
<v Speaker 1>what is that future that would be happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you?</v>

9
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.580
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit of humanity.</v>

10
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.503
<v Speaker 1>That's who you're negotiating with </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you make the assumption that if </v>

11
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>you forgo impulsive pleasure and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>your medical degree,</v>

12
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 1>that when you're done in 10 years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a physician,</v>

13
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.363
<v Speaker 1>humanity as such will honor your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice and commitment and open the </v>

14
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:47.170
<v Speaker 1>doors to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

15
00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:48.004
<v Speaker 1>So you're treating the future as if it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a single being and you're also treating </v>

16
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:54.160
<v Speaker 1>it as if it's some something like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate judge.</v>

17
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.143
<v Speaker 1>You're acting that out and maybe we had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to imagine God in that form before we </v>

18
00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:03.360
<v Speaker 1>could understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once we started to understand that there</v>

19
00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:04.194
<v Speaker 1>was a future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps we had to imagine God in that </v>

20
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:06.654
<v Speaker 1>form in order to concretize something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we could bargain with so that we </v>

21
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:10.644
<v Speaker 1>could figure out how to use sacrifice to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to guide ourselves into </v>

22
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>the future because as sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a contract with the future,</v>

23
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a contract with any </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular person,</v>

24
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:19.434
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a contract with the spirit of </v>

25
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:23.190
<v Speaker 1>humanity as such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that,</v>

26
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.443
<v Speaker 1>and so when you think about it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that should make you faint with </v>

27
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.863
<v Speaker 1>amazement because that is such a bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing idea to come up with that idea </v>

28
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 1>that you can bargain with the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is some idea,</v>

29
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

30
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>that's like the major idea of human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of humankind.</v>

31
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>We suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we do about it?</v>

32
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>We figured out how to bargain with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future and we minimize suffering in that</v>

33
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:45.234
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like no other animal does that </v>

34
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:47.101
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

35
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:48.630
<v Speaker 1>like the lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just eat everything.</v>

36
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>I think a wolf can eat 40 pounds of meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a single city.</v>

37
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's some meat,</v>

38
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:54.384
<v Speaker 1>eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like save some mammoth for </v>

39
00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

40
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a wolf thing,</v>

41
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a human thing and that might mean</v>

42
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>you have to be hungry today or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a farmer,</v>

43
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several thousand years ago,</v>

44
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:07.404
<v Speaker 1>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago or so with agriculture first </v>

45
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:09.624
<v Speaker 1>got going and you're starving to death </v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for the spring planting and you </v>

46
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>think we built it bloody well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better not eat those seeds.</v>

47
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.453
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really something to be able </v>

48
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:20.180
<v Speaker 1>to control yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make the future real,</v>

49
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.320
<v Speaker 1>to put off what you could use today and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not just in some impulsive manner,</v>

50
00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:26.180
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe your kids are starving to death.</v>

51
00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:27.014
<v Speaker 1>You think we are not touching the seeds </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we need for the future and for </v>

52
00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:31.874
<v Speaker 1>human beings to have discovered that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then to also have figured out that we </v>

53
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:35.450
<v Speaker 1>could bargain with the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

54
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:37.970
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something and I think that that.</v>

55
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.060
<v Speaker 1>I think that the stories that are laid </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in this book actually describe,</v>

56
00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:43.310
<v Speaker 1>at least in part the process by which </v>
<v Speaker 1>that occurred.</v>
