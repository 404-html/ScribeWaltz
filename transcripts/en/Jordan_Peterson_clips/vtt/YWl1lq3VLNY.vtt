00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.310
<v Speaker 1>How do you pick up knowledge of how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>act well,</v>

2
00:00:02.311 --> 00:00:04.770
<v Speaker 1>that's not quite as explicit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as easy to figure out,</v>

3
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you know the children up a lot</v>

4
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.423
<v Speaker 1>of information by modeling behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically a copy adults and </v>

5
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:12.234
<v Speaker 1>that basically means they watched adults</v>
<v Speaker 1>act with their body through space and </v>

6
00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>they duplicate those patterns of action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you generalize from them?</v>

7
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.553
<v Speaker 1>So that's one way behavioral wisdom is </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmitting something that is explicit </v>

8
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:23.124
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in terms of the receipt of </v>

9
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:25.254
<v Speaker 1>rewards and punishments because parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>will modulate their children's behavior </v>

10
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.130
<v Speaker 1>by engaging and motivationally </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant interactions with them.</v>

11
00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>At least that's what you should do if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a parent.</v>

12
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>That's your primary responsibility in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

13
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.940
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we mean when we say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're paying attention to someone.</v>

14
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.793
<v Speaker 1>That basically means that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>modulating your behavior with your </v>

15
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your emotions.</v>

16
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.353
<v Speaker 1>So like a child will monitor or parallel</v>
<v Speaker 1>marcher is child would react positively </v>

17
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>when something that the parent wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen happens and negatively.</v>

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>When something happens with the parent </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to happen.</v>

19
00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>So the child's behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's just classical reinforcement</v>

20
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:02.694
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically you exchanged rewards and </v>

21
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:06.840
<v Speaker 1>punishments and threats and promises and</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

22
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>We do that all the time in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal interactions.</v>

23
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.633
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the reason why people </v>
<v Speaker 1>with personality disorders can sort of </v>

24
00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:14.274
<v Speaker 1>have an uncanny effect on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say if you're a personality </v>

25
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:18.384
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a really potent expectation </v>

26
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:20.784
<v Speaker 1>about how someone else will behave </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually like a son of a bitch </v>

27
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:24.324
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if someone with a personality </v>

28
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:26.994
<v Speaker 1>disorder encountered someone who doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk like that and they're a challenge </v>

29
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:30.054
<v Speaker 1>to their belief system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people with personality disorders are </v>

30
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>extremely good at turning everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They meet into the same person that they</v>

31
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:37.440
<v Speaker 1>already met and they do that.</v>

32
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 1>I think by exchanging very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very subtle and covert reinforcements,</v>

33
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.863
<v Speaker 1>which is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're engaged with me and I have a </v>

34
00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>personality disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you act properly,</v>

35
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.153
<v Speaker 1>I'll ignore you or say something </v>
<v Speaker 1>contemptuous or look away or do </v>

36
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>something quite subtle and every time </v>
<v Speaker 1>you act like a miserable bastard,</v>

37
00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:52.914
<v Speaker 1>which is nice to expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll at least pay some attention and </v>

38
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>possibly even reinforced you covertly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll find if you get close to me,</v>

39
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like you'd been distorted by</v>

40
00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:01.714
<v Speaker 1>a gravitational field as you paid your </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts getting pulled in strange </v>

41
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:04.824
<v Speaker 1>directions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do that to each other all the time </v>

42
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things you might consider</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

43
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.793
<v Speaker 1>these are very large.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all engaged in these patterns of </v>

44
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:20.180
<v Speaker 1>mutually modifying interactions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>something emerges from that stable.</v>

45
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.113
<v Speaker 1>I guess I would say that the things I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to teach you about mythology or </v>

46
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:25.824
<v Speaker 1>the things that I do as stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerging properties from risk from </v>

47
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>centuries of reciprocal interaction.</v>

48
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.873
<v Speaker 1>So if we're engaged in some pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to notify me and I'm going </v>

49
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:36.644
<v Speaker 1>to modify you and neither of us really </v>
<v Speaker 1>know precisely what that means because </v>

50
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>we're not conscious of all the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we do everything.</v>

51
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's just been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's bad.</v>

52
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Not if there's only two of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it was like 50 of us will,</v>

53
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:48.174
<v Speaker 1>then you can imagine the calculating all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the permutations of the interactions </v>

54
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.283
<v Speaker 1>become virtually impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Point is we will settle into some sort </v>

55
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:55.884
<v Speaker 1>of stable configuration or disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the options and that human </v>

56
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>societies do settle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>settle into stable configuration,</v>

57
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>so we don't really understand how that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>

58
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.193
<v Speaker 1>but we we have developed the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe those configurations without </v>

59
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.953
<v Speaker 1>understanding of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that makes up a big part of </v>

60
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:16.204
<v Speaker 1>mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stories we tell ourselves about how </v>

61
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:19.774
<v Speaker 1>we behave when we don't know how or even</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you things to consider in the </v>

62
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.113
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
