1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.800
<v Speaker 1>It's our shared apprehensions about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>implications of situations for behaviors</v>

2
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.173
<v Speaker 1>that constitute our cultures and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>those shared maps that bring </v>

3
00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:13.640
<v Speaker 1>predictability to our interpersonal </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>

4
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.653
<v Speaker 1>You can only understand that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what the world is like when </v>

5
00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:18.194
<v Speaker 1>it's not predictable and it's difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand that for water and people </v>

6
00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:22.964
<v Speaker 1>who live in peaceful times because our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is so successful at regulating </v>

7
00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:29.450
<v Speaker 1>our interpersonal behavior and even the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment for that matter,</v>

8
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.463
<v Speaker 1>but we hardly ever encounter a situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>where anything remotely unpredictable </v>

9
00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:34.574
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can't tell what it's like to be </v>

10
00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:37.670
<v Speaker 1>faced with something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable,</v>

11
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.863
<v Speaker 1>so you don't know what it's like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in an environment where it </v>

12
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.773
<v Speaker 1>doesn't rain because you're part of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful community in your </v>

13
00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:46.000
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily well protected it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.980
<v Speaker 1>you're like a a boy that lives inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>the castle.</v>

15
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.880
<v Speaker 1>You can't see over the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't even know that they're there.</v>

16
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.900
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of terrible things </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the castle,</v>

17
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:56.510
<v Speaker 1>but everything inside is peaceful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the world.</v>

18
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.043
<v Speaker 1>The boy has no idea what he would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like if we went outside into the real </v>

19
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:01.094
<v Speaker 1>world where things were actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable because he's only had a </v>

20
00:01:02.871 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>chance to observe his behavior under </v>
<v Speaker 1>stable conditions.</v>

21
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Wherever that is predictable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable.</v>

22
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.680
<v Speaker 1>It's even worse now in a sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better the way to.</v>

23
00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:16.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is peaceful now anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even compared to 15 years ago,</v>

24
00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:18.674
<v Speaker 1>there's much less ideological dispute in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world about how the conduct is fair </v>

25
00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:26.090
<v Speaker 1>is then there was staying in the mid </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies when people are more or less.</v>

26
00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:27.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know there's exceptions to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

27
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:30.560
<v Speaker 1>but people the world over half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less accepted in this desk,</v>

28
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.420
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a market economy,</v>

29
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.493
<v Speaker 1>there aren't very many ideologies that </v>
<v Speaker 1>appear attractive even in the </v>

30
00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:37.064
<v Speaker 1>imagination in contrast to to Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>style democracies and I mean that's a </v>

31
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.640
<v Speaker 1>pretty recent occurrence and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlikely to last for any great length of</v>

32
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:44.474
<v Speaker 1>time I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is peaceful now that the fact </v>

33
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:52.550
<v Speaker 1>that that piece makes it even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult for us to either to understand</v>

34
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>ourselves or to be sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated.</v>

35
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.333
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kind of just also because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are going really well and </v>

36
00:01:57.711 --> 00:01:58.544
<v Speaker 1>everything's predictable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you presume that you know what </v>

37
00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:01.580
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

38
00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:02.414
<v Speaker 1>that's the basis on which you base your </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgments about whether you know what </v>

39
00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:06.794
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you perform a procedure and what you </v>

40
00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:10.250
<v Speaker 1>predicted it occurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

41
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.340
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean you know everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as far as you're concerned,</v>

42
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:14.174
<v Speaker 1>that's sufficient.</v>
