00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.953
<v Speaker 1>What is your advice for finding a sane </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound therapist and do you think a </v>

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.873
<v Speaker 1>fruitful psychotherapeutic relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>requires a therapist to have specific </v>

3
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:09.714
<v Speaker 1>temperamental compatibility or even </v>
<v Speaker 1>literacy and interests that align with </v>

4
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:15.360
<v Speaker 1>the patient?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.283
<v Speaker 1>I would say with regards to finding a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sane and sound therapists there some </v>

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>practical things you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.763
<v Speaker 1>I guess this is more relevant if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in North America and I'm not sure </v>

8
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 1>exactly what the training requirements </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in other places in the world,</v>

9
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:33.081
<v Speaker 1>but your best bet I would say is to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who is appropriately trained and</v>

10
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.463
<v Speaker 1>I would regard someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriately trained as a </v>

11
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.343
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapist to be someone who's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're safer if you go with </v>

12
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:42.624
<v Speaker 1>someone who's trained at one of the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>research schools and you have a </v>

13
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:45.624
<v Speaker 1>therapist who's well versed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapeutic practice but who's </v>

14
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:50.394
<v Speaker 1>also sufficiently educated </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientifically to be able to understand </v>

15
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>the scientific literature and you can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty certain of that.</v>

16
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.330
<v Speaker 1>If you find a therapist who's got their </v>
<v Speaker 1>phd rather than us id.</v>

17
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Not that there's anything necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with ids.</v>

18
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>If they had received their phd from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>American Psychological Association,</v>

19
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:11.244
<v Speaker 1>Approved School of Clinical Psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those schools operate under what's </v>

20
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 1>called the bolder model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the boulder model is promotes,</v>

21
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

22
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:21.534
<v Speaker 1>science practitioner as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the optimal ideal combination for a </v>

23
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So someone who's trained,</v>

24
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapeutic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also has research experience and can</v>

25
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:35.430
<v Speaker 1>understand the relevant scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature as it pertains to,</v>

26
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 1>to mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the first thing.</v>

27
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 1>The second thing I would say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>well go to see a psychotherapist once </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe go to see a couple of them and</v>

29
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.460
<v Speaker 1>find someone that listens to you because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychotherapist shouldn't be someone</v>

30
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:57.300
<v Speaker 1>who solves your problems for you or </v>
<v Speaker 1>offers even really offers you advice.</v>

31
00:01:57.301 --> 00:01:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Although sometimes that can be helpful.</v>

32
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.413
<v Speaker 1>Really what the psychotherapists should </v>
<v Speaker 1>do is be someone who can help you </v>

33
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:04.164
<v Speaker 1>understand what problem it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're facing so that that can be </v>

34
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>delineated properly to help you </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate what it is that you want.</v>

35
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:13.700
<v Speaker 1>So what your vision of mental health </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be in,</v>

36
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>and what you'd like to attain in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy.</v>

37
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.380
<v Speaker 1>And then who helps you strategize </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards that end.</v>

38
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>And so you want someone who will really </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to you,</v>

39
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>that you feel comfortable telling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth too,</v>

40
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>because that's also incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

41
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>If you can't tell you a psychotherapist </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth,</v>

42
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.433
<v Speaker 1>then you're not going to get anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy because you won't be able to </v>

43
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>actually outline the nature of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental problems.</v>

44
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.153
<v Speaker 1>So that's vital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And go see someone and see if you're </v>

45
00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:44.720
<v Speaker 1>happy with the way that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with them.</v>

46
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.790
<v Speaker 1>That's the most relevant issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first question.</v>

47
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.733
<v Speaker 1>Now the next one was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I think a fruitful psychotherapeutic </v>

48
00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 1>relationship requires the therapists to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have specific,</v>

49
00:02:57.691 --> 00:02:58.524
<v Speaker 1>temperamental compatibility or even </v>
<v Speaker 1>literacy and interests that align with </v>

50
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.314
<v Speaker 1>the patient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's difficult to work with the </v>

51
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>therapist who is less intelligent than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

52
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a rough way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing it,</v>

53
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:11.644
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of what a therapist does is </v>
<v Speaker 1>help you strategize and the person has </v>

54
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>to be able to think analytically and </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably at least to some degree,</v>

55
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:22.180
<v Speaker 1>to the same with the same degree of </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity that you're capable of.</v>

56
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily a good idea to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to think your,</v>

57
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.133
<v Speaker 1>your therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So was there ever a time when you saw a </v>

58
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 1>therapist of some kind.</v>
