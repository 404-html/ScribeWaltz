1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I think one thing we should have learned</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the 20th century,</v>

2
00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:03.514
<v Speaker 1>but of course didn't was that there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something extraordinary dangerous about </v>

3
00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:11.170
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian utopian visions at </v>
<v Speaker 1>something Dostoevsky wrote about,</v>

4
00:00:11.171 --> 00:00:14.410
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his great book notes from underground</v>

5
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.273
<v Speaker 1>because Dostoevsky had figured out by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the early 19 hundreds that there was </v>

6
00:00:18.911 --> 00:00:22.330
<v Speaker 1>something very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very pathological about a utopian vision</v>

7
00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:23.164
<v Speaker 1>of perfection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was profoundly anti human and </v>

8
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>and notes and notes from underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He demolishes the notion of Utopia.</v>

9
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.710
<v Speaker 1>One of the things he says that I loved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so brilliant,</v>

10
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.753
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you brought the socialist </v>

11
00:00:35.831 --> 00:00:36.664
<v Speaker 1>utopia into being and dusty FCC says </v>
<v Speaker 1>that human beings had nothing to do </v>

12
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.123
<v Speaker 1>except</v>

13
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.473
<v Speaker 2>eat,</v>

14
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.463
<v Speaker 1>drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and busy themselves with the </v>

15
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:48.204
<v Speaker 1>continuation of the species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that the first thing that would </v>

16
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:53.514
<v Speaker 1>happen under circumstances like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be that human beings would go mad </v>

17
00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:58.674
<v Speaker 1>and break the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smash it just so that something </v>

18
00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:02.214
<v Speaker 1>unexpected and crazy could happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>because human beings don't want Utopian </v>

19
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:07.464
<v Speaker 1>comfort and certainty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want adventure and chaos and </v>

20
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:11.544
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that the very notion of a utopia </v>

21
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 1>was anti human because we're not built </v>
<v Speaker 1>for static utopia.</v>

22
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.513
<v Speaker 1>We're built for a dynamic situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's demands placed on us and </v>

23
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.010
<v Speaker 1>we're the optimal amount of uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

24
00:01:33.371 --> 00:01:34.204
<v Speaker 1>we know what happened in the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century as a consequence of the </v>

25
00:01:36.671 --> 00:01:39.640
<v Speaker 1>widespread promulgation of Utopian </v>
<v Speaker 1>schemes,</v>

26
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.013
<v Speaker 1>and what happened was a ham on a scale </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had never been matched in the </v>

27
00:01:45.941 --> 00:01:46.774
<v Speaker 1>entire history of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's really saying something </v>

28
00:01:49.301 --> 00:01:54.301
<v Speaker 1>because there was plenty of mayhem </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the 20th century.</v>

29
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I guess there wasn't as much industrial </v>
<v Speaker 1>clout behind it.</v>
