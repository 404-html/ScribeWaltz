1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:00.990
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.990
<v Speaker 1>I've gone around and spoken and a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportion of my audience has been young</v>

3
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:07.160
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under 30 something like that.</v>

5
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 1>And I've spoken to them a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

6
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.023
<v Speaker 1>And what's so odd about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this is that of all the things </v>

7
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:19.794
<v Speaker 1>that I've spoken about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I can see the audience and I can </v>

8
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:22.134
<v Speaker 1>feel how the audience is reacting </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm always paying attention to </v>

9
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>all of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in so far as I can manage that.</v>

10
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>So I get some sense of how what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying is landing,</v>

11
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:32.304
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you have to do if you're going to </v>

12
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:35.310
<v Speaker 1>speak effectively to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>

13
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>what happens is if I talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities,</v>

14
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.280
<v Speaker 1>everyone b is silent just like they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

15
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 1>It's silent and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not moving,</v>

16
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Focusing attentive.</v>

17
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.963
<v Speaker 1>Say Pick up your responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up the heaviest thing you can and </v>

18
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:51.384
<v Speaker 1>carry it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the room goes quiet and everybody's </v>

19
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:53.964
<v Speaker 1>eyes open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that always makes me break </v>

20
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

21
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.173
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I was speaking to an </v>

22
00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>English journalist today who's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>write an article in spectator magazine.</v>

23
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about this and at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>point in the discussion the same,</v>

24
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.380
<v Speaker 1>I had the same emotional reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really understand it.</v>

25
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.170
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's something,</v>

26
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 1>there's something about it that's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>crucial because you know,</v>

27
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:28.164
<v Speaker 1>we've been fed this on ending diet of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights and freedoms and there's </v>

28
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:31.974
<v Speaker 1>something about that especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about that that so </v>

29
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>pathologically wrong and people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>starving for the antidote.</v>

30
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:41.550
<v Speaker 1>And the antidote is truth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>

31
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't.</v>

32
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>It isn't because that's what you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

33
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:45.950
<v Speaker 1>And some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.193
<v Speaker 1>in some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some I know better or someone knows </v>

35
00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>better for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you should do.</v>

36
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Since it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that it's that,</v>

37
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>it's that that's the secret to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful life.</v>

38
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.043
<v Speaker 1>And without a meaningful life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all you have is suffering and </v>

39
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 1>nihilism and despair and all of that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>self contempt.</v>

40
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:05.250
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not good.</v>

41
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:06.084
<v Speaker 1>And so the man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary for men to stand up and </v>

42
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:14.751
<v Speaker 1>take responsibility and they all know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and are starving for that message.</v>

43
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:16.734
<v Speaker 1>And the message is more that that's also</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good thing to stand up and take </v>

44
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>responsibility because you're cursed so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much now from,</v>

45
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

46
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.743
<v Speaker 1>from when you're young with this notion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your active engagement with the </v>

47
00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>world is part of what is destroying and </v>
<v Speaker 1>undermining the planet and adding to the</v>

48
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:34.260
<v Speaker 1>tyranny of the social systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

49
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>how about not so much of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

50
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.420
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

51
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.390
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's two soul deadening.</v>

52
00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>It's anti human right to the core.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my sense instead is that,</v>

53
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.103
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

54
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.540
<v Speaker 1>if you were able to reveal the best of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to you in the world,</v>

55
00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>that you would be an overwhelming force </v>
<v Speaker 1>for good.</v>

56
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.273
<v Speaker 1>And that whatever errors might be made </v>
<v Speaker 1>along the way would wash out in the </v>

57
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:57.294
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the other thing that you see </v>

58
00:02:58.171 --> 00:02:59.004
<v Speaker 1>in the abrahamic stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Abraham is not a perfect person </v>

59
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.973
<v Speaker 1>by any stretch of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a real person and he makes </v>

60
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>

61
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:09.150
<v Speaker 1>The overarching narrative is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>maintain your covenant with God and </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite your inadequacies,</v>

63
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>then not only will you prevail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your descendants will prevail.</v>

64
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

65
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>that's really good news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

66
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>So it's been really something to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the,</v>

67
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 1>in the stories.</v>
