00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any advice for someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>may be a sexual,</v>

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.083
<v Speaker 1>I want to have a husband and children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm 27 and haven't felt connection </v>

3
00:00:06.851 --> 00:00:07.684
<v Speaker 1>with anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just seeing everyone as friends so </v>

4
00:00:09.491 --> 00:00:12.940
<v Speaker 1>far in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:15.670
<v Speaker 1>he might want to see a sex therapist </v>
<v Speaker 1>that might help.</v>

6
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the other thing I would say is,</v>

7
00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:19.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.970
<v Speaker 1>it might not be too bad an idea to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.910
<v Speaker 1>act out what you want perhaps in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absence of any necessary desire.</v>

10
00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:28.744
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you might be so far have fallen so </v>

11
00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>far inside yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's very difficult to get out.</v>

12
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the sex therapist would do,</v>

13
00:00:36.371 --> 00:00:37.150
<v Speaker 1>would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.770
<v Speaker 1>once you've written some kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

15
00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:39.604
<v Speaker 1>friendship that you wanted to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward would be to have you guys </v>

16
00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>practice interacting in an intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner,</v>

17
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.960
<v Speaker 1>stage by stage so that you could get </v>
<v Speaker 1>accustomed to it.</v>

18
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.793
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you need to explore whether that's </v>

19
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.100
<v Speaker 1>asexuality as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if it's fear or if it's,</v>

20
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be fear of rejection,</v>

21
00:00:58.931 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>it might be fear of sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be that you're slow to warm up and</v>

22
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.600
<v Speaker 1>introverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think seeing a sex therapist might</v>

23
00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:10.370
<v Speaker 1>not be a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know.</v>

24
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.000
<v Speaker 1>I guess the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I say this with some hesitation,</v>

25
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:16.300
<v Speaker 1>is that if you find someone you liked </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could be friends with,</v>

26
00:01:16.301 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could try.</v>

27
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.663
<v Speaker 1>I'm initiating a romantic relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>and practice it for a couple of months </v>

28
00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:23.074
<v Speaker 1>and see what happens because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'd warm up across time and </v>

29
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>certainly it's certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly a possibility.</v>

30
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.903
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
