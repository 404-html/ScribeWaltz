00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.143
<v Speaker 1>Here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the practical bit of information </v>

2
00:00:02.651 --> 00:00:03.484
<v Speaker 1>for you to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all of you antisocial types who are </v>

3
00:00:05.501 --> 00:00:06.334
<v Speaker 1>going to end up in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're in prison and you want to </v>

4
00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:13.150
<v Speaker 1>go on parole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5
00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:15.640
<v Speaker 1>so you have to go in front of the judge </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tell them why you're not going to do</v>

6
00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:17.230
<v Speaker 1>it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the deal.</v>

7
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.093
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really matter what you did </v>

8
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.510
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't really matter what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>promise.</v>

9
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.440
<v Speaker 1>What matters is whether you see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>judge before lunch or after lunch,</v>

10
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.900
<v Speaker 1>because if you see the judge after </v>
<v Speaker 1>lunch,</v>

11
00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:32.140
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you will get parole</v>
<v Speaker 1>is 60 percent higher.</v>

12
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

13
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.230
<v Speaker 1>That is just like so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never have an argument with your partner</v>

14
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.730
<v Speaker 1>when you're hungry or when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry.</v>

15
00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you want something from </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

16
00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:43.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the sandwich.</v>

17
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 1>They'll eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there'll be happy.</v>

18
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Then you can manipulate them before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before that,</v>

19
00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:49.354
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
