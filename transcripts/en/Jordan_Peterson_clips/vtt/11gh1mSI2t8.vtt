00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Little kids should be doing whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can that's productive and useful as</v>

2
00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:05.094
<v Speaker 1>young as they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have a two year old is just </v>

3
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:07.854
<v Speaker 1>toddling around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you can get that two year old </v>

4
00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:11.770
<v Speaker 1>to set the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We used to have our kids do that.</v>

5
00:00:11.771 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>It's really funny to watch it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the table's like half above their heads.</v>

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.810
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you give the two year old and knife,</v>

7
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.940
<v Speaker 1>not a sharp one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obvious.</v>

8
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.940
<v Speaker 1>That's a different cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can save that for next time.</v>

9
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.751
<v Speaker 1>Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:26.130
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you say,</v>

11
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:26.964
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go put this on the table now they can't </v>

12
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>exactly put it beside the plate because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't see the damn plate,</v>

13
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Speaker 1>but the kids are actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're careful with them and you,</v>

14
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 1>you adjust your expectations to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of developing expertise.</v>

15
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 1>That's called the zone of proximal </v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

16
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 1>By the way there they're more than happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

17
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.813
<v Speaker 1>to comply because it helps them develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and move forward and they have a really </v>

18
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:52.240
<v Speaker 1>powerful instinct for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

19
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.470
<v Speaker 1>And with kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also interesting if you,</v>

20
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.393
<v Speaker 1>if you watch them very carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see when they're ready for the </v>

21
00:00:57.421 --> 00:00:58.880
<v Speaker 1>next task,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>and then also the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:01.764
<v Speaker 1>people talk a lot about self esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very badly conceptualized self </v>

24
00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:06.234
<v Speaker 1>esteem because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll come to me and you should feel </v>

25
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>good about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I don't believe.</v>

26
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I think you should feel good about who </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

27
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>who you could be if you've got your act </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and you shouldn't be feeling so</v>

28
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>good about who you are now and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>story state.</v>

29
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell,</v>

30
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 17.</v>

31
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Don't be feeling too good about </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

32
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.793
<v Speaker 1>Get the hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get your act together and see what you </v>

33
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:27.660
<v Speaker 1>could be and feel good about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>trajectory.</v>

34
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>That's way different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also your competence.</v>

35
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:34.920
<v Speaker 1>And so like even with little kids is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know they're being taken care of.</v>

36
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.813
<v Speaker 1>They have an existential debt to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents is like if you allow them to be </v>

37
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:40.134
<v Speaker 1>useful and encourage them to do things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they get to pay off that </v>

38
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:43.254
<v Speaker 1>existential debt and then they can see </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're contributing members of </v>

39
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>even this small society and it's no lie.</v>
