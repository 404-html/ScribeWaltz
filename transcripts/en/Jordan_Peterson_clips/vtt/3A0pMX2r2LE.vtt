1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.923
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to be an entrepreneur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you almost have the opposite profile as </v>

2
00:00:03.631 --> 00:00:04.464
<v Speaker 1>a soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very high in openness and you're </v>

3
00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:07.434
<v Speaker 1>lowering conscientiousness or at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness is irrelevant and the </v>

4
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:11.604
<v Speaker 1>reason for that seems to be that like if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an orderly person and you'd like </v>

5
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:15.294
<v Speaker 1>to follow procedures and rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of hard for you to start a </v>

6
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:18.714
<v Speaker 1>company because when you first start a </v>
<v Speaker 1>company or engage in any other creative </v>

7
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because entrepreneurs turn out to be the</v>

8
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>same as artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to.</v>

9
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>You're not operating within a rule </v>
<v Speaker 1>governed structure.</v>

10
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:30.204
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there may be many times where you have </v>

11
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:36.381
<v Speaker 1>to break a small rule to move properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a higher level of analysis.</v>

12
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.710
<v Speaker 1>There is no algorithmic way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>generating a new company,</v>

13
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>

14
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.133
<v Speaker 1>and so it's people who are very high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>openness who happened to be good </v>

15
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs and so this is something I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought was extraordinarily cool because</v>

16
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.030
<v Speaker 1>we'd.</v>

17
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.460
<v Speaker 1>We'd also already known what predicts </v>
<v Speaker 1>managerial,</v>

18
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:58.461
<v Speaker 1>administrative and academic ability and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq is crucial for any complex jobs.</v>

19
00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 1>So we'll just leave that behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what predicts academic ability?</v>

20
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:02.844
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the University of Toronto is </v>

21
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>intelligence obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also conscientiousness,</v>

22
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.920
<v Speaker 1>the correlation between creativity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>grades at the UFT is zero zero.</v>

23
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not.</v>

24
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not surprising that the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:17.994
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to be cynical about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things you have to </v>

26
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:20.904
<v Speaker 1>understand about creative people is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they continually step outside of the </v>

27
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:27.240
<v Speaker 1>domain of evaluation structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

28
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:28.074
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're going to say you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to evaluate [inaudible] </v>

29
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.660
<v Speaker 1>performance of 100 professors on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecturing ability,</v>

30
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.883
<v Speaker 1>while you kind of have to measure what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>common across all the professors in </v>

31
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>order to come up with the standards for </v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluation,</v>

32
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.610
<v Speaker 1>well that means you're not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to use that structure to evaluate a</v>

33
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:45.444
<v Speaker 1>particularly creative professor because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he or she is going to do something in a </v>

34
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 1>way that's so different that it won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>show up on the evaluation measure.</v>

35
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's what happens in </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>

36
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:58.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody sent me a couple of days ago,</v>

37
00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.393
<v Speaker 1>somebody sent me an essay that they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>written for their master's thesis that </v>

38
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:03.144
<v Speaker 1>was wildly creative and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically told to leave the program and </v>

39
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.860
<v Speaker 1>that they couldn't continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not in a mean way.</v>

40
00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:09.694
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened was that what they were </v>

41
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>thinking was so outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventions in the discipline is that no</v>

42
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>one had any idea what to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>essay.</v>

43
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.160
<v Speaker 1>So and then that's really the law of </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative people,</v>

44
00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:20.994
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're always stepping outside of </v>

45
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:22.773
<v Speaker 1>evaluation structures and so it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>that surprising that the relationship </v>

46
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>between creativity and grades at the u </v>
<v Speaker 1>of t is zero.</v>

47
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.353
<v Speaker 1>We found out as well by looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate student performance across </v>

48
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:33.924
<v Speaker 1>multiple institutions that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative correlation between creativity </v>

49
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>and graduate school performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even zero.</v>

50
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.183
<v Speaker 1>It was worse than negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being creative was negative and you </v>

51
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:45.504
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that could make you cynical as </v>

52
00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:46.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

53
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.723
<v Speaker 1>But you can't be cynical in that way </v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that happens </v>

54
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.004
<v Speaker 1>in science is that science tends to </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress incrementally rather than in </v>

55
00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:58.074
<v Speaker 1>great leaps now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then someone comes who blows the </v>

56
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>structure out of a science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>advances it ridiculously like Einstein,</v>

57
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>but like most people aren't Einstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be,</v>

58
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>thank God for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time you're in a discipline,</v>

59
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand the discipline,</v>

60
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>and then once you've developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the discipline,</v>

61
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:16.474
<v Speaker 1>you know what the next micro question is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that should be answered and part of the </v>

62
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:21.604
<v Speaker 1>reason that science is so powerful is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it allows people who aren't </v>

63
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 1>genius level creatives to make real </v>
<v Speaker 1>advances in the generation of knowledge.</v>

64
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>One tiny micro step at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if there's 100,000</v>

65
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>people doing it and each of them is </v>
<v Speaker 1>making a micro step.</v>

66
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.653
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're zipping along as fast as we </v>

67
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:39.304
<v Speaker 1>possibly wanted zip along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it turns out to be </v>

68
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:42.064
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the excellent predictor of </v>

69
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>graduate student performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the best predictor for law.</v>

70
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>It's the best predictor for managerial </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions.</v>

71
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:51.310
<v Speaker 1>It's the best predictor for </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrative positions.</v>

72
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Anything that has a structure of rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>that needs to be applied,</v>

73
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness is a great predictor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

74
00:03:58.061 --> 00:03:58.894
<v Speaker 1>but it's not good for predicting </v>
<v Speaker 1>artistic ability or entrepreneurial </v>

75
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's also really important because</v>

76
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.323
<v Speaker 1>one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is partly why bureaucracies </v>

77
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>stultify right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what happens is they,</v>

78
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.843
<v Speaker 1>as they develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get chock full of conscientious </v>

79
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 1>people with a few psychopaths thrown in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there just for good measure.</v>

80
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 1>They get chocked full of conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 1>people busily zooming,</v>

81
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:19.954
<v Speaker 1>efficiently down to a single track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden the landscape </v>

82
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:23.884
<v Speaker 1>shifts and they're going very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very efficiently in exactly the wrong </v>

83
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:29.320
<v Speaker 1>direction and then the whole bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing falls apart.</v>

84
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.333
<v Speaker 1>So you need to have some creative wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuts in your organization to come up </v>

85
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 1>with completely absurd ideas that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>just on the off chance be true.</v>

86
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>And so creativity is strange in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner too because it's a high risk,</v>

87
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:44.374
<v Speaker 1>high return game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a lot safer in your life to find </v>

88
00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:50.830
<v Speaker 1>a functioning entity and to operate as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cog within it,</v>

89
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.993
<v Speaker 1>as long as the entity keeps functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're creative and you go </v>

90
00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:56.494
<v Speaker 1>off on tangents all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some probability that one of </v>

91
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:00.184
<v Speaker 1>those tangents is going to be exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is needed at the time and you're </v>

92
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:04.960
<v Speaker 1>going to become hyper successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence,</v>

93
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.280
<v Speaker 1>but there's much more probability that </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though your,</v>

94
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.600
<v Speaker 1>some of your ideas might be highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable,</v>

95
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.583
<v Speaker 1>the probability that this is the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and place for them is </v>

96
00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:15.274
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to produce a successful creative </v>

97
00:05:18.161 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 1>product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

98
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:19.894
<v Speaker 1>in the marketplace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a ridiculous combination of </v>

99
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.403
<v Speaker 1>creativity so that you keep generating </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and then a network around you of </v>

100
00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:29.824
<v Speaker 1>people who have skills that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the production of a of a </v>

101
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 1>product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say whatever that happens to be,</v>

102
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.363
<v Speaker 1>that's actually in demand by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketplace at exactly that moment and </v>

103
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 1>that someone else hasn't already done </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

104
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.060
<v Speaker 1>So the sensible thing to tell anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>who wants to be creative is that stupid.</v>

105
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.880
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

106
00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:50.714
<v Speaker 1>it's your probability of success is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>low that it's better just to do </v>

107
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:55.744
<v Speaker 1>something sensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with that is that </v>

108
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.333
<v Speaker 1>creative people can't do that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're creative and if they shut down </v>

109
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:02.234
<v Speaker 1>their creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an extrovert who's gone to </v>

110
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>live in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In an isolated cell,</v>

111
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 1>a creative person who isn't being </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative.</v>

112
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just wither and die,</v>

113
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 1>so they're stuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

114
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 1>But it is a high risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high return strategy.</v>
