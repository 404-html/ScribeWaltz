00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Gabriel on drugs says,</v>

2
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please help me.</v>

3
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm 99th percentile of openness and zero</v>
<v Speaker 1>with percentile and conscientiousness.</v>

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Speaker 1>how old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing.</v>

6
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're young,</v>

7
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.663
<v Speaker 1>that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because younger people are less </v>

8
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:20.904
<v Speaker 1>conscientious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one thing to keep in mind if </v>

9
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:26.760
<v Speaker 1>you're very open like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to be doing something creative,</v>

10
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have to learn how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline yourself.</v>

11
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.173
<v Speaker 1>There's just no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say go do the future </v>

12
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:33.174
<v Speaker 1>authoring program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good start and you'll have to </v>

13
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:36.414
<v Speaker 1>learn how to schedule your time then and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to get up at the same time everyday </v>

14
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to be a real struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

15
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.890
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>

16
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I've had students who were very high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>openness and low in conscientiousness,</v>

17
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.080
<v Speaker 1>his graduate students and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplined themselves.</v>

18
00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:51.780
<v Speaker 1>You need to find something that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really interested in that you're willing</v>

19
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>to pursue and then you have to hit it </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

20
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what I would say,</v>

21
00:00:57.631 --> 00:00:58.464
<v Speaker 1>but do the future authoring program and </v>
<v Speaker 1>get yourself a plan and start to </v>

22
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:01.824
<v Speaker 1>implement it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every time you fall astray then get </v>

23
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>back at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

24
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>you may have to build up your </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness over a number of years</v>

25
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth doing.</v>

26
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.713
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
