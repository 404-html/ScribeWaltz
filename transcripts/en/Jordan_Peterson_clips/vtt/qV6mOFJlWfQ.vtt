1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I've told people to learn to use a </v>
<v Speaker 1>schedule.</v>

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.230
<v Speaker 1>And people often hate schedules because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they act as their own tyrants,</v>

3
00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:07.064
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say we have to do this unpleasant </v>

4
00:00:08.631 --> 00:00:11.060
<v Speaker 1>thing and then here's another unpleasant</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you have to do.</v>

5
00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:11.894
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to do this unpleasant </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and you do that for about three </v>

6
00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>days and you think tail with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that.</v>

7
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:19.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you fall off the wagon.</v>

8
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.770
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what you're supposed to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the schedule.</v>

9
00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:22.604
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to use it to design the </v>
<v Speaker 1>days that you would like to have if you </v>

10
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:29.600
<v Speaker 1>were taking care of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so some of that is,</v>

11
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.733
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wake up in the morning and you </v>

12
00:00:31.191 --> 00:00:32.024
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's five things I have to do that if </v>

13
00:00:34.341 --> 00:00:38.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't do my life will be worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like paying bills for example,</v>

14
00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:39.351
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

15
00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:40.640
<v Speaker 1>or taking out the garbage.</v>

16
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have to do those because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise things degenerate.</v>

17
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.770
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to put some of those in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the schedule.</v>

18
00:00:45.771 --> 00:00:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Cause otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow is worse than today.</v>

19
00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's a bad trajectory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you also want to build in things.</v>

20
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to act in some sense,</v>

21
00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:57.800
<v Speaker 1>like you're dealing with a relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>recalcitrant nine year old.</v>

22
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like so well here's some things you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do,</v>

23
00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:04.670
<v Speaker 1>but here's some things that if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could reward yourself with.</v>

24
00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:08.000
<v Speaker 1>And if you get the balance there between</v>
<v Speaker 1>obligation and reward,</v>

25
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:08.834
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll find that you're motivated </v>

26
00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:12.500
<v Speaker 1>to do the things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you want to do.</v>

27
00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:13.334
<v Speaker 1>You want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's sustainable across days and </v>

28
00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.030
<v Speaker 1>weeks and months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got to,</v>

29
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.193
<v Speaker 1>you got to treat yourself like a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>boss would treat a valued employee and </v>

30
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:27.230
<v Speaker 1>not like a tyrant would treat a slave </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the slave will rebel.</v>

31
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.400
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>

32
00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:30.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't follow through on my plans.</v>

33
00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:33.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well a,</v>

34
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.883
<v Speaker 1>they're probably not very well </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulated and maybe you're doing them </v>

35
00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:38.810
<v Speaker 1>because of an external moral obligation </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something,</v>

36
00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:40.820
<v Speaker 1>not really your plans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

37
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.090
<v Speaker 1>And B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're acting like a tyrant and a slave.</v>

38
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's a bad relationship to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>with yourself.</v>

39
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.970
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to treat yourself with some,</v>

40
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way.</v>

41
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.970
<v Speaker 1>That's the golden rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

42
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.470
<v Speaker 1>It treat yourself as you would treat </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people as you would have them.</v>

43
00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:58.663
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Treat other people as you would like to </v>

44
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:02.090
<v Speaker 1>be treated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works both ways.</v>

45
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.630
<v Speaker 1>You also treat yourself like you treat </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people properly,</v>

46
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.080
<v Speaker 1>so that's a necessary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And often people don't do that,</v>

47
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.180
<v Speaker 1>but the scheduling is really important.</v>
