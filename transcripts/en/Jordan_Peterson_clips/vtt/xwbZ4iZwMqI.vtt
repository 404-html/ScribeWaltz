1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.220
<v Speaker 1>In order to have any positive meaning in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:03.683
<v Speaker 1>you have to identify the goal and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be working towards it and there </v>

3
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:11.220
<v Speaker 1>is a technical reason for that and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technical reason as far as I can tell is</v>

4
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:12.054
<v Speaker 1>that the circuitry that produces the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of positive emotion that people </v>

5
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>really like is only activated when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed that your.</v>

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.993
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're proceeding towards a</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal that you value and so that means </v>

7
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>that if you don't have a goal that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>

8
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:27.504
<v Speaker 1>you can't have any positive emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So technically that's the incentive </v>

9
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:30.924
<v Speaker 1>reward system and it's the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuitry as dopaminergic and when that </v>

10
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:35.484
<v Speaker 1>circuitry is activated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's part of the exploratory </v>

11
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:38.670
<v Speaker 1>circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you.</v>

12
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.773
<v Speaker 1>It gives you the sense of being actively</v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged in something worthwhile and </v>

13
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.350
<v Speaker 1>that's you know you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tend to think of positive emotion is</v>

14
00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:47.184
<v Speaker 1>something produced by reward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's two kinds of positive </v>

15
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

16
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.930
<v Speaker 1>One is the reward that's associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>satiation and that's conservatory reward</v>

17
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 1>and that's the reward you get when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hungry and you eat.</v>

18
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.853
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about eating when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry is that destroys the framework </v>

19
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>within which you are operating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

20
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>It's time to eat what you eat and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>that frameworks no longer relevant.</v>

21
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:08.604
<v Speaker 1>So the conservatory reward eliminates </v>
<v Speaker 1>the value of framework and then you're </v>

22
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:12.281
<v Speaker 1>stuck with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:13.114
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the conservatory reward has with </v>

24
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:16.914
<v Speaker 1>it its own problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the incentive reward is constantly </v>

25
00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:20.214
<v Speaker 1>what keeps you moving forward and </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive reward because it's </v>

26
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 1>dopaminergic also is analgesic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally analgesics.</v>

27
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:27.924
<v Speaker 1>So if you're in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take opiates and that that will cut </v>

28
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:31.554
<v Speaker 1>the pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so will psychomotor stimulants like </v>

29
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:33.954
<v Speaker 1>cocaine or amphetamines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's literally the case that if </v>

30
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:38.334
<v Speaker 1>you're engaged in something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging and you're working towards a </v>

31
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:42.750
<v Speaker 1>goal that you're going to feel less </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>

32
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>And you can see this happening with </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes who you know,</v>

33
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.073
<v Speaker 1>they'll break their thumb or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe sometimes even their ankle and </v>

34
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.074
<v Speaker 1>they'll keep playing the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course afterwards they're suffering </v>

35
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 1>like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that they're so filled with</v>

36
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:58.761
<v Speaker 1>goal-directed enthusiasm means that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether Peyton systems are in some sense</v>

37
00:01:58.981 --> 00:01:59.814
<v Speaker 1>shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's an interesting thing because </v>

38
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.760
<v Speaker 1>what it suggests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean then you could imagine,</v>

39
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.713
<v Speaker 1>I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how happy you are you that you've </v>

40
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:12.060
<v Speaker 1>made a certain amount of progress and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about it,</v>

41
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>what you'd say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

42
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:13.884
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how much progress and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to what so hypothetically </v>

43
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:19.314
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be happier if you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>made quite a bit of progress towards a </v>

44
00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:22.104
<v Speaker 1>really important goal and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to think through what it means for a </v>

45
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 1>goal to be really important because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not obvious.</v>

46
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.793
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here in this class and you're listening </v>

47
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>to some information and maybe there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>two reasons for that.</v>

48
00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:38.760
<v Speaker 1>You might find the information </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting per se,</v>

49
00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:40.200
<v Speaker 1>but let's forget about that for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

50
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.173
<v Speaker 1>You need to listen to the information so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can do well on the assignment </v>

51
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:45.894
<v Speaker 1>so that you can do well in the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to do well in your classes so </v>

52
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:49.434
<v Speaker 1>that you can finish up your degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to finish up your degree so </v>

53
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>that you can find your place in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

54
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:54.743
<v Speaker 1>You need to do that so that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>financially stable and maybe you can </v>

55
00:02:56.851 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>start a family and have a life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of being a good person,</v>

56
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.353
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's a hierarchy of goals and </v>

57
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>you might say that being a good person </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be the thing,</v>

58
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>however vaguely thought through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's at the top of that hierarchy,</v>

59
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 1>and then when you're doing things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>serve the ultimate purpose,</v>

60
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:18.663
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to find those more </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful and that meaning is actually </v>

61
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:21.514
<v Speaker 1>produced as a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>engagement of this exploratory circuit </v>

62
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>that's nested right down in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus.</v>

63
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really old.</v>

64
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>It's as old as thirst and it's as old as</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger.</v>

65
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>It's really an old system and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to have that thing activated.</v>
