1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.103
<v Speaker 1>I read the story was not a biography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly of the of the </v>

2
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:07.920
<v Speaker 1>captain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong about that,</v>

3
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 1>but I've got the basic story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a ship wreck and the Antarctica</v>

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.740
<v Speaker 1>was then they were there for a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>year in the Antarctic,</v>

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and none of them died.</v>

7
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Not One.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't lose a single man,</v>

8
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.543
<v Speaker 1>not one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kept the morale high and then they </v>

9
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:22.764
<v Speaker 1>took this boat that was on the ship and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they crossed like 400 miles of the </v>

10
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>roughest ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roughest,</v>

11
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>frigid ocean in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

12
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>You don't go in that ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they went to an island and they</v>

13
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:34.554
<v Speaker 1>walked across the island across these </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains that no one else has ever </v>

14
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.813
<v Speaker 1>climbed since,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they went to the city on the other </v>

15
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:42.444
<v Speaker 1>side of the island and they got a boat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they went and rescued their </v>

16
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.110
<v Speaker 1>compatriots and everyone survived.</v>

17
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like endurance is the name of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

18
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.160
<v Speaker 1>You read that book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

19
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

20
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>people are really tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

21
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>and if it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who knows how tough you are and maybe</v>

22
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>you find out by going out to find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how tough you are,</v>

23
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you take on a challenge,</v>

24
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 1>one that you think you can master,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that's just a bit beyond your grasp</v>

25
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>and you master it and then your little </v>
<v Speaker 1>tougher and you think,</v>

26
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that worked out pretty well,</v>

27
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.773
<v Speaker 1>and so then you're more of a monster and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you go out and you find another </v>

28
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:16.920
<v Speaker 1>challenge that's even bigger and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

29
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:19.950
<v Speaker 1>well maybe I can do that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden you can and you</v>

30
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:20.784
<v Speaker 1>get a little bit bigger and God only </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what the limit is of you and you </v>

31
00:01:25.321 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>find out by pushing yourself against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

32
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's what Abraham is </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

33
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.533
<v Speaker 1>And so see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're very pessimistic us more than </v>

34
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>people were pessimistic about humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

35
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Dismal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wretched planet destroying cancer on the</v>

36
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:43.021
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

37
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:47.580
<v Speaker 1>As the club of Rome described us so </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasantly back in the 19 sixties,</v>

38
00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:48.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

39
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we're ashamed of the Cold War.</v>

40
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we're ashamed of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction.</v>

41
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>In the 20th century and the hydrogen </v>
<v Speaker 1>bomb and,</v>

42
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.180
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.043
<v Speaker 1>the continuing catastrophes of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies and were deeply ashamed of </v>

44
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 1>that and ashamed of ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>

45
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:04.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's a hell of a thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.393
<v Speaker 1>call us a cancer on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just no excuse for that because </v>

47
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:09.054
<v Speaker 1>what you do with cancer is eradicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that that's a very </v>

48
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:13.314
<v Speaker 1>noble motive personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it says a lot about the </v>

49
00:02:17.641 --> 00:02:18.474
<v Speaker 1>people who would use such phraseology </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would dare to conceptualize </v>

50
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 1>humanity in that manner.</v>

51
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.173
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be nice if we could be optimistic </v>

52
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>and I think began the problem with being</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic is that it's naive.</v>

53
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there an optimism that's not naive?</v>

54
00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:33.324
<v Speaker 1>And I think there is and the optimism </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not naive isn't just a </v>

55
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>visualization of how strong people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

56
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.053
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that I tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told my students in my class in </v>

57
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:49.050
<v Speaker 1>maps of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a goal.</v>

58
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.483
<v Speaker 1>You want to be the person at the funeral</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your father that everyone can rely </v>

59
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:56.400
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would that be?</v>

60
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.840
<v Speaker 1>You want to be the person who's broken </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

61
00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.993
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and useless and adding to the misery in </v>

62
00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>

63
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making light of people's grief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I understand grief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who do you want to be when there's a</v>

65
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

66
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to be the person that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone can turn to for strength?</v>

67
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the hell not?</v>

68
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a goal.</v>

69
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.460
<v Speaker 1>That would be a good goal because then </v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a crisis and there will be,</v>

70
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:22.294
<v Speaker 1>it won't be such a bloody crisis because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be someone there that can deal </v>

71
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:25.654
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>

72
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.633
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I went and talked to these </v>

73
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 1>people at the funeral home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I envisioned that I thought,</v>

74
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:32.404
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is something you have to </v>

75
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>contend with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to be alive and adult,</v>

76
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.173
<v Speaker 1>you have to contend with death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering and you have to be ready for </v>

77
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:41.314
<v Speaker 1>it and you have to be there for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person because that's all they're going </v>

78
00:03:44.851 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a goal man.</v>

79
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 1>And in this time of nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's,</v>

80
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.083
<v Speaker 1>what's the point of life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People ask and they're taught that at </v>

81
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the point of life?</v>

82
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Everything's interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humanities.</v>

83
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 1>A cancer on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

84
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about no?</v>

85
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>How about not that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about the do something to us.</v>
