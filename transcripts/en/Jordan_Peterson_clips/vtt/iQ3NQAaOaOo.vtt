1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.560
<v Speaker 1>It's useful to talk to people that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't agree with and it's.</v>

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.423
<v Speaker 1>It's useful for a variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that a lot of what determines </v>

3
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:09.684
<v Speaker 1>your political orientation is biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament far more than people </v>

4
00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>realize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

5
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.030
<v Speaker 1>left leaning people liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>although that's kind of Miss Misnomer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll keep with the terminology.</v>

7
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Liberals are high in a trait called </v>
<v Speaker 1>openness,</v>

8
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the big five personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>traits and it's associated with interest</v>

9
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>in abstraction and interest in </v>
<v Speaker 1>aesthetics.</v>

10
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.983
<v Speaker 1>It's the best predictor of liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>political leaning and they're low in </v>

11
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:41.184
<v Speaker 1>trait conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is due to fullness and and </v>

12
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.850
<v Speaker 1>orderliness in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the conservatives,</v>

13
00:00:46.851 --> 00:00:47.684
<v Speaker 1>so the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're high in conscientiousness there </v>

14
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:49.944
<v Speaker 1>due to full in orderly and they're low </v>
<v Speaker 1>in openness and that makes them really </v>

15
00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:53.874
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Managers and administers ministers and </v>

16
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:56.424
<v Speaker 1>often businessmen but not very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs because entrepreneurs are </v>

17
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:00.474
<v Speaker 1>almost all drawn from the liberal types </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so these are really fundamental </v>

18
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.070
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally biologically predicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>

19
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.190
<v Speaker 1>And there you might think about them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>different sets of,</v>

20
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.173
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of opportunities and limitations and </v>

21
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:15.444
<v Speaker 1>certainly different ways of screening </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and each of those different </v>

22
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 1>temperamental types needs the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>type.</v>

23
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>So economically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

24
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.793
<v Speaker 1>we need liberals to start businesses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need conservatives to run them and </v>

25
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:33.600
<v Speaker 1>the conservatives are too conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if they are running businesses,</v>

26
00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:35.400
<v Speaker 1>they have a bitch of a time with </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>

27
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.493
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the liberals are really good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>generating new ideas and and moving </v>

28
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:41.394
<v Speaker 1>laterally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not very good at the level </v>

29
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:43.554
<v Speaker 1>of detail and implementation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you start understanding that </v>

30
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>the person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a diversity issue,</v>

31
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:50.274
<v Speaker 1>let's call this a diversity issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you start understanding that the </v>

32
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>person that you're talking to doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>share your political views,</v>

33
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>isn't stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the first thing necessarily.</v>

34
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>They might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so might you be no,</v>

35
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:05.184
<v Speaker 1>stupidity isn't the differences in </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence are not the prime </v>

36
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 1>determinant of differences in political </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>

37
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might be talking to someone who's</v>

38
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.130
<v Speaker 1>more conscientious and less creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you.</v>

39
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:18.930
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you happen to be a liberal,</v>

40
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.943
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that that person's</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective is not valid and it doesn't </v>

41
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>mean that they wouldn't outperform you </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some domains because they would.</v>

42
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.800
<v Speaker 1>So one thing to remember is people </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually do see the world differently.</v>

43
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:32.634
<v Speaker 1>It's not merely that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're possessed of ill informed </v>

44
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Speaker 1>opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to first of all,</v>

45
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:41.250
<v Speaker 1>stretch out your hand and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

46
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:41.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

47
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that you see the world differently</v>

48
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>than me and I also understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a place for you and to place for</v>

49
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>me even though that isn't the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

50
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>And then it's necessary to also remember</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

51
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.413
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to talk to people or do you </v>

52
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>want it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to fight with them?</v>

53
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Because fighting is not pleasant and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes very dark places very,</v>

54
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

55
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last time I was down in Boston,</v>

56
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:11.041
<v Speaker 1>I talked to an old friend of mine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this person went on a relatively,</v>

57
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solid and strong and relatively personal</v>

58
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:20.044
<v Speaker 1>critique of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of trump supporters calling them ill </v>

59
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 1>informed and stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

60
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>and insulting and insulting </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterization.</v>

61
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:28.594
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it was surprising to me because </v>

62
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:32.254
<v Speaker 1>this was a reasonable person and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an indication of the </v>

63
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>polarization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

64
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 1>you can't throw away 50 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population like that.</v>

65
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>It's not reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same on the right.</v>

66
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 1>The Conservatives can't do it to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals either.</v>

67
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:47.584
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now I think that the radical left </v>

68
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian proclivity is a much </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater danger than radical right?</v>

69
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Totalitarian proclivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially on the university campuses.</v>

70
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.540
<v Speaker 1>And so I've been mostly speaking out </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the,</v>

71
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.433
<v Speaker 1>about the leftwing radicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could've just as easily been the </v>

72
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 1>reverse case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't happen to me.</v>

73
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.730
<v Speaker 1>But you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole point of the,</v>

74
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.713
<v Speaker 1>of a democracy is to continue the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue between people of different </v>

75
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 1>temperamental types so that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>move so far to the right,</v>

76
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:18.844
<v Speaker 1>that everything becomes encapsulated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone and doesn't move or so far to the </v>

77
00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 1>left and everything dissolves in a kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a mealy mouth chaos.</v>

78
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>And the only way that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can navigate between those two shows</v>

79
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>is by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is through discussion,</v>

80
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>which is why free speech is such an </v>
<v Speaker 1>important value.</v>

81
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.613
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that keeps the </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperamental types from being at each </v>

82
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 1>other's throats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like in a marriage,</v>

83
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:43.564
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's differences in the </v>

84
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:45.184
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't talk you either you're </v>

85
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:52.411
<v Speaker 1>either subservient or you fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's no good.</v>

86
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.943
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of it is have some respect for </v>

87
00:04:57.311 --> 00:04:58.144
<v Speaker 1>people that are different than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is of course what the radical </v>

88
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:00.724
<v Speaker 1>leftists are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't identify the real </v>

89
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:03.334
<v Speaker 1>differences.</v>
