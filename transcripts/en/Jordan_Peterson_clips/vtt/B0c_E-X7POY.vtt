00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.480
<v Speaker 1>To tap into the dopaminergic system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said you needed to value goal.</v>

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Is there any way to tap into the opioid </v>
<v Speaker 1>system?</v>

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.840
<v Speaker 1>I want to be more connected to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of me can't get myself to care.</v>

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well one of the things that that,</v>

5
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:14.970
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you're a little bit on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable side,</v>

6
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:15.804
<v Speaker 1>that's a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some interesting clinical </v>

7
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.403
<v Speaker 1>evidence that suggests that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that disagreeable people can do </v>

8
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.693
<v Speaker 1>in order to facilitate their </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions with other people is to do </v>

9
00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:27.594
<v Speaker 1>people favorites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what you might say is that you </v>

10
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:31.194
<v Speaker 1>could start by acting like you care and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you could learn how to care </v>

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 1>through doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you could say,</v>

12
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:38.334
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do something nice for </v>

13
00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:42.650
<v Speaker 1>someone once every two days for a month </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

14
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>and think about it a little bit and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

15
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.690
<v Speaker 1>see if that changes you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

16
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.533
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you think yourself into change</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you act yourself into </v>

17
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:52.614
<v Speaker 1>changing your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what I would start by </v>

18
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:56.994
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.373
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could also be more connected to </v>

20
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>people regardless of whether you care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.333
<v Speaker 1>let's say that it would take you six </v>
<v Speaker 1>months of practice or even a year of </v>

22
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.563
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>
