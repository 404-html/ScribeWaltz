1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.230
<v Speaker 1>I think people get so used to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the to think of past pain that an almost</v>

2
00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:07.500
<v Speaker 1>blurs out in their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that sound,</v>

3
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>the ringing that eventually your brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>stops processing,</v>

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.853
<v Speaker 1>but I think you have a very good rule of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thumb which is the 18 month rule and I </v>

5
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:15.294
<v Speaker 1>wonder if you could help people </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that it is not a suffering </v>

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.033
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to take with you like a </v>

7
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>ball and chain for the rest of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

8
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:21.264
<v Speaker 1>There are ways to release it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does involve circling back and </v>

9
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:24.594
<v Speaker 1>processing it through.</v>

10
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.291
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

11
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:25.771
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

12
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 2>let's define what processing means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

13
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:29.124
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say let's say that you had a </v>

14
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:31.854
<v Speaker 2>pretty painful history of being bullied </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were 13 and you're still </v>

15
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Speaker 2>carrying that with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You carry it with you and your posture.</v>

16
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.250
<v Speaker 2>You carry it with you in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>assumptions about people.</v>

17
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 2>This is all implicit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

18
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:43.344
<v Speaker 2>It's not explicit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You carry it with you in the form of </v>

19
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:46.584
<v Speaker 2>resentment and the and the questions </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what it might have been and you </v>

20
00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:52.950
<v Speaker 2>carry it with you because you've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>demeaned by it.</v>

21
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.100
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not 13 anymore,</v>

22
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.593
<v Speaker 2>you're 40 and those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those experiences are not transferable </v>

23
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 2>in any simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple manner to your current reality.</v>

24
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 2>So you go back and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

25
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What exactly happened and what what?</v>

26
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.363
<v Speaker 2>What happened means is what were the </v>
<v Speaker 2>causal pathways that put me in that </v>

27
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Speaker 2>position of vulnerability and </v>
<v Speaker 2>inferiority and you want to specify them</v>

28
00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:26.760
<v Speaker 2>as carefully as possible because what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the part of you that's hanging onto that</v>

29
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:31.761
<v Speaker 2>wants to know is have you changed enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that that won't happen again,</v>

30
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.810
<v Speaker 2>and if the answer to that is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even through thinking you realize,</v>

31
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that person anymore,</v>

32
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 2>or you go back to the experience and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out,</v>

33
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:41.484
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I did and I could stop </v>

34
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>

35
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.033
<v Speaker 2>Then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the IC hands of that traumatic </v>

36
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:49.490
<v Speaker 2>experiment experience will release that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>

37
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 2>You will be released from it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>what your mind wants to know,</v>

38
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:53.274
<v Speaker 2>your unconscious mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say is have you resolved this </v>

39
00:01:55.921 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 2>issue to the degree that it is unlikely </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it will occur again and that's what</v>

40
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:01.160
<v Speaker 2>it means to you</v>

41
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.570
<v Speaker 1>processed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this.</v>

42
00:02:02.571 --> 00:02:03.404
<v Speaker 1>I think is really important for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand that memory stick until </v>

43
00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:08.690
<v Speaker 1>you gain security memories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick to,</v>

44
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.533
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alert you to dangerous that you're </v>

45
00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:14.000
<v Speaker 1>recreating by avoiding the history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you will,</v>

46
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.720
<v Speaker 1>you're going to either end up usually in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the belief victim paradigm,</v>

47
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.703
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're either going to go out there and </v>

48
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:19.431
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

49
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:21.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get them before they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

50
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>or you're going to go out there with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your sort of shuffling along,</v>

51
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:25.430
<v Speaker 1>staring at the sidewalk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:26.264
<v Speaker 1>slumped shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to be inviting more </v>

53
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:28.154
<v Speaker 1>bullies into your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so until you figure out the </v>

54
00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:32.750
<v Speaker 1>causality of how you ended up being </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullied,</v>

55
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.703
<v Speaker 1>you're going to gravitate to either of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those two poles as either a fight or </v>

56
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:37.364
<v Speaker 1>flight mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you go back and process and </v>

57
00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:39.681
<v Speaker 1>figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

58
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:42.770
<v Speaker 1>here's the steps that happened that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up with me being bullied.</v>

59
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Now I know how to avoid the bullying </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

60
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Then that pain will recede.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's there until you listen.</v>

61
00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:49.850
<v Speaker 1>It speaks until you're safe.</v>

62
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.840
<v Speaker 2>So there's this great scene in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary called Crumb,</v>

63
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 2>which is about the underground </v>
<v Speaker 2>cartoonists Robert Crumb.</v>

64
00:02:57.691 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

65
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.470
<v Speaker 2>it's the most brilliant documentary I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever seen and it's,</v>

66
00:03:01.471 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 2>it's highly instructive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That documentary.</v>

67
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:04.684
<v Speaker 2>It's about a terribly eatable family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also about the successful </v>

68
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:09.364
<v Speaker 2>struggle of one of the brothers in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>family who became a famous underground </v>

69
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:12.874
<v Speaker 2>cartoonists to free himself from that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and part of the documentary details his </v>

70
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 2>terrible experiences as a 13 to 17 year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old with women.</v>

71
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.623
<v Speaker 2>And he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was one of these people that Robert </v>

72
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 2>Crumb who was not at the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy.</v>

73
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.370
<v Speaker 2>He was outside the dominance hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the land of absolute contempt.</v>

74
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.353
<v Speaker 2>And he made this card when he was about </v>
<v Speaker 2>13 or 14 with a broken heart on it and </v>

75
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:39.544
<v Speaker 2>described his realization that he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>such an outsider that he would never be </v>

76
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 2>successful with girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

77
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 2>or period.</v>

78
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.103
<v Speaker 2>But particularly with girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then that freed him up and he </v>

79
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 2>started to cartoon more and draw more </v>
<v Speaker 2>and listen to old music.</v>

80
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:55.030
<v Speaker 2>And he kind of developed his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathway.</v>

81
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 2>And then he became a very successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>illustrator.</v>

82
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 2>And then he became very successful with </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

83
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.820
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

84
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.590
<v Speaker 2>but what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>

85
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.443
<v Speaker 2>he drew this picture to illustrate what </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like when he was 13 and he is </v>

86
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 2>very self critical and he draws himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of hunched over thick glasses,</v>

87
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 2>really skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>underdeveloped,</v>

88
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 2>weak chin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bad attitude.</v>

89
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm poorly presented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>badly dressed like a walking,</v>

90
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 2>a walking testament to resentment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>weakness,</v>

91
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.410
<v Speaker 2>and it wasn't until he realized that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

92
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 2>that he was playing that part and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was also fueling his rejection.</v>

93
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Was He really able to to move towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>overcoming it.</v>

94
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 2>And so partly what you want to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go over your past and figure out,</v>

95
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:41.194
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what stupid things did I do or what in </v>

96
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:48.280
<v Speaker 2>what manner was I insufficient so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this negative destiny was more likely to</v>

97
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:49.114
<v Speaker 2>visit me?</v>

98
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.253
<v Speaker 2>Now you don't assume that everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened to you was your fault or </v>

99
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:54.904
<v Speaker 2>under your control because everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't your fault and everything isn't </v>

100
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 2>under your control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you do want to figure out,</v>

101
00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:02.254
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if I played some hand in this and </v>

102
00:05:04.691 --> 00:05:05.524
<v Speaker 2>that could be rectified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then I should figure out how to </v>

103
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:09.730
<v Speaker 2>rectify it because then I won't be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this situation anymore.</v>

104
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:10.564
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talked about the bullied victim who </v>

105
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 2>invites more bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

106
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:16.810
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've conducted yourself in a manner</v>

107
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.180
<v Speaker 2>such that you've attracted the attention</v>
<v Speaker 2>of bullies and you haven't stopped doing</v>

108
00:05:22.181 --> 00:05:23.014
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're still going to attract the </v>

109
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:25.294
<v Speaker 2>attention of bullies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so your mind is very alert to such </v>

110
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:29.494
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always looking for where you're </v>

111
00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:32.290
<v Speaker 2>weak and vulnerable and warning you </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

112
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.530
<v Speaker 2>And it's just an alarm bell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

113
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 2>It isn't necessarily a problem solving </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanism.</v>

114
00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:37.774
<v Speaker 2>And so alarm bells might be going off in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your head all the time and that's very </v>

115
00:05:40.391 --> 00:05:41.224
<v Speaker 2>unpleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the difficult process of </v>

116
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:46.660
<v Speaker 2>articulating it and thinking it through </v>
