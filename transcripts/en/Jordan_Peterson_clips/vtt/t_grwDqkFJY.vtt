1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.520
<v Speaker 1>For those who are very creative but high</v>
<v Speaker 1>in neuroticism,</v>

2
00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>how should one work to gain emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability in order to go out into chaos,</v>

3
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 1>to do more creative things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good question.</v>

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.040
<v Speaker 1>You know what I learned about that by </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading Young's works on El Camino,</v>

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.883
<v Speaker 1>weirdly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so back again in graduate school </v>

6
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:16.854
<v Speaker 1>when I was writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to write maps of meaning and </v>

7
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:20.310
<v Speaker 1>really tearing myself apart </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically.</v>

8
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.173
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to understand evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the evil of the Cold War and </v>

9
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:28.400
<v Speaker 1>the evil of the individuals who compose </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazi Germany in Stalinist,</v>

10
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

12
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>I was reading Carl Jung because he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

13
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.663
<v Speaker 1>he wrote his tracks on alchemy where a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot about self transformation and he </v>

14
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to explain his works on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alchemy,</v>

16
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 1>but suffice it to say that his advice </v>
<v Speaker 1>was something like,</v>

17
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:46.584
<v Speaker 1>the advice he derived from the alchemist</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that if you were going to make mess </v>

18
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>around with very complicated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous matters,</v>

19
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>that's a good way of putting it.</v>

20
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 1>That you should really put your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

21
00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:57.024
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say the right way to deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your neuroticism is to increase </v>

22
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:00.834
<v Speaker 1>your conscientiousness because we also </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that the higher your </v>

23
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:04.164
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lower your neuroticism </v>

24
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness does seem to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism and check.</v>

25
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have said this to many people,</v>

26
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm clean your room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Organize your life like get a routine.</v>

27
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Get up everyday at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to bed at the same time.</v>

28
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Establish disciplined habits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that will help a lot schedule like.</v>

29
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>And here's how to use a schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use a,</v>

30
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 1>use a calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use Google calendar,</v>

31
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:32.130
<v Speaker 1>but don't use it as a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what you want to use your.</v>
