00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>How does he become corrupt and for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person to avoid the dangers of the </v>

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.780
<v Speaker 1>postmodern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neo Marxist ideologies and not enroll?</v>

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.003
<v Speaker 1>Would you agree the same thing applies </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the institute of marriage with laws </v>

4
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:15.681
<v Speaker 1>as they are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.323
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess partly because I don't </v>

6
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:24.110
<v Speaker 1>understand what the alternative is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

7
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.953
<v Speaker 1>I would say that to the degree that men </v>
<v Speaker 1>are just your unjustly upset about the </v>

8
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 1>way the marriage laws are set up and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they have reason to be concerned,</v>

9
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.803
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to the custody </v>
<v Speaker 1>of children and the probability of </v>

10
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:37.464
<v Speaker 1>paying virtually endless alimony with </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably severe penalties for </v>

11
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:43.280
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.423
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's incumbent on men to </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize themselves politically and </v>

13
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.653
<v Speaker 1>rectify that.</v>
