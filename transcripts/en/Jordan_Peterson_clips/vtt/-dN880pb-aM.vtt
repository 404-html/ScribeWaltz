00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of reward as what happens with you</v>

2
00:00:03.101 --> 00:00:05.530
<v Speaker 1>achieved something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not exactly right.</v>

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.393
<v Speaker 1>Not with human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time we feel reward when or </v>

4
00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:12.190
<v Speaker 1>so engagement and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

5
00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:12.680
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

6
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.480
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

7
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.313
<v Speaker 1>and positive the positive desire to move</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward in life when there's evidence </v>

8
00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:22.000
<v Speaker 1>that we're moving towards a valuable </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>

9
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.890
<v Speaker 1>So we're making progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

10
00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:25.180
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're making progress.</v>

11
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.890
<v Speaker 1>There's a real neurochemical kick that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes along with that.</v>

12
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.670
<v Speaker 1>The same system that cocaine effects and</v>
<v Speaker 1>amphetamines.</v>

13
00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>And so with rats for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get wrapped hooked on cocaine if</v>

14
00:00:34.781 --> 00:00:39.610
<v Speaker 1>they're alone in a cage and they'll self</v>
<v Speaker 1>administer cocaine until basically until</v>

15
00:00:39.611 --> 00:00:42.520
<v Speaker 1>they die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they're doing rat things with the</v>

16
00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:43.354
<v Speaker 1>route buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're not that interested in </v>

17
00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:46.090
<v Speaker 1>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

18
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.583
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I'm saying that is </v>

19
00:00:48.461 --> 00:00:51.790
<v Speaker 1>because like a rat who's out with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>rat buddies doing rat things gets enough</v>

20
00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:52.600
<v Speaker 1>reward from that.</v>

21
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.433
<v Speaker 1>So the drugs aren't that attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of the reason that people take </v>

22
00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.893
<v Speaker 1>drugs like cocaine is because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not doing enough things that are deeply </v>

23
00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:02.320
<v Speaker 1>meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

24
00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:03.154
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get meaning unless he got </v>

25
00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:08.470
<v Speaker 1>a name because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your nervous system is wired to give you</v>

26
00:01:08.471 --> 00:01:11.830
<v Speaker 1>a pat on the back when you're making </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress towards your aim.</v>

27
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got to have an aim and the aim</v>

28
00:01:15.821 --> 00:01:18.460
<v Speaker 1>should be high because otherwise why </v>
<v Speaker 1>bother with it,</v>

29
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.833
<v Speaker 1>but it should also be broken down into </v>
<v Speaker 1>steps that you have a reasonably high </v>

30
00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:25.720
<v Speaker 1>probability of attaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

31
00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:27.220
<v Speaker 1>with a kid you want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

32
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.120
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to get your kid to develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

33
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.333
<v Speaker 1>You don't give them an impossible task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You give them a task that's slightly </v>

34
00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:35.920
<v Speaker 1>harder than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they can already do.</v>

35
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're engaged by that.</v>

36
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're a little anxious about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they master it and they've.</v>

37
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.600
<v Speaker 1>They've expanded their domain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>

38
00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:47.080
<v Speaker 1>It's no game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big deal to do that and that kids</v>

39
00:01:47.081 --> 00:01:47.914
<v Speaker 1>love that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's where you learn in that </v>

40
00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:50.044
<v Speaker 1>zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know where you're pushing yourself </v>

41
00:01:51.101 --> 00:01:52.690
<v Speaker 1>just a little bit beyond where you are.</v>
