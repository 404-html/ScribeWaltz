1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.120
<v Speaker 1>It seems indisputable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that the Canadian healthcare</v>

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.503
<v Speaker 1>system is preferable to the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare system except at the very </v>

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.490
<v Speaker 1>highest end and there's a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons for that that would even perhaps</v>

4
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:15.324
<v Speaker 1>appeal to conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is the amount of administrative </v>

5
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:19.674
<v Speaker 1>overhead that spent by Canadian health </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions as far less in Canada than </v>

6
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:23.964
<v Speaker 1>it is in the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because hospitals don't have to </v>

7
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:26.934
<v Speaker 1>collect money so they don't spend 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of their intake on on the </v>

8
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:32.334
<v Speaker 1>financial end of the equation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is approximately the case in the </v>

9
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:35.484
<v Speaker 1>u.</v>
<v Speaker 1>s and everyone has access to healthcare </v>

10
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.233
<v Speaker 1>in Canada and because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our rate of individual entrepreneurship </v>

11
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:42.864
<v Speaker 1>is higher in Canada than it is in the US</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because because people don't </v>

12
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:49.090
<v Speaker 1>have to worry about losing their </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare.</v>

13
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.943
<v Speaker 1>If they switched jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can switch jobs more easily and </v>

14
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:52.854
<v Speaker 1>they can also take risks if they have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>family that can take entrepreneurial </v>

15
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>risks without putting all the health of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their entire family at stake.</v>

16
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.383
<v Speaker 1>So these things can't be broken down </v>
<v Speaker 1>really simply into right wing versus </v>

17
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:05.960
<v Speaker 1>left wing issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right there.</v>

18
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Too complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the overall point is that Canada has</v>

19
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:10.014
<v Speaker 1>done a very good job of having that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation even are socialists are </v>

20
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 1>basically fiscally conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

21
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Although they're not socially </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative,</v>

22
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

23
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.720
<v Speaker 1>there are signs of the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>polarization in Canada that,</v>

24
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>that that's really plaguing the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

25
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:31.840
<v Speaker 1>And of course that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good for the US.</v>

26
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for Europe where it's also</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

27
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's also not good for our country </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want that to happen.</v>

28
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 1>So that's partly why I've been objecting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the more ill advised in radical moves</v>

29
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:46.890
<v Speaker 1>that the so called liberals have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>managing over the last few years.</v>
