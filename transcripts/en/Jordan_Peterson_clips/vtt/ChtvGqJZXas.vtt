00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Nothing motivates me aside from eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sleeping.</v>

2
00:00:02.971 --> 00:00:03.804
<v Speaker 1>I lie in my bed all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one on my computer or my phone not </v>

3
00:00:06.531 --> 00:00:07.364
<v Speaker 1>doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just lie there thinking what's </v>

4
00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:12.170
<v Speaker 1>happening to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that you are.</v>

5
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:13.603
<v Speaker 1>This is not a diagnostic comment and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know enough about you to provide </v>

6
00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:17.234
<v Speaker 1>that sort of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would recommend that you see a </v>

7
00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:21.794
<v Speaker 1>therapist and be screened for depression</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what it looks like to me </v>

8
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.670
<v Speaker 1>and I would say that if it's depression </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should do something about it because</v>

9
00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:29.504
<v Speaker 1>depression is very hard on people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>produces a lot of stress hormones like </v>

10
00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:35.570
<v Speaker 1>cortisol and that can hurt human man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

11
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:37.850
<v Speaker 1>if it's only been a couple of days I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't worry about it,</v>

12
00:00:37.851 --> 00:00:41.060
<v Speaker 1>but if it's a chronic pattern then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should go talk to somebody.</v>

13
00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Even your family doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:46.610
<v Speaker 1>and there's always the possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 1>a low dose of an antidepressant might be</v>

15
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.390
<v Speaker 1>worth trying.</v>

16
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a month if it fixed you.</v>

17
00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:52.400
<v Speaker 1>But I would say don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't stay in that situation now.</v>

18
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go find out,</v>

19
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.090
<v Speaker 1>do whatever you have to do to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

20
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.383
<v Speaker 1>and especially the fact that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your computer and you're not doing </v>

21
00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:00.771
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:02.120
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ruminating,</v>

23
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.133
<v Speaker 1>that's just lying there thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>snoop's of negative emotion and you </v>

24
00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:08.000
<v Speaker 1>don't have any positive emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 1>that's why you're not on your computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>or your phone.</v>

26
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:11.054
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the characteristics of </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression was supposed to have the </v>

27
00:01:14.421 --> 00:01:17.300
<v Speaker 1>characteristics is a decrease in </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive motivation.</v>

28
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.343
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in anything and an increase </v>

29
00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:23.110
<v Speaker 1>in negative emotion and that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself in.</v>

30
00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm just lying there thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.770
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

32
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.500
<v Speaker 1>go talk to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go talk to someone,</v>

33
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.920
<v Speaker 1>tell someone that this is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gift to your family doctor,</v>

34
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.993
<v Speaker 1>let them know what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get them to give you a depression </v>

35
00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:40.430
<v Speaker 1>screening and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and see what you can do about it because</v>

36
00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:43.580
<v Speaker 1>there are effective treatments for </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>

37
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:47.330
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes antidepressants work like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a absolute charm.</v>
