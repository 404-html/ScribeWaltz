<v Speaker 1>You've said that a marriage must be </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on trust and transparency and </v>

2
00:00:03.411 --> 00:00:04.244
<v Speaker 1>being shackled together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How and for how long should you get to </v>

3
00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:09.380
<v Speaker 1>know someone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does set a foundation?</v>

4
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.970
<v Speaker 1>you know there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no simple answer to that.</v>

6
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.183
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.943
<v Speaker 1>I think that you should know someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>well enough so that you can so that you </v>

8
00:00:30.381 --> 00:00:31.214
<v Speaker 1>know if you can negotiate with them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you have started to formulate a </v>

9
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:40.571
<v Speaker 1>vision of your joint future that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>both look forward to with enthusiasm and</v>

10
00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:44.384
<v Speaker 1>confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and of course that's going to depend </v>

11
00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:49.580
<v Speaker 1>to some degree on your level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>maturity,</v>

12
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.443
<v Speaker 1>but that means you've considered such </v>
<v Speaker 1>things as do you have a sufficient </v>

13
00:00:56.151 --> 00:00:56.984
<v Speaker 1>number of joint interests and are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented in the same direction with </v>

14
00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:00.614
<v Speaker 1>regards to how you're going to handle </v>
<v Speaker 1>your joint careers and the possibility </v>

15
00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:04.514
<v Speaker 1>of children and that the manner in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to interact with your in </v>

16
00:01:07.461 --> 00:01:10.310
<v Speaker 1>laws and you have to start thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

17
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.260
<v Speaker 1>You have to start considering your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

18
00:01:15.261 --> 00:01:18.440
<v Speaker 1>From the perspective of practicality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>economics,</v>

19
00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:19.274
<v Speaker 1>I would say so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't just be that massive erotic </v>

20
00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:26.000
<v Speaker 1>attraction that's associated with with </v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

21
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.073
<v Speaker 1>although I think that's extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>important and you're unbelievably </v>

22
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:31.850
<v Speaker 1>fortunate if you have that and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should do everything you can to maintain</v>

23
00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:32.684
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
