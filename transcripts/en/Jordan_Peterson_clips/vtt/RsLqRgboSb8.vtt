00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.390
<v Speaker 1>So what I've been trying to do with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos and,</v>

2
00:00:02.391 --> 00:00:03.224
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.220
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is part of the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they've become so popular,</v>

4
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.420
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm certain of it,</v>

5
00:00:07.421 --> 00:00:08.254
<v Speaker 1>is that I've been trying to agitate for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the adoption of that personal </v>

6
00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:14.680
<v Speaker 1>responsibility as an alternative to </v>
<v Speaker 1>political ideology.</v>

7
00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:18.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like get your act together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a vision,</v>

8
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.090
<v Speaker 1>straighten out your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say what you think,</v>

9
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay away from the ideological idiocies </v>

10
00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:27.940
<v Speaker 1>and simplicity and oversimplifications </v>
<v Speaker 1>and try to put yourself together.</v>

11
00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Because I think that I do believe at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most fundamental level,</v>

12
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.490
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is the remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 1>realization of Western civilization,</v>

13
00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:37.324
<v Speaker 1>is that the well developed individual is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the antidote to the tyranny of society </v>

14
00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:42.274
<v Speaker 1>and biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's our great discovery in </v>

15
00:00:44.831 --> 00:00:47.050
<v Speaker 1>the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like other cultures haven't had</v>

16
00:00:47.051 --> 00:00:47.884
<v Speaker 1>that idea in nascent form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's been hyper developed in the </v>

17
00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:54.610
<v Speaker 1>west and I think it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we abandoned that,</v>

18
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.430
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pathway of divine individuality and</v>

19
00:00:57.431 --> 00:01:00.460
<v Speaker 1>revert to ideological identification of </v>
<v Speaker 1>race or sex.</v>

20
00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:01.294
<v Speaker 1>We're going to tear each other apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the reason we're </v>

21
00:01:03.551 --> 00:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>motivated to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

22
00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:05.644
<v Speaker 1>is because many people don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear the responsibility of developing </v>

23
00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:11.050
<v Speaker 1>themselves as individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they'll,</v>

24
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.320
<v Speaker 1>they'll shuffle off the responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that means that you know,</v>

25
00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:16.900
<v Speaker 1>we're dancing in the streets because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's on fire,</v>

26
00:01:16.901 --> 00:01:17.734
<v Speaker 1>that'll be just fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing that's adding </v>

27
00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.760
<v Speaker 1>to the terrible danger that we're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

28
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.253
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
