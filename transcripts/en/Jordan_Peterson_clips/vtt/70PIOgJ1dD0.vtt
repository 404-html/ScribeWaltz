1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.500
<v Speaker 1>What cures in therapy is truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the curative.</v>

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Now there's exposure to the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid of and avoiding as well,</v>

3
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:08.424
<v Speaker 1>but I would say that's a form of enacted</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth because if you know there's </v>

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.120
<v Speaker 1>something you should do by your own set </v>
<v Speaker 1>of rules and you're avoiding it,</v>

5
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:17.700
<v Speaker 1>then you're enacting a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're not telling one,</v>

6
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>but you're acting went out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same damn thing.</v>

7
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.573
<v Speaker 1>So if I can get you to face what it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're confronting that you know </v>

8
00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:27.800
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be avoiding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what's happening is that we're both</v>

9
00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:28.634
<v Speaker 1>partaking in the process of attempting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to act out your deepest truth and what </v>

10
00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>happens is that that improves people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives and it improves some radically and</v>

11
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.183
<v Speaker 1>the evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clinical evidence for that is </v>

12
00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:41.210
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that if you expose people to the</v>

13
00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:43.040
<v Speaker 1>things they're afraid of but that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're avoiding,</v>

14
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.113
<v Speaker 1>they get better and you have to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully and cautiously and with their </v>

15
00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:47.324
<v Speaker 1>own participation and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of all the things that clinicians </v>

16
00:00:51.221 --> 00:00:53.890
<v Speaker 1>have established that's credible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's number one,</v>

17
00:00:53.891 --> 00:00:58.480
<v Speaker 1>and that's nested inside this deeper </v>
<v Speaker 1>realization that the clinical experience</v>

18
00:00:58.481 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 1>is redemptive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

19
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:01.084
<v Speaker 1>because it is designed to address </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering in so far as the people who </v>

20
00:01:03.881 --> 00:01:04.714
<v Speaker 1>are engaged in the process are both </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling each other the truth and then </v>

21
00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:08.620
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well obviously,</v>

22
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>because if you have some problems and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you come to talk to me about them,</v>

23
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.950
<v Speaker 1>well first of all just by coming to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me about them.</v>

24
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.750
<v Speaker 1>You've admitted that they exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

25
00:01:16.751 --> 00:01:19.510
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty good start in second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:20.344
<v Speaker 1>if you tell me about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we know what they are and then if </v>

27
00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:23.614
<v Speaker 1>we know what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can maybe start to lay out some </v>

28
00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:28.570
<v Speaker 1>solutions and then you can go act out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the solutions and see if they work.</v>

29
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.930
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't admit they're there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't tell me what they are.</v>

30
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.943
<v Speaker 1>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like posturing and acting </v>

31
00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:39.010
<v Speaker 1>egotistically and taking the upper hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>in all of that in our discussions.</v>

32
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell is that going to work?</v>

33
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be comfortable moment to moment</v>

34
00:01:43.391 --> 00:01:45.610
<v Speaker 1>while we stay encapsulated in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>delusion,</v>

35
00:01:45.611 --> 00:01:46.444
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of that seems to think it </v>

36
00:01:49.391 --> 00:01:50.950
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems pretty self evident.</v>

37
00:01:50.951 --> 00:01:54.390
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud thought that repression was at the</v>

38
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>heart of much mental suffering.</v>

39
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.860
<v Speaker 1>The difference between repression and </v>
<v Speaker 1>deception is matter of degree and that's</v>

40
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:03.090
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's technical.</v>

41
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.953
<v Speaker 1>It's a technical differentiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Alfred Adler who was one of Freud's </v>

42
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.360
<v Speaker 1>greatest associates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

43
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:10.194
<v Speaker 1>and much underappreciated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say he thought that people got </v>

44
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 1>into problems because they started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>act out a life lie.</v>

45
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.413
<v Speaker 1>That's what he called it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a life lie that's worth looking up </v>

46
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>because Adler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although not as charismatic as Freud,</v>

47
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.713
<v Speaker 1>was very practical and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really foreshadowed lot of later </v>

48
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:26.124
<v Speaker 1>developments and cybernetic theory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>of course young believed that you could </v>

49
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.400
<v Speaker 1>bypass psychotherapy entirely by merely </v>
<v Speaker 1>making a proper moral effort in your own</v>

50
00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Carl Rogers believed that.</v>

51
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:37.494
<v Speaker 1>It was honest communication mediated </v>
<v Speaker 1>through dialogue that had redemptive </v>

52
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.443
<v Speaker 1>consequences and the behaviors believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you do a careful micro analysis of </v>

53
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:46.794
<v Speaker 1>the problems that are laid before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would help introduce people to what </v>

54
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:50.094
<v Speaker 1>they're avoiding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of those things to me are </v>

55
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:53.034
<v Speaker 1>just secular variations of the notion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that truth will set you free </v>

56
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.173
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>
