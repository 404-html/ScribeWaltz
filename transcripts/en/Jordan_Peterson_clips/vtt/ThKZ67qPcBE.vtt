00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.303
<v Speaker 1>So the temporary victory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also something really good to know </v>

2
00:00:04.251 --> 00:00:05.084
<v Speaker 1>about marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can never win an argument </v>

3
00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:07.874
<v Speaker 1>with your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could if you only lived with </v>

4
00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:11.150
<v Speaker 1>her for one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like I wanna see you later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.121
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7
00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:16.430
<v Speaker 1>she's there the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she's been,</v>

8
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.710
<v Speaker 1>she does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She does remember that.</v>

9
00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even more than you remember it,</v>

10
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.823
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also might be that she was right </v>

11
00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:25.760
<v Speaker 1>and you just out argued her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

12
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that's really worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing too because sometimes you know,</v>

13
00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:30.044
<v Speaker 1>you'll have an argument with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's say with your wife and she's </v>

14
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:35.300
<v Speaker 1>got something to say and it's not very </v>
<v Speaker 1>well articulated.</v>

15
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Same could be true for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can just brush it aside,</v>

16
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.363
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to brush it aside </v>
<v Speaker 1>because maybe there's something there </v>

17
00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:45.830
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't address it then it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not like it's gonna go away,</v>

18
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:46.100
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

19
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.933
<v Speaker 1>It's going to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you have to help her formulate </v>

20
00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:50.324
<v Speaker 1>her argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really annoying because you </v>

21
00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>want to win and you have in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispute,</v>

22
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.160
<v Speaker 1>I want to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

23
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not winning that game.</v>

24
00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:00.050
<v Speaker 1>You're winning the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

25
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:00.884
<v Speaker 1>I think about it as the game of games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to win the set of games that </v>

26
00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:06.470
<v Speaker 1>stretch across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the long war.</v>

27
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

28
00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Exactly where that little battles </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocking,</v>

29
00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:13.130
<v Speaker 1>no matter and in fact you should not try</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be right.</v>

30
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.290
<v Speaker 1>If you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows it's fine,</v>

31
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.960
<v Speaker 1>but there's the worst thing to do is rub</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in and say,</v>

32
00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:20.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm right and you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>You do that 100 times and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're the,</v>

34
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.600
<v Speaker 1>you're the winner and she's the loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's great because now you're</v>

35
00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:28.580
<v Speaker 1>married to a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

37
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.120
<v Speaker 1>If you do that 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

38
00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:35.270
<v Speaker 1>then your marriage is over and then and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then there'll be hell to pay.</v>

39
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.710
<v Speaker 1>You can be sure of that.</v>
