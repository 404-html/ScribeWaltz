1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows that we are social </v>
<v Speaker 1>identities and ideological identities,</v>

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.760
<v Speaker 1>their religious or cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual,</v>

3
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:06.594
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's really paid much attention to </v>

4
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:12.240
<v Speaker 1>studying how the representations of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural identity,</v>

5
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.423
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alter the manner in which we feel </v>

6
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:17.703
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which English is perceived by which we </v>

7
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:21.354
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in how our internal </v>

8
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>representations of our culture modulator</v>
<v Speaker 1>or emotional expression,</v>

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>that's the best way to say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brain basically,</v>

10
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:33.440
<v Speaker 1>it's programmed as your social lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what socialization is for.</v>

11
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.583
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's socialization that </v>
<v Speaker 1>instills cultural identity and equally </v>

12
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:37.974
<v Speaker 1>obviously the process of socialization </v>
<v Speaker 1>that leads to cultural identity has to </v>

13
00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:42.404
<v Speaker 1>have some impact on the way you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously lay that on the way that your </v>

14
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.123
<v Speaker 1>mind functions and the way that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain functions and see North American </v>

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.833
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychologists have been loath to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give any consideration to this sort of </v>

16
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:55.764
<v Speaker 1>notion to think that cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations might have some direct </v>

17
00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>impact on physiological function by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time the Russians.</v>

18
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.853
<v Speaker 1>By contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has been a central tenant of their </v>

19
00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:08.420
<v Speaker 1>nurse neuro psychological theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically since,</v>

20
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.683
<v Speaker 1>since day one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is particularly true with regards </v>

21
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 1>to Alexander learning and the God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

22
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.200
<v Speaker 1>now you can think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite obvious if you think about it</v>

23
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.763
<v Speaker 1>for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to something like the </v>

24
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.270
<v Speaker 1>capacity to read silently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the case that what?</v>

25
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>This is a relatively new talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literacy is a new talent,</v>

26
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:29.394
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people aren't able to read 500 </v>

27
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:31.314
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only been 500 years and only for a </v>

28
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:34.554
<v Speaker 1>little bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the capacity to read has been </v>

29
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:41.271
<v Speaker 1>widespread and the capacity to read </v>
<v Speaker 1>silently as a relatively new development</v>

30
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 1>in human history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a good thing if you think about</v>

31
00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:45.484
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless the capacity to read </v>

32
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:50.760
<v Speaker 1>silently localized to a specific part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain,</v>

33
00:01:50.761 --> 00:01:51.594
<v Speaker 1>which is to say it's as if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the brain that's evolved for </v>

34
00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>that purpose.</v>

35
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.083
<v Speaker 1>It's the same place and everybody more </v>
<v Speaker 1>or less their individual variations or </v>

36
00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:02.280
<v Speaker 1>differences when people are allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize differently,</v>

37
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:05.360
<v Speaker 1>but all that aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you learn to read,</v>

38
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.203
<v Speaker 1>there was a party of this specializes </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that and it's pretty much the same </v>

39
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:09.444
<v Speaker 1>place and everyone and it wasn't there </v>
<v Speaker 1>or wasn't doing that sort of Bot </v>

40
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand years ago,</v>

41
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:16.470
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read at one point,</v>

42
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:17.304
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where the reference to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like so many things that I make </v>

43
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:21.624
<v Speaker 1>reference to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've had at one point that people </v>

44
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:23.874
<v Speaker 1>thought Julius Caesar was a magician in </v>
<v Speaker 1>part and he was obviously a remarkable </v>

45
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:27.684
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in part because he can read </v>

46
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>silently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't have to read aloud,</v>

47
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>so it wasn't just reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was remarkable.</v>

48
00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:35.190
<v Speaker 1>It was being able to read without </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

49
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.683
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point of all this is that your </v>

50
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:41.560
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is learning.</v>

51
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.060
<v Speaker 1>His view of the brain fundamentally is </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain is an organ that produces sub</v>

52
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:47.270
<v Speaker 1>organs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally specific subordinates,</v>

53
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.143
<v Speaker 1>not since that's it's remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity is that it can generate new </v>

54
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.670
<v Speaker 1>molecules that are specialized for </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain tasks.</v>

55
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence of environmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

56
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.023
<v Speaker 1>This is an interesting notion which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say that at some level of </v>

57
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>physiological analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least your culture determines how you</v>

58
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>bring worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

59
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 1>it's very plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brain is very plastic.</v>

60
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:11.764
<v Speaker 1>When were a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sustain immense amounts of </v>

61
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>critical damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In childhood.</v>

62
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I still grow up normally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

63
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 1>if you're a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very epileptic as a child,</v>

64
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>sometimes what surgeons will do is take </v>
<v Speaker 1>out a whole hemisphere,</v>

65
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.653
<v Speaker 1>the right hemisphere on and children who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have hysterectomy is if they're done </v>

66
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 1>young enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still brought to be relatively normal,</v>

67
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>quite normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

68
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>in the other cases too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people are hydrocephalic,</v>

69
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:40.840
<v Speaker 1>which basically means that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>ventricles don't vamped properly,</v>

70
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.933
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cerebral spinal fluid builds up in </v>

71
00:03:44.211 --> 00:03:44.670
<v Speaker 1>the scouts.</v>

72
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 1>These people often have stalls that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly larger than normal,</v>

73
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.770
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what steel case.</v>

74
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.693
<v Speaker 1>And they ended up with a skull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's essentially full of liquid with a </v>

75
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:55.714
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very thin layer of brain tissue around </v>

76
00:03:57.431 --> 00:03:58.264
<v Speaker 1>this is all liquid and there are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of case reports of people who </v>

77
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:04.354
<v Speaker 1>have like five percent of the fishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>tact who have high functioning </v>

78
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:09.580
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His normal personality,</v>

79
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>so point is your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the higher cortical levels of</v>

80
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:16.190
<v Speaker 1>your brain are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very functionally flexible.</v>

81
00:04:16.191 --> 00:04:18.480
<v Speaker 1>We can childhood now by the time you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have adult,</v>

82
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pattern changes a little bit.</v>

83
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Guy Of looks like your brain dies into </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's adult configuration.</v>

84
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:27.840
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting at which is to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have way more neurons need,</v>

85
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 1>especially right before you're born and </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

86
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>prunes your brain down to its adult </v>
<v Speaker 1>configuration,</v>

87
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 1>so of course you develop connections as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

88
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:39.634
<v Speaker 1>but if you lose a lot of neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so by the time you're an adult you're </v>

89
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:45.124
<v Speaker 1>brain is nowhere near as flexible as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was when you were a child and if you </v>

90
00:04:47.031 --> 00:04:47.864
<v Speaker 1>have sustained damage to certain parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of you that are already specialized </v>

91
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:51.994
<v Speaker 1>while you hold any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the damage and you can work around </v>

92
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.363
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can still be really prominent </v>

93
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

94
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 1>So that's sort of the market and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

95
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.900
<v Speaker 1>that's right because the brain adapts or</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the body.</v>

96
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a great comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

97
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.460
<v Speaker 1>and if you start thinking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has really revolutionary implication.</v>

98
00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:10.930
<v Speaker 1>So you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

99
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.973
<v Speaker 1>if I have an idea that's really radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sense that changes the </v>

100
00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:19.300
<v Speaker 1>configuration of my core tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can transmit that maybe not to you.</v>

101
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your brain is already fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

102
00:05:21.611 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Put down the generations and altered the</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of brains,</v>

103
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:25.450
<v Speaker 1>hand sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could say,</v>

104
00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:26.284
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas can spread through a population </v>

105
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:30.480
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lamarckian spread.</v>

106
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.030
<v Speaker 1>Even more interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is speculative of course,</v>

107
00:05:34.031 --> 00:05:39.031
<v Speaker 1>but let's say that there are certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>types of revolutions in thought that are</v>

108
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:42.190
<v Speaker 1>actually the consequences of biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutations.</v>

109
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.370
<v Speaker 1>So you could sing that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a particularly odd sort of person</v>

110
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:48.010
<v Speaker 1>from the genetic perspective and as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence you think,</v>

111
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 1>and a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unique matter.</v>

112
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.063
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that's so interesting is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you can still communicate those </v>

113
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:57.100
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the effect of that genetic mutation</v>

114
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 1>be transmitted throughout the population</v>
<v Speaker 1>without any biological alteration at the</v>

115
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 1>genetic level at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's really something,</v>

116
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.173
<v Speaker 1>something that's interesting because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means that the consequences of genetic </v>

117
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:09.494
<v Speaker 1>mutation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in competition can spread throughout </v>

118
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>the population is fast as communication </v>
<v Speaker 1>could move.</v>

119
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

120
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 1>the Lamarckian everybody know what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmission is.</v>

121
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.183
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lamarck was the character who thought </v>

122
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:21.524
<v Speaker 1>that the reason that that you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can transmit acquired </v>

123
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Speaker 1>characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reason drafts at Lomax is because</v>

124
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.120
<v Speaker 1>it kept trying to stretch their next </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

125
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.233
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they transmitted the capacity to do </v>

126
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:35.114
<v Speaker 1>stretching to their offspring so you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>transmit acquired characteristics down </v>

127
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 1>the genetic line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no,</v>

128
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.290
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong.</v>

129
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:43.124
<v Speaker 1>But that's what Lamar thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he wasn't completely wrong because </v>

130
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:45.944
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is how this sort of transmission </v>

131
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's non genetically mediated cumulation</v>

132
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 1>of biological resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's very interesting.</v>
