00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.013
<v Speaker 1>The radical left leaning anti theist </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentalists tend to make the case </v>

2
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:08.754
<v Speaker 1>that the predations of the Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalist system are a consequence of </v>

3
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:15.234
<v Speaker 1>the injunction that was delivered in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Genesis by God to man to go out and </v>

4
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.600
<v Speaker 1>dominate the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Suzuki has talked a lot about this</v>

5
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.463
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They believe that that statement has </v>

6
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.233
<v Speaker 1>given rise to our inappropriate </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption that we have the right to </v>

7
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:35.874
<v Speaker 1>exert control over the world and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's turned us into these </v>

8
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.163
<v Speaker 1>terrible predatory monsters sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>described as counselors on the face of </v>

9
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:45.414
<v Speaker 1>the earth or viruses that have inhabited</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire ecosystem who are doing </v>

10
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>nothing but one wandering everywhere and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wreaking havoc as rapidly as we possibly</v>

11
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:53.754
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is another perspective on the </v>

12
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.490
<v Speaker 1>essential element of humankind that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>find absolutely deplorable.</v>

13
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the historical record,</v>

14
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even casually,</v>

15
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 1>you'll find out that as early as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as late as the late 18 hundreds,</v>

16
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>95,</v>

17
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>thereabouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Huxley,</v>

18
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>who was Elvis Huxley's grandfather and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>great defender of Darwin,</v>

19
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.433
<v Speaker 1>prepared a report for the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>government on ocean sustainability and </v>

20
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>his conclusion was fish away.</v>

21
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

22
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.203
<v Speaker 1>there are so many fish out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oceans are so inexhaustible that no </v>

23
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>matter how hard humanity tried for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for any number of years,</v>

24
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.633
<v Speaker 1>the probability that we could do more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than put a dent in what was out there </v>

25
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>was zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Huxley turned out to be wrong.</v>

26
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>He didn't realize that our population </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to spike so dramatically,</v>

27
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:42.594
<v Speaker 1>partly because we got a little bit rich </v>
<v Speaker 1>and our children's stopped dying at the </v>

28
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:48.970
<v Speaker 1>rate of 60 percent before they were one </v>
<v Speaker 1>years old and you know,</v>

29
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.650
<v Speaker 1>we actually managed to populate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth with a few people,</v>

30
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:53.484
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't really until 1960 or so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we woke up to the fact that there </v>

31
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:57.144
<v Speaker 1>were so many of us that we actually had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to start paying attention to what we </v>

32
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:02.460
<v Speaker 1>were doing to the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's like what 50 years ago?</v>

33
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:03.294
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've just started to develop the </v>

34
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.143
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the wherewithal to understand that </v>

35
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.383
<v Speaker 1>the whole world might be well considered</v>
<v Speaker 1>a garden and we need to live inside the </v>

36
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:16.170
<v Speaker 1>proper balance between culture and order</v>
<v Speaker 1>or culture and,</v>

37
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and chaos.</v>

38
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.553
<v Speaker 1>Before that we were spending all of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>time just trying not to die and usually </v>

39
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:24.714
<v Speaker 1>very unsuccessfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't agree with that </v>

40
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of the opening section of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Genesis.</v>

41
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:31.614
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that it's given human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being has the right to act as super </v>

42
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:35.994
<v Speaker 1>predators on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that instead the proper </v>

43
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.180
<v Speaker 1>environment for human beings is </v>
<v Speaker 1>presented quite properly as a garden and</v>

44
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 1>that the role of people and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>explicitly stated in,</v>

45
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.063
<v Speaker 1>in the second story of Adam and Eve was </v>
<v Speaker 1>to tend the garden and that means to </v>

46
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:51.024
<v Speaker 1>make the proper decisions and to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that everything thrives and </v>

47
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:54.084
<v Speaker 1>flourishes and and so that it's good for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that are living there that </v>

48
00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>aren't just people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also good for the people too.</v>

49
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>So fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we can.</v>

50
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.623
<v Speaker 1>We could least note that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly different take on the story </v>

51
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:06.484
<v Speaker 1>than the that ultimately cynical </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation that's so commonly put </v>

52
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:10.624
<v Speaker 1>forward today.</v>
