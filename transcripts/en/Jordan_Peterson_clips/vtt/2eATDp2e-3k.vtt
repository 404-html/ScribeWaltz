00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.660
<v Speaker 1>One piece of evidence that I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so well,</v>

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:04.494
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One I would derive from friends to wall </v>

3
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>who's a famous primatologist and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>studied,</v>

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.413
<v Speaker 1>he studied the prototype morality that </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerges in chimpanzees and it's very </v>

5
00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>much rest nested in their dominant </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures,</v>

6
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:17.514
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you could think of morality in </v>

7
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:19.554
<v Speaker 1>some sense as the understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules by which the dominance hierarchy </v>

8
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>operates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

9
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

10
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugliest,</v>

11
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:27.504
<v Speaker 1>meanest chimp and the male dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies in chimps seemed to be the </v>

12
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:31.044
<v Speaker 1>predominant ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the females also have a </v>

13
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite so clear in Bonobos,</v>

14
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 1>which seemed to be more female </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominated.</v>

15
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:40.260
<v Speaker 1>But in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the champ.</v>

16
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Primary chimp dominant structure is male</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could think,</v>

17
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:44.394
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the.</v>
