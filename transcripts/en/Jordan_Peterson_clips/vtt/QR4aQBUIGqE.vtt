1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.450
<v Speaker 1>We talked a little bit about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 1>over a drink we had a couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

3
00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:07.080
<v Speaker 1>but what about the couples that have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.660
<v Speaker 1>couples that just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:10.494
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're more interested in our </v>

6
00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>intellectual pursuits or traveling or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

7
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>You think they are really missing sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like a key component of,</v>

8
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.930
<v Speaker 1>of what life is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

9
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.420
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that.</v>

10
00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:21.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they don't.</v>

11
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.740
<v Speaker 2>I think the kids have a bad rap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>

12
00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:27.200
<v Speaker 2>That's also why I wrote this chapter in </v>
<v Speaker 2>part because,</v>

13
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see this too,</v>

14
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 2>a lot of Hollywood depictions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>children's,</v>

15
00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 2>very rare that you see children </v>
<v Speaker 2>portrayed knowably in,</v>

16
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.780
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

17
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.810
<v Speaker 2>in a Hollywood film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kind of saw with Harry Potter.</v>

18
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.450
<v Speaker 2>I liked that and that's partly why that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was so popular.</v>

19
00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:43.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean those kids had some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

20
00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:45.740
<v Speaker 2>there were bad kids and they were good </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids and they're heroic kids.</v>

21
00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Like they were treated pretty in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>

22
00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:50.330
<v Speaker 2>realistically given that it was such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>magical,</v>

23
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enterprise and,</v>

24
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.473
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had some courage and they had </v>

25
00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:57.140
<v Speaker 2>some heart and they had some </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebelliousness and so,</v>

26
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.243
<v Speaker 2>so I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing that you have to </v>

27
00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:02.960
<v Speaker 2>understand about kids is they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably good company,</v>

28
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they pay you back for your care </v>

29
00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:11.070
<v Speaker 2>of them and by being ridiculously a </v>
<v Speaker 2>music there,</v>

30
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.963
<v Speaker 2>their little clouds and they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy little stunts all the time and </v>

31
00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:17.210
<v Speaker 2>they have a sense of humor that kicks </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

32
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.210
<v Speaker 2>Like I have a grandchild now that's two </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half months old and that child can</v>

33
00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:26.750
<v Speaker 2>already smile and has the beginnings of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a sense of humor.</v>

34
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.771
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

35
00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:29.840
<v Speaker 2>that's a miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

36
00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:32.360
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're very funny.</v>

37
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.460
<v Speaker 2>They're really playful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really,</v>

38
00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:35.294
<v Speaker 2>really like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can have the kind of </v>

39
00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 2>relationship with them that you set out </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have.</v>

40
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.550
<v Speaker 2>And so that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very interesting now.</v>

41
00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:45.830
<v Speaker 2>And you can also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like once I had little kids,</v>

42
00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:48.740
<v Speaker 2>I spent a lot more time with them than I</v>
<v Speaker 2>did with my friends.</v>

43
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.603
<v Speaker 2>Say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that was that I </v>

44
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:53.114
<v Speaker 2>actually found it more enjoyable to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>things with little kids than with the </v>

45
00:01:56.541 --> 00:01:59.180
<v Speaker 2>adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is like,</v>

46
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.103
<v Speaker 2>by the time you're 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say you've seen so much of the world </v>

47
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.080
<v Speaker 2>that you actually don't see the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

48
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.150
<v Speaker 2>And this is technically true.</v>

49
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 55 when I walked down the street,</v>

50
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.800
<v Speaker 2>there's houses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't look at them,</v>

51
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 2>I have house icons in my memory and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just see the house icons and,</v>

52
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:18.384
<v Speaker 2>and so the older you get in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more what you see of the world is </v>

53
00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:25.430
<v Speaker 2>your memory and that's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's efficient,</v>

54
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:27.670
<v Speaker 2>but it's sort of dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

55
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.720
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and artists help break through that.</v>

56
00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:34.640
<v Speaker 2>They show you something as if it's new </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

57
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.750
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

58
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.010
<v Speaker 2>and so that's why van Gogh's irises will</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell for $160,000,000.</v>

59
00:02:40.011 --> 00:02:43.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like you haven't looked at flowers </v>
<v Speaker 2>since you were three.</v>

60
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.623
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thing that's cool about having </v>

61
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:46.574
<v Speaker 2>little kid is everywhere you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we're so good at putting </v>

62
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:55.070
<v Speaker 2>ourselves in other people's bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kid revitalizes the world.</v>

63
00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:56.120
<v Speaker 2>And the kid's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

64
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what a two year old looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>like all the time.</v>

65
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 2>They're just completely awestruck by </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

66
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 2>And you can see that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really interesting</v>

67
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.753
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you know about my love of star </v>

68
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:08.884
<v Speaker 1>wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I watched empire strikes back with </v>

69
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>my five year old at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nephew.</v>

70
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.730
<v Speaker 1>And at the moment when darth vader told </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was his father,</v>

71
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.573
<v Speaker 1>I was staring at him and he loves star </v>
<v Speaker 1>wars and I was looking at him and the </v>

72
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>way his eyes opened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

73
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

74
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing,</v>

75
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>like that's what it's all about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it's all like as an adult.</v>

76
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 1>How could I ever as a 41 year old have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that experience again?</v>

77
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:33.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about and,</v>

78
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>and a movie is art.</v>

79
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

80
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:36.784
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took my daughter to see the mask with </v>

81
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 2>Jim Carrey when she gets like a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit young for that.</v>

82
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I held her on my lap during,</v>

83
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 2>I think she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was probably only about five,</v>

84
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.170
<v Speaker 2>maybe something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I took her out one night.</v>

85
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.370
<v Speaker 2>We went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw the mask and it's pretty intense and</v>

86
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.213
<v Speaker 2>it was like holding a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call a bundle of </v>

87
00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 2>electrically charged barbed wire for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour and a half.</v>

88
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 2>She was just like that and like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was perhaps a bit much for her,</v>

89
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.690
<v Speaker 2>but he had the knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was exactly.</v>

90
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.190
<v Speaker 2>But I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

91
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 2>you forget how much impact the world has</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

92
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 2>if you bring little kids around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old people,</v>

93
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 2>you can really see this [inaudible] old </v>
<v Speaker 2>people will sit around.</v>

94
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 2>Like when we first had my daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she was the first grandchild on my,</v>

95
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.693
<v Speaker 2>my side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd take her up to this lake that I go </v>

96
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 2>to see my parents that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hell up in northern Alberta.</v>

97
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.663
<v Speaker 2>And she was like a little fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how people sit around a fire </v>

98
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 2>and look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't look away.</v>

99
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.613
<v Speaker 2>It's because we're all the descendants </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the first crazy chimpanzee who </v>

100
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 2>couldn't keep his God dammit fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

101
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.170
<v Speaker 2>And that's what little kids are like </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

102
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.013
<v Speaker 2>and the older people just watch them </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonstop and it's partly because they're </v>

103
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:49.600
<v Speaker 2>participating in that renewal of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

104
00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:50.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>

105
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:51.634
<v Speaker 2>it's like a reintroduction to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unsalted paradise of being something </v>

106
00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:58.390
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it only works if the,</v>

107
00:04:58.391 --> 00:04:59.224
<v Speaker 2>if you like your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a disciplinary element </v>

108
00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:03.064
<v Speaker 2>that's really important too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that modern </v>

109
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:05.824
<v Speaker 2>parents don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is because of the </v>

110
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 2>exceptionally permissive ethos of the 19</v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties,</v>

111
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:15.220
<v Speaker 2>were when we developed this idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that society does to children</v>

112
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:20.221
<v Speaker 2>is bad and so don't damage your children</v>
<v Speaker 2>by putting restrictions on them.</v>

113
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.873
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just not so wrong that it's </v>

114
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:24.274
<v Speaker 2>almost impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's why people shy away from kids </v>

115
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.453
<v Speaker 2>because they don't understand that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to put up with any </v>

116
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.563
<v Speaker 2>unpleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to put up with any </v>

117
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:37.210
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary unpleasant nonsense from </v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

118
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessary.</v>

119
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.080
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the.</v>

120
00:05:40.081 --> 00:05:40.914
<v Speaker 1>You could almost argue that the sixties </v>
<v Speaker 1>led to exactly what you're talking </v>

121
00:05:45.181 --> 00:05:46.014
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These kids who then were taught to be </v>

122
00:05:47.611 --> 00:05:50.190
<v Speaker 1>afraid of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They become a mess there,</v>

123
00:05:50.191 --> 00:05:51.024
<v Speaker 1>the parents have now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's probably in part why they're </v>

124
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>having less children or at least talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about family and children in a</v>

125
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 2>different way when there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also less trust in the structure</v>

126
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 2>of the family because the divorce rate </v>
<v Speaker 2>has proliferated and it's hard.</v>

127
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.983
<v Speaker 2>Like there was a woman in our department</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the psychology department who's </v>

128
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 2>allison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's Helen's last name?</v>

129
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 2>She's going to hate me if she ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>watches this.</v>

130
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.710
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll post the full post.</v>

131
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get it the second week </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hope that's right.</v>

132
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 2>It's probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

133
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.113
<v Speaker 2>she showed that if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you interfere with the maternal </v>

134
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 2>relationship between rats and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>pops because children are called pops,</v>

135
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.453
<v Speaker 2>that you can see the detrimental effects</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that disruption three generations </v>

136
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:37.130
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

137
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

138
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.953
<v Speaker 2>you disrupt those early bonds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you disrupt the familial structure that </v>

139
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 2>echoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes.</v>

140
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like an oral tradition in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>

141
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:46.394
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because being a good mother is not just </v>

142
00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 2>something that you're taught.</v>

143
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.470
<v Speaker 2>It's something that you kind of have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your bones.</v>

144
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 2>If you were mothered properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my father was an excellent father,</v>

145
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:55.663
<v Speaker 2>especially when I was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really spent a lot of time with me </v>

146
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.430
<v Speaker 2>and I used to love it when he came home </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

147
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.460
<v Speaker 2>and like I have a natural affinity for </v>
<v Speaker 2>little kids and I do believe it's,</v>

148
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:07.803
<v Speaker 2>it's in large part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's because I just know how </v>

149
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:12.254
<v Speaker 2>to react with them and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe it's because of the way </v>

150
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:17.270
<v Speaker 2>that I was treated when I was little </v>
<v Speaker 2>kit.</v>

151
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.463
<v Speaker 2>You disrupt that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like lots of people don't trust </v>

152
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:20.804
<v Speaker 2>themselves as parents say because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were hurt or they didn't have good role </v>

153
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:26.450
<v Speaker 2>models or they don't trust the familial </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>

154
00:07:26.451 --> 00:07:30.470
<v Speaker 2>And so you know that all that all makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>people afraid.</v>
