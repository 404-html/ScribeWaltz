1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.953
<v Speaker 1>There are experiments where people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>task is to pick up an object and they </v>

2
00:00:06.491 --> 00:00:09.990
<v Speaker 1>can see the object in front of so you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>given the task.</v>

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.853
<v Speaker 1>That's the basic story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story is what you're required to do </v>

4
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.203
<v Speaker 1>is to transform yourself from the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are now into the person who has a </v>

5
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.353
<v Speaker 1>possession that watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the standard laboratory </v>

6
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 1>experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the watch is actually not there.</v>

7
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.343
<v Speaker 1>It's an image that's generated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirrors and when you move towards the </v>

8
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:32.214
<v Speaker 1>watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find that it's not where it appears </v>

9
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:34.710
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

10
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.743
<v Speaker 1>the fact of the object not being where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it appears to be is an anomaly with </v>

11
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>regards to your current plan and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>react to that emotion.</v>

12
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that'll happen is </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you're going to be surprised,</v>

13
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.213
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think this is pretty easy on you to </v>

14
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>pick that up and you find out that thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you see as low actually there.</v>

15
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 1>That's an anomaly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You contrast at your desired future,</v>

16
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:00.654
<v Speaker 1>which was your aim when you moved your </v>
<v Speaker 1>arm with the actual outcome of your </v>

17
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:05.094
<v Speaker 1>actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so part of your brain called the </v>

18
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:07.344
<v Speaker 1>hippocampus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be responsible for </v>

19
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:11.214
<v Speaker 1>comparing what's actually going on in so</v>
<v Speaker 1>far as you can interpret that with what </v>

20
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:15.714
<v Speaker 1>you want to have and if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a mismatch occurs that sets up the </v>

21
00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:20.624
<v Speaker 1>whole sequence related to events and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those events manifest themselves in </v>

22
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>emotion and in thought and in behave </v>
<v Speaker 1>most evidently and emotion.</v>

23
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.473
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done it before and it doesn't </v>

24
00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:36.810
<v Speaker 1>work out the way you expected it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Events that constitute the anomaly,</v>

25
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>the unexpected occurrence there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising,</v>

26
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>and the question then is what does </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising mean?</v>

27
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.003
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it basically means that something </v>

28
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>threatening as occurred in something.</v>

29
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what does the unknown me?</v>

30
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about them unknown is that you</v>

31
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>don't know what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty.</v>

32
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty straightforward statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see that immediately.</v>

33
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.623
<v Speaker 1>That immediately introduced as a string </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of paradox because you lack </v>

34
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>infinite information for obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't know what they're doing all</v>

35
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:12.234
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that you come into contact </v>

36
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>with things that you don't understand a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot and that means in a sense,</v>

37
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.953
<v Speaker 1>but you have to know what to do when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what to do because you don't </v>

38
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:26.240
<v Speaker 1>know what to do a lot and that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't just bring into a halt.</v>

39
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 1>What is the case?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then?</v>

40
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.003
<v Speaker 1>Your nervous system is hardwired to move</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a sort of default position when the </v>

41
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:35.940
<v Speaker 1>plans to be explicit plans that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

42
00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:39.120
<v Speaker 1>that you're carrying out sale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as long as you could say in a sense,</v>

43
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.163
<v Speaker 1>as long as you know what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that you have a </v>

44
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.760
<v Speaker 1>representation of where you are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you'd like to be.</v>

45
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.863
<v Speaker 1>You're carrying out your plans to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>the move and things are going according </v>

46
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 1>to plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as you're doing that,</v>

47
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:54.130
<v Speaker 1>then the higher centers in your of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

48
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.810
<v Speaker 1>the cortex basically it's under control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what you're doing.</v>

49
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>You feel comfortable and secure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as something unexpected happens,</v>

50
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.513
<v Speaker 1>the control shifts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that basically </v>

51
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 1>beyond your capacity to control whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can interfere with the process,</v>

52
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.263
<v Speaker 1>control shifts from the cortical centers</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the more fundamental areas of the </v>

53
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the limbic system.</v>

54
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 1>When something unexpected happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two things occur.</v>

55
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.743
<v Speaker 1>You start to feel a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and it's not unexpected </v>

56
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 1>occurrences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really unexpected.</v>

57
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:25.894
<v Speaker 1>You'll be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very frightened because just minor </v>

58
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>something minor league unexpected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll just stop.</v>

59
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Your sensory processing will heightened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll gather more information and you'll</v>

60
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.963
<v Speaker 1>explore and as you explore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you generate information and the </v>

61
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:41.680
<v Speaker 1>information is supposed to bring me back</v>
<v Speaker 1>on course basically,</v>

62
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:42.514
<v Speaker 1>so you'll say what you'll do if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to reach for the wash and you </v>

63
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:48.244
<v Speaker 1>find out that it isn't great this while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll start making different sorts of </v>

64
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:55.010
<v Speaker 1>approach sequences until you end up </v>
<v Speaker 1>producing the outcome that you attended.</v>

65
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.113
<v Speaker 1>When something unexpected occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two sets of circuitry or activated one </v>

66
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 1>looks like it's dominated by the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere.</v>

67
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Now it looks like it's dominated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left hemisphere.</v>

68
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Unexpected things make you anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curious,</v>

69
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 1>and you've been localized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those emotions in the body,</v>

70
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:17.380
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety is the emotion that accompany is</v>

71
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 1>the cessation of your body's clam </v>
<v Speaker 1>directed activities.</v>

72
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.983
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's you could say that anxiety is </v>

73
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:27.360
<v Speaker 1>what you feel when you slip into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motor.</v>

74
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Pause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pause for further analysis.</v>

75
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.740
<v Speaker 1>What do you expect it to happen so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to stop.</v>

76
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Curiosity is what you feel when it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary for you to explore further,</v>

77
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:40.210
<v Speaker 1>to gather new information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to update your plans,</v>

78
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.523
<v Speaker 1>and exploration is basically governed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interplay of the circuitry brain </v>

79
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:47.080
<v Speaker 1>circuitry that mediates anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity.</v>

80
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

81
00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:52.350
<v Speaker 1>and that's associated with positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions and anxiety as you all know was</v>

82
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.363
<v Speaker 1>associated.</v>

83
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 1>That's a negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would rather not experience it.</v>

84
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.063
<v Speaker 1>Curiosity or surprise is basically the </v>
<v Speaker 1>juxtaposition of those two sets of </v>

85
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:01.894
<v Speaker 1>emotions which work antagonistically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The unknown produces conflict all by </v>

86
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:06.214
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a hard wired response to the </v>

87
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.423
<v Speaker 1>emergence of the unexpected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to because they have to know </v>

88
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:13.040
<v Speaker 1>what to do when something unexpected </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurs.</v>

89
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.013
<v Speaker 1>It's instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your instinctive response to the </v>

90
00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:19.030
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's anxiety plus curiosity,</v>

91
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.953
<v Speaker 1>which is to say cessation of ongoing </v>
<v Speaker 1>motor activity plus a drive to move </v>

92
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>forward and explore and your exploratory</v>
<v Speaker 1>activities.</v>

93
00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:27.514
<v Speaker 1>Actually the sum total of the activation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the two sets of circuitry that </v>

94
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:33.960
<v Speaker 1>mediate that response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you explore,</v>

95
00:05:33.961 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Speaker 1>if you explore something unexpected </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>

96
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:37.204
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to explore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can note it and get the hell out of </v>

97
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:39.964
<v Speaker 1>there safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't gather any new </v>

98
00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good short term strategy.</v>

99
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good long term strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

100
00:05:46.331 --> 00:05:50.440
<v Speaker 1>the point is the surprise activities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity,</v>

101
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.810
<v Speaker 1>and it tells you 40 generate new </v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

102
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:53.644
<v Speaker 1>you update your plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and soon you can get to where you want </v>

103
00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:56.164
<v Speaker 1>it to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is the mismatch between what </v>

104
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 1>you expect to happen and what actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

105
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.660
<v Speaker 1>That explains it.</v>
