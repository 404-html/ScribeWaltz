00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.933
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that there's a right number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of children to have as you're saying </v>

2
00:00:04.061 --> 00:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That popped in my head.</v>

3
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come from a good number</v>

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have one child,</v>

5
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's terrible man.</v>

6
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:14.364
<v Speaker 1>Like what the Hell is wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hard to have one child because </v>

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.123
<v Speaker 1>children first of all socialize each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and they amuse each other and so </v>

8
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:25.554
<v Speaker 1>we've found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have two kids and then my wife </v>

9
00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:27.924
<v Speaker 1>also took care of a couple of neighbor </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids that actually in some ways made </v>

10
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:31.764
<v Speaker 1>things easier because the kids will just</v>
<v Speaker 1>run off and amuse themselves and then </v>

11
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>what you have to be is around when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a problem,</v>

12
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want you around and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't necessarily want them around.</v>

13
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 1>You have adult things to do right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With one child you've got the problem of</v>

14
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:45.294
<v Speaker 1>having to amuse the child all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the child has the problem of not </v>

15
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>having siblings to hash things out at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a peer to peer level.</v>

16
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.150
<v Speaker 1>And I think that maybe that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons the overprotected child,</v>

17
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to university phenomena has </v>

18
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:07.491
<v Speaker 1>emerged is because children are now </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly produced by older couples,</v>

19
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>so who are more intent on doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything right for them.</v>

20
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 1>But they also don't have enough siblings</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're not getting sorta,</v>

21
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.093
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like puppies that haven't had </v>

22
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>enough rough and tumble play with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>puppies.</v>

23
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.940
<v Speaker 1>And they're really like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

24
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.893
<v Speaker 1>and that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know from the animal developmental </v>

25
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like even with rats,</v>

26
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.973
<v Speaker 1>I'm social animals don't do that well </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless they have peers to get into it </v>

27
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:34.140
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.820
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of socialization takes place </v>
<v Speaker 1>between peers and so.</v>

29
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.253
<v Speaker 1>So I would say to kids minimum because </v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you have kids and they can </v>

30
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 1>amuse each other and maybe three is </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice,</v>

31
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.433
<v Speaker 1>but one is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is I do not believe that one is </v>

32
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>easier than two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that.</v>
