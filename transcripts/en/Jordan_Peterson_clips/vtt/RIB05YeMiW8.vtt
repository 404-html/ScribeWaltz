1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick question.</v>

2
00:00:01.981 --> 00:00:02.814
<v Speaker 1>Are you a Christian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the most straightforward </v>

3
00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>answer to that is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I think it's.</v>

4
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Let's leave it at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm a bit dissatisfied with that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are so many kinds of Christians.</v>

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:26.743
<v Speaker 1>there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are truths to other than the </v>

8
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:31.630
<v Speaker 1>literal that perhaps are more truthful </v>
<v Speaker 1>than even literal truth.</v>

9
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.443
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are many kinds of truth and I </v>

10
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.723
<v Speaker 1>don't mean that in A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean that in a postmodern way </v>

11
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:39.384
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truths that govern behavior and </v>

12
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:45.230
<v Speaker 1>the truths that emerged from facts are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the same truths.</v>

13
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.930
<v Speaker 1>What do you do you believe that Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 1>rose again from the day I find it.</v>

14
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I cannot answer that question and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason is because.</v>

15
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.753
<v Speaker 1>Let me think about it for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if I can come up with a reasonable </v>

16
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:13.131
<v Speaker 1>answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

17
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:14.623
<v Speaker 1>the first answer would be it depends on </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you mean by Jesus and historical </v>

18
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.903
<v Speaker 1>human being that existed in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a physical body and then it was </v>

19
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:32.331
<v Speaker 1>on earth that was literally was </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally came back to life after death.</v>

20
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I would say that at the moment I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>agnostic about that issue,</v>

21
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>which is a lot different than saying I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't believe for it's happened.</v>

22
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Explain why when I get to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I get to the New Testament,</v>

23
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:01.794
<v Speaker 1>in my biblical lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll spend like six hours trying to </v>

24
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:04.824
<v Speaker 1>explain what I think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things I have come to </v>

25
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:10.314
<v Speaker 1>learn over the last 15 years in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in particular is that the </v>

26
00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>world is a theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>

27
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.270
<v Speaker 1>strange place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's far stranger than we think and what</v>

28
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:19.104
<v Speaker 1>we don't understand about consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and its relationship with the body was </v>

29
00:02:22.131 --> 00:02:22.964
<v Speaker 1>still many books and you could say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing about our relationship with </v>

30
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>time and perhaps corporality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability and all and death for that</v>

31
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:31.494
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

32
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.650
<v Speaker 1>So I don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The structure of being well enough to to</v>

33
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 1>to make my way through the complexities </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the resurrection story.</v>

34
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.713
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's the most mysterious </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of the biblical stories to me </v>

35
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.800
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps I'm not alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is now.</v>

36
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.953
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the central.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the central drama and in the </v>

37
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.573
<v Speaker 1>Christian Corpus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

38
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.630
<v Speaker 1>but I don't believe that it's reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>to boil it down to something like,</v>

39
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>do you believe that or do you not </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that?</v>

40
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.860
<v Speaker 1>You know it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's I don't know what the limits.</v>

41
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the limits of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>

42
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.973
<v Speaker 1>I don't know intriguing because I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>very much has you down as somebody sold </v>

43
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>us essentially projections of the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

44
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.083
<v Speaker 1>They are that and I could say I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>say the death and resurrection of Jesus </v>

45
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.243
<v Speaker 1>Christ symbolizes the necessity of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche to a sequence of deaths and </v>

46
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 1>rebirths attainment of the ideal.</v>

47
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.660
<v Speaker 1>That's what I expected you to say is </v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

48
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a phoenix story.</v>

49
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 1>No know the actual facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It started.</v>

50
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 1>The thing is is that just because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

51
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.280
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that's all true about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I also don't know.</v>

52
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

53
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.573
<v Speaker 1>in order to stay alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary to get the balance </v>

54
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:18.664
<v Speaker 1>between death and life are in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche and your physiology because that </v>

55
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.003
<v Speaker 1>keeps you alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your cells die and regenerate all the </v>

56
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you die too much,</v>

57
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 1>then you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't die enough,</v>

58
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.420
<v Speaker 1>well then you also die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You end up with cancer or something like</v>

59
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:35.254
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to get the balance between </v>

60
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 1>death and life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

61
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.923
<v Speaker 1>In order to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what would happen if you </v>

62
00:04:41.361 --> 00:04:42.194
<v Speaker 1>got the balance between death and life </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly right and I don't know what the </v>

63
00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>upper limits are to human possibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and neither does anyone else,</v>

64
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.420
<v Speaker 1>and human consciousness and human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>are capable of.</v>

65
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.470
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what we're capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose is the final answer,</v>

66
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.990
<v Speaker 1>and so I'm unwilling for a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons which aren't,</v>

67
00:05:02.991 --> 00:05:03.824
<v Speaker 1>which I can't explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're tangled up with the experiences </v>

68
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 1>of the experiences that I've had that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>

69
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.823
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can neither understand newer </v>

70
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.950
<v Speaker 1>explained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm unwilling to rule out.</v>

71
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm unwilling to rule out the existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of heaven.</v>

72
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm unwilling to rule out the existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life after death.</v>

73
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.873
<v Speaker 1>I'm unwilling to rule out the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal redemption and the defeat of </v>

74
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:28.270
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know perfectly well that all those</v>

75
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:31.420
<v Speaker 1>things can be pro well conceptualized </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically.</v>

76
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.050
<v Speaker 1>I know that metaphorical </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization,</v>

77
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.643
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not willing to make the claim </v>
<v Speaker 1>that those ideas exhaust themselves in </v>

78
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:47.890
<v Speaker 1>the metaphor of it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.223
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in a position as of yet to </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate why I think that in a manner </v>

80
00:05:54.971 --> 00:05:59.971
<v Speaker 1>that would be anything other than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>jumble of lateral thoughts.</v>

81
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.323
<v Speaker 1>I have thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not organized and part of </v>

82
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:05.624
<v Speaker 1>the reason I'm doing the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture series is to organize those </v>

83
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:12.210
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so interesting.</v>

84
00:06:12.211 --> 00:06:14.610
<v Speaker 1>I had one day I'll have a chance to ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>you more about that.</v>
