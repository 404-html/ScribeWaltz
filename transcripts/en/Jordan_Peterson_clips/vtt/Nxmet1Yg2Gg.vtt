1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.070
<v Speaker 1>One of the natural response to what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

2
00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:03.180
<v Speaker 1>would it be okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the priorities are,</v>

4
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:06.384
<v Speaker 1>it's a rigged game because only when </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are the ones who are able to </v>

5
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>procreate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do we answer to that?</v>

6
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a rigged game.</v>

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.233
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's a rigged game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women have complicated lives and the </v>

8
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>pill has made them more complicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.513
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that exactly because you </v>

10
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:20.424
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred years in 1895 the average </v>

11
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>person in the western world lived on $1 </v>
<v Speaker 1>a day in today's money.</v>

12
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those people worked so hard at,</v>

13
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:31.740
<v Speaker 1>slaved away to such a degree that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't even imagine it and all their kids</v>

14
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:33.030
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

15
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:38.031
<v Speaker 1>So the death rate among kids below five </v>
<v Speaker 1>is beyond comprehension.</v>

16
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:40.780
<v Speaker 1>And so like women have terrible time of </v>
<v Speaker 1>timber.</v>

17
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so with men,</v>

18
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.770
<v Speaker 1>they got to be coal miners and soldiers.</v>

19
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Cause now that wasn't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertaining,</v>

20
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so life was very,</v>

21
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:49.141
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

22
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:49.974
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard before we got rich and we're </v>

23
00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Speaker 1>rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even those of you who are in this class,</v>

24
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>you think you're poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

25
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

26
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.773
<v Speaker 1>You're in the top one 10th of 1% by </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical standards and probably there </v>

27
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>by her and world's standards as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

28
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:04.854
<v Speaker 1>you could just compare yourself to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>few people to Richard than you and feel </v>

29
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:07.824
<v Speaker 1>sorry for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a pretty pathetic in my </v>

30
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's in,</v>

31
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly historically uninformed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

32
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>women have it rough obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's,</v>

33
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.300
<v Speaker 1>there's other things to consider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do live eight years longer,</v>

34
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 1>so that's not trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Testosterone kills men.</v>

35
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 1>That's basically why men die earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>and men are much more likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed and dangerous jobs.</v>

37
00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 1>They do almost all the dangerous jobs.</v>

38
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 1>They do almost all the outside work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's lots of reasons that men get</v>

39
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 1>paid more than women that have nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with prejudice.</v>

40
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.133
<v Speaker 1>It's because they take awful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible jobs like working in the oil </v>

41
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:45.980
<v Speaker 1>rates in northern Alberta when it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody 40 below and come out at,</v>

42
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.460
<v Speaker 1>you know of that after five years with </v>
<v Speaker 1>two or three fingers missing and,</v>

43
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.483
<v Speaker 1>and all warped up because you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to wrestle pipe when it's 40 below </v>

44
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.070
<v Speaker 1>and it's filthy with a bunch of ordinary</v>
<v Speaker 1>men who are hung over beyond belief.</v>

45
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's not very entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

46
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:04.284
<v Speaker 1>I mean each gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each sex has its own unfairness to deal </v>

47
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to think of that as a consequence of</v>

48
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 1>the social structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like come on,</v>

49
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about nature itself?</v>

50
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.063
<v Speaker 1>And this is something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something that seems to be </v>

51
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>completely invisible on the left side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the political spectrum.</v>

52
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.303
<v Speaker 1>So like of course you're a bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressed and your life is full of </v>

53
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:26.004
<v Speaker 1>suffering obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to think about that as a direct </v>

54
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:31.800
<v Speaker 1>consequence of unjust social structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>is just moronic.</v>

55
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's part of the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small part.</v>

56
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:35.274
<v Speaker 1>But look where you're sitting people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty warm in here and you're so </v>

57
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:41.010
<v Speaker 1>privileged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could come here and Saturday morning</v>

58
00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:45.210
<v Speaker 1>and listen to an intellectual lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you should be happy about that</v>

59
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:46.044
<v Speaker 1>because by historical standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be out lifting rocks in your </v>

60
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:53.670
<v Speaker 1>skeletal form about five foot three with</v>
<v Speaker 1>no teeth.</v>

61
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.070
<v Speaker 1>So have cougars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cougars alliance.</v>

62
00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

63
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no gratitude.</v>

64
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:02.164
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no gratitude for what our </v>

65
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:04.740
<v Speaker 1>society is capable of doing.</v>
