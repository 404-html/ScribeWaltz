00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Can I ask your thoughts on Brexit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2
00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:02.874
<v Speaker 1>you can have my thoughts on brexit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day I was doing a lecture on </v>

3
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>the on the stories in genesis and one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stories that I analyze briefly,</v>

4
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:10.284
<v Speaker 1>and this will be posted very soon is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story of the Tower of Babel and I've </v>

5
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:15.384
<v Speaker 1>been very curious about that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes after Noah's flood myth in </v>

6
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:19.044
<v Speaker 1>genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that human beings get </v>

7
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:22.314
<v Speaker 1>together and they decide to build a </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive building and the human beings </v>

8
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:28.254
<v Speaker 1>that are building that building all </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak in one voice and they have this </v>

9
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>grand vision which you might regard as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>utopian vision,</v>

10
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.053
<v Speaker 1>which is what I think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can build a building so high </v>

11
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.163
<v Speaker 1>that within it everyone will speak the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same language and it will reach all the </v>

12
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:46.500
<v Speaker 1>way to have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you could see it in some sense as</v>

13
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 1>an attempt to usurp the transcendent.</v>

14
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.063
<v Speaker 1>I kind of read it as an an early </v>
<v Speaker 1>precursor of the story that Milton told </v>

15
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>and paradise lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where Satan,</v>

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.980
<v Speaker 1>who's God's highest heavenly angel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps and who's Lucifer?</v>

17
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.490
<v Speaker 1>The brightest light in the psychic </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy you might say,</v>

18
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 1>and the spirit of untrammeled </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality decides that he can wage war</v>

19
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:08.094
<v Speaker 1>in heaven and overcome God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome the ultimate in the </v>

20
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:11.904
<v Speaker 1>transcendent value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I read that as a cautionary tale </v>

21
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:15.054
<v Speaker 1>about the pride that goes along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual presupposition in the same </v>

22
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 1>pride that produced the totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>states of the 20th century.</v>

23
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>What happens with the Tower of Babel is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that human beings start to build this,</v>

24
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.103
<v Speaker 1>a unitary homogenous structure who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pinnacle will reach into God's heavenly </v>

25
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:34.314
<v Speaker 1>domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps thereby taking the place of the </v>

26
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:38.124
<v Speaker 1>transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God gets wind of that and goes to earth </v>

27
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>and takes the people or or transforms </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who are,</v>

28
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.503
<v Speaker 1>who are building them.</v>
