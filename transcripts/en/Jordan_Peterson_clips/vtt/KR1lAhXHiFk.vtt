00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.120
<v Speaker 1>The cynical attitude towards prayer is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like asking God for favors,</v>

2
00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:05.954
<v Speaker 1>and then of course the cynical analysis </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that is that if you ask God for </v>

3
00:00:09.591 --> 00:00:10.424
<v Speaker 1>favors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he won't help you find your lost </v>

4
00:00:12.531 --> 00:00:14.090
<v Speaker 1>wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

5
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't.</v>

6
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.493
<v Speaker 1>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take a bit of a more </v>

7
00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:20.084
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated approach to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what you're doing if you pray </v>

8
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.420
<v Speaker 1>is that you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You formulate a question and you,</v>

9
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.850
<v Speaker 1>you wait for an answer like a prayer </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be,</v>

10
00:00:31.851 --> 00:00:32.684
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to do the best thing I </v>

11
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:35.804
<v Speaker 1>could with my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you have to open yourself up to </v>

12
00:00:38.061 --> 00:00:40.160
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's to knock the door will open.</v>

13
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.230
<v Speaker 1>I would like to do the best thing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

14
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.483
<v Speaker 1>What might that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say that you're thinking </v>

15
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:47.354
<v Speaker 1>when you say that are you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say that you're leaving </v>

16
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:52.670
<v Speaker 1>yourself open for revelation or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intuition,</v>

17
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.953
<v Speaker 1>but you're communing with whatever it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that enables you to receive wisdom and </v>

18
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>you can attribute all of that to you or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can attribute it to your brain,</v>

19
00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:04.160
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're.</v>

20
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.370
<v Speaker 1>You're really communing with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of the cosmos when you're,</v>

21
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.293
<v Speaker 1>when you're asking such a question and </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you do it properly and </v>

22
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.253
<v Speaker 1>it's really useful to do that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really necessary because it orients you </v>

23
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.050
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

24
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:22.040
<v Speaker 1>the demise of prayer when prayer is </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered in a sophisticated manner,</v>

25
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.623
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I commune with the better part of </v>

26
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:26.990
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

27
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.600
<v Speaker 1>to determine how I should orient myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world?</v>

28
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:31.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a catastrophic loss not to do that.</v>
