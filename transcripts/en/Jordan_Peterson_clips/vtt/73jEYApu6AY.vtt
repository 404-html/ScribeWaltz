00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Conscientious people like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they value hard work,</v>

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.560
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>order reliability,</v>

3
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.280
<v Speaker 1>integrity and structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so their dutiful.</v>

4
00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:15.070
<v Speaker 1>We analyze what predicted military </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>

5
00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:15.830
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in theU ,</v>

6
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.780
<v Speaker 1>s army overwhelmingly conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not surprising,</v>

7
00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:23.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a very structured rule,</v>

8
00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:28.171
<v Speaker 1>ordered top down follow procedure sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of endeavor.</v>

9
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.253
<v Speaker 1>Now the armed forces had problems with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to some degree because they were </v>

10
00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:33.274
<v Speaker 1>also simultaneously looking for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who could think independently on their </v>

11
00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:39.220
<v Speaker 1>feet because if you're in a battlefield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

12
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're isolated from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>command structure,</v>

13
00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:42.484
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be times when you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make extraordinarily difficult </v>

14
00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:45.274
<v Speaker 1>decisions on your own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're selected primarily for </v>

15
00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:49.504
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to be your forte </v>

16
00:00:51.191 --> 00:00:52.930
<v Speaker 1>because if you're a conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

17
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.320
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that you enter into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>contract with someone,</v>

18
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.810
<v Speaker 1>even yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you carry it out.</v>
