1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.070
Yeah,
he's a,
he enjoys it and he seems to like want you to enjoy it too.

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.310
He's like,
all right.
That went amazing.
You know,
it's like,
come on,

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.520
let's get some deep breaths.
You're doing fantastic.
Yeah.

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.320
In between 'em round with Michael Bisbing,
there's a five round fight.
Um,

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.140
he comes in and tells me,
he,
he told,
he told me like a knock,

6
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:21.330
knock joke and then why a chicken crossed the road joke.

7
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:24.240
And I sitting there and there's a picture of me like quizzically looking at him,

8
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:28.110
I'm like,
I'm going to kill you.
And you're like,
what are you doing?

9
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.760
And he just wanted me to relax.
He just wanted me to breathe when,

10
00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:33.240
because I was doing everything I was supposed to be doing and um,

11
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.350
I just needed to,
you know,
he just thought you were two tents.
Yeah.
Apparently.

12
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.450
Huh?
What a Dick playing mind games in the middle of,
in the middle of a fight.

13
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.800
You have one minute to figure out what to do and what to say to a guy who just

14
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:50.100
was,
well,
some people bonds for five minutes.
Yeah.
Yeah.

15
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.250
Some people have a little more.
Do you know that?

16
00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:56.160
I discussed that yesterday with big John Big John,
the podcast yesterday.

17
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.100
We fucked up and he forgot to talk about it during the podcast,

18
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:01.410
but after the podcast he explained what happened.

19
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.680
He says that it was the UFC cut man's fault cause he left a giant Glob of

20
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.660
Vaseline on yokels.
I,

21
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.420
he didn't want to touch it because he felt like if he touched it could open the

22
00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:15.690
cut up again.
Yeah,
he called the,
I guess it was the guy's name,
Tate.

23
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.530
He tried to call and get the guy to come back in.
The guy wouldn't come back in,

24
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.530
so the corner men tried to come in.
He said No.
He's like,

25
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:25.560
you got to bring the cut man back.
And then he wound up doing it by himself.

26
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.190
It was the perfect storm.
He said he fucked up and said,
Yo,

27
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:32.220
I was definitely playing it off.
And he said,
but if he had to do it differently,

28
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:36.030
he would had a made UL stand up and be,

29
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.710
he would've made sure that fucking cut man didn't leave the cage with that big

30
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:42.990
Glob of asset on that.
I was just talking crap.
Oh,

31
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:46.770
I was actually complaining about.
Yeah,
it was.
Um,
so,
but that was a giant issue.

32
00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:51.750
It was a 32nd 32nd issue for a guy who was really wobbled at the end of the

33
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:55.160
second round and my route to the title.
Yeah.
It was a big deal.
Yeah.

34
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.950
It was a bummer,
but it was the perfect storm,
you know,
and,
and um,

35
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.510
and now he's fighting for the title,
so,
you know,
hopefully he represents Cuba.

36
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.250
Well,
he's a bad motherfucker.
Yeah.
He's a freak.
He really is right.

37
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.550
Specimen.
Yeah.
I mean,
when like,

38
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.140
there's so much going on there.

39
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.370
It's like there's the years of training and that crazy Cuba Olympic program,

40
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.450
there's phenomenal genetics is experience and competing.

41
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:26.010
There's so much going on there with that guy.

42
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.700
Layers and layers and layers of the highest level of competition,

43
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.113
um,

44
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.420
mixed in with a life that I think has been very complimentary to a mindset of an

45
00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:42.510
athlete.
You know,
he,
he,

46
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:47.511
he has pretty much been shaped most of his life to be a highest level athlete.

47
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.830
Um,
tricky part is math.
Whitaker's good Whittaker is very good.

48
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.880
It's very good.
It's very good and very young,
you know,
and a Whitaker,

49
00:02:56.881 --> 00:03:00.160
you gotta remember had his knee blown out in the first round.

50
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.870
He got his knee high,
Brixton at tourists,

51
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:06.010
MCL pretty badly in the first round and still was able to stuff takedowns and

52
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:10.570
arguably the best wrestlers ever fought in MMA.
Yeah,
pretty impressive shit.

53
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.000
That's great fight.
That's a couple of weeks from now.
