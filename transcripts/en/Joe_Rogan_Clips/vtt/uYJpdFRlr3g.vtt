1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.530
Ever right now.
He's 22 he's making money.
He's a fucking savage.
Come on.

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.400
He started specials.
Where he belongs right here.
He saw it.
Look,
I mean,
he's just,

3
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:09.750
he does everything so well.

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.740
Everything from his de France two is striking and Rehab did.

5
00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:16.200
He looks like a world champion boxer when he's got his hands up.

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.530
It doesn't mean he can't get caught.
Doesn't mean he can't get finished.
He can.

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.030
He'll get a little reckless.
This motherfucker got to keep your hands getting.

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.340
He's going to be so good.
He hit so fucking hard through his body shots.

9
00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:30.430
His left took his day.
One of the best love.
Ooh.

10
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.390
When would the Duchy.
Oh Shit elbow.
Oh Gosh.

11
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:39.600
A cart with a rabbit a little bit.
Definitely got hit in her.
Correct.

12
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.450
This is a real fight.
You Know Morales hand Corrales are tough.

13
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.440
Pico also has a crazy six pack to

14
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.280
tell you what I tell you here under four bro.
Oh,

15
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:56.280
the left hooks coming.
There's one that's coming inside.
He's a little,

16
00:00:56.281 --> 00:01:01.270
he's a little concussed.
Corrals says little concussed paralysis.
Morales.
Okay.

17
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.630
Paralysis.
Cream and corrals is not tow needed.

18
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:06.430
The body shots too bad smart page.

19
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.720
Oh Shit.
Oh No.
Oh No.

20
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.040
Oh No.
Brendan just fell out of his fucking chair.

21
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.700
Oh my God.
Oh No.
That's what happens.

22
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.720
That's what happens in fighting.
That's what happens.

23
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.430
That's what happens in Friday.
Holy Shit speech.

24
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.980
I don't like seeing a young man get hit like that.
That was crazy.

25
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.960
A poor or Brennan punched.
Watch this.
Watch this again.

26
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.970
Why?
Why is he so reckless?
The savage,

27
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.410
but
Luke,
he's 22 he'll learn,
but watch this,

28
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:54.390
John Jones and do this.
So he just,

29
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.040
he just wades in and you could tell the corrals had recovered.

30
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.800
Look at this body shot.
Body shot hurts him there.
Hello.

31
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.250
Hello.
No snaps back out.
Cold out cold.

32
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.110
Two big bumps.
Look at this one more time.
Boom.

33
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.870
That's all she wrote,
Dude.
Everything goes on.
The Drake of

34
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.170
the way down.
His head is not.
That's not going to see again,
look at this.
Boom,

35
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.000
perfect shot.
The lights go out in Georgia,

36
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:31.050
one too on the way down and then a third one when he's already out cold.

37
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.340
Holy Shit.
That's some killer instinct right there.
That could stop you.

38
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:39.780
You know you're talking about this progression that stop you.
Well,
yeah,

39
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.840
the first,
he doesn't know what happened.
He's,
he's,

40
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.600
he's trying to figure out what happened now.
I mean,
he was comprised,
he's going,

41
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.800
fuck this MMA style.
You understand my deathbed confessional now.
Yes,

42
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.000
astral traveling,
but your,
your deathbed confessional.
You're correct.

43
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.900
He could've taken him down.
Who's going to stop Aaron Peko from take.

44
00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:02.800
Could it be dumb?
Can beat them.
Here's the thing,
not too,
but here's the thing.

45
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.290
You can do all things.
You can do all things,

46
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:08.380
but if you're standing in front of a guy all the time,
if you get that guy hurt,

47
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:11.680
the way he got that heart,
that guy hurt.
If your objective,
okay,

48
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.200
it's easy to be Monday,
Monday morning quarterback,
right?

49
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.530
But objective looking at right now,
I would say take him down.
He's hurt.

50
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.440
Take him down,
smash them up and then you take no dammit.
Fuck no chances.

51
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.070
It's all variables.
It's all about mitigating variables.

52
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.870
You close all the variables down.

53
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:31.630
When you take God down a mountain and start dropping elbows on his head,

54
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.950
you close all the variables.

55
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.280
If you can maintain the mount position and keep punching and you already know

56
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:37.610
he's fucked up,
God,

57
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.210
it's all it's about of whether he's going to tap the strikes or are you going to

58
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:41.200
get a choke?
I don't like.
