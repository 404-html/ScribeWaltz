1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.970
Awesome.
The,
the life that you were living,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.480
you could probably pull those dark thoughts out like other people.
Well,

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.150
which probably can't sit in a bar man and uh,
write stuff down.

4
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.420
And uh,
the next day I'd pick it up,
go,
oh my God,
what the fuck was I thinking?

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.450
You know?
And it just horrified me.
But yeah,

6
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:25.470
sometimes you can pull dark stuff at a bad moment in the life.

7
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.040
Well you had experiences.
I mean,

8
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:32.100
I mean it's just trying to kill yourself with pills or whatever the fuck you

9
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:35.190
were doing.
I mean know the darkness that you had in your life.

10
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.940
Like my sister being murdered and shit and my mother,

11
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.660
my mother was a 12 year old girl and her mother was dating my father.

12
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.420
Her mother was
my grandmother passed,

13
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.090
my father left that and went into a 12 year old who girls room and raped her.

14
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.100
That's me.
That's how I got started.

15
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.680
And then later in life raping,
my sister did not know it,

16
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.490
you know,
he raped another daughter and not know it.

17
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.860
Always heard whispering.

18
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.800
So people whispering and even in the evil item.
And what the fuck's your problem?

19
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.480
They're not getting the ring with somebody that,

20
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.850
that knew my dad and they beat the fucking shit out of me because they hated him

21
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.480
because they'd seen some of the shit that he did.

22
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.660
You want to believe that of your own father?
I want to believe that.

23
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.030
God,
you don't want to believe that Dee.

24
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.710
I was the girl that you met earlier.
Cody.

25
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.350
She is a first daughter of mine that I held in my lap.

26
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.920
She was 2122 before I would ever pick up.

27
00:02:02.441 --> 00:02:05.350
One of my daughters said that my,
my lap

28
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.740
because I was afraid.
I turned into my father.

29
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.310
<v 1>No,
never wanted that.
And everyone,</v>

30
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.270
<v 0>he's someone that abused a child cause I didn't and I knew what the shit was</v>

31
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:20.100
like and I knew what I did to my fucking head

32
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.790
getting right and getting sober

33
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.010
warning to talk about it helps a lot.

34
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.970
It makes it better.
You don't cure it,

35
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.980
you know you never get over it,
but I can deal with it now.

36
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.540
I don't have to go medicate when it,

37
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.970
now when you talk to these people that you're also helping your medium that also

38
00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:52.680
have these problems.
How many of them have also been abused?
A lot.
A Lot,
man.

39
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.490
You know what it's like to be sitting at a comicon and a look out there and

40
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.840
there's people in your line and your eye contact contacts.
A kid,

41
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.430
he looked at the kid and they look at you and you're like,
for a mother Fucker,

42
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:12.550
you're going through it too,
aren't ya?
And I can tell it.

43
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.990
I know that putting kids,
being sexually abused,
he can see it.

44
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.100
And I hate that feeling because then they get up to the front and you're like

45
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:23.410
trying to talk to them and they're like,
shut down.
Completely.

46
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.190
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.250
<v 0>And then the fucking asshole is next to him was probably doing the bullshit.</v>

48
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.240
He's wanting my contention,
man.

49
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.260
What chance did I have him getting in good attention and not much.

50
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.930
I keep going back to the kid.
How can you tell?
He's just feeling,
you know it,

51
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.080
you smell it,
taste it.
If you see the fear,
you know,

52
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.330
and you see the way that the dad communicates with them and you see their

53
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:52.650
reaction and they won't look at you with their eyes,
you know,

54
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.380
really hard to get him look at him.
He really is.
And No,

55
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.350
I remember I told somebody one time that probably the one thing that helped me

56
00:04:03.351 --> 00:04:07.700
in my early life about going through all that sexual abuse and bullshit was I

57
00:04:07.701 --> 00:04:12.530
learned that a lot at a very young age,
regional.
I learned that a lot of these,

58
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.840
cause it helped me get me to a safe place,
you know,
uh,

59
00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:21.260
I learned to judge people in their attitudes.
You know,

60
00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:25.130
I knew what buttons to push and what buttons not to push with my stepmother and

61
00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:29.270
I knew what was a safe place and if there were key words that come out from her,

62
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.330
I knew to fucking go hide.
I had to start reading this shit.

63
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.580
Then I had to start coming up with storylines and stuff to get me out of shit.

64
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.140
So I wouldn't be put into the position to get gotten again.

65
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.620
When you're earning that should have 12 and 13.
Brother,

66
00:04:42.621 --> 00:04:43.760
you're getting some fucking knowledge,

67
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.130
but it's a motherfucker man.
You know,

68
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.060
just to have to go through it and uh,

69
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.860
I don't know brother.
I mean if there was ever a reason to,
uh,

70
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.430
bring back the big one,
the gas or bullets or whatever aim.

71
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.240
I think paintings perfect for anybody.
That'd be just kids.

72
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.860
It was make a public fucking,
hey,
fuck five years in jail.

73
00:05:09.861 --> 00:05:10.910
Fuck you motherfucker.

74
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.210
But you dancing on the end of a rope that would get people's attention when you

75
00:05:16.221 --> 00:05:19.610
might stop some of it.
Yeah.
I don't know how to steal.

76
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.530
What would they do that would stop it completely,
but it's,

77
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.060
it's one of the most disturbing characteristics of people that,
that,

78
00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:29.570
that that's even possible.
Buddy wants to talk,

79
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.790
nobody wants to talk about that kid damn shirt

80
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.320
because here's what happens to the kid.
Nine Times out of 10,

81
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.940
they raise their hand and they say something.
Then this group comes in,

82
00:05:40.941 --> 00:05:44.060
this group jumps in,
cops come in and they say this ashes that late,

83
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.100
he's probably just exaggerating this,

84
00:05:46.101 --> 00:05:49.760
that this that you have to go home with them.
Oh Fuck No.

85
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.620
You can't put that kid back in that house.
Right.
What chance do you have now?

86
00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.130
Right.
Or you up in an orphanage where you're eating raped again?

87
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.210
Yeah.
Who Does?
Yeah.

88
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.250
Who wants to all these share at an orphanage more than a predator.

89
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.160
<v 2>And that's the other problem is a lot of kids that get abused like that.</v>

90
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:08.070
One of abusing other

91
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.440
<v 0>kids.
Absolutely.
Even what you're taught</v>

92
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.940
Sandusky at that whole charity for kids.

93
00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:18.110
I was this whole like thing map.
Yeah.

94
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.900
I'm going to open up abuse children's home.
That way I know where to go get one.

95
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.253
Yup.

96
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.300
<v 2>Knew that the kids were damaged and they would be used to it.</v>

97
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.430
<v 0>You know what we,
what we call love.</v>

98
00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:35.431
It can be an a and luckily you know sometimes the kid looks to get his ass

99
00:06:37.091 --> 00:06:40.510
kicked because that's the only type of loving knows.
That's true.

100
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.310
<v 2>You're a powerful man to have gone through all this and to be able to express
it.</v>

101
00:06:45.311 --> 00:06:49.180
So honestly,
two to everybody,
I mean that,
that,

102
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.450
that is an amazing thing because the pain of your experiences has not stopped

103
00:06:54.791 --> 00:06:58.240
you from expressing all of the,

104
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.220
all of the downsides of it,

105
00:07:00.221 --> 00:07:04.960
but also that you've come out of it on the other end in a very positive way.

106
00:07:04.961 --> 00:07:07.870
I mean you're a great guy to be around your funniest shit.
You,

107
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.510
you have amazing stories and you're clean.
Now

108
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.010
<v 0>colonial.
I know I'm funny in a room like this,
but go,</v>

109
00:07:13.011 --> 00:07:17.260
there's not any competition.
Come on Joe.
Me Fuck.
Where do you go from here?

110
00:07:17.261 --> 00:07:22.170
You know lapdog 27 no,
that's amazing.

111
00:07:22.171 --> 00:07:27.010
Just one really is I just want to help somebody else feel what I felt.
Yeah.

112
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.260
Cause I don't want them to have to do the things that I did to quit feeling

113
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.440
cause I'll tell you man,

114
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.460
it's just a whole lot easier to pick up cocaine and forget about it than it is

115
00:07:38.461 --> 00:07:42.120
to go through counseling.
Go through this,

116
00:07:42.121 --> 00:07:45.390
go through reliving it 25 fucking times.

117
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.490
You know,
you go into counseling and then they say,
okay,

118
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:53.260
tell us exactly how it happened.
Do I really fucking want to do that?
Right.

119
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.500
What do you want me to do that so you can get it over there and Jack off of
what?

120
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.110
What's your none on this cause that's what we're thinking.

121
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.400
What do you want me to remember it?
I want to fuck fucking forget it.

122
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:08.150
Tell me how it forget it.
Don't tell me how to remember it.

123
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.920
I got it down.

124
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.270
<v 2>What was ultimately,</v>

125
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.990
what was ultimately the thing that allowed you to stay clean when you had

126
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.500
faltered five or six times,
whatever it was,

127
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.820
what was ultimately the thing that allowed you to get past all this and just to

128
00:08:23.821 --> 00:08:24.920
embrace a bride

129
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.330
<v 0>being healthy?
I think it was just</v>

130
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.430
realizing that I wasn't going to fail this time

131
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:39.740
and that game from Dallas not giving up on me.
