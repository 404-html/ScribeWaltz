Hello Freak bitches.
That'd be more considered or more kind.

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.630
It's about calling people out on doing something wrong and stopping them.

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.870
Do you think the intent matters more than the word hundred percent?

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.500
Cause I feel like we saw that a lot with,
um,
there's a,

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.740
there's two big youtubers that were in the news,
uh,
or one was in the news.

6
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:20.910
There was a cutie pie.

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.130
Felix talk about that because I saw his response video and I kinda got sickened.

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.240
Oh really?
By what's happening to him.
Oh,
by what's happening,

9
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:34.170
I think you're saying.
Yeah,
no,
his words.
He was,
he was crazy.
It was crazy.

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.330
The whole thing is insane.
They're making it out like he's a Nazi.
Right.

11
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.000
And he's not at all.
No.
He had made some,

12
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.630
some videos where he had told people to not be Nazis and to not until like tea

13
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.070
too.
Don't you know,
what was his exact words?
I know.
I don't want to miss ripping.

14
00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:58.020
And they,
it,
it originally started with this whole five or a video that he did.

15
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.330
Um,
and then Fiverr.
Yeah.

16
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:03.600
So it's like a website where you can get people to do thing for things

17
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:08.010
originally for $5 now for more money.
And so he went through the site.

18
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:10.080
It all started from this one video that got him attention.

19
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.950
He went to Fiverr and tried to get people to do ridiculous,
outrageous things.

20
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.520
Okay,
good.
A guy dressed as Jesus to say something weird.

21
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.870
He got these,
uh,
the main thing that blew up where these two guys,
they're like,

22
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.380
they're in like a jungle setting of some sort.
They dance,
they laugh,

23
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.070
they'll hold up a sign,
they'll say something.
And so he was like,

24
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.350
it's gonna be hilarious because they're not going to do it right.

25
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:33.630
They're going to be like,
thank you.
But no.
Um,

26
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.690
but they actually made a video where the guys were laughing and dancing,

27
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.380
held up a sign that said death to all Jews and,

28
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.430
and then said to subscribe to a youtube channel.
Right.
The whole of,
of,
uh,

29
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.670
of like someone else asked them to say death to all Jews.

30
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.810
So he wrote in as like a cause in the same video,

31
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.190
he gets all these people that are like,

32
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.770
I'm not going to do the stupid ridiculous thing that you said,

33
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.140
but then they actually did it.
The,

34
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.900
the big reason I feel like they did it is they didn't understand what the words

35
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:03.360
they were riding in the words they were saying,
oh,
they're from another country.

36
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.870
What country were they from?
I don't know.
I'd have to,
I'd have to double check.

37
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.180
Okay.
So they just essentially wrote down the symbols.

38
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.190
They didn't really know how to even say it is.
There it is.
And they're laughing.

39
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.620
Yeah.
And so I think this might be from his explanation video,

40
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:20.670
but in the first one he's like,
why the fuck did they do it?
How do I,

41
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.680
can I even include this?
Um,
and so then that sent that got that,

42
00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:28.490
got a little traction and then people started going through his other videos and

43
00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:31.860
they were like,
he's,
he's dressed up.
Uh,
he's watching Hitler.

44
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:36.420
And this one taken completely out of context of him saying that the Youtube

45
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.900
Heroes Program,
which was a program where people can,
uh,
uh,

46
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.680
highlight videos are not highlight them but mark them down for deletion because

47
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:46.020
they're offensive.
Right?
And so people were like,
oh,

48
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:49.920
that censorship that's you're talking about like obviously hyperbole.

49
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:53.340
It's like those are Nazis.
So he made that joke in that relation.

50
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.020
And then there was one,
if I want to say if it was on the verge or wired,

51
00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:01.900
but then they go even further.
They're like,
he use Leslie Jones Picture,
um,

52
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.130
on Harambie taken completely out of context because he was using,

53
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.320
there's this Microsoft Ai Bot like this chat bot.
And you'd say,
uh,

54
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.810
let me see Harami as Jesus.
And uh,

55
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.530
either the AI was messed up or people had manipulated it where it was putting

56
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:20.170
Leslie Jones his face on it.
And he was horrified by it.

57
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.930
And that was the whole joke.
But there were saying that he,
he was doing it.

58
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.440
<v 1>So this is clear.
Like he,
you saw him use the software and you saw the error.</v>

59
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.680
<v 0>You try and use the bot today,</v>

60
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.650
a picture won't come up because now they are aware that that's what was

61
00:03:31.651 --> 00:03:32.780
happening,
right?

62
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.820
And so they took all these things and it was this like this crusade of,

63
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.760
look guys,
we're looking at this bad guy.
He's the biggest guy on youtube.

64
00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:42.180
He's the bad guy.
We're going to take him down.
So much taken out of context.

65
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.960
Some things are not defensible where I can't,

66
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.650
I can't say it in the sense of like you say that words don't have power based on

67
00:03:49.651 --> 00:03:51.660
intent.
And I think there's a,
there's a lot of truth in that.

68
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.750
<v 1>Not saying words don't have power based on intent.</v>

69
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.380
I'm saying that words should just convey intent.
Right?

70
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.430
And there are times where a word,

71
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.930
there's times where like you see a friend and he go,
what's up bitch?

72
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.500
And you know you have haven't and you're both laughing and you're being silly.

73
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.800
And then there's times where you call,
some of them want a bitch,
right?

74
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:13.270
Because you think they're being mean.
Yeah.

75
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.760
I mean those two words exactly the same,

76
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:17.830
but one conveys a completely different intent,

77
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.570
<v 0>right?
But out of this,
it was,</v>

78
00:04:20.571 --> 00:04:23.840
it was very obvious that they were trying to do this takedown thing and it blew

79
00:04:23.841 --> 00:04:25.340
up entirely in their face,
I think,

80
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.570
<v 1>because I don't think most people are aware,</v>

81
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.770
I mean there was a Wall Street Journal article on it,
right,
which was where it,

82
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.600
where it got really weird because three people worked on this and they comb

83
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:36.560
through hundreds of hours.
Yeah.
I mean,
yes.

84
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.020
And they found like instances of him holding his arm out like this and they use

85
00:04:42.021 --> 00:04:46.870
that picture.
Like there's a,
I mean that's,
that's weird.

86
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.110
<v 0>Very weird.
And then,
and then once all that came out that they were like,
well,</v>

87
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.610
here's the thing about the context.
He's just like Donald Trump.
And it was,

88
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.660
it was an immediate jump to,
he's using the same tactic tactics as Donald Trump,

89
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.553
but

90
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.330
<v 1>it was just insane.
Now he's very reasonable.
He did,</v>

91
00:05:03.331 --> 00:05:07.180
he did a video response video about it and the way he handled it was very

92
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:10.930
reasonable.
And he explained what he was doing and what's going on.
And you know,

93
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:15.610
he's doing hundreds of hours of him playing video games and talking and being

94
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:16.444
silly.

95
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.510
And if you comb through those and take these things again out of context and try

96
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:26.530
to make it look like he's a Nazi,
that's a hit piece and 100% and it's deceptive.

97
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:30.700
It's not indicative of his overall,
it's hard to call it a body of work,

98
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:32.300
but let's call it a body of work,
right?

99
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.740
His overall body of performance that he's,
that's online,

100
00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:39.520
whatever you want to call it,
right?
His talking,
it's not who he is.

101
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:43.450
So for them to call him a Nazi and say that Pooty Pie has,
you know,

102
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:46.540
seven videos where he's done something about Nazis,

103
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:50.890
like people when they're doing these long form spit ball,

104
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:54.610
improvisation videos like that,
and you're interacting with people,

105
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.180
you're going to say all kinds of shit that in the moment is legitimate.

106
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.020
But if you chop it up and edit it and splice them all together and then make a

107
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:07.490
five minute montage of him saying Nazi,
like he's obsessed with Nazis

108
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.930
<v 0>and what,
what kind of sucked from it was a lot of people think that,
oh,</v>

109
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.360
they're there articles about the downfall of Pewdie Pie.

110
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.710
I think he's gone up half a million if not more than a million subscribers since

111
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:21.560
all of this happened.
Right.
So he's gotten all this new support.

112
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:23.480
He's a temporary phase for a,
for free speech,

113
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.380
free speech and a persecution from mainstream media.
Didn't even lose some,

114
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.490
some get matter for him though.
He so,

115
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.820
I mean it sucks more for the people that we're working on that project.

116
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.090
What was the project?
So it was scare Cutie Pie.
Season two.

117
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:38.030
It was a youtube red series.
Um,
so they were,

118
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:40.660
I think there were about to go into production,
um,
and,

119
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.990
and so then that got canceled.
So Youtube didn't want to fund that.
And I said it,

120
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.681
he said it.

121
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:48.290
He understands why they would have to separate because then it becomes a story

122
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:52.440
of Youtube and pubic or youtube.
And Disney support an anti-semite.
Right?

123
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.930
That's right.

124
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.190
<v 1>Busy.
He's not an anti Semite so why would they back away?</v>

125
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.640
<v 0>I think because there were scared that the Wall Street Journal was like,</v>

126
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.430
did you see all of this?
We're going to write this article,

127
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.370
<v 1>Wall Street Journal at that slip through.
That seems to me very responsive.</v>

128
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.680
<v 0>Many of them are standing by it though.
Many real yes.
100%.</v>

129
00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:14.240
And the many are touting it as this victory because he lost a Google preferred

130
00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:15.800
ads on Youtube,
which I will say,

131
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:19.640
I don't know how he was still seeing it as family friendly cause I'm not family

132
00:07:19.641 --> 00:07:24.200
friendly on my show his past two years,
at the very least,
not family friendly.
Uh,

133
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:27.980
and then uh,
drop by maker.
Uh,
he doesn't,
he doesn't need his,
uh,

134
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.580
his MCN has his company around him and the youtube red series is nothing.

135
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:35.720
He's still gonna make millions of dollars.
He's grown it.
It's a good thing.

136
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:38.480
I feel like it now if you,
if you have mainstream media,

137
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:41.000
try and take a swing at you.
It's some of the best promotion in the world.

138
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.160
<v 1>But why did they take a swing at him and why is anyone saying that they took</v>

139
00:07:45.161 --> 00:07:46.180
down a bad guy?

140
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.660
<v 0>That it's,
it's a big thing of them trying to label and it's once,
once again,</v>

141
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:54.170
it's a problem with a lot of media is there,
they're overextending,
right?

142
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.250
They all of a sudden start talking about this narrative about outright and the

143
00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:00.560
rise of white supremacy again in this country.

144
00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:02.960
And then they look at this big guy and they're like,

145
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.220
we can use him as an example.
We can be the heroes that expose this,

146
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:10.680
that do the takedown piece.
Um,
and they're not and they're not.

147
00:08:10.681 --> 00:08:14.090
And they're like so driven for that,
that they then just,
they go,
oh,

148
00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:17.270
well maybe that doesn't add up there.
It's an argument.
But we have the power.

149
00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:20.450
We have the size of the audience were good and it just blew up in their face.

150
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.450
<v 1>So they were thinking they could get away with it even though it wasn't kosher.</v>

151
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.830
I believe so too.
What is their response so far?
Do you know?

152
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.350
Have you read anything about it?
But as far as like

153
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.130
<v 0>fans or the Wall Street Journal posts,</v>

154
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:38.250
posts are they digging their heels in and then a lot of people started trying to

155
00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:41.320
find as always add bearish stuff.
Turn it on like the,

156
00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:46.220
the office in the past one was like a,
a joke from 2015 because,
and,

157
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.090
and while part of me would go,
well that's petty.

158
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.070
If the argument is that context doesn't matter,

159
00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.730
then fine then then look at these guys,
what they said a year ago.

160
00:08:53.731 --> 00:08:54.351
Look at what they are.

161
00:08:54.351 --> 00:08:57.640
They're saying now the writers who have the art of the article,
like I think Ben,

162
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.100
Ben Fritz was one of the art,
the writer is where you made a,
I can't,

163
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.580
I never knew Jews were so good at frying joke,
uh,
from way back.

164
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:07.860
And then he made another joke about a,

165
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:11.220
it was like a back and forth with someone where he said,
you know,
the,

166
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.850
these racial jokes are so stupid.
And then someone said,
Eh,
you know,

167
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:17.490
they hit everyone.
And he said,
well,
at least the black jokes are funny.

168
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:21.120
Those ones,
those ones are funny.
And so people were like,
well,
if,
if,

169
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.400
if context doesn't matter,
are you a scumbag?
And,

170
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.930
and then people just dismissed it as are a lot of mainstream people dismissed it

171
00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:30.240
as like,
oh,
that's,
that's not the same thing.

172
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.780
How could anyone say context doesn't matter.
That's insane.

173
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:36.330
That is an insane thing to say.
Is that literally what they said,

174
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.300
they context it does not matter.
What was it?
It was one of the,

175
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:42.150
one of the people I'm going to get the problem is so many people have written

176
00:09:42.151 --> 00:09:45.380
about it.
There was one article that was promoted and it said,
uh,

177
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:50.430
all these are articles,
uh,
or all these people defending Felix with.
But context,

178
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.010
that's,
that's a bullshit argument and that's insane.

179
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.400
If you think that that's an insane,
so everything exists a in a,

180
00:09:56.401 --> 00:09:59.550
in a highly edited bubble.
Dope.
So that's ruined everyone's career.

181
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.030
If you're talking about a mathematician discussing algorithms,
yes.

182
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.060
Context doesn't really mean that much because he's talking about numbers,

183
00:10:06.061 --> 00:10:08.970
but we're not talking about numbers.
Talking about words.
Yeah.

184
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.090
We're talking about the way people express themselves and we're talking about

185
00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:15.930
someone who is generally considered to be humorous.
I mean Pooty Pie,

186
00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:17.970
a lot of his stuff is playful and humorous.

187
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.560
So if your humerus and you're playing around and you say something that might
be,

188
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.780
I don't even want to use the appropriate,

189
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.580
it might be the thing for him to say in that moment to try to be entertaining.

190
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:29.970
Right.

191
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:34.920
That does not mean he's a Nazi and two to label him like that is incredibly

192
00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:39.270
irresponsible.
It's,
it's really bad.
I mean,

193
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:43.170
I'm not a lawyer,
but I would sue the fuck out of him if I was him.

194
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.680
I would sue the fuck out of them for sure.
Yeah.

195
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.970
Because what they're doing is misrepresenting who he is as a human being and

196
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.070
even if it's beneficial in the long run,

197
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.970
it's super dangerous to set that precedent.
Well,
especially something in this,

198
00:10:56.971 --> 00:11:00.800
in this climate where you say,
this is what he supports and it 100% isn't.

199
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.450
How do you know,
someone doesn't just see those articles,

200
00:11:03.451 --> 00:11:05.280
it doesn't see as defense and tries to kill the guy.

201
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:10.140
But why would the Wall Street Journal do something like this?
To jump back to,

202
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.930
to what you were saying about mainstream,
do they have to go back?

203
00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:17.931
Matt Pooty Pie guy and Europe places I get scared when everyone talks about

204
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:21.780
stuff in generalities,
right.
When I talk about,
and I'm guilty of it too,

205
00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:25.450
when I talk about like all mainstream media,
it's not everyone,
you know?
Right.
Um,

206
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.780
but there are,
I,

207
00:11:26.781 --> 00:11:30.900
I stopped doing interviews with mainstream outlets several years ago because

208
00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:32.190
they made everything about,

209
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.990
like I would talk about all the really cool ventures that we're going into,
how,

210
00:11:35.991 --> 00:11:40.390
how our space is changing things up.
And it would always be turned into,
um,

211
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.170
one comment that maybe was somewhat critical of let's say like a,

212
00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:50.020
a studio and all become about that.
Or if all become about the money.
And,

213
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.650
and I was like,
you just fucking manipulating what I'm saying.

214
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.800
I don't want to do with it.
Yeah.
And,
and so the point is become,
uh,
when,

215
00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:00.670
when the Wall Street Journal knocks on Felix's door after they didn't apparently

216
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:03.250
approach him,
uh,
for the original story.
And they're like,
hey,

217
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:05.830
we want to give you a platform to tell your story.
It's like,
fuck you.

218
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.380
Is that what they're doing now?
Uh,
yeah.
The,

219
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.000
after the story broke and there were all these people that came to his defense,

220
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.220
they came to him.
Now I'm not going to,

221
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.740
that's what I think that's what a journalist should do.
Right.

222
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:18.700
Talk to the fucking moon,
I would assume,
but not be after the French journalists.

223
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:23.320
Well,
so I think from what Felix,
uh,
wrote,
it was the Wall Street Journal.

224
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:26.580
They left their cards and that's how we knew it was 100% of them.
Um,

225
00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:28.220
<v 1>but why does someone,
I mean,</v>

226
00:12:28.221 --> 00:12:30.740
what I mean is different journalists from the Wall Street Journal,

227
00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.000
not the same as really to hit P.
I don't know if it was the same ones.
He didn't,

228
00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.350
he didn't say,
Hey,
we're super sorry.

229
00:12:36.351 --> 00:12:39.560
We called you a Nazi in front of millions of people.
And we were totally lying.

230
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.500
Yeah.
But the argument all of a sudden is that why?

231
00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.460
Why should he do an interview with the Wall Street Journal?

232
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.050
Maybe because they have a different audience,

233
00:12:45.051 --> 00:12:49.640
but he has his own larger platform where he controls the narrative.

234
00:12:49.641 --> 00:12:51.000
He's not going to be selectively edited,

235
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.770
but he's not speaking to the people that the Wall Street Journal disparaged him

236
00:12:54.771 --> 00:12:55.161
in front of it.

237
00:12:55.161 --> 00:12:58.940
But I would assume that they're also covering their ass by going to him and

238
00:12:58.941 --> 00:13:01.640
reaching out and giving him a platform.
They can say,
well,

239
00:13:01.641 --> 00:13:05.000
we gave him a chance to respond and the facts remain.

240
00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.210
He did say those things and they are valid,
I think.

241
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:09.540
<v 0>I think if he was confident enough,</v>

242
00:13:09.541 --> 00:13:13.290
he should probably do what I've seen Milo Yiannopoulos do in the past where he

243
00:13:13.291 --> 00:13:17.250
had someone film at the same time.
So if they did misrepresent him in some manner

244
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.790
<v 1>matter,
it doesn't matter because they've already done it.</v>

245
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.490
They've already misrepresented him in the article.
If they,

246
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.880
if he has someone film his response to that,
I don't know.
I mean,

247
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.520
I mean just if he did something with them,
right.
If they did film,

248
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.850
film the entire thing,
just so you can show,

249
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.240
but I'm saying it doesn't matter because they've already done the damage,

250
00:13:36.241 --> 00:13:37.110
the damaging thing,

251
00:13:37.111 --> 00:13:40.800
like how many people who read the first thing or even going to read the second

252
00:13:40.801 --> 00:13:44.460
thing,
right.
It might even be 30%.
Well that's 70% people.

253
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:48.360
And how many people just read the Wall Street Journal and maybe a local paper

254
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.810
and our online and aren't hearing all these responses and they go,
oh,

255
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.930
you know these catch their son.
Oh,
I'm watching Pooty pie.

256
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.170
Oh you're watching that Nazi,
that guy's a Nazi.
No,
he's not dead.

257
00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.340
You hate everything.
I like,

258
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.600
<v 0>yeah.
And now that kid's doing meth for the rest of his life.
I don't know.
No,</v>

259
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:07.740
I uh,
I,
I think that it is sad,
right?
That's,

260
00:14:07.741 --> 00:14:08.970
that's a huge problem with,

261
00:14:08.971 --> 00:14:12.130
with a lot of the fake news or just news that's false is the,

262
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.580
the crazy salacious shit.
If you then look at the correction,

263
00:14:15.581 --> 00:14:19.180
half the time that gets like 20 times the shares,
you know why?

264
00:14:19.181 --> 00:14:22.660
Cause it's fucking insane.
It's like,
did you see this?
Did you see this thing?

265
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.710
And it's something that I've been critical of people I like in the industry,

266
00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.860
a critical level out of the mainstream guys.

267
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.680
I don't like it and it sucks because there's not,
there's not a clear answer.

268
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.350
Do you delete the false thing and then it looks like you're hiding that

269
00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:38.020
information.
Um,
do you do what?

270
00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.110
You should definitely delete the false thing but so that's my argument.

271
00:14:41.111 --> 00:14:42.930
But then there's an argument that you,

272
00:14:42.931 --> 00:14:46.300
you leave it up because you show that you were wrong.
If it's on Twitter,

273
00:14:46.301 --> 00:14:49.940
you quote tweet it,
but that's still,
that's still doesn't fix it because um,

274
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.070
as much as we talk about bubbles and separation,

275
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:53.120
<v 1>that tweet,</v>

276
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.420
that promotion of a thing is separate from everything else in the world.

277
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.630
Tweets are problematic anyway because it's 140 characters and it's very

278
00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:02.870
difficult to adequately explain some subjects and 140 characters.

279
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:06.620
But if you put out some information that's not true,
like this Pooty pie thing,

280
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:11.270
right?
You absolutely should print a retraction and you absolutely,
if you have,

281
00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:12.470
it's still up on your website.

282
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.740
The first thing you should say is this is all taken out of context and it's

283
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:20.840
incorrect and it's not.
It does not represent who this guy is.

284
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:24.890
And you should absolutely not have those writers do that again.
Right?
I mean,

285
00:15:24.891 --> 00:15:29.720
whether you fire them or whether you,
who knows what they were asked to do,

286
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.380
this is another part of the problem.
Was it,

287
00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:35.240
was this an independent thing that they decided to pursue on their own?

288
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.460
Did someone ask them to do it?

289
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.300
Was there someone who decided that this guy was a Nazi because maybe they tuned

290
00:15:41.301 --> 00:15:44.240
in at the very moment he was doing something right,
and they're like [inaudible].

291
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.120
And some people obviously are very,
very sensitive to that kind of stuff.

292
00:15:47.121 --> 00:15:49.390
So I think that's why it's important,
especially on a,

293
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.940
an editorial team of some sorts I have people with,
with mixed opinions,

294
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.690
because it's very easy to all of a sudden get railroaded behind him.

295
00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.080
An idea of just like,
yeah,
look at these,
look at these seven specific things.

296
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.390
We're not gonna say that it's out of context,
but look at this information.

297
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:05.240
We got this guy,
we got,
we've got this guy dead to rights,
but it's,

298
00:16:05.241 --> 00:16:09.680
it's all flimsy.
Well,
again,
context,
right?
As soon as you,

299
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:13.220
that is part of the problem with doing something like you do and it's certainly

300
00:16:13.221 --> 00:16:18.221
part of the problem with a co a podcast is if you're talking for three hours and

301
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.760
you take these little snippets of those three hours out of context,

302
00:16:22.761 --> 00:16:25.730
it paints a completely distorted perception of who the person is.

303
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:30.200
But that's also a problem with language in general.

304
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.360
It really is a problem with,

305
00:16:32.361 --> 00:16:36.320
and it's certainly a problem with words and that's one of the problems with

306
00:16:36.321 --> 00:16:39.680
these magic words like that you're not supposed to say anymore.

307
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.250
Whatever those words are,
you know,
the,
you,
you,

308
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:48.610
you give the weight gives so much weight to these words that just taken alone,

309
00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.480
uh,
on,
on their own.
They can get you in trouble just saying,

310
00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.780
uttering the phrase as if it was a magic.
Abracadabra,

311
00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:00.290
I think it get you in trouble.
I think it's important that we stopped trying to,

312
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.030
uh,
got it rhymes and it's not on purpose.

313
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.360
We have to stop just blindly hating and we try and educate.
Right.

314
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:08.540
I think that don't blindly hate educate.

315
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:14.900
It's an afterschool specials.
Dot.
Philly d Oh God,
that sounds like straight up.

316
00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:19.880
Something from the 90s on a skateboard.
He pull up.
Don't hate educate.

317
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:21.380
Yeah,
but I mean,

318
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:31.020
yeah.
