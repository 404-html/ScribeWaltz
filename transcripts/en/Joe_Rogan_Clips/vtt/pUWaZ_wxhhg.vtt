00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.760
Hello Freak bitches.
That's amazing.
You know what's really incredible is that,

2
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:09.080
uh,
people are using Siliciden,
um,

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.910
these days in what they call micro dosing,

4
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:16.380
taking very small doses and seeing these profound benefits.
Yeah.
Uh,

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.410
one of the things that I'm aware of is kickboxers are using it and kickboxers

6
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.020
are using it in a good buddy of mine is using it.

7
00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:26.930
He says that he can see things happen before they happen.

8
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.540
Like it was almost like he's reading people's minds before they're about to do

9
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:33.440
something even on micro dose.
Yeah.

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.260
That's very interesting in an intense environment of sparring and,
and the,

11
00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:42.540
the intense physical kinetic interaction of kickboxing said he's seeing what

12
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:45.300
people are going to do before they do it in a way that he's never able to do

13
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.250
quote unquote on the net.
Right.
No,
I'm not surprised at all.
I mean,

14
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:53.190
and why,
why aren't you surprised?
Like what do you think is happening?

15
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.900
Because I think that uh,

16
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.740
these things let you step out of your box a little bit.

17
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:06.741
They let you step out of your usual reference frame and notice things going on

18
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:08.520
in the environment.
That again,

19
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:12.990
this gating mechanism we were talking about where program to filter stuff out,

20
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.930
psychedelics temporarily disrupt that.

21
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.050
They let the background come forward and you notice things about the environment

22
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:22.050
that we're,

23
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.490
that normally you would suppress because they're not relevant to immediate

24
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.480
survival.

25
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.860
I don't know if you've read some of the work by Simon Powell.

26
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.410
He wrote the psilocybin the solution.

27
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.300
He writes very intelligently about psilocybin.
In this latest book,

28
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:41.340
the Mush Magic Mushroom explorer,

29
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:46.341
he talks about how silicide Siliciden is a lens.

30
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:52.431
So essentially you can think of it as a lens through which you can look at the

31
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:54.061
world.

32
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:59.061
You can look at natural phenomena and you will notice things about that,

33
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.900
those phenomena that you normally would overlook because we're programmed to do

34
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:08.760
it.
So in a sense he talks about how silicide but is a scientific instrument.

35
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.210
You know,

36
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.530
it's a lens through which you can look at the world and see aspects of it that

37
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:14.790
are always there,

38
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.210
but you've never noticed them before because we're programmed not to.

39
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:21.240
For example,
um,
you know,

40
00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:26.160
carry Mola says is famous because his discoveries in molecular biology,

41
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:31.161
he attributes to his insights about molecular processes that he got from LSD

42
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.100
that he could get down with the molecules as he put it and see how all this is

43
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:38.700
working.

44
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.320
And obviously he invented a polymerase chain reaction,

45
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:47.730
which she got the Nobel prize for.
So it's not like this was a delusion,

46
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.750
it's a real thing that he was able to notice that no one else,

47
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.860
you know what I'm saying?

48
00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:57.240
He was able to put himself in a place where he could notice these phenomenon.

49
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.190
And I think,
I think that's really true.
If you,

50
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.220
if you go to take a walk in the forest with an indigenous person,

51
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.311
you know,

52
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:11.311
who in some ways as in this less of this sensory gating in a more open place all

53
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:17.920
the time,
they will notice things about the environment,

54
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.030
you know,

55
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.030
that you are completely oblivious to until they pointed out,

56
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.280
you know,
and then now say,
Oh yes,

57
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.280
I never noticed the leaf cutter ants are behaving this way,

58
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:34.600
or these different things.
Their sensory,
uh,

59
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.770
sort of,
uh,

60
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.780
experience of a environment like the forest is very different than ours,

61
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.480
you know,
because we're used to,

62
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.870
we're just not out in nature the same way.

63
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:51.871
And I daresay I think one of the things that in some ways inserts a,

64
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.290
uh,
a barrier between us is literacy.
You know,

65
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.920
we're all literate,
right?
And we'd like being literate.

66
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.940
It's good that we're literate,
but in order to be literate,

67
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.970
you have to have this separation between the self and the external environments.

68
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:13.450
You know,
you have to pick up a book and read it.
I am here,

69
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:16.390
I'm the point of view.
Here's the book,
you know?

70
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.420
So that creates that relationship and you sacrifice,

71
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.570
you focus on one particular sensory modality and you sacrifice all the other

72
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:29.650
input that is coming up.

73
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.230
I don't know if I'm making Sam absolutely,
absolutely.
But,
but that's,

74
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.500
that's what these substances can do.

75
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:43.501
They can essentially reverse this background foreground relationship that we're

76
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:49.921
so used to suddenly what's right in front of you is not so important and you can

77
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:55.210
pay attention to the things in the background that you're normally your program

78
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.590
to suppress and ignore.

79
00:04:56.591 --> 00:05:01.591
Because know you have to be ready for the saber tooth tiger to come across,

80
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.700
you know,
over the,
the mountain or whatever.
You know what I'm saying?

81
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:11.290
But,
uh,
it's good in that sense.

82
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.490
They teach different ways of perception,
you know,

83
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.850
and I think that's a very useful thing to learn.
You know,

84
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.530
the indigenous people call these psychedelics plant teachers and they call them

85
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.700
teachers for a reason.
You know,
much of the,

86
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.960
what you experienced comes directly from the experience,

87
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:36.961
but much of it also comes from your change perception and suddenly realize

88
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:39.520
there's a different way to be in the world.

89
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.550
There's a at different way to perceive what you experienced that normally you

90
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:49.900
don't.
Uh,
you know,
we're programmed to filter out.

91
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.440
I don't know if you've ever read or had a Stephen Buhner on your show.

92
00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:59.390
No,
he writes very intelligently about this stuff.

93
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:04.391
He's written a book called a plant intelligence on the imaginal realm and it's

94
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.440
all about this,
you know,
uh,
this,
uh,

95
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.530
essentially what his rap is.
You can learn this,
you know,

96
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:19.460
you can learn this way of perceiving whether you do it with psychedelics or not.

97
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.230
You can actually learn it and it's a,
it's an interesting,

98
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.650
it's a better way to relate to nature or more of an alternative way to relate to

99
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:30.830
nature in any way.

100
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.830
I feel like we have these pre assume definitions of things that we rely upon

101
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.240
instead of seeing things for what they really are and you kind of,
yeah,

102
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:45.140
you box them up and you package them and you go,
oh,
well there's a car,

103
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.750
there's h and then one day you look at the car and you go,

104
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.350
that's a box that has a controlled explosion and Cayston iron and it rolls on

105
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:57.980
rubber tires.
That's exactly what I'm talking about,
right?

106
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.660
There's a different way to look at things if you step out of the box.
And yes,

107
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:07.250
it is all those things and it's also a car and it's that if you did that all the

108
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:11.060
time,
you'd never get anything done.
That's right.
That's right.

109
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>
