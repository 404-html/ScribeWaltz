WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.550
But it's,
it's hard sometimes,
man,

2
00:00:02.551 --> 00:00:07.110
because there are so many people that are just unreasonable and they're not good

3
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:10.680
at communicating and they're not happy.
They're not happy people and not man.

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.650
There's a lot of people out there that are just aren't happy man.
It's,
you know,

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.700
and it'd be honest with you,

6
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:19.230
I didn't realize it until I got to the notoriety that I am now in the space that

7
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:20.920
I'm in.
Well,
you're in a weird space.
Yeah.

8
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.290
Because you're in the space of defending guns,
you know,
and I'm black.
Yeah.

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.890
And I'm relatively young.
Yeah.
There's a lot going on there.

10
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.310
And we were a lawyer and I work well.
They tend to disregard that.
Well,

11
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:35.460
they should probably pay attention.
Well,
it doesn't matter because I have,

12
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.990
I'm doing,
I'm advocating also with certain three letters behind me.

13
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.950
They automatically assume as the devil.
How does it NRA feel about you?

14
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.380
Do you know?
I mean,
do you have conversations with them?

15
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:49.890
Are they saying good job or they,
are they pleased or,
oh,
I mean,

16
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:53.690
as far as I can tell they arms.
We still have the relationship we have.
It's,

17
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.770
it's very much a very symbiotic relationship,

18
00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:57.690
but it's a weird one right now because it's like,

19
00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:59.070
this is what I hear from the NRA.

20
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.820
I hear Coleen [inaudible] and then I hear Ted Nugent.

21
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.150
Those are the two that I hear.
I,
I gotta be honest,
I'm not,

22
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:12.160
I'm not the biggest fan of Ted techniques,
rhetoric.
Um,

23
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.060
but I do know where it's coming from.
But then again,

24
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:19.110
I didn't grow up listening to Ted Nugent.
Yeah.
That's not my demographic.

25
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.290
But at the same time took Nugent.
It's still an individual.

26
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:27.050
And people felt or understand that like we,
like,
we may be monolithic on that,

27
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.520
on the issue of firearms.
We're not monolithic.

28
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:33.570
And the way we go about expressing that,
well,
he's right about things.
You know,

29
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:36.940
just because someone's outrageous doesn't mean they're not right.
Like a,

30
00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:38.430
if you ever seen his,
uh,

31
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.320
the s the debate that he had in a gun store with Piers Morgan.

32
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.100
Yeah,
no,
the funny thing is tattoos.
She's incredibly bright.
It is a smart guy.

33
00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:52.590
He's just crazy.
Hell,
I don't even think he's crazy.
I do.
You can only,

34
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.920
you can only kill so many things for you.
Lose your fucking marbles.

35
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.450
Ted Lives on a fucking ranch in Texas where it's all fenced in.

36
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.310
He's just shooting all animals.
He hunts every day.
He's a psycho.
And I don't,

37
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.360
with all due respect,
I'm a big fan of strangle hold.
So what Ha,
what's,

38
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:12.120
where's the line of demarcation between becoming courageous,

39
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:14.760
hunting too much and not hurting enough in terms of becoming,

40
00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:18.470
it's crossing over that line into the sociopath?
Well,
I'm just joking.

41
00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:19.530
By the time it's,
I'm a hunter.

42
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:22.500
I mean it really depends entirely upon what he's doing with the meat.

43
00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:24.900
And I know he gives it to hunters for the hungry.

44
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.850
I know he gives it to neighbors and friends and there's nothing wrong with that.

45
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.010
Then he asked,
he actually has a,
um,

46
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.560
he has an obligation to be the steward of his land because he has a lot of

47
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:40.410
exotics and stuff on it.
I'm just totally joking around.
Oh No,
I know.

48
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.360
But when you,
um,
when you listen to his conversation with Piers Morgan,

49
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.550
which Piers Morgan takes that flipping leftwing knee jerk reactionary,

50
00:02:50.551 --> 00:02:54.750
you know Eric guns?
Yeah.
He's a con.
Yeah.
And when he's,

51
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.250
when he's on with Ted,

52
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.160
Ted just knew everything about the actual facts.

53
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:03.310
When you start running around with statistics of gun violence,
he's like,

54
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.020
do you know how many of those people were bad guys that were shot by cops?
Yeah.

55
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.370
Do you know how many of those people were people that were shot when they're

56
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.540
breaking into people's homes?

57
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.910
Do you know how many of those people were people that were killed in self

58
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:16.000
defense?
Yeah,
there's a lot.
Yeah,
it's not.
And you know how many of those people,

59
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.820
when you sit and talk about gun violence,
how many other people were suicide?
Uh,

60
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:22.600
yeah,
there's a lot.
Keep in mind that the recent suicide,
well,
no.

61
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.520
So here's what happened.

62
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.940
So when I started getting really deep into the advocacy component of it,

63
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.640
everyone was screaming,
30,000 people a day die from gun violence.

64
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.260
30,000 people a day.
That's what they were running with.
Right?

65
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.320
And they were scaring all the suburban House moms.
Oh my gosh.

66
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:41.800
We got to do something about gun control.
We got to do something about guns.
Um,

67
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.960
so I,
I jumped into the pool and I,
I,

68
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.710
I just like something doesn't seem right about that figure right now.

69
00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:51.400
I'm not saying I'm the one who brings what's wrong about it.
It's seem inflated.

70
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.220
It seem to fight it.
I don't know what it was.

71
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:56.380
It's on a subconscious level or maybe,

72
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.820
or maybe it was me looking for confirmation bias,
right?

73
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.040
Because I felt the way I did about farms.
I'll be honest and say that.
Right?

74
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.750
And so what I did is I kind of researched a little more than I realize.

75
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.613
Holy Shit.

76
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.940
Over 65% of that 30,000 is suicides.

77
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.570
65% real.
He's just Christ.

78
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:18.100
So what does that like 18,000 people a day?
Shoot themselves,
man.

79
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:20.260
Something crazy like that.
What did we say at the top of the show?

80
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.080
And people are miserable.
Man.
That's a fucking crazy number though,
man.

81
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.730
That's a Kevin Hart concert.
Yeah,
pretty much altogether.

82
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.990
CanNot everybody blam well,
that's really what it is.

83
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.430
18,000 people that,
that's fucking incredible.
So then it,

84
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.230
but then it begs the question that you brought it before the mental health

85
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:40.300
aspect.
Yeah.
How much,
how much,

86
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.080
how many lives would we actually save if we took the same energy we applied to

87
00:04:45.081 --> 00:04:50.081
just making guns evil and trying to ban guns and take that energy and put it

88
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:54.610
towards understanding what it is.
W W why as a society,

89
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:59.470
we have a society that is so eager to really not want to be here anymore.

90
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.280
Mm.
