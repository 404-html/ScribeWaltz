Maybe you missed her calling baseball might've been you find baseball so boring.

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.993
It's definitely boring.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.730
It's one of those things that you couldn't and people right now are screaming,

4
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:12.550
fuck your uh,
your fans hate me anyway.
That's not,

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.440
that's definitely not true.
I see it occasionally attention to those comments.

6
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.850
There are music,
there are only the people that would comment something shitty.

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.560
They're the only ones that are going to get to you.
Right.
I get it.

8
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.370
There's a lot of Kuk Beta stuff about the kind of,

9
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.500
because they assume I am an open relationship and so therefore there's all that

10
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:34.380
kind of stuff.
Yeah,
that cut thing.
That's interesting.

11
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.410
Anyone who would call someone else a cook or a Beta male is most likely.

12
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.740
I don't think you could say anyone cause sometimes people just are and some

13
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:47.940
people say it and they're correct,
but I think for the most part,

14
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:51.510
but why would you say that you're not in an argument?
Okay.

15
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:54.420
Like you aren't in an argument with them.
You don't know them.
You guys aren't.

16
00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:57.850
So why are they insulting you?
Why they going Africans?
Because of insecurity.

17
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.840
Let's also,
because of this weird way of expressing each other,
uh,
ourselves on,

18
00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:05.240
on instant,
you know,
on Twitter,
Facebook and stuff,

19
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.720
just to instant that instantaneous ability to just go after something.

20
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:11.970
You don't meet them,
you don't establish a friendship with them.

21
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.260
You don't talk to them about what I'm saying.

22
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:15.300
It's a reflection as a psychologist,

23
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:18.840
I find it really interesting because it's an,
it's,
it's,
you know,

24
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:23.140
you see these guys every fucking day.
There's another story about a,

25
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.620
an anti gay,
you know,

26
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:30.550
minister who's been sucking little boy's dicks every day,
or even big black guys,

27
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.290
Dick,
whatever,
whatever,
whatever dixies into.

28
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.500
But if he's trying to like pray the gay away,
yeah,
for sure.

29
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.300
There's some gates going on somewhere.

30
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.950
I think we reveal our deepest secrets in our loudest accusations.

31
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.550
I think you're right.
You know,
and so this whole,
the,

32
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:51.240
the trolling and stuff going on online is interesting because people don't

33
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:55.160
realize that they're exposing themselves,
you know?
Yeah.
Well,

34
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.280
it's also,

35
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.350
it's a really shitty way of interacting with humans that some people participate

36
00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:02.920
in almost exclusively.
Yeah.

37
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.990
Like there's some people right now in our culture that they're communicating

38
00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:10.000
with people,
but the people that they're communicating with,
their,

39
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:12.690
their only communicating with people online,

40
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.770
they're only doing it through Twitter or Facebook or however they do it.

41
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.070
So like their days are spent interacting just randomly with people tweeting at

42
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:26.400
them and reading tweets or reading,
you know,

43
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:31.290
reading message board posts or posting things or reading Instagram,

44
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.090
you know,
passages.
All they're doing is interacting with people online.

45
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.380
And I just think there's a lot of kids developing that way cause there would not

46
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:42.450
even,
even when they're around each other,

47
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.980
they're spending more time communicating with people through a device than they

48
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:50.190
are doing it face to face because they're always distracted.

49
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.800
And I feel like this is a very,

50
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.450
it's not indicative of how we evolved like these,

51
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.370
this method of communication.

52
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.920
So like people say there's way more hate today than it's ever been before.

53
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.710
I don't think so.
I think it's the same amount of hate.

54
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.280
There's just this new weird form of expression that doesn't make you take into

55
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:10.960
consideration the other people's feelings.

56
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.290
It's like the only time we've ever had something like that.

57
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.540
If you killed someone or you beat someone up and you looked at them and they

58
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:21.370
looked at you and you knew that you hated them,
at least that's an honest attack,

59
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.720
you know?
But if you're,

60
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:27.130
if you want something terrible to happen to someone and you don't even know
them,

61
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.600
he just heard him on a podcast.

62
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:31.990
He was a guest and he annoyed Usi want terrible things to happen to them.

63
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.410
Like you're not even,
you don't even know him.
It's like traffic,
anger out.

64
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.790
Fuck you.
Like,
Eh,
you know,
know that guy in that car,
like whatever.

65
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.830
You know where that comes from,
the right traffic.

66
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:45.430
Anger comes from a heightened sense of awareness because you're going so fast

67
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.610
because you're in your car or scared.
Yeah,
well,
you're ramped up.

68
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.310
You're looking constantly for anything to go wrong.

69
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.580
You can't be at zero and just drive.
When you're driving,

70
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:58.150
you're very aware that you're at the wheel of a big fucking thing and the car

71
00:03:58.151 --> 00:03:59.590
accidents happen and people die in them.

72
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.680
Everybody's aware of that so you can get,
you get ramped up.
