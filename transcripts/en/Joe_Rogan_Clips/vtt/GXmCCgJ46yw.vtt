1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.590
Most talked about that.
Like every,

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.190
I got calls from all my friend Bert Kreischer was fucking obsessed with you.

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.040
He wouldn't stop calling me about it.
He's like,

4
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:11.850
the fucking guy's by himself through the video with him,
with the grizzly bear,

5
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:15.570
and he's pointing the gun at it.
Jesus Christ.
Fucking weirdest thing is,
it's,

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.700
that's normal shit.
It is.
That's very normal society so removed from it now.

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.590
Well,
if you're out there,
it's normal to get false charge by a grizzly bear.

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.850
Nycha.
One good reason not fucking be out.

9
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.920
All of the token wave came about this.
Well,

10
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.440
we hopped into the back of Montana to the spot that's usually got a bunch of

11
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:40.650
grizzly bears that I go to and uh,
we were talking about you,

12
00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:43.410
how you wouldn't come out to Australia.
Hunting could just scan it.
Everything.

13
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.040
The difference is when you walking around the mountains here,

14
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.370
it can happen at any point because fucking grizzly bears to go feet.

15
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.450
They walk on land.
In Australia,
you pretty much have to go into the water.

16
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:58.170
So you're only worried about that when you go to click water or you're thinking

17
00:00:58.171 --> 00:01:02.700
about having a wash or something here it's full time.
For whatever reason,

18
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.660
it doesn't bother me as much to get killed and eaten by a bear.

19
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.850
Does a giant saltwater CROC.
I reckon the crocodile,
it'd be nicer.

20
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.800
What?
Yeah,
it'd be nicer.
It like grab you and drag you down.
You'd drowned anyway,

21
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.281
you know?

22
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:20.840
And then it would do what it wants to go at Grizzly bear is gonna fucking

23
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.600
Moliere scratch your face off.
Bite your neck.
Take chunks out of here.

24
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.600
It's going to be longer,
dude.
Yeah,
but it's American.

25
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.430
We're not want no foreign shit.
Fucking no fun is eating to me.

26
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.070
Uh,
there's some about a grizzly bears.

27
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:41.420
It's most terrifying things that they just eat you.
They don't kill you first.

28
00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:44.910
He just holds you down eating you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They treat you the same way.

29
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:46.080
They treat a salmon.
You know,

30
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:48.950
when you see them hold down salmon and they take big bites out of it,

31
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.800
they don't make sure they killed.
I thought behind it,
you know,
it's like,
yeah,

32
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:53.940
I'll finish it off first.

33
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:58.650
And then did you see the mountain lion that I ended up hunting?
He did,
yeah.

34
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.050
And like mountain lions usually kill their prey,

35
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:05.010
but obviously grabbed the car and it was eaten this calf while it's still alive,

36
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:09.150
like a beef cow calf video.
Pretty disturbing.

37
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.460
And then I seen one not long ago,

38
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:15.450
someone shared with me with a mountain lion drag and the mule deer down,

39
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.780
it's like chomping on this mule deer before it actually dies,
you know?

40
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:22.590
And it's like,
there's just not that thought process there.

41
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:23.700
There's not that human,

42
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.420
as long as they make sure that they have it as a meal and it's not going

43
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:29.480
anywhere,
they'll just get it done.
Yeah.

44
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.810
Some friends,
uh,
were elk hunting and they came across as elk who,
uh,

45
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.350
these wolves had torn the back legs apart and were a,

46
00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:44.520
it was in the river and the wolves were eating it while it was in the river.

47
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:47.070
And the thing was moaning and screaming.
It couldn't go anywhere.

48
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.560
But bull elk in the,
in the water.
And they just pretty,

49
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.270
pretty horrible for us,

50
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.200
but I not give a fuck dot standard for them.

51
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.000
Have you encountered any bulls when you're out there?
Yeah,
plenty of times.
Yeah.

52
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.800
The first time I went to Canada was northwest territories and there was a pack

53
00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:11.820
of wolves that that would chase and a Caribou bull and like pretty much chase

54
00:03:11.821 --> 00:03:16.080
this thing to like a lever,
a sweat,
you know,
I like the key.
This is in winter.

55
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.160
So the ball,

56
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.210
the Caribou bull got really hot and like chased it in the freezing cold river

57
00:03:21.211 --> 00:03:24.600
and they sort of surrounded it in the river and then they just left it and they

58
00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:27.350
walked off,
you know?
And it wasn't that they were walking away from their kill,

59
00:03:27.351 --> 00:03:28.560
they knew the job was done,

60
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.190
the wolves went back up high and they got on these rocky benches and sat in the

61
00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:35.550
sun and we're like drawing out their selves and cooling down and drawing out.

62
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.450
And this Caribou never left the river.
It was like just quivering in the river.

63
00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:44.190
And then that afternoon when we come back,
that Caribou was just the caucus.

64
00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:47.700
We've like flesh hanging off the ribs on the side of the river so they come back

65
00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:52.540
down once the river had done his job and item smart as hell.
I that's,

66
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.450
that's really crazy that,
that intelligent that they know it's over.
They're like,

67
00:03:56.451 --> 00:04:00.360
Oh God,
he's in the water in the water.
Like chill now.
Yeah.

68
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.420
That has bananas.
Crazy high.

69
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.770
There are so wise people that I know that I've seen them in the forest say they

70
00:04:06.771 --> 00:04:09.350
look at you a different way.
Did they look at you?

71
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.210
There's a way they look through you.

72
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.690
They look at you in a way like almost like they think that that's the reason why

73
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.040
that the myth of the Werewolf exists as it people that have these terrifying

74
00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:25.800
encounters with wolves.
They swear that it's part human cause you make,

75
00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:29.180
he is into interior.
Yeah.
They're looking into you.
They're figuring you out.

76
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.380
You know,
he's got to think what it would be like if you just out there,
you know,

77
00:04:33.381 --> 00:04:35.150
if you're lucky live five years old,

78
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.310
you'd get this hard scrabble life out there chasing much larger animals than you

79
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.180
and you've got to kill them with your face.
Yeah.
Like a happened or die.

80
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.690
Yeah.
Crazy.
A pack of luck.
30 wolves.

81
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.400
This last trip that I was in BC and I kept coming around camp.

82
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.680
We had horses and not in camp and um,
one die.

83
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.890
I've ventured out to try and get onto them and get a better look at them and

84
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.450
they just,
without seeing me,
they just kept this perfect range,
you know,

85
00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:04.590
like that how back to me,

86
00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:07.560
I was trying to call him Manos Hal and that how back to me and I just keep these

87
00:05:07.561 --> 00:05:11.130
perfect range and you could tell the whole time they'll communicate and cause

88
00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:12.190
then they'd be a novel,

89
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:15.090
a wolf or a couple of wolves that were like a couple of miles in the other

90
00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:18.990
direction and you could hear them moving the same pattern at the rest of these

91
00:05:18.991 --> 00:05:22.950
walls were.
And I got eyes on him from a distance.

92
00:05:22.951 --> 00:05:27.270
I walked across an ice lake.
And other than that I never really seen him.

93
00:05:27.271 --> 00:05:30.420
But I guarantee you those wolves looked at me a bunch of times.

94
00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:32.190
Like they're just a different hunter dude.

95
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.280
They're trying to figure out what they can do.
Yeah.
So that's,

96
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:39.650
it's such a eerie feeling too.
So it's like snow and it's like,

97
00:05:39.651 --> 00:05:43.280
why in the back country of British Columbia and like,

98
00:05:43.281 --> 00:05:44.930
I'm going up on these mountains,

99
00:05:44.931 --> 00:05:47.090
it's like big pine trees and everything like that,

100
00:05:47.091 --> 00:05:49.750
and just every direction around your howl and dude,

101
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.240
you'd hear him how and you'd hear him do it sounds like a Bach.

102
00:05:53.241 --> 00:05:55.100
It's not stuck like this.
Short howl.

103
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.040
And then every now and then you'd hear hell different.

104
00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:00.020
And you could tell that that was the alpha.

105
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.840
There's the sound that it was letting out,
dude.

106
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:07.841
Just like earrings or some place to be if you were in the nature like crazy

107
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:12.220
place to be,
if you're not into Nycha fucking nightmare,

108
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:13.610
like,
yeah.
