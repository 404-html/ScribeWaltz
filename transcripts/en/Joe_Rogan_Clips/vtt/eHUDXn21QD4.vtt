1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.740
A publisher would,
would,
uh,
support an author through three,
four,
five books,

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.910
thinking eventually something's going to hit.
This guy's got talent eventually.

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.870
And so as an investment now they expect you to have your own platform.

4
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:14.280
You're an access to media.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.810
You sometimes they're asking authors to hire their own editors,

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.280
their own publicists,
right,
Hailey?
Yeah,
but they still get all the money.

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.820
They still get the same,
the contract.
Then the ratios are the same.
So it's like,

8
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:29.990
yeah,
that's why I say it's like a Napster kind of thing.
Yeah.

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.530
It's at the point now where it's like,
wait a minute,
if I got a platform,

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.510
I got access to media,
I'm hiring my own editor.
Why?

11
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.090
Why am I giving you creative control?

12
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.690
And 92% of the fucking revenue.

13
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.890
It's a strange business.
That is a strange business.

14
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.430
Essentially what they have is credibility.

15
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.320
So if you self publish or publish with some independent publisher,
the,

16
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.950
the New York Times isn't going to review it or you know.
No.
Wow.

17
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.090
Because it's a very insular world.
Well,
that's crazy.

18
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:07.050
If it's a book that takes off,
then a publisher will come in and buy.

19
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.090
So like 50 shades of gray that was self published.
I wonder why.
Yeah,

20
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.800
but look what happens.
Yeah.
They found they tapped into a market.
A chick,

21
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:19.620
the lights get spit on.
Right.
There are a lot of them.
There's a lot of them.

22
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.980
I don't know about their hood on,
but certainly yoked.
Yeah,

23
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.950
smacked around by a billionaire.
Yeah,
good looking.

24
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:28.410
Good looking guy with low carb gold,
heart of gold.

25
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:30.900
But he likes to spit in your mouth and then she,

26
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:35.901
and then ultimately he'll see the light and and of course he'll be tank course.

27
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.620
That's fantasy.
That's the fairy tale.

28
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.100
That's what everybody wants.
See,
that's why I was saying earlier,

29
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.250
I've got this idea,
I was talking to Duncan about this the other night.

30
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:49.920
I've got this idea to write an erotic memoir,

31
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.020
but that'll sort of be like my last book because at that point I'll have burned

32
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:56.160
all the bridges.

33
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.390
You'll be the only person who would ever your interview be after that.

34
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.810
I think I was planning for it to come out around my 60th birthday and it will be

35
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:07.350
called an old manifesto.

36
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.510
It's just have you changed the names of people?
Oh No.

37
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:15.860
I'm not worried about the people.
I'm not going to hurt anyone in the bush.

38
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.440
It's more just about,
you know how many people you fucked to.

39
00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:21.650
People find out the truth.
Dude,

40
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.430
you're going to become legendary this study though,

41
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.250
but it's not a book about how much I got laid.
It's not an,

42
00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:28.950
it's not a book about how cool I am.

43
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.280
It's a book about the amazing things I've learned in sexual situations and that

44
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.780
the world is so different from what people think,
how

45
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.130
there's just so many things going on that mainstream people can't imagine.

46
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.770
Like,
I mean,

47
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.840
I was in college the first time a man told me he would be happy for me to have

48
00:02:59.081 --> 00:03:00.100
sex with his wife

49
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.060
<v 1>and it wasn't a kinky weird thing.
It was like,
I'm not doing it.
She's wonderful.</v>

50
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:09.280
I noticed that you guys like each other.

51
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.320
I just want you to know it's cool with me.
Wow.
That's the first time.

52
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.840
Since then there's probably been,
I don't know,
half a thousand or something.
Um,

53
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.770
mothers like,
would you please have sex with my daughter?

54
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.340
Cause she really,
you know,
there is a good one.

55
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.760
But generally it's because she didn't like the boyfriend always.
Yeah.

56
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.500
So it's was like,
well you show my daughter,

57
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:38.620
like there's a world out there that she doesn't know about.
Yeah,

58
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:40.710
there's always that.
But then,
you know,
they recruit you,

59
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.730
you got to take on the project.
Well,
you know,
should you choose to accept it?

60
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:48.190
Should you choose to accept that they expect you to stick around as well?

61
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.060
Not necessarily.
Yeah.
Yeah.

62
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.330
The world's a weird stuff that people think like,
you know,
oh my God,

63
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:58.750
if you know you have sex with someone's wife and he knows he's going to kill
you,

64
00:03:58.751 --> 00:03:59.380
well maybe not.

65
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.020
Maybe he'll take you out for a beer afterwards and you'll be friends.

66
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.580
This is the subject of Ari Shaffir podcast this week with our,
uh,

67
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:07.960
with Aubrey Marcus.

68
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.620
And they're talking about open relationships and they get super honest.

69
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.880
It's very intense.

70
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.330
I think that we live in cultural patterns and that what we see around us,

71
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.670
we replicate.
I think there's a lot of evidence for that.

72
00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:22.810
If you just pay attention.

73
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.170
I forgot about studies just to look at how different people are in other parts

74
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:26.621
of the world.

75
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:29.590
People that are putting plates in their lips and rings through their nurses.

76
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.080
People that way,
people tattoo themselves.

77
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:35.140
The way people express themselves in dance,

78
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:40.141
like human beings vary so wildly in what we accept when we don't accept.

79
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.890
I was going to bring up Japan earlier.
It's one of the more fascinating uh,

80
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.590
travel,
uh,
experiences I've had was going to Japan.

81
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.850
Because when you go to Tokyo you realize like this is a completely different way

82
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:52.684
of living.

83
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.930
Like they have a completely different way of interacting on the streets.

84
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.710
They have a completely different way that they have decorated their buildings

85
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.380
completely.
It like I have tattoos,

86
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:04.270
they told me I had to wear long sleeves at the gym.

87
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.680
I had to go back and change my shirt.
They don't accept,
uh,

88
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.450
exposed to associated with organized crime.
Yes.
So I had to go back and a,
I mean,

89
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.320
there's a lot of that,

90
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.620
like where you realize like this is a totally different way of living,

91
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:21.030
but if I lived there,
I would live like these people.
So the,
the,

92
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.990
the momentum of these patterns in these cultures gets established and then it

93
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:30.991
takes something radical to lift them and to free people from these patterns.

94
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:32.410
And once they're free from these patterns,

95
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.450
then they have a real opportunity to objectively assess the way they behave.

96
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.390
And whether or not this is the way they want to behave or the way they want to

97
00:05:40.391 --> 00:05:45.100
live or were there in that just expect it to because of this unthinking culture,

98
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.210
right?
This momentum.
