1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.830
In a further distance course you have to,
yeah,

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.330
but it also makes you susceptible for counters in a way like,

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.060
like when,
when Connor was fighting Floyd,

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.760
my biggest concern for Connor was not speed or counterpunching.

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.570
It was the distance that you're going to be able to counter.

6
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.110
And when,
when Connor caught Floyd a cough Floyd a couple times in the beginning,

7
00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:24.810
I think one was a left upper cut he called flood.

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
That was shocking to me because I was surprised that he had boxing counter

9
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:35.680
punching speed.
The distance is half.
Yeah.

10
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.120
Compared to a kick sport.
I would say if we're standing what,
two,

11
00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:43.860
three feet away from each other in kickboxing,
it's one and a half unboxing.

12
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.280
So to cut that distance in half and still have the counterpunching ability was

13
00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:52.250
impressive.
Yeah.
I mean,
well he's done a lot of

14
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.390
<v 1>lower level boxing and the gym,
stuff like that is when you get up to that level,</v>

15
00:00:56.391 --> 00:00:59.600
it's a different fucking gay Floyd Mayweather is on a completely different

16
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:03.360
planet than anybody else.
He's the greatest of all time.
Yeah,

17
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.080
that's what I'm meaning like I think he's better at boxing.

18
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.820
Then Stephen Hawking is astrophysics.
You might be right.
Look,

19
00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:15.140
he's 50 and now the con it does count even though it probably shouldn't.
Right.

20
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.520
I mean it was a real boxing match,

21
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:20.120
but it was a guy that had zero professional boxing matches.
Uh,

22
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:23.000
but he did get tagged Connor.
Ken Punch.
He's a good fighter.

23
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.980
He's a very good mixed martial arts fighter.

24
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.490
But the thing about Floyd is that Floyd is the best at not getting hit.

25
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.540
No one's better.
So I've been tagged,
really tagged like three times,

26
00:01:32.541 --> 00:01:35.390
four times in his whole career.
I can name five times.
Yeah.

27
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.010
It should be Shane Mosley,
my Donna the end of the fourth round.
Yup.
Um,

28
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.680
the other ones are early.
I'm Judah.
Right Hook.
I actually talked to him.

29
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.460
Sam shooter was a wicked man.
It was great.
His Dad was a kickbox.
That's right.

30
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.610
He came from that.
What does the name something something,
dude,
I forget his name,

31
00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:52.530
but all guys.
You all did.
You all do it?
Yeah.
And then,
uh,

32
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.500
to Marcus Chop Chop quarterly.
Oh,
that's right.
I forgot them.
Oh yeah,

33
00:01:57.501 --> 00:02:02.120
that's right.
It was.
Um,
yeah,
my,
my pops was like a massive box and Fannie,

34
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.840
we still go to Ollie's a,
he was a journalist back in the day,

35
00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:07.730
used to cover like Ali and his fight something.
That's why I kind of came up,

36
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.200
you know,
generationally watching boxing.
So that's awesome.
Yeah Dude,
it was like,

37
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.380
I mean some of the best moments,
you know what Floyd has going for him,

38
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:20.381
that the best Jujitsu guys have going for him is that he's not physically

39
00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:24.870
powerful.
Like the best Jujitsu guys are smaller people,
right?

40
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.400
Because the smaller people learn how to use leverage and technique and the camp

41
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:31.790
muscle things.
Whereas if you look at 250 pound gorilla,

42
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.250
here's some good old football player dude.
And you're like,
man,

43
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:38.300
I don't want to words fuck Jujitsu.
Like you don't ever have to be on your back.

44
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.840
Right.
You know,

45
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.540
like I was talking to [inaudible] about that shops thinking about doing jujitsu

46
00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:44.060
again cause I was telling him,
I got back into it recently,

47
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.520
I'm really enjoying it and he's like,
ah,
I don't know.
I go,

48
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:50.210
just roll off your back man.
Tell him to be a big guy with a guard.

49
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.100
No big guys have gone.
It's so rare,
right?

50
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:56.330
Because big guys just get little guys on the ground and they have a nasty top

51
00:02:56.331 --> 00:02:59.890
game,
but then when they find themselves on their back,
a lot of them are turtles.

52
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.580
Right?
Ooh.
They don't know what to do.
Yeah.
It's a technique thing.

53
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.590
A little guy has to learn perfect precision technique because they don't have

54
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:12.550
that exercise or power point guard.
The NBA,
Floyd has weekends cans.

55
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:14.490
He's broken his hands many times.
Yeah.

56
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.480
And even though he's capable of knocking guys out,
it's with precision.
All these,

57
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.920
he's going to knock you out like a John the beast Mugabi would or a Francis and

58
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:24.940
Ghana would,

59
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:29.020
or a fucking a real power punch or Joe Smith.

60
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.400
There's guys who just fucking get you to the cage or in the in against the ropes

61
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:34.360
and just smash.

62
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.870
<v 0>Yeah.
Uncanny.
Some of these guys,
it's just raw power and it's,</v>

63
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.150
Yep.
He,
Floyd is all precision and he's all like,

64
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:44.530
one of the most fun things for me is,

65
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.590
is watching Floyd in the first round and watching him take away your life.

66
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.850
Like I like to see him take away a fighter's confidence,
right?

67
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:59.560
Like he knew that Moseley was going to get off with the jab,
or at least he knew,

68
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:03.040
mostly thought that he was going to get off with the jab.
And there's a moment,

69
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.740
even in the first round,
I know he gets tagged with that overhand right,

70
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.350
but there's a moment where Mosley,

71
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.740
Mosley pops the Left Jab and Floyd sees it steps back slightly and then come

72
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:15.550
straight over at the right.

73
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.030
And that moment you could see Shane know that there's nothing he can do because

74
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.980
Floyd has time the Jab and countered it directly.

75
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.640
So now your job is done now blocked off one of your arms.

76
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:33.280
I've literally just cut it off.
Now you got to open up with the right.

77
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.670
You're not gonna do anything to me.
Just straight right.
I mean,

78
00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:37.120
I got the Philly shell,
it's over.

79
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.820
It's like seeing him take pieces away from a fighter.
It's,
I just,
I love fucking,

80
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:43.210
yeah

81
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.400
<v 1>man.
Well he learns how to,
I'm the biggest boy,
Paul Young age too.</v>

82
00:04:46.401 --> 00:04:49.760
And His dad was a wizard.
His Dad when he was young,

83
00:04:49.761 --> 00:04:52.580
fought sugar ray Leonard and of course good fight when sugar ray was in his

84
00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:55.940
prime.
Good pedigree men comes from good pedigree.
They know how to do it.

85
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.340
A smart fighter schools.
Roger Mayweather,

86
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.880
Black Mamba was his brother was a motherfucker man.

87
00:05:01.881 --> 00:05:04.460
I used to love watching his brother fight pack and the,
or is a,

88
00:05:04.461 --> 00:05:09.020
is a uncle rather.
I used to love watches,
uncle fight.
He would fight on like ABC,

89
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.830
like whatever television shows were having boxing on television during the day.

90
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.520
Maybe it was ABC,
I don't remember.
But yeah,
like that family,

91
00:05:16.521 --> 00:05:20.240
he grew up boxing and he also got to see the things that people do wrong,

92
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.300
you know?
And here's another thing that Floyd has going for him.

93
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.290
Conditioning unfathomed he's always in tremendous shape.

94
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.710
Always just always in shape.
I think it's a hustle.
When you see a meeting,

95
00:05:30.711 --> 00:05:33.170
the mcdonalds and shit,
nothing.

96
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.500
I hundred percent regularly,
100% you can eat that shit.
It's just carbohydrates.

97
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.080
It's just bullshit.
The thing about that,
like either the eating sugar or uh,

98
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.310
like he'll drink a soda after a workout.

99
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.730
He's working out for two and a half hours so you can take some sugar dude.

100
00:05:49.731 --> 00:05:51.150
Not only can you take some shade,

101
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.550
there is an argument that that kind of sugar is not bad for you after you have a

102
00:05:55.551 --> 00:06:00.130
brutal workout.
Dude,
when I was,
we did this sober October challenge.
Yeah.

103
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.490
Showing a three man,
dude already looked phenomenal fucking free.

104
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.110
So I'm in New York.
I was like,
dude,
you had add.

105
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.230
He was going to be my biggest competition too cause he hired in his face.

106
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:13.790
Like his head is just exhausted.
Yeah.
He's like,
yeah,
so door to this bullshit,

107
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.690
but his body was fucking shredded.
Shredded.
What does this head Johnson,

108
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:19.540
he always eats McDonald's and he's doing it.
Yeah.

109
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.960
While he's working out right here.
Yeah,
dude,
you can do that.

110
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.470
It's all in how much you exercise now that's not,

111
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.750
please go chat.

112
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.470
Obviously he's eating healthy food on top of that,

113
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.490
but if he feels like fucking off and getting a big Mac,
he could do that.

114
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.790
And there's no,
no performance benefit.
Nope.
No penalty.
