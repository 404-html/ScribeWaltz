1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.140
So I have to ask you,
does Tom talk about Ufos all the time,

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.160
but you know he's not in the band.
No.
Yeah,
I know.
But you know,
always do that.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.270
He always did.

4
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.980
<v 1>We used to get loaded and just look out the bus window for one.</v>

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.130
And I used to do it with him as like,
I don't know,

6
00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:16.510
it's kind of a bonding experience.

7
00:00:16.511 --> 00:00:19.840
It's like if you wanted to show me bow and arrows,

8
00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:22.390
whatever were on tour together,
if forest had sit there and like,
you know,

9
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.670
check it out.
So with Tom,
that was his thing.

10
00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:28.720
Like fucking let's get high and look for Ufo here.

11
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.180
We just sit there and like stare out the bus window,

12
00:00:31.181 --> 00:00:34.900
look at ufs or like he would even go as far as when we're on tour,

13
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.700
like let's go and fucking look for bigfoot,
whatever it was,
you know,

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.520
and he would assemble a crew and they would go do it.

15
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.540
Oh I got ever got me on one of those trips cause that was just two fairy tale

16
00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:50.410
for me.
But,
um,
but I would,
you know,
I'd do that.
And he was always,

17
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.270
it's really not something he just got into from the day I fucking met him.

18
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.460
He was obsessed with Ufos and aliens and was always very passionate about it to

19
00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:03.700
the point where like,
I didn't know enough to,

20
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.240
to have any kind of,
I guess like opinion on it.
I was just very open and,

21
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.780
and you know,
just took it all in,
but nothing has changed.

22
00:01:13.781 --> 00:01:15.610
He's still,
the other day I talked to him,
he's like,

23
00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:19.960
I'm on the way to the fucking White House,
Bro.
And I don't ask any questions.

24
00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:24.420
I had to be like,
as you should be,
you know,
whatever.
Let's fucking go.

25
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.960
Yeah.
What a great response.
Yeah.
Good luck with that.
Yep.

26
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.000
<v 0>Wow.
That's crazy.
Yeah,
he was a trip man.</v>

27
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.150
Having a conversation with him was very strange because I'm,

28
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:39.360
a part of me was like Skype putting me on like,
what is happening?

29
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:42.030
He's dead ass house.
Deta seemed like it.

30
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.500
And we would look at these videos that were so clearly horse shit and he would

31
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:48.510
be like,
amazing.
Right?
And they're like,
what?

32
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.660
Like you think that that's an actual Ufo?

33
00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:54.330
Like that is the fake fucking video I've ever seen in my life.

34
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.750
But he didn't see that at all.
Yeah.
In his mind,

35
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.950
he was seeing a real alien spaceship.
Even on tour.
I'd be like,

36
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:04.320
you'd walk in my room and he'd be like,
what are you doing?
And I'm like,

37
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.770
<v 1>I'll check this thing out.
I just made up whatever,
playing drums.
He'd be like,</v>

38
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.280
dude,
fucking whatever.
George Bush just did.
You know,

39
00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:12.290
he needs just coming at me with something like politics.

40
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:13.640
He's been watching CNN or,
or,

41
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.440
<v 0>or,
yeah.
Like he's just,
he's always been obsessed with it.</v>

42
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.290
So he's obsessed with all sorts of like hidden things like not just your foes,

43
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.890
but big foot two and conspiracy theories,
politics,
everything.

44
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.680
Very,
very passionate about all those things.

45
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.200
Conspiracy theories and politics.

46
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.730
It's an interesting how those things go together because people who are always

47
00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:40.720
wondering like,
who the fuck is running things and what's really going on?

48
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.860
What's happening behind the scenes?
Who's pulling the strings?

49
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.280
What is it all really mean?
Yeah.
You know?

50
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.370
Yeah.
But the UFO thing,
it's like pool boy,
boy you got up.
I mean,

51
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.880
I absolutely believe there could be intelligent life out there,

52
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.060
but I'm seeing a fucking single thing that makes me think that anybody's got a

53
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:04.600
picture video.

54
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.840
<v 1>Yeah.
I feel like it could,
it could be real.
I believe,
but I'm not,</v>

55
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.760
I can't fucking,
I'm not dedicating my life to search for it,
you know,

56
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.860
and I,
I give it to a man to like,

57
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.330
honestly to walk away from your fucking very successful band to go do that shit.

58
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.230
Like I have nothing but respect for his passion,

59
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.730
but it's like I couldn't do that.
That's insane.
Yeah.
It's like that just,

60
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.650
it really shows like he's,
you know,
he's very,
very passionate about it.

61
00:03:33.651 --> 00:03:35.930
And you'll be saved up some money.
Yeah,
me too.

62
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.140
<v 0>You know a Survivorman Les Stroud.
Nah,
he's a,
you ever seen that show?</v>

63
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.450
Fucking great show.
He,
uh,

64
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.510
would survivorman would go out into the woods with our limited amount of things.

65
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.360
He would say like,
okay,
I've got this bucket,
I've got a fucking pocket knife,

66
00:03:53.361 --> 00:03:56.240
a and I got a ball,
a ball of yarn.

67
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.090
And I'm going to survive out here for seven days.
And it,

68
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.470
and he films the whole thing and he'd be filming himself like eating frogs and

69
00:04:03.471 --> 00:04:08.090
catching a squirrel and finding edible plants and just living out in the forest.

70
00:04:08.091 --> 00:04:10.040
And oftentimes going days and days without food.

71
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.330
And then he would have like a point where he'd get rescued,
know seven days in,

72
00:04:14.331 --> 00:04:16.490
there would be a spot where they would meet him.
Um,

73
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.550
he had an experience when he was in Alaska alarm time ago where he was camping

74
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.270
and he said he heard footsteps,
like big,
heavy footsteps.

75
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.510
And you heard some sound that sounded like a gorilla or something like that.

76
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.060
And,
uh,
and then it ran off.

77
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.810
And to this day he's convinced that that was a big foot.

78
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.200
And so now he has survivorman bigfoot and he goes out into the woods and just

79
00:04:46.221 --> 00:04:48.620
looks for evidence of Sasquatch.

80
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.380
<v 1>Oh,
he should.
He needs to.
It needs to hit up.
Tom.
Tom,
we pulled up,
he'll go with,</v>

81
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.580
and he would love that.
