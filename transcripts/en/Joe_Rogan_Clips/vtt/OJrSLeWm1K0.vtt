00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.800
What was the reasoning behind not verifying Julian Assange?

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.420
I don't think there was one.
Okay.
Can we do,
let's take a little sidebar here.

3
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:09.150
Yeah.
Can you tell me what's wrong with Julian Assange?
Like what,

4
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:13.830
what is the idea that this guy is some,

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.060
some super villain,

6
00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:18.660
some bad person that did something terrible because the expose some information

7
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:22.140
like what it,
well,
I'm missing bags.

8
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.500
I guess it depends on how conspiratorial you want to get,
but join assign,
they,

9
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.400
they,
they've labeled him like the intelligence agencies.
I can't write,

10
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.160
I think that may have been James Clapper said that he is acting as a private

11
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.960
intelligence adversary of the u s or something to that effect.
So of Russia,

12
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:38.340
you mean?
No,

13
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:41.820
that Julian Assange just acting independently against the u s o against it.

14
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.480
Right,
right,
right.

15
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.410
And so that the leaks assigned to put out very damaging to the u s right.

16
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.800
I think that's fair to say.
Sure.
They don't like him.
So,
you know,

17
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.270
then he ends up getting accused of,
uh,
I believe molestation.

18
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.060
I'm secrets or what was it?

19
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.510
It's,
it's,
it's pretty complicated.
W he was having consensual sex with a woman,

20
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.640
the common then?
No,
no,
no,
I don't think so.

21
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:10.641
I think while they were in the in bed than the accusation was that he without a

22
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:15.270
condom on,
he had sex with her.
Again,
I don't think that's,
you know,

23
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:17.250
I'll be honest,
it's been years,
but I don't think that's the case.

24
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.050
I thought that there,
there is a,
I'll say this there,
it's been years I think,

25
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:22.710
you know,

26
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.070
but there was reference to a condom breaking and I think what happened was he

27
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:29.670
said it was fine or something,
but,
but you know,
outside of that,
you know,

28
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:32.490
the guy's been locked up for how long,
you know,
I,
I think,

29
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.880
I think it was the UN said something like it's a violation of his human rights

30
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:38.010
or whatever.
And yeah,
we went over,
it was like,
what is it,

31
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:42.060
six years if he's been locked up for more than six years.
Yeah,
it's crazy.

32
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.180
And it's because there's an an uh,
um,
man,

33
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:46.740
this is getting a little bit out of my wheelhouse,

34
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:50.550
but I think the US has preparing it in a grand jury indictment against them.
So,

35
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.260
but again,
you know,

36
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.030
and Chelsea manning who gave him the information is now free and out of jail.

37
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.670
I,
I don't,
I think it's presumed that Chelsea did.
I thought it was,
maybe it,

38
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.370
maybe it is the whole jail.

39
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.450
It's been years since I've tracked a lot of this stuff.
Okay.

40
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.010
But back to the main point,
back to the signage wasn't verified.
Wiki leaks was,

41
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:15.870
I'm pretty sure.
Okay.
So verification is not just,
hey,
this is Tim pool.

42
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.770
There's Jamie Vernon.
Oh,
that's,
that's the real Jamie.
Give him a blue check mark.

43
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.010
It's a,
we don't like use,
we're going to take away your check mark.

44
00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:26.670
Even though we know you're the real you.
It's,
it's like a,
it's a class.

45
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.570
It's an elite class of people.
A removal of approval.
Yeah.

46
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.290
There are some people who I think have removed their own verification badges and

47
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.460
you can just change your name and it erases,
ah,

48
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.700
I think Pewdie Pie did it once and then immediately,
immediately.
Got It back.
