1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.210
Isn't it weird that like pop corn became the official food watching movies.

2
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:09.450
Isn't that weird?
I know it's loud chewing shit.
He can't hear dialogue.

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.390
Have no one likes to say do the scope.
Let's go get some popcorn.
No one,

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.740
no one ever looks for popcorn unless they're at the movies.
That's a good point.

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.420
What is it?
Only time it's good.
Maybe a Disneyland because it's like,

6
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:24.540
Yay,
I forgot about popcorn.
Fucking and by that while I'm here too.

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.820
Other than that,
like the circus circus,
circus popcorn,

8
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.510
circus got peanuts into the mix.

9
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.900
Maybe there's something about the popcorn that like the,

10
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.900
it's like genetically modified and it's like it helps with the,

11
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.560
with the brainwashing just in the palm corn.
Yeah.

12
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:42.480
It probably opens you up to microwave dude.
That's what it is.

13
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.790
It just fucks with your head Bro.
Dude.

14
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.160
Basically microwave,
just kill everything.
Right.
When you might go into your food,

15
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:53.820
you basically just don't have anything.
It's just like,
yeah,
pop,
pop.

16
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.670
I'm nothing survived somewhere.
I can only write.

17
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.960
Isn't it crazy that we haven't really improved upon microwave?

18
00:00:58.961 --> 00:01:03.190
It's like they mastered that shit 40 years ago and it's still the same goddamn

19
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.450
micro and it's really bad for you and they're going to take out of microwave

20
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:08.490
popcorn.
When you get microwave popcorn,

21
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.150
there's fats in there that your body just doesn't know what the fuck to do with.

22
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.880
That's where those things could sit on a shelf for so long and those little

23
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:17.100
packets I think.
What is it?

24
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.360
What is the toxic ingredient in microwave popcorn that they're eliminating?

25
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.880
It's hilarious.
They decided all this shit kills you,

26
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.680
but we're going to let you sell it for two more years.

27
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.410
They didn't just make it illegal.
They made a moratorium.
I think it's trans fats.

28
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:35.130
I think it just might be a vegetable.
Oil Fats.

29
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.370
There's certain certain trans fats that are just,
your body's just like,

30
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:42.230
what in the fuck is this non food?
Yeah,
you're,

31
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.850
you're making me.
Yeah.

32
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.760
We're talking about delicious protein bars before the show.

33
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.190
That gives you the most unbelievable farts.

34
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.100
That's how I know I shouldn't be eating.
So if I'm,

35
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.090
if I'm eating something and I'm just lightened the inside of my car on fire

36
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.740
chemical here it is chemicals used in the lining of microwaveable popcorn bags

37
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:06.741
including per fluoro [inaudible] acid or Pfo are part of a class of compounds

38
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:13.650
that may be linked to infertility in humans.

39
00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:16.500
According to a recent study from Ucla and animal testing,

40
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:21.390
the chemicals caused liver cancer,
testicular cancer and pancreatic cancer.

41
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.110
So that's one thing,
but I know that they banned trans fats.

42
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.480
I might have conflated the two stories.
Did they?

43
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.930
Cause what is the ban of trans fats is the one where they're giving them like

44
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:33.450
all the like hostess cakes,

45
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.930
those bullshit cakes and the tongue sit on the shelf forever.

46
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.010
Ding dongs are my favorite.
Those things,
those,
those pop,

47
00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:44.490
those pie cakes that you get from hosts,
it's like the lemon filling.

48
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.080
Those are just trans fats to the gills.
Twinkie method.

49
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:52.890
They last 20 years or whatever,
twinkie

50
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.110
twinkie.
You and I were laying around and fucking bored,
smoked a little weed,

51
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.620
watches some and up to God.
I'm so hungry.
When he got here,
man cabinet.

52
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.130
And you had like ring dings,
Twinkies and my grab a twinkie.
If I'm starving,

53
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.270
crowd watching survival chillin,
I might eat a twinkie.

54
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.180
These are like the worst wedding cake.
It says,
well,

55
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:15.430
you know what I had last night,
I had strawberry shortcake.

56
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.450
US popcorn makers could face long expensive road to lose trans fats.

57
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.290
Oh,
okay.
This is why I conflated it.

58
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.950
Microwave popcorn makers could face a long difficult task.

59
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.870
Ridding their snacks of trans fats,

60
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:33.871
US Food and Drug Administration proposal to ban the additive goes into effect.

61
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.250
So you s is banning.
So the u s ban on Trans Fats is what?
Um,
I uh,

62
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.380
what I got confused with that US ban on trans fats is like a dick given these

63
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:47.220
people like two years.
Isn't it crazy that they're there?

64
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.250
They're not big deal out of this.
They're going after the trans fats,

65
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:55.010
but they don't go after like,
like,
like real shit.
Like all calls,

66
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.110
like killing people all day,
every day.
I know,
right?
It's like you,
you say,

67
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.630
why don't you say this is going to kill you if you keep eating it,

68
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.650
but it's awesome.
But you're going after trans fats.
Someone,

69
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.900
someone in the popcorn industry just pissed off and an Illuminati mammogram.

70
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.340
You know when I go after him and this is this like a smear campaign,
trans fats.

71
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.270
People know they're bad for you once they know they're bad for you,

72
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.670
but should have,
be able to just take him.
What about the,
that one,
um,

73
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.400
drug that everyone's getting addicted to.
That's the legal,
uh,
Adderall.
No,

74
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.080
it's a Carolyn.
It's morphine.
Fentanyl.
No,

75
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.220
no.
Very,
very popular prescription.
Chicanx ECON.

76
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.710
Oh,
Oxycontin for sure.
Fuck your life up.
Hundred percent.

77
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.210
But he have serious pain.
It also leave Yeates pain.
And the thing is,
can you,

78
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.380
can you just it for a few niggling after trans fats here,
it's crazy.

79
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.580
Let,
let them have their popcorn.
Fuck Aa.
They're going,

80
00:04:51.581 --> 00:04:55.180
they're making like news articles about it.
Who we're going after trans fat.

81
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.210
What about the 800 kids that go missing every year?
What about,

82
00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:01.090
why don't you go well does it different?
People will look for that.
Okay,

83
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.790
that's true.
But these are different people.
These are food scientists.

84
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.110
But I think the point is that this stuff,
that there's other ways to make food,

85
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:11.020
but the thing is,
I don't know.
What is the benefits of Trans Fats?

86
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:12.490
Does it make processing easier?

87
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.550
Like why do they use that as opposed to like other healthy fats?

88
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.620
I Dunno why it probably has something to do with shelf life maybe.
Yes,
probably.

89
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.060
That's probably why it fucks you up to.
