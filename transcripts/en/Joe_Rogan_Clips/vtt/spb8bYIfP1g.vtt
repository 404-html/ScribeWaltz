1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.670
Awesome.

2
00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.550
Do you feel like you could just say that instead of appreciate that this is to

3
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:09.870
intellectuals discussing something that's very complex and that it is,

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.140
it was about immigration and about Islam and those are two things that people

5
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:19.890
don't want to hear.
You know,
they just like go,
those two things are off limits.

6
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:24.360
Unless you're a pro Islam or pro immigration,
you better shut the fuck up,

7
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:26.010
but we're going to demonetize you.
And that,

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.450
that kind of censorship is fascinating to me because it's,
it's not effective.

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.040
It's a,
it just,
it just makes people go,
hey,
and you know,

10
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:40.041
and then it makes the people on the youtube side get defensive and it makes them

11
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:45.090
double down and you know,
and,
and you're seeing,
you see that now?

12
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.290
I mean,
you see it with many people.
It's,

13
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.460
it's a weird time for ideas.
Yeah.

14
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.860
How do you feel about being part of the Idw,

15
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.540
the international dark web?
Uh,

16
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.320
I'm,
I'm the least mentioned,

17
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:08.790
happily the least mentioned person in that group.
I'm very happy about that.

18
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.190
I don't like being in any groups.
It,
Groucho Marx once say,
uh,

19
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.070
I don't want to be a part of any club that would have me.
It's just,

20
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.981
look,

21
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:24.150
I'm very happy to be able to have a platform where I can have people like you on

22
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.190
or any of those people,
whether it's Bret Weinstein or Eric Weinstein Stein,

23
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.580
sorry guys,
Bret Weinstein era after Harvey.

24
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.660
Everybody got real uncomfortable.
He's really sweet.
He's great.

25
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.630
And his wife Heather is amazing as well.

26
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.870
He'll be on actually the next season of wrong speak.
Oh cool.

27
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.880
Heather hiring his wife is amazing too and they were on together.
Um,

28
00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:51.650
and Sam Harris is a good friend and I love that guy.
He's fast.

29
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.200
Any person and as,
as Jordan and a look,

30
00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:57.210
I don't agree with a lot of what Ben Shapiro says,

31
00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:00.960
but he's a super nice guy and I really like him,
you know?
And that's,
that's,

32
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.160
you saw that thing that happened with that actor mark was the same mark Duplass

33
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:08.490
is that his name?
Got In trouble for tweeting that uh,
you know,

34
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.650
very nice and reasonable person.
Yeah.
Yeah.

35
00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:18.180
It's a fun time then is really nice too.

36
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.540
He's a really nice guy.
You know,
I like him a lot.

37
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.620
This a internet,
whatever it is,
the dark web thing,

38
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.690
that's all Eric,
Eric Weinstein's idea was to name this and label.

39
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:34.350
He loves all that Shit.
He loves all that cloak and dagger stuff.

40
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.430
He gets a kick out of it,

41
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:39.920
but he makes some very good points and he's a brilliant,
brilliant guy.
And um,

42
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.370
this idea that we're all joined together,
I mean we all went out,

43
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.600
we had a big dinner together,

44
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:49.710
like a bunch of dorks and we all got together and we're like this little club

45
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.600
and that's kind of fun and we're going to do it again.
And we're,

46
00:02:52.601 --> 00:02:56.160
we're bringing more people into,
we're bringing more people into the dark web.

47
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.300
If some people are that they're not a part of the dark web.

48
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.010
And I'll tell you some names afterwards,

49
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:06.790
but some people like contacted Barry Weiss and were upset that they weren't

50
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.080
included in the dark web.
I love Karen.
I loved Barry's column.

51
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.560
It was interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's the whole,
but the label of it all.
I mean,
it's,

52
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.560
what's interesting is it,
it starts this conversation,
right?

53
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.800
So why is it even necessary?

54
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.890
You have this dark web and what's the function of this dark web and what is
this?

55
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.460
What is the dark web doing?
Really like what,
what is,
you know,

56
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.700
and there was an article today where someone was calling it problematic and

57
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:34.810
saying that it's mostly right leaning people,
which is absolutely not true.

58
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.580
Sam Harris very left a Bret Weinstein,
fiercely progressive.

59
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.560
Eric very left.
Um,
I'm way more left than I am,
right?

60
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.770
I the very few right wing ideas that I hold on to their very small,

61
00:03:50.131 --> 00:03:55.080
it's very,
the vast majority of my positions on things side with,

62
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.080
uh,
with people on the left vast majority.
Um,

63
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.890
Ben Shapiro was very right,
but he's reasonable,
you know,

64
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:05.530
and he's also a young guy,
you know,

65
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.750
conservative religious.
It's,

66
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.380
but he's also extremely intelligent and reasonable talk to him.

67
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.580
And he has himself,
um,

68
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.160
disavowed some of the things that he said.
And he's,

69
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.400
he's himself criticized his own words.
He wrote a whole call.

70
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.740
Here's a list of all the stupid things I've ever said online.
You know,

71
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:33.580
and because he's,
he's,
you know,
he's a very aware guy,
very self aware.

72
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.120
I think.
Um,

73
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.330
I think it's important to have discussions and I think it's important that when

74
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:45.340
people feel like those discussions are being suppressed,

75
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.970
that they talk about that.
And I think that's what this whole thing is.

76
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.950
And I think you're a part of that as well.
I was in the column,
yeah,

77
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.860
we could use you in the dark web,
a woman of color to it.

78
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.320
You guys aren't all racist white people.
God Damn it.

79
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.330
I took a 23 and me and I'm hoping I've got some black gray and I'm hoping for

80
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:10.900
you to give me some,
give me more than 5%.

81
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.000
What is it that you have to have?

82
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.720
I think you only have to have like one 16th native American to catch a check in

83
00:05:17.721 --> 00:05:18.610
some places.
