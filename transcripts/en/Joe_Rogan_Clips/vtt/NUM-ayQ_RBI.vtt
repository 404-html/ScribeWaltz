1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.990
You walk off stage and get on that fucking thing.
You feel like a king.

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.900
You got a driver.
What do you give a fuck?

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.570
You don't give a fuck about anything.

4
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:13.030
I can be on the road forever and that and just make an x on that little stove

5
00:00:13.031 --> 00:00:15.870
top.
No,
you were in there drinking.
You're doing what you want.

6
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:18.000
You watching Goodfellas are fucking anchorman.

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.120
<v 1>That is pretty beautiful.</v>

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.330
It's so well it's an experience to your riding in that thing.

9
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.510
That's a retro experience as not just a truck.

10
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.090
<v 0>Yeah.
That thing I,
you know my wife's nixed it.
What do you,</v>

11
00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:33.850
what are you going to put away?
I got the fucking driver.
We'll keep it.

12
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.550
I don't need it.
She was right.
My wife's always going.
Not always,

13
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:41.900
but mostly women don't like when you collect shit like where are you going to

14
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:45.030
put that?
They don't like that.
You get too many things.

15
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.770
That's half the reason why I got this place.
Collect shit here.
Oh yeah.

16
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:54.730
Nobody could say nothing.
This spot when one says nothing.
No,
but then it becomes,

17
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.960
you spend more time down here then you do up here though.
I've got it.

18
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.450
I got it nailed.
I figured it out.
Get up.
Berlin.

19
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.360
He being such a jerk.
That's why they don't have a point.
I don't.

20
00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:11.110
I actually,
I can actually refute your opinion,
your point or whatever.

21
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.120
It's so universal too.
All women have that response like,

22
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.000
the fuck is wrong with you,
man.
They are.
We had a highway.
Yeah,

23
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.660
that's it.

24
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.200
<v 1>Well,
imagine being them watching you imagine being a woman.</v>

25
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.930
Have taken care of your children.
You know,
you give birth,

26
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.860
you get this little tiny infant and then financially you're relying on this

27
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:36.780
fucking maniac south.
They're flying helicopters and fixing cars.
I know.

28
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.250
Playing drums all day.
He's like,
what long as the money keeps coming in,

29
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:43.850
they can't say anything,
but they're like,
what the fuck are you doing?

30
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.630
<v 0>The end of the day,
you married an eight year old,</v>

31
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.810
you would have married a comedian.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
You're lucky.

32
00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:57.080
We're not drug addicts.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
I'm,

33
00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:01.960
I'm a,
I got,
I got to work on myself,
man.
I got to fucking,
you know,
I just,

34
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.840
yeah,
I am a difficult person to live with.
Evidently.

35
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.700
I didn't realize it,
but like,

36
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:12.570
I'm now looking at it honestly stepping back and look,
I go,
yeah,
I can see that.

37
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.040
I can fucking see that.
I've thought about it.
I'm definitely difficult.
Well,

38
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:20.490
if you don't think about it,
they'll remind you.
Yeah.
But I mean,
I would just

39
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.040
<v 1>imagine relying on me,
I mean,
I'm reliable.
Like</v>

40
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.390
<v 0>I'm not,
I want to be like,
look,
responsible.</v>

41
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.410
You could have married the me that worked in a fucking warehouse and I would

42
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:34.140
have been the same thing,
you know?
And we would be in a fucking studio apartment.

43
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.670
Here's the deal,
though.
They weren't married yet.

44
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.280
They would have found someone better.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

45
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.040
If you were just fucking off.
Never got your shit together.
You know,

46
00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:48.680
when he's about limit too is their ability to move on.
Yeah.
Ooh.
Well,

47
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.440
I've always said like,
if I ever fucking died,

48
00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:53.710
how quickly all my clothes would be at down at the goodwill,
you know,

49
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.650
and she'd just be like,
you know,
sell the house.
That's just burns.
Sage.

50
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.830
That was interesting.
All right,

51
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.590
<v 1>well next step to the plate.</v>

52
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.340
All my discussions with biologists and people who study like what?

53
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.550
What's Gads ads?
Uh,
what is his discipline?

54
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.150
Behavioral Psychology,
but he studies,
you know,
motivation,
Gad sad.

55
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:20.770
Is that his last name of his fullness?
A.
D.
G.
A.
D.
That's his first name.

56
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:23.920
Gad.
S.
A.
D is His last name.

57
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.610
Does it rhyme because it also Ryan,

58
00:03:26.611 --> 00:03:30.850
he's Canadian evolutionary behavioral scientist.
Brilliant guy.
He was so non,

59
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.460
does his name still rhyme?
It's a good question.
Is there anywhere he can go?
No.

60
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.490
Let me just,
my name is Gad said No.
He calls himself the Godfather.

61
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.680
He's,
oh,
so he just steered into it.
He's a great guy.

62
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.410
Couldn't imagine he's 13 but brilliant.

63
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.630
<v 0>At least talking about.
Why would you name me mom?</v>

64
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.720
<v 1>Gad Sad.
I don't think sad means the same thing over there.
You know,</v>

65
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.180
<v 0>differently,
but end of the day it rhymes.
There's no country you can be on.</v>

66
00:04:00.181 --> 00:04:02.700
You can be on that fucking little island where they shot that guy with the

67
00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:04.230
arrows and they get,
they going to make fun of you.

68
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.610
Still probably kick you off the island can.

69
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.970
You can't name your see like some of these celebrities,

70
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:10.950
some of the fucking names they named their kids.
It's just like,

71
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.150
don't you remember school?
You don't remember how fucking mean kids were.

72
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.580
Why are you giving that point?
Painting a fucking by.
Get it your creative.

73
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.320
Yeah,
have a meditation room.
Fucking don't do that with the name.
Oh,

74
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.480
give him a nice bill name.
William.
This is folding chair Johnson.

75
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.640
<v 1>People need to express themselves and they do it through the naming of their</v>

76
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:36.850
children,

77
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.100
<v 0>children.
My other favorite thing and what they do is when they fucking,</v>

78
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.690
they put their political agenda on them like the kid doesn't even have a fucking

79
00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:48.310
chance.
Like this whole thing,
like a gender roles.
They bs.

80
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.930
By the way,
that my little experience being a dad,

81
00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:55.420
going to kid birthday parties,
they,

82
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:59.110
those kids are not old enough for that behavior to be learned through.

83
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.680
The kids come,
the boys show up.
It is fucking brave heart.

84
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.690
They come all over the fucking hill.
Yeah.
The girls are social.

85
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.920
They're sitting there that kind of the taking things in enough kids.

86
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:14.340
Boys come in a fucking dude.
Ah,

87
00:05:14.341 --> 00:05:19.270
we were at one on Saturday and there was this,
this kid who's hilarious.

88
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:22.600
He looked like a little Bobby Hurley is a point guard.
Right.
And um,

89
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.550
he was playing this game,
he had like this ball and he was using his,

90
00:05:25.551 --> 00:05:28.810
his is like forums is a bat and he was hitting it,
then he would catch it.

91
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.120
Then he would throw it between his legs and he's doing all his brothers gets kid

92
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.010
hand.
Eye Coordination was great for his age.

93
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.910
So over in the corner where I was sitting with my daughter was these like little

94
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:40.090
like sort of like cushions that someone had put together like three piece thing

95
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:41.650
and made it into like a little chair for.

96
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:43.450
So an old person like me could sit down.

97
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.670
So I stood up because I was worried the ball was going to hit.

98
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:46.630
So I was kinda guarding that.

99
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.380
So he went over and got the ball at one point and just seeing the chair there,

100
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.350
you know,
all built like that.
He just saw it and just kicked it,

101
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.350
destroyed it and then continued on.
I was thinking like,
why did he do that?

102
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.610
Because he's a boy.
He's a boy.
Yeah.
We like ruined shit.

103
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.140
<v 1>Well you got a lot of energy.</v>

104
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.520
Little kids like needs something to do that's physical.

105
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.270
They're the little bodies have the little little batteries overflown with
energy.

106
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.430
<v 0>I'm just saying do that.
They're shit was all about like grabbing,</v>

107
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.570
throwing,
breaking,
breaking.
Yeah.
Do you remember being a kid?
Yeah,

108
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:23.600
I already did that.
Yeah.
So this is normal,
this whole thing of like,
like,

109
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:28.190
well women aren't aggressive like that because you know a solid standards.

110
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.930
Yeah.
I think it's,
they're aggressive in life.
I think that they,

111
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.010
they Lilly from like just survival shit.
They are looking in like,
all right,

112
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.400
that's what I have to compete with.
And there are,

113
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.490
you see them looking at the boys who appear to be dominating and what they are

114
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:47.420
is they're actually showing all of their carts and the little girls are already

115
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:50.480
taken an in breaking them down knowing,
well,

116
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:52.190
I can't get physical with this person.

117
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:55.190
I can't like dominate this person physically.
This is definitely,

118
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.370
and they just immediately stuck on like that's why they're fucking smarter than

119
00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:01.160
we are.
I think.
No.

120
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.450
Did I lose you somewhere?
And then I don't necessarily think they're smarter.

121
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.700
I think

122
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.930
<v 1>going on is that uh,</v>

123
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.990
men have different DNA and the genes are aggressive and men are supposed to be

124
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.460
doing reckless shit.
Right.

125
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.200
<v 0>Well,
I'm just saying it's nice to,
society didn't sit down,</v>

126
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.770
they didn't watch three cereal commercials and they'd be like,
oh,

127
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:31.300
I need to be fucking this.
I just think that's,
that's just some,

128
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.330
uh,
bullshit that adults come,

129
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.400
came up with and uh,

130
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.420
<v 1>does adults,
it's almost always women.</v>

131
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.320
It's women that think that there's something wrong with the way men are raising

132
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:43.070
their sons.

133
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.070
They think there's something like this idea of these men raising these kids and

134
00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:51.230
these kids being aggressive is because the way they've been coached.

135
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.870
That's not true.
It's just,
that's just a part of being a boy.

136
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.530
This is a shit ton of studies.
If people wanted to actually look at the science,

137
00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.680
I mean if you leave boys alone with toys and girls along with toys,

138
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.430
boys would gravitate towards trucks and fucking,
you know,

139
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.640
the things that they can hit and smash and girl sit down there with a little tea

140
00:08:07.641 --> 00:08:11.570
cops and they play with dolls.
It's natural.
It's just a hundred percent natural.

141
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.800
Yeah.
It was a documentary on babies.
You know what they,

142
00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:19.520
bees are gender neutral.
The raising their kids gender neutral,

143
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:21.720
so they don't call them a boy or a girl.
And

144
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.170
<v 0>my thing with that is there's no way.
You're not saying to your son,</v>

145
00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.240
you're sure you don't want to wear the dress.

146
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:32.130
And then the kid wants to fucking Ed wants to parents' approval.
Yeah,

147
00:08:32.131 --> 00:08:33.600
I didn't want that football.

148
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:37.770
I guess I wanted the dress and it's just like,
like I said,

149
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.340
you know,
my kid's barely too,
so what the fuck do?
Why?
No,

150
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.080
I'm just saying my limited experience at kids' birthday parties is,

151
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:51.110
it's not even how it was ever even questioned that like they're too fucking too

152
00:08:52.321 --> 00:08:55.740
young.
The fucking year and a half,
two years old,

153
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:59.910
like the telling me that society has already occurred.
Yeah.
They had.
