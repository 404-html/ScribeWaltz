00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.510
It just seems like a strange thing to do.
A documentary on.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.910
Documentaries are killing it lately.
[inaudible] Kelly,

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.650
he thought he was flying free isn't on pitches that then that documentary came

4
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:17.340
out.
He's fucked.
Yeah,
he's fun.
He's arrested.
Yeah,
they just released him.

5
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:19.320
Did you see when they released him,
like he,

6
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:24.321
he leaves jail and he has to walk through a throng of people people and there

7
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:27.270
was script and some,
the woman was yelling at him,
calling him.

8
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.480
They took his music off iTunes.
Really?

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.110
They took that all of shit and all the artists who worked with them took their

10
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:39.090
music down.
Like let's say Michael Jackson did get convicted of molesting kids.

11
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.120
Could you still listen to his music?
Could you imagine your separate,

12
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.550
do you know Tony Hinchcliffe?
I don't want to give away a bit.

13
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.850
He has a fucking hilarious bit about that.

14
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.330
He has a hilarious bit about really heard.

15
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.260
I bet he's redoing it now because I don't think it's on a special on his last

16
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:59.670
special.
I don't think it's on,
so,
no,
I heard it.
Yeah,
Dude.
Tony Hinchcliffe.

17
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.650
He's got some fucking,
he's got this new bit about transgender athletes.

18
00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:05.041
What does it say?

19
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:10.041
Their daycare affiliated woman who bailed R Kelly out of jail receives bomb

20
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:11.340
threat.
It's a mystery.

21
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:14.220
Woman bailed him out and he's looking like shit right there.

22
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.810
It's been stressful time.
Fuck yeah,
we're going to do.
