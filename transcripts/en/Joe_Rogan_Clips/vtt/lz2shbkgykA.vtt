WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.890
Yeah.
Well the Jim Acosta one is strange because Jim Acosta,

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.360
like he wasn't supposed to be talking then.
Right,
right.
He was interrupting.

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.050
He was deciding that he was more important than the other person who was
talking.

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.620
Right.

5
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.290
And he was also decided that he was more important than everyone else in the

6
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:16.860
room.

7
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.310
And he's also deciding that having a White House press grandchild is a human

8
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:21.810
right.
So basically,

9
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:23.880
even though you could do it very well and you'll never be taken away,

10
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.740
but is there's gotta be some decorum.
Right.
Well,
their argument,
I would guess,

11
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:31.200
I can't speak for Jim Acosta cause I could speak in normal voice,

12
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.670
but their argument would be that because the president has made things,

13
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:40.290
so lack of decor and when she has therefore they're following suit.

14
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.560
So I guess that's real leadership,
but

15
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.450
this monster is really kicking in.
Yeah.
You like it though.
Yeah,
a lot.

16
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.220
A lot of stuff going on that cam

17
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.350
got the Tarin it says.
Yeah.
So yeah,
that's,
you know,

18
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.300
it's unfortunate.
I mean,
look,

19
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.040
I think I appreciate the fact that he goes out of his way to question the

20
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:05.800
Whitehouse narrative and he goes out of his way.
It's his job.
Yeah.
Yeah.
To,

21
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.090
to put the irons to the president and get them to answer questions.

22
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:11.190
But you can't do that while someone else is talking.

23
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.490
The other guy had the microphone.
You're the guy was supposed to be talking,

24
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:15.480
right.
Well,

25
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.500
this is why I think he's unforgivable because during the Singapore summit,

26
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.170
when you had president Trump and Kim Jong one from North Korea,

27
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.490
and they're making,

28
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:26.940
signing a piece of paper and they're trying to kind of hopefully go towards a

29
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:31.110
peaceful direction,
a cost that gets up and yells,
hey,
uh,
what about Ottawa?

30
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.180
I'm bear marshal,
Kim Jong and what?
I'm online beer.

31
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:36.540
It's like you got this guy who's got 25 million hearts dishes.

32
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.350
He's hauled off taking the first step that dropping his gun.
You're like,
Hey,

33
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:41.700
what about that kid you killed?
What about,

34
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.940
you know that it's a time and a place and I don't think Kim Jong Un's speaks

35
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:47.080
English.
I'm pretty sure he doesn't.
So,
uh,

36
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.060
I think the guy took wrestling a little too seriously.
Uh,
and,

37
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.720
and I don't know what it is.
I mean,
you know,
a lot of reporters,

38
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:57.000
I know that our pores,
they don't act like this.
No.

39
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.160
I think he likes attention and I think he feels like some,

40
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.920
there's something very significant about what he's doing.
And He,

41
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:08.880
I think he also wants to be a martyr.
He will wants to be a,
you know,

42
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:12.060
like every like,
you know,
he's got the weight of the world on his shoulders in,

43
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:15.800
but for him,
uh,
we'd be facing Nazi Germany.
Yeah.
It's,

44
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.700
it's the question is like,

45
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:22.380
when does someone get their press credentials removed from the White House?
When,

46
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:26.220
when can they no longer have Whitehouse credentials?
Like,
when is,
what is,

47
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.541
what do you,

48
00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:31.050
what do you have to do to the point where everyone agrees you're a nuisance and

49
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:35.160
you were interrupting regularly.
CNN could just get someone else,
right.

50
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.810
Who's not going to scream out,
right.

51
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.750
It's not like they're trying to block CNN and it's like they're saying to this

52
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:43.980
guy like,
you,
you,
you are interrupting.
Like you're yelling things out.

53
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.380
And then what if everyone yelled things out at the same time?

54
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.830
Are you better than everyone else because you're not,
you're just a person here.

55
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.960
And if you just decide my opinion and my voice is more significant than anyone

56
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:58.620
else's,
well you,
you've thrown everybody else under the bus,

57
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:00.040
the entire rest of the room and the whole

58
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.820
<v 1>process.
I remember Leslie Stahl had Trump on 60 minutes,
not that long ago,</v>

59
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:06.310
and you know,
they're going back and forth and she goes,
well,
you know,
well,

60
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.770
I don't want to talk about that.
I'm like,
this is the fucking president.

61
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.930
You're a reporter.
If he wants to talk about it,

62
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.480
at the very least it's going to be the president says x,
Y,
and z.

63
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:15.820
So who are you to be like?
And then I shut up.
We're not going to talk about this.

64
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:19.330
And he's like,
well fuck you.
I'm the president.
So I think there is,

65
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.680
I'm glad this is happening because I think for a long time the press who has had

66
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:26.320
an agenda since Washington's days as they should have an agenda,

67
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.690
pretend that they're honest and objective,

68
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.960
and they use the veneer of politeness and civility to be like,
look,

69
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:33.940
we're professional,
we're decent people.

70
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.650
But now the mask is dropping and you see that they're,
you know,
often lunatics.

71
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.670
<v 0>Yeah.
I was watching this a piece on,
um,
God,</v>

72
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.940
I really wish I remember what it was on,
but it was on,
um,

73
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.150
maybe I was listening to it either way it was on the news and when the news

74
00:03:50.151 --> 00:03:54.470
started becoming an entertainment program versus when it was just,

75
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.520
here's the events of the day and this is,
you know,
this is what the,

76
00:03:59.521 --> 00:04:02.990
the significance of these events could be and this is the impact it could have

77
00:04:02.991 --> 00:04:05.030
on our society.
Instead,

78
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.060
it just became this really flamboyant Wilde crazy.

79
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.140
If it bleeds,
it leads and it became entertainment.
Right.
And they,
they,

80
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.850
they really nailed it down to 60 minutes.

81
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.920
There were saying when 60 minutes became a hugely successful financial show,

82
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.790
what's that?
A seventies then somewhere around there,
right when one 60 minutes,

83
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.550
it's been around for a long,
long time,
long,
long time.

84
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.120
But when 60 minutes became a hit,
it was a hit show,

85
00:04:32.121 --> 00:04:35.030
like big advertiser money.
It was,
you know,

86
00:04:35.031 --> 00:04:39.110
the entire country would watch it and then that sort of change the way they

87
00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:40.190
viewed the news.

88
00:04:40.191 --> 00:04:43.820
Cause now they viewed the news as a potentially profitable venture.

89
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.650
And then boy,

90
00:04:45.651 --> 00:04:50.651
once they realized that people can clearly affiliate with one side versus

91
00:04:50.871 --> 00:04:53.300
another side and they want that in their news coverage,

92
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.340
then you get the Weird Fox News slash CNN bias,
which is,

93
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.770
it is one of the weirdest polar like it distinctions.
If you watched the news,

94
00:05:03.771 --> 00:05:07.160
you watch television during the elections particular anything that's really

95
00:05:07.161 --> 00:05:10.100
significant going on,
you go back and forth between the two of them.
You're like,

96
00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:11.990
are we,
there's like separate university.

97
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.920
<v 1>Oh yeah.
Uh,
Scott Adams has that metaphor,</v>

98
00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:18.130
which is that we're looking at one movie screen and there's two movies in one

99
00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:22.030
movie screen that different people see this exact same data and see different

100
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:25.600
conclusions.
And I think that's great.
I mean I think,

101
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.370
I don't think we need to be all United.

102
00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:30.610
I think people should like what they like and the idea that we all got a great

103
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:34.600
and everything is to tell Terry aneurysm.
Yeah.
I mean

104
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.900
<v 0>I definitely think that we should be able to enjoy what we enjoy and we should</v>

105
00:05:38.901 --> 00:05:40.460
lean whatever way we choose to lean.

106
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.030
I think the issue with the news though is when it's just straight up propaganda.

107
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.650
Yeah.
Like when is,
when,
is this actually the real objective version of the,

108
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.660
of the events or when are they deleting and editing stuff out and adding things

109
00:05:53.961 --> 00:05:57.830
to it and concentrating on one maybe possibly thing,

110
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.400
but pumping it up to be more than it is because then it changes the narrative

111
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:02.190
for their side.

112
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.830
<v 1>Uh,
this morning I went after some dimwit from Msa,
from,
excuse me,</v>

113
00:06:05.831 --> 00:06:07.000
from NBC and he goes,

114
00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:10.240
this is the worst attack by the White House and the press freedoms in history.

115
00:06:10.241 --> 00:06:15.190
I go,
John Adams,
second precedent put journalists in jail.
So did Lincoln Lincoln.

116
00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:16.540
Of course you could say,
okay,
it's the civil war,

117
00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:19.000
but there have been many cases of attacks on the press.

118
00:06:19.001 --> 00:06:22.360
But of course because everyone's so narcissistic,
if it's happening to them,

119
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.910
it's the worst thing ever and this is basically the gulag.

120
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.730
Even though they can go on Twitter and have their hundreds thousand followers,

121
00:06:27.731 --> 00:06:29.140
I have their good book deals as a consequence.

122
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.960
<v 0>Is anybody criticizing Jim Acosta from the left?
Does anybody saying like hey,</v>

123
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.370
you're not supposed to do that?
Like what you did,
what you did is out of line?

124
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.100
<v 1>I haven't,
I have,
I've been having fun in La.
I have not seen that.</v>

125
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.550
I think they have been running interference because I do think that the press

126
00:06:45.551 --> 00:06:48.550
corps,
like any organization,
you work with someone side by side every day,

127
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.490
you're going to be friendly with them.
And I do think they,

128
00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:56.020
there is very much obviously acrimony between Sarah Sanders and the White House

129
00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:58.870
press corps and she's very insulting and hostile to them.

130
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.850
And you could say it's deserved or not.

131
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.490
So of course they're going to kind of team up together,
be like,
lady,

132
00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:07.390
we're just trying to do our job and you're just spitting on our face every

133
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.610
single day.
Now the question is do these people have,

134
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.170
should have their faces spit it in or not?

135
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.980
<v 0>Well I think they both suck.
No,</v>

136
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.020
I think what she's doing sucks.
Like the way she treats people,
like some sheets,

137
00:07:20.021 --> 00:07:22.990
some fucking school teacher in seventh grade.
That's,

138
00:07:22.991 --> 00:07:25.390
that's what it seems like when Sarah is doing those,

139
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.020
those White House press things.
I love venom.

140
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.540
So I love that the venom is flowing right,

141
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.360
<v 1>both directions and the Anti Leggett because I,</v>

142
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.670
I think people get over politically by saying let's all get along.

143
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.700
And then people who don't get along or marginalized and those are the ones who

144
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:47.150
innovate things that the troublemakers are the ones who move culture and move

145
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:50.930
politics.
So whenever everyone gets together,
like,
oh,
90% of us agree,

146
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.600
then where it fits venom.
It's like,
yeah,

147
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:57.340
if this country has been at least two culture since the beginning and it only

148
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.620
stayed one because one conquer the other and held it under martial law for

149
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:04.740
decades,
there's no reason for us to be one United States.
Uh,

150
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.810
when everyone hates each other.
Like,
why?
Let's have a divorce.
What do you mean?

151
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.570
Like just if you want to separate out America to different parts.

152
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.190
I think everyone get along a lot nicer.

153
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.190
<v 0>Do you mean like make separate country out of America really?
Of course.</v>

154
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.930
Like Europe.
Like how,

155
00:08:19.931 --> 00:08:23.770
like if you looked at the size of Europe and the relative size of countries and

156
00:08:23.771 --> 00:08:26.530
how easy it is to travel from one country to another,

157
00:08:26.531 --> 00:08:31.531
you can make a real honest comparison between Texas and New Jersey.

158
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.390
I mean,
they basically are different countries,
right?

159
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.580
I mean it's trickier because we all speak English.

160
00:08:36.581 --> 00:08:39.190
So it seems like we're what but what are we United on?
And like,

161
00:08:39.191 --> 00:08:42.070
why does this have to be this way?
Well,
because Texas,

162
00:08:42.071 --> 00:08:43.390
we'll start invading everybody.

163
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.820
You can't just do that,
man.
They'll just throw,
they just steal New Mexico,

164
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:56.070
like whose garden it,
that's ours now.
And then they'll just

165
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.560
<v 1>start marching their way through Phoenix and yeah,</v>

166
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:00.360
it's a fucking disaster waiting to happen.

167
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.710
I think this is a disaster that's happening.
Oh yeah.
And I think the acrimony,

168
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.590
which I enjoy on some level because I think it's honest,

169
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.460
is going to get much worse.
Really.
What makes you think he's going to get worse?

170
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:15.810
Because I think both sides are just doubling down both sides left and right.

171
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.920
Yeah.
I very much doubling down the right has become radicalized as a function of

172
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:24.720
Trump.
The left has been radicalized for decades.
Uh,
and there's no look,

173
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:26.430
here's what happened with Kevin on hearings.

174
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:31.440
Either this very innocent family man has been railroaded completely by shameless

175
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:35.580
leftist or someone who is quite possibly rapist was nominated,

176
00:09:35.581 --> 00:09:39.330
was put to the Supreme Court,
uh,
without being,
and everyone knows it.

177
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:40.470
So there's no in between.

178
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.990
And when you have one event and to completely obscenely different perspectives,

179
00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:49.350
meeting each side sees the others obscene,
I don't see where you get together.
