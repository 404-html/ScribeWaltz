1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.740
I didn't know that this was a camp area.
Oh,
you see all the campers?
Yeah.

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:07.330
Right out in front of you of the place.
They're everywhere.
Well,

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.300
they finally side streets where the cops won't kick them out.
Yeah.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.310
And semi homeless people.
They're not homeless.
They just have mobile homes.

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.060
You know what it is that the homeless people here,
it's so peaceful there like,

6
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.920
uh,
like the caravan,
you know,
they just,
they don't bump change.

7
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.940
They don't do anything.
They just kind of walk around.
I'm,

8
00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:26.700
I'm sitting in front of your building here.

9
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:29.310
It was like a fashion show for the homeless.

10
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:33.540
One guy comes by with a buffalo bills jacket and the other guys then,
you know,

11
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:35.310
and they just quietly talking to themselves

12
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.010
and you know what's freaking me out?
I've only been here 12 hours,
but

13
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.900
everybody is either really soft spoken are,

14
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:50.820
I'm losing my fucking hearing because like even at though I'm renting the car

15
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:55.460
and the woman says,
[inaudible] a Honda,
do you want us?
I said,
what?

16
00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.330
What did you want a sign that said what?
You know,
in Boston it'd be like,

17
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:03.570
what do you want for a cat?
You want to be upgraded.
You know,

18
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.300
it's like the noise pollution.
Well,

19
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:09.060
it's louder there and colder and people are angrier.

20
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.150
It's a different place out here.
It's just,
even the homeless people,

21
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:14.580
they don't have it so rough.
If you're going to be a homeless person,

22
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.200
this is the place to go.
People are very open minded.
It's relaxed,

23
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.520
it's warm.
I mean the coldest it gets is like 40.
That's as cold as it ever gets.

24
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.650
Yeah.
But you know,
if you're giving advice to homeless people,
it's like,

25
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.840
like I was,
I was sitting in Westwood and a Starbucks,
right.

26
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.230
And it's,
the guy was just sitting there,
you know,

27
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:40.530
and all these people are having their lattes and shit and he's just,

28
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.983
<v 1>okay.</v>

29
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.300
<v 0>You know,
one of those crazy laughs,</v>

30
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.660
everybody's just gone along with their conversation,
you know,
the,
uh,

31
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.360
I don't know what to say about the,
about the homeless thing.

32
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.270
Have you ever been in downtown?
Do you ever seen my Kiddo?

33
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.900
I myself was homeless when I was like 16.

34
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:04.380
I was a hippie father passed away when I was 15.
And,
okay.

35
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.620
It was a different time,
you know?
No,
I haven't been down.

36
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:09.240
So you were homeless for like how long?

37
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.500
I was a hippy and it's different than being homeless,
but a couple of years.

38
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.400
Really.
Yeah.
I,
uh,
uh,
you know,

39
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:19.830
the worst moment I was lying,

40
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.890
I was downstairs in this guy's house and I overheard his girlfriends saying no.

41
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:31.980
He was saying it was girlfriend.
I don't know.
I keep asking the guy to leave,

42
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.290
but you know,
I was,
uh,
you know,
I was,
here's what happened.
I Made Joe,

43
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.440
I Read Jack Kerouac on the road.
Okay.

44
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.740
So I wanted to beat Jack Carol whack and I wanted to be a writer.

45
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.900
So I did everything that Carol Act did,
except right.

46
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.710
You know,
I was living in YMCAs and drinking the wine and the whole thing,

47
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:54.270
but it was a whole different country then.

48
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.840
Why didn't you start writing wasn't one of those things like eventually you'll

49
00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:01.710
start writing or writing.
I going to be a writer.
I didn't want to fucking right.

50
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.300
You know what I mean?
Right.
Like you writing the artist,
you don't want to paint.

51
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.950
Right?
Writing's the hardest job in the world.
I don't know how people do it.
