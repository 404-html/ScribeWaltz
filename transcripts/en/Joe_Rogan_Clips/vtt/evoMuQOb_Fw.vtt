00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.250
Hello Freak bitches is a lot of guys.
I'm super talented.

2
00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:08.640
They just love to eat,
you know,
man,
it's crazy.
Like a lot of those folks will,

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.510
we'll go to food for comfort for that and for the control control.

4
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.970
Yeah,
that makes sense.
Especially in such a crazy world.

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.260
The world of competition in combat sports,

6
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:22.710
especially in this sport where like winning lossing is so finite and when you

7
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:24.690
get to the top like nobody,
well,

8
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.580
rarely people win more than they lose.
Right?
Like it's just so hard,

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.090
so hard.
And there's so many with the,
you know,
like in,

10
00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:35.220
in NFL and major league baseball and soccer,
there's a clear pecking order.

11
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:37.590
You beat this person that you beat this team,
then you'd beat this team.

12
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:41.400
Then you get to play for the championship or an MMA.
It's not like that.
Well,

13
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:45.180
it's definitely not anymore.
You know,
in the UFC it's real weird.
Like,

14
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.530
especially the 185 pound division,
like good fucking luck.
Oh,
you know,

15
00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:51.660
everybody's waiting in line to fight Michael Bisping.

16
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.980
He's probably going to fight George St Pierre.
People like Luke Rockhold.

17
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:59.490
So those other guys,
like what the fuck when he beat Rockhold,

18
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:02.100
that's my single favorite MMA moment history.
Really.

19
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.470
I'm not like obnoxious Bisbing fan or anything,

20
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.090
but that was the culmination of a dude who put in so much time and he did

21
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:10.800
everything to make it a business.

22
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:14.160
He did everything he and then he not only steps in and fights,

23
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.720
I just killer and Rockhold who I thought it has been underrated his whole
career.

24
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.510
Like he's this insanely good,
but he'd already got,

25
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.870
he'd already lost to them convincingly.
Like you know,

26
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.800
back then subbed in the first round.
Yeah.

27
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.900
And older guys don't come back and beat younger guys in the rematch ever.
Right.

28
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.920
Especially on short notice.

29
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.580
Short notice when he had a whole camp and has every reason to not have

30
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:39.330
confidence in like 90% or more,
fighters would have just been like,
no,
I'm out.

31
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.160
Like no way.
He takes the flight,

32
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.980
like no one would take that flight because if you lose twice to the champion,

33
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.170
you're,
you're done.
Right.
He ain't gonna get third.
Just every risk possible.

34
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.350
And he just nails it like this.
Unbelieve clips him and knocks him out.
Yeah.

35
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.690
Amazing.
Like I loved the rock whole book.
That was just incredible.

36
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:55.800
It really was crazy.

37
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:59.820
And you could really tell that Rockhold just thought he was gonna win the fight

38
00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:04.760
no matter what.
Right.
This is a done deal.
Totally underestimated him.
Piss pink.

39
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:09.240
So scrappy that he's one of the most mentally tough guys in the sport because he

40
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:12.900
doesn't have like some freakish you,
our Merrill athleticism or anything.

41
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.650
He's just,
it's just hard work.
He's not particularly fast.
No,
he's not.

42
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.530
He's not super mobile.
He's,

43
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:23.220
he's very skilled and he's got a lot of physical issues too.
Came see at a one I,

44
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.970
yeah.
You know,

45
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.560
he's had a bunch of issues with like joints and disks and he doesn't move well.

46
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.530
He's,
no,
and he's not a big for the division or anything.
Just people that,
well,

47
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:34.060
he's pretty big for one 85 well,
not like amazing.
What?

48
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.980
He's not like towering over men are Rockhold like,
no,
he's not beat.

49
00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:38.940
Those guys are giants.
Yeah.
Those guys are giant.

50
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:40.680
He doesn't have some amazing skill set.
Either way,

51
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:43.230
he can fall back on a world championship in wrestling to get through.

52
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:45.850
Like he just is like pretty good at everything.
Yup.
Yeah.

53
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.210
Was still just finds a way off yet.

54
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.390
He's a guy I would love to biopsy and figured out like how much slow twitch and

55
00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:55.410
fast twitch does he have 34 beats per minute resting heart rate.
He's fit.

56
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.170
Yeah it's a big factor.
It's a big factor.

57
00:02:58.171 --> 00:03:00.700
And then he could push a tremendous pace and then keep it going.

58
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.200
Like one of my favorite fights of a Michaels was a,
when he beat Kung Lee.

59
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.070
Oh yeah.

60
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.220
Cause he's overwhelmed them and just you see cotton starting to get tired and

61
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.980
Bisping just poured it on.
Yeah.
Just gave him a beating.
And that was sort of a,

62
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.280
in a lot of ways like a,
a shift towards,

63
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.410
I mean he was always a world class fighter.

64
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.130
There was a shift towards the upper end of the,
of the division.

65
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.680
And it's a big moment for his career too.
Cause if he lost that,

66
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:29.770
that's probably about night night for him in terms of he could say that,

67
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:33.760
but he doesn't give a fuck you,
he got knocked out by Vitara,
comes right back.

68
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:37.720
You know,
he got knocked out by Henderson,
comes right back.
He's one of the guys.

69
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:41.200
I've been around him a bit.
Uh,
he,
he's Hilarious,
but he's,

70
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:42.850
one of the guys were again,
like he doesn't,

71
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.980
he just not going to shake him like that.
No,
not at all.
He's undeniably tough.

72
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.450
Yeah.
And he's undeniably like when he says like all fight that dude.
Yeah.
He,

73
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.390
he legit.
Oh yeah,
he's there.
Yeah.
And you can say like,
oh,
he's scared of Romero.

74
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:55.990
No,
he's not like,

75
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.280
he's not scared of any of these students he's trying to cash in when he's like,

76
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.060
well,
I think the Bisping GSP fight is a fascinating fight.
It's fascinating.

77
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.950
First of all,
GSPS never fought at 85 he comes back,
he fights for a world title.

78
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.820
It makes it compelling.
Yeah.
I just wonder if this is unfortunate,

79
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:15.220
but I wonder how many of these young new fans,

80
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.510
I would like to say like post Ronda Rousey fans,
how many of them,

81
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:22.590
you know who fucked GSP is?
I think there's a lot in,

82
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.420
my wife definitely does well.
She's a fan.
Yeah.

83
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.660
But I mean I'm wonder of how many of the new ones,
you know,

84
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:33.661
the people coming up actually know who he is and I mean it's been a long time.

85
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.910
Yeah.
You know,
a couple of years,
right?
More than that.

86
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.040
When did he lose to Johnny Hendricks?

87
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:43.810
I want to say it's three years ago at least.
At least.
Yeah.
Well Pete,

88
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:48.700
Tony Hendrix.
Yeah,
I,
I'm not,

89
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.650
I'm not a big believer in that decision.
I feel like at most that was the draw.

90
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.690
I felt like Hendrix got the most event.

91
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.410
My buddy Troy brother had 50 k on Hendrix on that fight.
Did he?
Yeah.

92
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.240
And afterwards he's like,
here we go.
Like for done.

93
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.670
Hendrickson was interesting because a Hendrick's is one of those guys that you

94
00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:11.260
go like,
what happened to that guy?
You know?

95
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:16.261
Like what a lot of speculation on that where you can all read between the lines

96
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:21.010
there.
Well that's,
that's the problem,
right?
Yeah.
There's the Usada speculation.

97
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:23.760
There's the motivation,
speculation.
There's a lot of speculation.

98
00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:27.160
You also have that thing to what guys like that that put it in that many years

99
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:30.010
of wrestling and he started competing that hard,

100
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:33.310
that young [inaudible] like that that wears on you.

101
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.880
It was a timeframe out of,
yeah,
there's a,

102
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.840
like p people believe there's a nine year window as a world class fighter.

103
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.090
Have heard that before.
It depends on the sport,
but yeah,

104
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:46.300
that's probably fair as a fighter,
as a fighter,

105
00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:49.870
like can you get to MMA in particular guys have like nine years to compete at a

106
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:52.690
world class level and then the wheels just fall off.
Yeah.

107
00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:56.200
Get in and get your money and get out.
Yeah.
If you can,
if you can.
Yeah.

108
00:05:56.201 --> 00:06:01.170
That's why 38 I think bespeaks 38 dead GSP fights the right move.

109
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.570
Oh,
for a hundred so right move.
Anyway.
Yeah.

110
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.740
What does a Bisbing typically do well with like the fighters?

111
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.010
Like he handles rustlers decently well.
He's a very good defensive wrestler.

112
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.070
His styles can be fantastic.
Yeah.
It doesn't get tired,

113
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.420
which is what DSB relied on a lot is,
is his stamina.
Conditioning was great.

114
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.340
But yeah,
that stamina like is dependent upon activity.
Like do you,

115
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.400
even if you're just physically fit,
but you haven't fought in a long time,

116
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:28.190
but I don't necessarily know if it's,
it's applicable.
Yeah.

117
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.220
Well it's also going to be different too with we'll see what he does weight
wise.

118
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.840
Yeah.
So what people don't understand about when you watch professional athletes

119
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:38.810
fighters in particular is a lot of what happens in that fatigue is either

120
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.530
psychological or it's bad weight cut stuff.
So now he doesn't have that.

121
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:45.420
But if he's lugging around extra weight,
um,

122
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.340
that he's not used to potentially problematic depending on how he does it.

123
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:51.770
Now he's got some smart people in this camp,
so he's probably going to be fine.

124
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.840
Yeah.
But that's a real problem.
Um,
that,
that he may or may not be ready for.
Yeah.

125
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.500
If he's lugging around extra way.
But he was always walking around.

126
00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:02.120
It's somewhere around one 85 one 90 he might just decide to compete at that

127
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:04.580
weight.
That's what I mean.
Like if he stays there,
he's probably fine,

128
00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:06.920
but if someone gets in his head and tries to get them up to two oh two or

129
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:08.090
something and then come back down,

130
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:10.460
like he's probably not going to feel normal there.
Yeah.

131
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.680
When she's not going to run out of gas.
Because of that,

132
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:14.810
like having more muscle doesn't make you fatigue more.

133
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.130
It's the training that does it.

134
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>
