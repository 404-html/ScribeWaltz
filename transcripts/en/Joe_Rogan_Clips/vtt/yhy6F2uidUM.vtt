WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.370
But I'm fucking beyond pumped for it is Eddie Alvarez and just engage.

2
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:13.200
You just engage.
He is a fucking savage

3
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.850
and so's Eddie Alvarez.

4
00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:21.080
Eddie Alvarez is a beast and they take a lot of people are looking past Alvarez.

5
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.591
You know,

6
00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:26.591
Alvarez had just come off of that brutal knockout loss,

7
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.713
uh,

8
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.820
kind of a humiliating knockout loss to Conor McGregor.

9
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.270
And then after that he is involved in the,

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.180
the no contest,
uh,
versus um,
Dustin poor.
Yay.

11
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.470
I believe that was an eye poke.
That is,

12
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.190
I'm trying to remember how that fight went down,
but I do not,

13
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.790
I feel like someone got poked in the eye.
Uh,

14
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.710
either way it's a no contest.

15
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.740
So that obviously doesn't move him up the ladder or any and he's got to regroup.

16
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.080
Yeah,
no contest.
Here it is.
Yeah.

17
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.230
Yeah.
This was a,
okay,
now I remember what it was.
It wasn't an eye poke.

18
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.500
It was a knee to a downed opponent and it was a fucking phenomenal fight while

19
00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:30.990
it played out against Dustin [inaudible].
They were going back and forth.

20
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:33.320
Now I remember the fight and,
um,

21
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.390
poor ea had Alvarez in some deep trouble.

22
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.570
Ann Alvarez rebounded and Alvarez I believe,

23
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:47.070
hit Dustin employ Yay.
With a knee while he was down.

24
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.460
Yeah,
that's exactly what happened.

25
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.180
And interesting.

26
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.620
Yeah.
See,
this is what happened.
Pour.
Yay.
Um,

27
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.150
<v 1>yeah.</v>

28
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.530
<v 0>Alvarez,
you know,
Herb Dean was Safat defending it,</v>

29
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:13.770
saying that Alvarez didn't intentionally need poor.
Yay.
And if I remember,

30
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:17.130
the fight is a crazy war.
Uh,

31
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:19.910
Alvarez had been rock pour had been robbed.

32
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.830
[inaudible] was bloodied and um,

33
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.480
Alvarez hit him with an unintentional knee,
um,

34
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.160
that could have resulted in a disqualification when for poor,
Yay.

35
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.170
And pouring.
It was saying that he looked at it as a win,
which is,
uh,
interesting.

36
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.100
MMM.
So anyway,

37
00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:46.490
[inaudible] rebounded from that fight obviously,
and uh,

38
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.540
stopped Anthony Pettis in his last fight so that the division is just crazy and

39
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.090
unbelievably hot right now.

40
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.840
And everybody waiting to see what the fuck happens with Conor McGregor.

41
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.670
But Eddie Alvarez with the no contest.
And before that,

42
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:07.450
the Kale lost econom McGregor desperately needs a win.

43
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.570
And he's coming in there against one of the most fucking savage guys in the

44
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:14.100
division.
Just engaged.

45
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.410
You showed in that Michael Johnson fight what he's made of and a lot of people

46
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:19.690
were very excited to see him inside the octagon.

47
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.080
He had been fighting in the world series of fighting and looking like an

48
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:24.310
absolute monster,

49
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but against what a lot of people thought was just not the same caliber of

50
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:32.770
competition as the UFC offered.

51
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.840
And so they wanted to see what would happen if he fought a real world class

52
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:41.380
fighter.
And what we saw in the Michael Johnson fight,
it's adjusting gage,

53
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:44.920
he who fights,
uh,
I don't want to say reckless,

54
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:49.000
but he puts himself in danger and it's one of the things that makes him so

55
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:51.220
excited and he forces his will on people.

56
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.200
He's a ferocious striker and a,
an excellent wrestler as well,

57
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:59.200
and just fucking puts it on fighters.

58
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.970
He tests there will,
he puts tremendous pressure on fighters.

59
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.410
And the,

60
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:10.360
the fight with Michael Johnson was just a pleasure to watch,

61
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:13.630
just so much fun and so fucking crazy.

62
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:15.730
There was so much chaos in that fight.

63
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:21.010
And a lot of people were introduced to just engage you from that fight.

64
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:24.550
The hardcore fans had known him already from the world series of fighting and

65
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.280
had heard about him through the Internet.
But the UFC fans and uh,

66
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.300
the people that were watching that night,

67
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.870
they really got a chance to be treated too.

68
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.140
Does the kind of chaotic fight that is really going to bring like the casual fan

69
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.610
when they see a guy like just engage you fight.

70
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.270
It's really gonna make you a fan of this kid.

71
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.650
Just his style is just,
there's very few guys,
I mean other than,

72
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.590
I mean Matt Brown who I talked about before,

73
00:04:56.591 --> 00:05:01.591
but even Matt Brown is capable of winning so many different ways where as Gagey

74
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.130
he's gonna probably try to knock you out or get,
I mean,

75
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:08.860
he's even said himself that he might get knocked out.

76
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.700
You're probably going to see me get knocked out.
He said,
uh,

77
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.660
over the next few years he's got that mindset,
this kill or be killed mindset.

78
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.823
And,
uh,

79
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.240
it's just absolutely fascinating to see this kid compete inside the octagon

80
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.270
because he's so fucking crazy because he's such a fucking animal inside the

81
00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:30.640
octagon.
He just got this,
uh,

82
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.260
undeniable killer instinct and indomitable spirit.

83
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.390
And she's,
there's levels to this game.
There's levels physically,

84
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.560
and he's at a very high level physically,
but there's also levels mentally.

85
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.420
And that's what excites me about Justi Iag is,
is the,
the mental level.

86
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.880
He just has zero quit in him and he's 100% ferocious.

87
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.980
So him fighting a fucking animal like Eddie Alvarez,

88
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.930
that's just a recipe for a good time.
And we're going to get to see that.

89
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.470
And we're going to get to see that next Saturday night live on paper view.
