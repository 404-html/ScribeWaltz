1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.430
Did you ever realize while you were,
while you were in the middle of this,

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.680
especially in the beginning,
the early days,
that this was,

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.760
that you guys had,
especially with van Halen in the early days,

4
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:18.870
you guys had a massive impact on culture.
Where you guys aware of that?

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.280
Like while it was happening,
how,
I mean when I was in high school,

6
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:27.900
I graduated in 1985 and you guys were the shit.
My girlfriend,

7
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.150
my sister's rather boyfriends,
uh,
my sister's boyfriend's license.

8
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.910
<v 1>I am the sand tray.
I'm the soundtrack to your whole,
I get this now.
Absolutely.</v>

9
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.680
I mean,
what was that?
That the gym was intentional.
It was intentional.

10
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.710
I can tell you now the van Halen knew it but can't articulate it.

11
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.550
But right there instrumentalists.
Here comes the funny joke words M my thing,

12
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.060
right?
You understood the words in my thing.

13
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.370
So you realized that while it was happening.
Well,

14
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.140
your end game depends on how you started.
It's like chess.

15
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.770
And we began very early on identifying that there's a whole lot of different

16
00:01:08.621 --> 00:01:13.060
neighborhoods and southern California.
I knew this from being with my dad,

17
00:01:13.061 --> 00:01:16.290
all of his patients,
whereas like a Benetton ad com.

18
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.480
Yeah.
You know,
that's part of the beauty of passive data.
You got everybody.
Okay.

19
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.390
And um,
okay.

20
00:01:25.391 --> 00:01:30.310
The way you play at the birthday party in the Spanish speaking neighborhood,

21
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.880
old rally Santana,
you got to change.

22
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.650
You've we bro.
Yeah.

23
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.510
It's different than what we're going to play for the surfers out of Venice
beach.

24
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.420
That's Aerosmith stuff.
Uh,
you know,

25
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.970
and do like this.

26
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.230
And then you have the working man okay.

27
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.860
Out in San Bernardino,
that Zz top

28
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.093
right.

29
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.300
Subtle but important genius is in the details and how you interact with that

30
00:02:08.051 --> 00:02:12.670
crowd.
In between.
We would play out in Pomona at a biker bar.

31
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.440
Guy got killed right in front of us and we finished the song.
What happened?

32
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.870
A couple of bike bike gangs went at it and uh,

33
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.510
there was a scrap and when everybody cleared out,

34
00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:29.620
there was a fellow right in the middle of the floor.
Next night we came back,

35
00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:31.270
vengeance had been sworn,

36
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.420
there were police Chevy where we pulled the amps out from the wall so we could

37
00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:39.310
hide behind the amps.
And
seventies there was a mighty task.

38
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.240
Wow.

39
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.710
And we played on the Queen Elizabeth for remotely fancy.

40
00:02:44.711 --> 00:02:45.491
Oh my God.

41
00:02:45.491 --> 00:02:48.910
I remember sitting in that ballroom at four in the morning in the days when we

42
00:02:48.911 --> 00:02:52.990
carried our own equipment and stuff and thinking of all the people who had been

43
00:02:52.991 --> 00:02:56.740
in there and everybody who'd perform there and so forth.

44
00:02:56.741 --> 00:03:01.741
And dozens and dozens of places know that we're all a little bit different.

45
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.610
And our,

46
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.510
our thing was that we could play anywhere we had to otherwise,
uh,

47
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.330
we had feed ourselves.
All right.
And that meant five 45 minutes sets a night,

48
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.430
five,
six nights.
If you could get it.

49
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.410
And we would ping pong all over the Southland anywhere we could drive for two

50
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:21.640
hours,
two hours north,

51
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:26.320
south or east is how we would do in every neighborhood was a little different.

52
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.480
And that shows up in the music,
you know,

53
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:35.380
now you can take a look at something like dance the night away or Jamie's
crying.

54
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.090
There's a,
there's a Latino influence in that.
Okay.
Do,
do,
do,

55
00:03:41.091 --> 00:03:43.810
do,
that's Ricky Ricardo people say,

56
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.650
what's your favorite Cuban expecting me to name a cigar.
I say Ricky Ricardo,

57
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.120
but in the ditch,
Rumba,

58
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.750
Rumba to touch a dud to now you're thinking about it,

59
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.210
you go yeah,
and kid.
And if he was in a dance the night away,

60
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:04.510
the middle break is all cha-cha chotchkies stuff,
Leah,

61
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.770
because here this is,
you know,

62
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.460
are you're surrounded by Hispanic culture here and we had heavy metal

63
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:15.460
influences.
Okay.

64
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.200
We had a super wealthy stuff.

65
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:24.100
So you have to be able to move to acoustic.

66
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.970
You gotta be able to ease up if you get hired for a wedding.

67
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.230
And more importantly,
perhaps,
you know,
artists to artists.

68
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.480
I don't know Springsteen better during the song or in between.
Careful.

69
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.440
We're going to the Broadway show.
Yeah,

70
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.750
that's about a $12,000 ticket now.
And I'm guessing,

71
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.730
I'm guessing before tee shirt.
And,
uh,

72
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.250
I'm guessing that,
uh,
I haven't seen the whole show.

73
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:59.251
I saw some of it on Netflix and the very pivot of it is the in between songs.

74
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.060
Yeah.
The songs are almost secondary.
You know,

75
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.350
they're almost peripheral to his narration in his descriptions and his poetry.

76
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.260
Well,
he sets a deep guy.
Like you have to hear the in between stuff.

77
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:16.780
You want to hear him brewed,
you want to hear him talk,

78
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:19.090
you want to hear him think about things.
Yes.

79
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.080
And where do you learn that or dealing that

80
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.120
already have,

81
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.630
I'm going to count to 30,000 Joe hours and hours and hours and when we're done

82
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.100
you'll be able to,
you know,
Joe,
that's not a good Springsteen.
You know,

83
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.760
you're a good man.
Jo.
What I was trying to get at was like,

84
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.040
does it ever freak you out?

85
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.430
Like when you ever alone and you think about what you guys did and what you've

86
00:05:45.431 --> 00:05:49.710
done in your career,
does it ever freak you out?
But the impact that you've had,

87
00:05:49.711 --> 00:05:52.240
that if you looked at the amount of human beings that have had the kind of

88
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:57.160
impact that you've had,
the tiniest,
tiniest fraction of a percent,

89
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.340
like the amount of human beings that can relate to your personal life

90
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.880
experiences.
Paraphrase the James Brown movie,
there's two of them.

91
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.680
Both of them were helpful,
hopefully produced by Jagger.
Okay.
And,
uh,

92
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.060
he does an interview.
He goes down a little bit of me in every record you hear.

93
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.330
Oh yeah.

94
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.360
He's in the DNA is a little bit of David Lee Roth in there.

95
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.900
Yeah,
there's a little bit,
whenever,
when you see videos today,

96
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.260
it doesn't matter if it's hip hop,
doesn't matter if it's rock and roll.

97
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:34.580
It doesn't matter if it's classic or pit bull.
Can you dig?

98
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.250
There's a lead.
You can trace it back if follow.
Right.
And it's not a,

99
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.060
I don't think of it as impact.
That's a result.
What's the verb?

100
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.830
Contribution.
Yeah.
At family reunions,

101
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:53.230
whatever we go around,
everybody picks a word.
And,
uh,

102
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.860
my favorite word ever was to contribution.
Did you try,

103
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.370
you know,
go climb the tree.
Here's my favorite poem.

104
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.060
I saw it inscribed on a rock by an anonymous poet at the base.

105
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.800
Just sort of base camp at Everest.
Go climb the treasure mountain.

106
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.790
Do not return empty handed.
Where are you now?

107
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.670
Mm.
Ooh.
Ooh,
Ooh.
Yeah.
That's some gps shit.
