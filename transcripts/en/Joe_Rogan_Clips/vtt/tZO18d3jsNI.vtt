WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.220
Lee.
I'm just not sold.
Did you?
Oh No.

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.540
And then Konya had some good points,
but I don't know.

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.760
Did you see that Candice Owens and Tomi Lahren?

4
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:12.660
We're getting into it on Twitter today?
No.
Like,
like two weeks ago I missed it.

5
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.070
It was this big cat fight.
Really?
Yeah,
it was hilarious.
What did they say?

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.640
Like Tommy's was subtweeting her,
she wouldn't use her name.
She goes,
oh,
you know,

7
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:24.300
blah blah blah blah blah.
And Candice is like,
Tommy Comma,

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.680
like you're jealous cause your careers that disaster,
blah blah,
blah,
blah.
Yeah,

9
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:31.260
it was,
it was before I'd be on the scenario.
Yeah,

10
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.000
it's extensively Kanya turned on.
Candace throw her under the bus.

11
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.730
Oh yeah.
Oh,
Kanye turned on Candace.
Oh yeah.

12
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.160
He says I'm not involved and I'm not involved in politics anymore.

13
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.240
How's that turning on Candace?
Cause she could use her name in the tweets.

14
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.930
What'd he say?
He said,
Candace,
whatever.
I find the tweet if you want.
But,

15
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.000
so she was,
I don't want to speak for her,

16
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:54.810
but she launched this whole Brexit thing and basically implied that he was

17
00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:55.770
involved and he's like,
I'm not,

18
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.020
I've been used by people in politics and not doing it.
Well,
look,
she,

19
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.570
she went at it hard.
Oh yeah.

20
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:05.340
They both turn on Kanye now the ship was doomed to sync from the start,

21
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:08.670
but hunger for fame and money was placed over the movement.

22
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.940
Funny how he was a free thinker in quotes before and now he's a trader and

23
00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:19.320
quotes sounds a lot like a tactic of the left.
I like how she capitalize.

24
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.180
It'll all in left.
Yeah.
You made your bed now lie in it.

25
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.020
I think she means,
I think he'd be laying there.
Yeah.
Well maybe not.

26
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.720
Maybe it's a double entendre.
Maybe.

27
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.020
Maybe it'd be in factual or all the Tommy.

28
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.550
I think I can Expedia speak on behalf of people on both sides of the political

29
00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:45.300
aisle and say,
we are sorry about your failed career.

30
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.030
That this is hilarious.
And she's saying this,

31
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.150
she's literally had a career in this for about eight months and you're failed

32
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:57.900
career,
you know,
she used to run an anti Trump website.
A doxing set,
you mean?

33
00:01:57.901 --> 00:01:58.734
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

34
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.430
The desperation to be relevant again by constantly serving me and,

35
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:07.620
or attacking Kathy Griffin weekly.

36
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.700
Make sure to tag Kazen bode well for any movement.
Grow Up.

37
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.730
Whenever anyone writes grow up.
I always hear it in Karpman's voice.

38
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.940
Is that it?

39
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.450
Did they go out into the further or is it just one little bit of back and forth?

40
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.840
Yeah,
that's sort of silly.
Yeah,
it is.
Oh,
wins.

41
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:29.841
Went on the defensive Wednesday after West rejected claims that he designed or

42
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:35.040
created blacks at t shirts.
What does black set black black lights it.

43
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.680
They could shut it.
Called a black set.
Yeah.

44
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.690
Like they mean the black still leaving the Democratic Party.

45
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.100
Why didn't they do that?
You'd have to ask Candace and our Kanye and her.

46
00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:48.120
Kathy Griffin.
Yeah.
Well I get they did it because of Brexit.

47
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.750
You have a black sits Exeter.
Yeah.
Blit yeah.

48
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.820
Eh,
it's not bad black exit.
Yeah,

49
00:02:56.821 --> 00:03:01.750
but black state is also black exit.
Yeah.
It's called blaxploitation the movies.

50
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.230
Right,
but exit is spelled e.
X.
I.
T.

51
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.590
He just have be l and then e.
X.
I.
T.
It's actually better

52
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.500
if you want to be sure.
Precisely spelling is better,
but in terms of how,

53
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.800
how it's said,
I think blacks,
it sounds,
lacks it.
I'd look to

54
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.180
exit.
I don't think either.
You don't have to abbreviate exit.

55
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.140
You just keep exit in there and just be out at the beginning of it and it works

56
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.600
or it collects.
It also works.
Let's,

57
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.450
I've sure Candace think you're married to your idea of blacks.

58
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:35.320
It's needed to let it go.
You're a writer.
You know how to kill your babies.

59
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.060
I don't have any black vegans.
No excavating writing.
You've got your darlings.

60
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.630
Kill your darling till your shitty ideas.
Yeah.
Blacks.

61
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:47.860
It's like shitty idea blacks.
It is where it's at.
Is it?
Yeah.
Brexit.
Brexit.

62
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.560
They were right.
Do you think that there's gonna be a lot of people,

63
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:53.890
black people leading the Democratic Party?
I don't think so.
Yeah.
No,

64
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.490
I think there's going to be a few that recognize that it's a genuine pathway to

65
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:02.860
attention.
And I think there's going to be,
a lot of people are going to sit home.

66
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.730
That's where African American a,
listen,

67
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.180
there is few on both sides of the aisle that are contrarians.

68
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.590
Hucksters you know,
there's,
there's two different types of people.

69
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.310
The contrarians are people that don't like the fact that they are being told

70
00:04:17.311 --> 00:04:22.200
that as an African American I have to vote Democrat and I have to lean left and

71
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:24.780
they're like,
fuck this,
you know,
you don't tell me what to do.

72
00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:25.590
And then they go that way.

73
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.600
I think we're getting a little bit of that from Kanye West.

74
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.450
And then there's people that recognize that there is,

75
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.430
there's legitimate pathway to start them to attention to.

76
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.350
You know,
it's just a,

77
00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:42.351
it's a career and being like reciting conservative talking points as an African

78
00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:47.340
American.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I mean it's a,
it's affirmative action.
Yeah.
But it's,

79
00:04:47.341 --> 00:04:49.830
um,
and especially,
you know,

80
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.920
if you can get a little juice on some sort of argument with some Tommy Lauren

81
00:04:56.191 --> 00:04:59.370
chick or any of these,
I was confused.
Her and Lauren Southern,

82
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.810
they're very different.
I know,
but they're both hot.
They're both hot plates on.

83
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.320
That's all I say.
I'm not really paying attention to what they're saying.
Well,

84
00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:10.080
I don't think that's fair to Lauren.
How dare you?
What do you mean?

85
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.590
How'd there has,
is Lauren the superior to the title?
I'm not going to s I mean,

86
00:05:16.591 --> 00:05:20.730
if I wouldn't say it,
not fair to Lauren.
So you mean Lauren is better than Tommy?

87
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.890
Uh,
I think Lauren,

88
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.270
Tommy is very much someone who's there to have a,
uh,

89
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.460
standard Republican point of view,
which she does well.
And write your present.

90
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.050
Lauren is more of kind of a filmmaker and she's much edgier.
I mean,
she's,
uh,

91
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.400
she went with Molyneux to Australia.
There was all this beef.
Um,

92
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.990
I'll go in Australia like they want it to stop their talks.
Uh,
she's done.

93
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.970
She's going to South Africa to do work.
They want to stop everybody's talks,

94
00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:50.270
who want stop.
Tommy's talks to,
they want to start [inaudible] Lawrence.

95
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.910
Much more controversial.
Real Watch.
More controversial.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

96
00:05:53.911 --> 00:05:56.330
She's very anti anti immigrant.

97
00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.180
She went to Europe to see the migrant camps.
Um,

98
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.230
so you're not going to see Lauren really on these like mainstream outlets.
Um.
