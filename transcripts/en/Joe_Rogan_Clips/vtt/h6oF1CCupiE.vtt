1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.580
What'd it look like?
But it was from all we can tell,

2
00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:06.750
it was awfully close to today's chimps.
And so there,
if you look at chimps today,

3
00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:08.850
you can get a pretty good sense of what life was like then.

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.650
And chimps today are really interesting.

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.340
They're basically at the top of the food chain in the rain forests.
They,

6
00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:17.730
because they travel in groups,
even amazing tree climbers,

7
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:20.840
like leopards won't try to attack them in trees.
It's just,
it's,

8
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.360
they're too dangerous,
too fast.
But if you look at a chimp on the ground,

9
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.990
it can't even lock its knees.
It's as kind of cute little stumbling along thing.

10
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.860
And then the question is why would an animal that runs the show in the canopy

11
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.520
leave the rainforest for the Savannah and then how to survive once I did that.

12
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.803
And that's,

13
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.930
that's the story of this book and then how that manifested itself to where we

14
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:43.590
are today.
So really my goal,
I'm a psychologist.

15
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:45.870
I want to understand why we are the way we are.

16
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.360
And so in trying to figure that out,
I said,
well,

17
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:52.530
let's take a look back all the way to our common ancestors and see some of the

18
00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:55.500
key events and how they might have had an influence on how we are today.

19
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.950
So the first question is,
why would we leave the trees right here we are,

20
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.580
we're dominant position where we're food on the ground.

21
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:03.930
Why would we ever take that risk?

22
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.440
And the basic story there is the great African Rift Valley,

23
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:09.360
I'm not sure if you've,
you're familiar with that at all,

24
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.730
but basically it runs down from,

25
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.690
I'm up at the Red Sea down to the coast of Mozambique and you can think of it

26
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:17.760
like a geographic zipper.
You know,

27
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:20.940
all the world's sits on these tectonic plates and sometimes they crash into each

28
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:25.020
other like,
uh,
how Indian smashing into Asia and creates amylase.

29
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.890
Sometimes they literally tear apart and Africa's tearing apart at the great

30
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:33.240
African Rift Valley.
So that plate that has Somalia and Ethiopia,
Tanzania,
Kenya,

31
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.250
that's moving off to the lower right.

32
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.770
The rest of Africa is moving off to the upper left.

33
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.390
And I got no idea why it's been going on for quite a while.

34
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:46.140
But one of the consequences that is that the east Africa starting to rise up

35
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:50.340
slowly,
bit by bit,
and when it rises up,
the rain forest dry out.

36
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.790
And so basically what you have is a situation where our ancestors were on the

37
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:56.700
east side of that Rift Valley and it started to dry out.

38
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.840
And now they're in a situation where they've got this great lifestyle,

39
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.060
their dominant position,
but now they're pushed.

40
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:04.860
They're forced out onto the ground increasingly more and more because there's

41
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:07.260
more and more ground and less and less rain forest.

42
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.970
And so how did they survive that?
What do they do in order to make that work?

43
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.590
And this is,
uh,
what,
what period of time is this?
How many millions of years ago,

44
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.200
six or seven,
six or seven,
does this coincide with the when,

45
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.320
when was the jump of the human brain size?
We're double,
we'll get to that.

46
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:28.380
So it's a super interesting question about why that happened as well.

47
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.560
So basically if you track us across the next 3 million years,

48
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.180
how did our ancestors survive when they're basically chimpanzees on the open

49
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:36.960
Savannah.

50
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.020
And you can get a hint of how they did it because there's one chimpanzee group

51
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:43.350
that does live on the Savannah in Senegal and they,
um,

52
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.000
they show some differences between themselves and other chimps that traveled and

53
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:50.430
slightly larger groups.
They share more nicely with each other,

54
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:53.620
which is interesting.
That's kind of a human trait as well.
And uh,

55
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.350
they also avoid open space.

56
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:58.170
Like they are just kind of trying to stay near the trees as much as possible.

57
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.930
And,
and if you look at other aids,
not aids,

58
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:05.200
but other primates that are on the Savanna,
like Savannah baboons,

59
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.020
they're only monkeys.
So they're not as sharp is chimpanzees are,

60
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.610
but they have a similar strategy,

61
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:12.850
large groups to try to protect themselves and lots of eyes to look out for

62
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:15.190
predators.
And they do fine on the Savannah.

63
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.030
And so what I suspect happened is for the first few million years,

64
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.080
basically what you've got is this chimp like animal that's kind of skirting the

65
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:23.914
edges of Savannah.

66
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.580
Nowhere near the top dominant position they used to be and just kind of noodling

67
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:31.360
around.
And that takes,
I suspect that takes us for about the first three,

68
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:34.210
three and a half million years.
And if you look at who we are,

69
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:39.070
then we're Australopithecus afarensis.
So it's,
if you looked at one of them,

70
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.340
you'd think it belongs in a zoo.
It looks almost like a chimpanzee.

71
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.840
And so a chimp brain,

72
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.230
in answer to the first part of your question is about 380 grams.

73
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.830
And Australopithecus brain is about 450 grams.

74
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.520
So 3 million years of evolution and all we've got four to 70 grams.

75
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.440
So why do we get so smart?
Why do we take off in the next few million years?

76
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.000
And what is it that Australopithecus did that,
that helped us survive?
And,

77
00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:05.800
and why do I call that the social late?
That's all kind of tied together.

78
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.890
And the basic story is it,

79
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:13.360
by this point Australopithecus has become bipedal and we can talk about how that

80
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:16.020
happened if you'd like.
And so because they're bipedal,

81
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.960
their waste is now stretched out their,
um,
their musculature.
Like,

82
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:21.430
if you look at Chimpanzee Pecs,

83
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.790
they aim upward because of course chimps climbing all the time.
Um,

84
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:26.740
Australopithecus is more lateral like we are,

85
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:30.430
we're basically completely lateral because things are side to side as far as

86
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:32.470
we're concerned.
It's harder to climb a tree,

87
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:35.640
but it's a whole lot easier to do a lot of other things.
And uh,

88
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.520
we have much more limber shoulder,
we have much more limber wrist,

89
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:43.540
all that sort of thing.
And a lot of that was in place by Australopithecus.

90
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.250
So once they became by peatal,
they gained a lot of these qualities.

91
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.060
And then the question is why do those qualities matter?
Well,
the,

92
00:04:52.061 --> 00:04:53.860
if you watch a chimpanzee throw,

93
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.920
it's terrible at it even though they're stronger than you and I are pound for

94
00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:59.710
pound by a sizable margin.
When they throw their inept,

95
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.340
they can't Dane very well and they typically use two hands because they're not

96
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:06.840
lined up well to throw.
If you watch a really good thrower,
like you know,

97
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.220
a grid iron football player,
a baseball player or a hunter gatherer throw,

98
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.060
you know it's a full body motion to step forward with the other leg.

99
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.330
There's this rotation and the very last minute you bring your risk through.

100
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.920
Well what that does is it creates an enormous amount of elastic energy across

101
00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:24.310
your muscles,
tendons and ligaments.
And the end of that throw for a human,

102
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:28.840
it's like the snapping of a rubber band.
So chimps can't do that.

103
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:30.130
They're not lined up properly.

104
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.060
But australopithecus got to the point where they could probably do that pretty

105
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:36.100
well.
And so now,

106
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.940
and this is purely a byproduct of bipedalism because it's stretched out their

107
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:42.260
whole body and they don't,
they're not climbing as much anymore.

108
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.260
So their musculature is more lateral,

109
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.790
which would have been helped them for throwing.

110
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.050
So now you get to a point where they have access to the single most important

111
00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:54.190
military invention in history,
which is the capacity to kill it a distance.

112
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.070
So if you and I are running around the Savannah and Elian attacks us and we got

113
00:05:58.071 --> 00:06:00.800
50 of our best friends,
we could kill it with our bare hands.

114
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.170
But a lot of us are going to die in the process,
right.
Because think 50 of us go,

115
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.830
let's make it a hundred somebody who even though they would,
you know,

116
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:12.510
with a bunch of Nice and shy,
and I'd be super coffee.
Yeah,

117
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.210
you wouldn't worry people,
you wouldn't worry very much.
But,
but even if we could,

118
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:19.460
so we knew what we're doing.
We're all armed with knives,
whoever,

119
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.750
whoever goes in his first screwed.
Right.
Right.

120
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.300
And so the capacity to kill it a distance though allows a larger force of weaker

121
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:29.360
individuals to come to easily defeat a stronger individual.

122
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.750
And so once they gained this capacity to throw,

123
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.730
if they were attacked by lions or something like that,

124
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:37.010
whereas in the past they did just scattered for the trees.

125
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.210
Now they can throw stones at it and defend themselves now and Australopithecus

126
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:44.480
throwing rocks at alliance is going to be in the belly of a slightly annoyed

127
00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:46.230
line in about three minutes.
Right,
right.

128
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.540
But 50 australopithecines throwing rocks at Lyons is a totally different story.

129
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.160
And so it's the,
this is the idea here is the throwing hypothesis there.
What,

130
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.690
what changed everything was throwing.

131
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.810
And the reason it changed everything is that it caused us,

132
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.680
it was the first reason why we should have any effective collective action

133
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.230
because it's not a good strategy when you're on your own.

134
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.710
It's not a good strategy if I do it in the rest of the group hits heads for the

135
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:12.830
trees.
But it's a great strategy if we all do it together.

136
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.900
And so for the first time in history,

137
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.620
the group's goals and our history in our line,
the primate line,

138
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.110
the group's goals aligned with the individual goals,

139
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.040
which is let's cooperate and work together to try to drive away these predators.

140
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.380
Now it,
you look at a lion and you look at someone throwing rocks,

141
00:07:30.381 --> 00:07:34.160
it still seems like a really big ask,
right?
To drive that thing away or kill it,

142
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.990
throwing rocks.
And so,

143
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.990
but Barbara Isaac was one of the first anthropologist to propose this hypothesis

144
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.843
quite a while ago.

145
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.790
Went Back and looked through the historical record and these extraordinary

146
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.670
stories of how effective people are throwing rocks.

147
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.350
And so in when the Portuguese went to the Canary Islands to try to subjugate it,

148
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.520
they rock up with,
you know,
armor guns,
uh,
crossbows.

149
00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:00.440
And this is like 14 something and all the locals were on with,
with stones.

150
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.150
And despite the fact that the Portuguese are there in army trained,
you know,

151
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.140
ready to shoot and,
and in their armor,

152
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.440
they were just decimated by the local stone,
Roxanne.

153
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.790
And this story has happened over and over again.

154
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:12.650
And when you read these accounts,
they're extraordinary.

155
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.880
I can read you some examples from here.
They just,
the,
it happened in Australia.

156
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:18.950
It happened in the Canary Islands that happened elsewhere.

157
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:23.370
They just throw rocks incredibly accurately,
incredibly hard and really fast.
Hmm.

158
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.950
So,
and there's,
you know,

159
00:08:24.951 --> 00:08:29.900
accounts in Africa basically killing a zebra with one blow of a rock to the
head.

160
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:35.650
Hmm.
So like,
uh,
a picture of major league pitcher.
Yeah,

161
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.460
exactly.
Rock.
Right.
Who gets very accurate at it.
So do you think they,

162
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.740
they must have practiced constantly.

163
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.960
What I suspect is that we evolve to like to throw rocks.
And so if I look at,

164
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.690
if you look at my son as a,
for example,
when he was 18 months old,

165
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.930
we would be walking back toward the house.
If he saw a rock on the street,

166
00:08:53.931 --> 00:08:56.630
he picked it up and start trying to throw it.
And my wife said,
no,
no,

167
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.190
don't let him throw rocks.
It's only going to cause trouble.
First of all,

168
00:08:59.191 --> 00:08:59.491
I'm thinking,

169
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:01.980
well maybe I'll develop a good arm so I'm gonna go ahead and let them anyway.

170
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.230
But it's secondly,
he fricking wants to,

171
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:06.840
this is like something inherently fun for him,
right?

172
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.500
And I think all humans enjoy throwing and it's,

173
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.740
it's stunning how good you can get it with practice.
So,
um,

174
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.060
we were at the Ohio state fair,
but there's,

175
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.040
before my son was born and I was walking by one of these stalls where you can

176
00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:21.060
throw in a radar gun.

177
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.480
And so I thought I was just starting to date my wife and I thought,
oh,

178
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:27.960
here's a perfect chance to impress her.
Right?
And how,
how much do I am?
So I said,

179
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:30.150
hey,
why don't I stop and I'll throw some balls here and this net,

180
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.480
cause I had never thrown,
I didn't know how fast I could.
So she's like,
sure.

181
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.190
And I was,
I played like little league,
right?

182
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.870
So I throw the ball and it's like 50 miles an hour and she's pretty impressed

183
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:43.920
because that's sounds fast,
right?
Then this like kid shows up next to me,

184
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:47.960
it's got to be 12 years old,
probably weighs 85 pounds.
There's total gang,

185
00:09:47.961 --> 00:09:49.170
I'm not a muscle in his body.

186
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.830
And he just starts to freaking throw on ball after ball it like 65 miles an
hour.

187
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.710
And I'm like fuck.
I mean she's not going to be impressed with,

188
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.140
it's like human twig next to me is kicking my ass,
right?

189
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.980
And so I pick up the last ball,
I fricking throw it as hard as I can.

190
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:05.220
It hurts my shoulder,
flies off at an odd angle,
doesn't hit anything,

191
00:10:05.221 --> 00:10:07.410
and it's like 57 miles an hour.
Now,

192
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:10.410
that little guy who's like literally the size of an hostile Pythagoras was

193
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:14.400
thrown in 65 and hitting the target every time.
And so it's obvious it,

194
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.130
it's skill,
it's practice that would have made you good at this.

195
00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:20.520
And if your life depends on it,
you're going to do it.
Well,
that makes sense.

196
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.830
Coming from a martial arts background,

197
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.940
like coordinated movement where at the end of it,

198
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.920
you snap exactly sense that this technique is so critical,

199
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.360
even though you're a larger person.

200
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.290
So a better technique could have more of an impact with that.

201
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.610
So the throwing arm,

202
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.670
I had read this and if that was one of the hypothesis,

203
00:10:41.671 --> 00:10:45.900
there's several hypothesis why the human brain doubled over a period of 2

204
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.210
million years.
Another one was cooked meat,
right?

205
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.700
They figured out a way to get more nutrients out of meat that's writing it over

206
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.540
fire,
right?
So that's a little bit down the road.

207
00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:56.100
So here we are three and a half million years ago.

208
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.520
And so for the first time we put some pressure on ourselves to have an advantage

209
00:10:59.521 --> 00:11:02.040
to be smarter.
So imagine you're a zebra.

210
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.070
You know what the hell good is it to you to be Einstein?
You got moves.

211
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.370
What are you going to do with that brain?
Right?
But it's a big,
it's a big cost.

212
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.860
Our brains are 20% of our metabolic energy,

213
00:11:10.861 --> 00:11:14.490
whether we're doing math or watching TV,
it's,
it's constant drain.

214
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.150
And so what are our ancestors?
Why would they pay for that drain?
Now,

215
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:22.840
just recently,
there was a paper that came out maybe three months ago now on um,

216
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.880
a new brand expansion gene they found or they think that's what it is called to

217
00:11:26.881 --> 00:11:30.840
NL.
And it turns out,
I don't know,
12,
15 million years ago,

218
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.110
there was an accidental duplication of that gene on our genome and it,

219
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.210
but it was ineffective and it just sat there doing nothing.

220
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.050
Now that's a great way that evolution works where it accidentally doubles a gene

221
00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:41.820
because then you don't,
you can mess with it.

222
00:11:41.821 --> 00:11:43.620
And the old jeans still doing the job,
right?

223
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.880
So it sat there for about 9 million years in our line til about 3 million years

224
00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:48.081
ago,

225
00:11:48.081 --> 00:11:52.080
round Australopithecus and then it duplicated itself and it came online again.

226
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:56.320
And would that gene seems to do is it makes our brain remain as stem cells for

227
00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:57.010
longer,

228
00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:00.340
which means a lot more duplication before they run away and start becoming

229
00:12:00.341 --> 00:12:04.390
neurons.
And so if I had to guess,

230
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.590
I'd say that that probably that gene coming online probably happened many times

231
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:11.950
in the past and every time it happened in the past it was more cost than it was

232
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:12.550
worth.

233
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.490
And so what's the chimp going to do with a little bit more brain and just means

234
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:19.090
more calories and what does he gain from it?
But now that we're working together,

235
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.050
now that we have collective action,
all sorts of things open up,
we could,

236
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.860
we could devise division of labor,
I'll say,
hey man,
you do this and I'll do that.

237
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.160
Cause Australopithecus they've got 70 more grams in a chimp.

238
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.220
They can't do things like that.
They can all throw rocks at the same time.

239
00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:34.390
That's not rocket science.

240
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:39.430
But all the kinds of things that came next probably were enabled by that process

241
00:12:39.431 --> 00:12:42.040
of us coming together and deciding to work together and cooperate.

242
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:47.140
So if you look at chimpanzees,
they don't cooperate very well.
Um,
for example,

243
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:50.530
one of the activities where they sorta cooperate is when the hunting monkeys and

244
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:53.520
so the law gather round and they'll see some monkeys in the trees and they'd

245
00:12:53.521 --> 00:12:56.140
come in from every angle.
It's not very coordinated.

246
00:12:56.141 --> 00:12:57.610
It's kind of a wild free for all.

247
00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.370
But what's interesting about it is that when the Hunt's over,

248
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.610
let's say you just sat there the whole time and watched and I'm working my ass

249
00:13:03.611 --> 00:13:07.480
off chasing these monkeys,
I got one.
You come up and bug me for it and I don't,

250
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.180
I don't really handle it.
You like keep nudging me til I share,

251
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.270
but I'm just as likely to share with you if you helped as if you didn't.

252
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.170
I don't make any distinction and you'll never establish effective groups if you

253
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:21.490
can't reward those who participate compared to those who don't.
Even little kids,

254
00:13:21.491 --> 00:13:25.180
four year old kids,
when you give them games to play and they earn stickers,

255
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.530
if you didn't play,
you don't.
When you come up and ask,
you don't get an a,

256
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.150
you played even if you didn't do your job right,
but you tried,
boom,

257
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:34.270
you can have a sticker.
So humans immediately get that,

258
00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:36.850
that you get rewarded for your activities as part of the group.

259
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.260
Chimps don't seem to have that.
