WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.590
Violations of,

2
00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.450
and then you have people like Milo who was mean to a person and you delete,

3
00:00:04.451 --> 00:00:07.910
you banned him permanently.
There's more than that.
There's a little more to that.

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.700
Yeah.
I'm happy to talk about Milo and actually brought the tweets because so,

5
00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:14.440
so let's,
let's preface that by saying,

6
00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:17.320
the point I want to make sure is clear is that you had somebody who actively

7
00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:19.540
called for the death of people.
I understand the context issue.

8
00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:22.330
Maybe he's talking about video games probably takes some skill and scale.

9
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.040
So this is a verified user and the end,

10
00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:28.870
that's just the complexity and enacting not an excuse for why we don't do it in

11
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.560
a particular writer.
But there,
there,
there are a lot of other examples too.

12
00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:35.170
They get into more egregious areas that I've,
I've prepared.

13
00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:37.690
So here we have someone with over 20,000 followers.

14
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.340
He's verified numerous times insights his followers to commit a crime against

15
00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:45.970
these kids.
The action taken against him is delete the tweets.

16
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.260
You get a suspension,
you get time out.

17
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.690
Then you have people like Alex Jones who be rated,

18
00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:52.030
a CNN reporter permanently banned.
You get Milo Yiannopoulos,

19
00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:54.160
he was mean permanently banned.
But that's your impression.

20
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.190
That's not what happened.
Okay,
the details.

21
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.860
Let's do this one at a time.
Let's start with Myeloma.

22
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.470
So what was the details with Milo?

23
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.950
Milo had a number of tweets that violated our rules going back to 2014 but I'm

24
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.790
going to talk about the final three concept.
Um,

25
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.180
he claimed to be a buzzfeed reporter in his bio and he's a verified account.

26
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:21.900
So that is impersonation.
I'm not sure why he did that.
He did do that.
What?

27
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:25.620
Buzzfeed's a left wing thing.
So he was doing parody a potentially,

28
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:28.260
but our parody rules are very specific that if you have an account,

29
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:30.780
that's me being a is a parody account,

30
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:33.460
you need to say that it is a parody accounts.
You confuse people.

31
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.260
Everybody who knows Milo would know that he's not a buzz feed reporter,

32
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.410
that people who don't know Milo,
we'll look at that verified account,

33
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:44.670
write an essay,
but it wasn't verified after a while you removed as verification.

34
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:46.430
He violated our rules around verification.

35
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.030
So the viable via the verification was removed because of the buzzfeed thing.

36
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.010
I believe so.
I can,
I can confirm that.
I believe so.
He also a docked someone,

37
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:59.730
he posted,
um,
private information about an individual.

38
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.990
So that was the second one.
He tweeted to somebody else.
Um,

39
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.010
if you were my child,
I'd have dashed your head on a rock and try it again,

40
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.130
which we viewed as a threat.
Really.

41
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.280
That's like he's saying like,
your mom should have swallowed you.
You know,

42
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:20.640
it's like,
you know what I'm saying?
It's like you're,
you're a mistake.

43
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.200
I'll tell you that's a threat.

44
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.660
I understand why reasonable people would have different impressions of this.

45
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.360
I'm just going through and telling you what they are,

46
00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:29.100
just so we can have all the facts on the table,
right.

47
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.650
And then we can debate them.
And then the last one,

48
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.570
we found a bunch of things that he posted that we viewed as incitement of,

49
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:39.570
uh,
abuse against Leslie Jones.
So there's a bunch of them.

50
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:44.571
But the one that I like to look at in which really convinced me is he posted to

51
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:49.410
doctor tweets that were supposedly by Leslie Jones.
They were fake tweets.
Um,

52
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.440
the first one said,
white people are getting on my nerves.

53
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:57.000
Like how can you call yourself human?
And then the second one said,

54
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.893
um,

55
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.260
the God damn a slur for a Jewish person at Sony ain't paid me yet.

56
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:08.050
Damn bics nude better pay up.

57
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.880
And this was just a fake tweet that someone had photo shopped two or two,

58
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.650
two fake tweets and we know they were faked because we could still tell from the

59
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.820
software and they were faked.

60
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.890
You can't always tell is it is possible that he didn't know they were faked.

61
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.510
It's possible to send it to him and he didn't do his due diligence and looking

62
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:29.860
it up and it is possible.

63
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:32.860
But it was pointed out to him that they were fake because he left it on.

64
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.600
And not only did he leave it on,
he said,
don't tell me some mischievous intranet.

65
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:39.760
Rascal made them up.
Exclamation point.

66
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.010
So this and the context of a bunch of other things he was saying towards Leslie

67
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.843
Jones on Twitter,

68
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.370
I and my team felt that this was taken as a whole incitement of harassment

69
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:51.910
against her.

70
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.650
Wasn't there another issue with multiple accounts that were connected to him?

71
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.610
Uh,
there were a bunch of other issues on the background,

72
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:04.840
but these are the three primary things that we looked at in terms of the other

73
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:05.950
things that were in the background.

74
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.090
Weren't they multiple accounts that were connected to him?

75
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:13.450
Like I think that,
I'm not sure about that.
Uh,
Joe,

76
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.710
I think it was more that we found him to be engaging in coordinated behavior at

77
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:19.410
inciting people to,

78
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.490
to attack Leslie Jones case like him.
No,
I'm just going to be honest.

79
00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:28.240
When I'm listening to those or listening to read those tweets out,

80
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:29.290
they don't sound that bad.

81
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:32.620
And they certainly don't sound as bad as calling for the death of a child who's

82
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.550
wearing a maggot hat.

83
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.330
Throw him into a woodshop or the fact that that guy is still out there tweeting

84
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:40.600
and Milo's not Milo's initial.

85
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.020
The whole thing stemmed from,
other than the buzzfeed thing,

86
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.160
stemmed from his legitimate criticism of a film.
And he's,
you know,

87
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:52.660
he's a satirist.
He was mocking this film.
The doxing incident wasn't related.

88
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.410
Doxing.
Why don't we want the [inaudible] stuff?

89
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.910
We all agree that doxing,

90
00:04:57.911 --> 00:05:01.900
if something that Twitter should take action on to percent threaten people in

91
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:02.440
real life,

92
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.180
and I take an enormous amount of responsibility for that because I fear daily

93
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:10.510
for the things that are happening on the platform that are translating into the

94
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:12.160
real world.
So,
uh,

95
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.120
Milo is a contentious figure and there's certainly things you can pull up that I

96
00:05:16.121 --> 00:05:18.430
wouldn't agree with.
Anything he did there.
I think those are horrible.

97
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.550
I think Joe brought some really good points,
but what about Chuck Johnson?

98
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.930
Why was Chuck Johnson Ben?
I don't have those details in front of me.

99
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.100
Time Johnson said that he was preparing something to take out d deray McKesson

100
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.350
and in the Er,
in a journalistic context,

101
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:35.410
people take this to me and he was going to do a dossier or some kind of hit

102
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:38.260
piece on Deray is permanently banned.
And my understanding,

103
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:40.900
and it's been a long time since I've read this,
there was some leaked emails,

104
00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:43.700
I think from Dick Costolo where he said maybe it wasn't deck.

105
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.670
I don't want to drag deck.
I don't know who it was exactly.
They said,

106
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:49.630
I don't care,
just get rid of him.
And he was off.
So you have,

107
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.510
and again maybe there's some hidden context there,
I don't know.

108
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.770
But on the surface the concern is that this is always leaning towards the left.

109
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.010
Oh it absolutely is.
And I'm,
I'm,
I'm not even getting started.
Yeah,

110
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.670
I can understand why you feel that way.
I don't think that's true.

111
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.810
I think we look at each individual instance of violations of our rules and try

112
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:12.440
to make the best case that we can and I'm not trying and I do think Joe,

113
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:16.310
just to just to say I do think we've failed in a couple of ways and I want,

114
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.260
I want to admit that.
Okay.
Number one,

115
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.500
we haven't done enough education about what our roles are because a lot of

116
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:23.420
people violate our rules and they don't even know it.

117
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.250
Like some of the statistics that we've looked at,

118
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.040
like for a lot of first time users of the platform,

119
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.420
if they violate the rule once,

120
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.580
almost two thirds of them never violate the rules again.

121
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.370
So we're not talking about like a bunch of people accidentally.

122
00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:36.080
Like if they know what the rules are,

123
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.540
most people can avoid it in most people when they feel the sting of a violation,

124
00:06:40.541 --> 00:06:43.700
they go,
okay,
I don't want to lose my rights to post.
Exactly.
And they're,

125
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.431
and they're able to do it.

126
00:06:44.431 --> 00:06:47.610
So we have a lot of work to do on education so people really understand what the

127
00:06:47.611 --> 00:06:49.020
rules are in the first place.

128
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.500
The other thing we have to do to address these allegations that were doing this

129
00:06:52.501 --> 00:06:57.501
from a bias perspective is to be really clear about what types of behavior are

130
00:06:58.171 --> 00:06:59.970
caught by our rules and what types are not,

131
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.560
and to be transparent within the product.

132
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.120
So when a particular tweet is a found to be in violation of our rules being
very,

133
00:07:06.121 --> 00:07:06.721
very clear,

134
00:07:06.721 --> 00:07:09.930
like this weight was found to be in violation of this particular role and that's

135
00:07:09.931 --> 00:07:12.870
all work that we're doing because we think the combination of education and

136
00:07:12.871 --> 00:07:16.620
transparency is really important,
particularly for an open platform like Twitter.

137
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.100
It's,
it's just part of who we are and we have to build it into the product.

138
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.011
I appreciate that.

139
00:07:21.011 --> 00:07:24.850
Your particular thoughts though on those examples that he described when he

140
00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:28.060
talking about someone saying they should throw these children into a wood

141
00:07:28.061 --> 00:07:32.170
chipper versus Chuck Johnson saying he should take this guy,

142
00:07:32.171 --> 00:07:35.520
he wants to prepare a dossier to take this guy out or how do you say it?

143
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:35.810
I want to,

144
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.070
is that something like I'm going to take out deray Mckesson with he said I'm

145
00:07:39.071 --> 00:07:40.660
preparing to take out Derek,
something like that.

146
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.200
I can't preparing to take him out.

147
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.550
I can understand what it could be misconstrued as he was trying to assassinate

148
00:07:45.551 --> 00:07:46.181
him.
Right.
You could,

149
00:07:46.181 --> 00:07:48.790
you could misconstrue it that but not a direct threat but the other one's a

150
00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:53.050
direct threat.
One guy is banned for life.
The other guy is still still we can,

151
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.480
I'm happy to follow up.
I was,
you don't have all the Chuck Johnson.

152
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:56.021
It's not about,

153
00:07:56.021 --> 00:08:00.460
one thing is that it's about a pattern and practice of violating her holes and

154
00:08:00.461 --> 00:08:02.530
we,
we don't want to kick someone off for one thing,

155
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.080
but if there's a pattern in practice,
like there was from Milo,

156
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.620
we are going to have to take action at some point because we can't sit back and

157
00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:11.430
let people be abused and harassed and silenced on the platform.
