WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.750
Over there.
And the viewers don't know that at all,

2
00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:06.480
especially when you're a little boy watching it.
I mean,

3
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:09.060
the Saturday morning that you sick did on macho man,

4
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:13.170
Randy Savage affected him in entire generation in,

5
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:16.410
in time I've ever got.
I,
oh,
there's no doubt.
I mean,

6
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:21.411
it affected me so deeply as a kid to the ship is if I'm ever laying around with

7
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:25.220
a girl and I'm having a little problem in the woods,
key department,
you know,

8
00:00:25.221 --> 00:00:29.250
and it happens at 63.
Ah,
you put that on,
you know,
uh,

9
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.260
I put the video wall and instantly I'm her ass.
Really?
Oh brother.

10
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.890
That's hard,
right,
man.
Why?
Holy Shit watching.

11
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.380
I mean,
that was,

12
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.480
this was literally the ultimate bad guy putting a snake on a good guy and look

13
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:50.000
at the,
look on that kid's face in the corner.
That's the best part,

14
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.530
actually.

15
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.170
Somebody you're shoved the finger up his ass or that kid is gonna have a goddamn

16
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.300
heart attack,
but you have a heart rate monitor on him.
He beats per minute.

17
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.600
I had a conversation with one of my good friends,
Pete.
You know Pete,

18
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.460
when he saw this,
you had a good friend.
But yeah.
Quick question I want to ask,

19
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.670
but check out.
This is,
this is the kind of quality friend I have is a dealer.

20
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.200
When he saw this,
when I,
when he saw this as a kid,

21
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.620
all on the same day that I saw it,
he ran away from home.

22
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.430
It freaked him out so badly.
When you put this snake on Macho man,
his arm,

23
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.740
he packed it.
He didn't even have anywhere to go.

24
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.770
He ended up coming home later that night after it got cold,

25
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.530
he packed a bag and just left.
How old was he?
Oh Jeez.

26
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:38.140
I mean I got to it probably.
Probably,
probably I would guess and you know,

27
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.980
1112 something like that.
300 kids.

28
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:45.670
You're right that day because Jay Jay is a real story on this whole,
yeah,

29
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.680
I love that.
Yeah.
You want to hear this?
Just yes,
your job really went down.
Whew.

30
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.410
I've been waiting 30 years I've done with the python because that mother fucker

31
00:01:57.551 --> 00:01:59.550
tell you the truth of killing me,
you know,

32
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.970
weight a hundred pounds and then he would bite me and then it'd be 30 40

33
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:06.990
stitches.
That was 30 something stitches there on it.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh my God.

34
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.890
You got the vein

35
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.680
actually committed suicide that night.
Looking at that shit is cool in it.

36
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.680
I mean this must just handles it
better bite.

37
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.180
You're doing a great job.
Look at that thing sinking.

38
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:28.650
It's fucking teeth in to him.

39
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:31.620
And then at the end a little stream of blood comes through and that was the

40
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:36.510
final,
Oh my God,
I couldn't get any moose.

41
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.010
Oh my gosh.

42
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.410
Finally I had to prize mouth open to get him off.
And by the way,

43
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:46.800
this is on a Saturday morning,
so it's this,
you flip the channel.

44
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:50.130
It's a little old school cartoons that weren't even like entertaining.

45
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.121
You know what I mean?

46
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:55.140
And then there's this chaos on another channel and it's so obviously real.

47
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.100
Oh yeah.
It's so obviously terrified of snakes.

48
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.660
Well if he wasn't before the Piper pulled the gun on me one time over a snake.

49
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.370
Really?
Yeah.
What happened?

50
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.600
I snuck up behind him with a snake and he'd fucking heard me.
Jagan went,
yeah.

51
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:12.230
He goes,
I know what you're fucking doing it don't.

52
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.150
You don't even get his fucking pistol and polarized motherfucker.
I'll kill you.

53
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:19.600
I'm like,
okay.
When I get it,
guy was shaking,
man,

54
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.690
here's the story.
Here's the story.
I'm in the locker room behaving myself,

55
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.570
my Nigga soul,
I believe I was cleaning the wash cloth,
you know,

56
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.690
boards off and not making it nice for everybody and macho walks in.
He's like,

57
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.190
Oh really?
I'm going to do it to me to get some little,

58
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.570
it's the story fucking going around.
We're going to need to get done and do it.

59
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.110
Dude.
Sounds great.
And he's like,
we gotta take care of a little business.
Mercy.

60
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.260
What?
Who built the sneak?
Yeah.

61
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.680
Has he been fixed or not
fixed?

62
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.780
You mean poisonous?
He goes,
yeah,
that money be the fucking bro.
I'm like,

63
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.670
Randy,
of course he's been fixed.
He goes,

64
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.240
maybe as in maybe has seen stranger things.

65
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:17.440
Have happened in the WWE.

66
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.540
Somebody wants to macho man Chen,
intercontinental Livvy,
we champion shoot

67
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.110
poisonous snake on fucking rest is history was stage the chimp.

68
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.760
I'm like,
dude,
are you fucking cheek?
I'm just telling you this.

69
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.790
He has to blink you now.
Wow.
I'm like,

70
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.770
what?
He goes,
we got to go at it right now.
Me and you.

71
00:04:46.771 --> 00:04:49.360
And he's up in my fucking face with his fist and I'm fuck man.

72
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:50.680
What the fuck is wrong with you?

73
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.020
Don't bleed no fucking games jam.

74
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.980
So I got to stick out,
man.
I'm like,
motherfucker,

75
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.160
I'm like any special place you want it to bite me like my deck.
It's like,

76
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.050
where's good?
How about the leg?
I'm like,
fine.

77
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.380
So I got the Cobra out and I pulled my pant leg up,

78
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.220
Shimmin him a little bit and stuck my leg up here and he fucking bet me,

79
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.120
you know,
three,
four seconds.
Let's go.
March.
I was like,
no,
don't move.

80
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.950
Don't take no lecture.
Don't take

81
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.080
pictures.
Oh Shit.

82
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.220
Just fucking sit there.
I want to see the boys and go through your body.

83
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.720
Fricking kidding me.
Finally,
after about 10 minutes,

84
00:05:42.721 --> 00:05:45.850
he's like,
let me get,
you are going to be okay.
Oh sorry,

85
00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:46.990
I didn't fucking make you happy.

86
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.340
You know I'm to die if I know you want me to die.
You know he's like no.

87
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.600
But tonight brother,

88
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.130
you fever once the sneak.
Let's build me.

89
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.130
Bringing back may want you looking back up again because I want this idea to

90
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:08.390
fucking to make us both some fucking big money.
Yeah.
Can you dig it?
Dig It.

91
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:10.920
All right,
we're out of here.
Wow.

92
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.900
I think motherfucker you wait was parish man.

93
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.950
Cause it's one thing to get bit and the heat of a moment.

94
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.630
But to sit there and fucking cold have to hike or fucking pant legs up and let a

95
00:06:24.631 --> 00:06:27.350
fucking snake chew on you to make a motherfucker happy.
Come on,
give me a break.

96
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.821
We're asking a lot.

97
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:32.920
So if all those people were there were no or I wouldn't have felt any effects.

98
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.230
Right to sit there and in the locker room cold,

99
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.180
really no budge.
Bump another.
So I remember during the match and we did it.

100
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.010
Imagine,
minimum,
boom comes down,
time in the ropes.

101
00:06:45.011 --> 00:06:48.990
You get the snake out came this,
make sure he's little unhappy.

102
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.630
And so when I turned my back to macho man,

103
00:06:50.631 --> 00:06:54.260
he doesn't see me and I fucking paint brush the hell out of this fucking snake.

104
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.630
I pounded that motherfucker.

105
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.310
Why he didn't miss a second time is fucking mouthful.
Been brother.

106
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:06.050
And he's looking for anything to fucking bikers,
you know?
And I just went whoa.

107
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.810
And took him macho man and boom,

108
00:07:07.811 --> 00:07:11.000
he latched on and he's true and he's shown my match.
You're doing a great job.

109
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.980
Well,
Randy,
he looked so believable.
God Damn,
you know,
he's fucking nuts.

110
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.190
What did they do to the snake?
Remove this poison glands?

111
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.380
They moved the venom sac.
Yeah.
So there's no venom in its body damaged.

112
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.240
They even replace it with fucking stuff they use for bullying plants,
man.

113
00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:36.250
You know,
like silicone,
silicone.

114
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:41.000
Oh yeah.
Salient time.
Better Dude.
So,
uh,
they just cut them out.

115
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.640
It's just like an operation or she cut them out and fill them with silicone

116
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:48.170
mantra.
They can't regrow him.
Oh Wow.
Wow.
So they can't,

117
00:07:48.171 --> 00:07:52.580
otherwise it would regrown yeah.
Creepy fucking animal,
Huh?
Frightening.

118
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.320
Especially as a kid.
And that did shoot you guys up at big law,
Paul.
Oh yeah.

119
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:02.540
I couldn't imagine.
Here's this
91.
Wow.

120
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.740
Yeah.
It fucking rock her world,
Bro.
Yeah.
Yeah,

121
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:10.760
my little kid to watch a real snake,
an actual code couldn't get laid for months,

122
00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:14.450
man.
Really fucking station in your room.
You're not fucking lying to me.

123
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:16.370
I'll come on.
Wow,
please baby.

124
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.070
And you really did at the snake in your room.

125
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.400
Usually in the bathtub playing in the water.
Oh Wow.
You want,

126
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:31.450
it's like four o'clock in the morning for a fucking drug junkie to walk in the

127
00:08:31.551 --> 00:08:33.500
bathroom.
Now I'm paranoid as motherfucker anyway,

128
00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:34.670
cause I'm fucking all this shit.

129
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.610
And now I've got to look down in a 15 foot snake.

130
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:40.310
This fucking got his mouth open.
Looking at my fucking little Dick.

131
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:46.330
Are you serious?
I'm not pissing.
What do you mean I gotta take a shit?
Nah,

132
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.090
not anymore.
So I go in the other room,
I piss in a fucking bond.
Oops.

133
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:54.530
I missed what the fuck?
Just pissed off.
Wow.
Yeah.
Don't walk in my room.

134
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:59.450
Barefooting swish.
Swish.
What did you feed it?
I didn't,
he didn't,

135
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.310
he only out there for 10 days.
So,
so what?
How often they eat once ever?

136
00:09:04.311 --> 00:09:05.930
Six weeks or so.
Oh really?
