WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.730
The Joe Rogan Experience Qosmio tour again?
No,
no,

2
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:09.530
I think that's done.
It's over.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I think so.
Well,

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.240
I remember when he was touring,
promoters would not,

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.820
I think would think it's not worth the trouble really.
I think so.

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.310
Yeah.
I think Louisville to Oregon.
Do you think so?
Yeah,

6
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.770
I think so too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think he'll take like a year off.
Yeah.

7
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.830
And then he'll do some shows and people get mad and it'd be,
yeah.

8
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.740
And then like if you know,
the real thing is like the corporate side of it.

9
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.420
Like in other words,
a channel or network that would went to,

10
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:42.810
let's say host show the special,

11
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.730
but he has such a dedicated,

12
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.970
no one's website following is like what he ended up developing and he's sold,

13
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.390
chose and,
and made millions.
You know,

14
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:56.760
when people were doing the like download my special thing,

15
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.580
I think he could book a venue,

16
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.640
shoot something and go back to his $5 model and do really well.

17
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.710
No,
I'm sure he could and people would be really interested to see it.

18
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.940
Of course Netflix would have them on.
They still have his old stuff.
I want to be,

19
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.770
yeah.
I mean,
I,
yeah.

20
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.720
I was on a flight after right after all of it went down.
I watched his,

21
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:20.550
uh,
the special from DC,

22
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:24.530
which I thought was really interesting to watch it knowing the DC one was that,

23
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:26.940
is that the latest,
latest one,
2017,

24
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.530
but just to know that it was like right around the corner that he was gonna get

25
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:35.010
busted.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Beating off in front of people.
It's just,

26
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.850
it's a weird thing to get caught doing too.
Yeah.

27
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:40.650
I got to all the things that people have done that they got caught doing,

28
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.440
although rape accusations and all the horrible shit,

29
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:48.441
like his is the most pathetic and also kind of the most innocuous.

30
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.220
Yeah.
It's just humiliating.
Just beating off in front of people.
I know.

31
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.450
It's like his kink.
It's what he likes,
but it could be way worse,
you know?

32
00:01:57.451 --> 00:02:01.830
Like what,
what he actually did not saying it's a good thing to do to people.
No,

33
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:05.850
it's,
hey,
watch me beat off.
But I know a bunch of people,
he did it too,

34
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:07.810
apparently laughed.
Yeah,

35
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.860
quite a few comics that I've talked to that know people that he did it too.

36
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.700
Yeah.
I knew somebody.
They did too.
Yeah.
And when she think not happy,

37
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.990
um,
but like,
you know,
I dunno man,
it was like weird.

38
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.070
I knew it for a long time.
That story.
Yeah.
And I,
I mean,
I said it before.

39
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:32.441
I was like,
well,

40
00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:37.440
I mean I knew it and then like every other person I talked to you in comedy to

41
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:41.340
it and we were all like,
that's fucked up.
But it also,

42
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.350
I mean this doesn't excuse it at all either,

43
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.500
but there is something about something at least that as you know,

44
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.910
that something somebody did a while ago.
So it's like,
what am I supposed to,

45
00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:56.560
to bring this shit up to him,
you know,
like,
how do you know?
But,

46
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.740
but the other thing is how do you even know that they did it?

47
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.310
Because one of the things that happened during the whole like,

48
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.300
did he do it or do not do it thing before I came out was,
uh,

49
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.020
someone had told me that it was bullshit and that what he had done is take some

50
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:14.440
pictures with a female comedians with his dick out,

51
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:18.610
just being silly and stupid and like,
and then tell him,
please delete.

52
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:21.680
Those pictures were just having fun,
you know,
in trouble.
I mean,

53
00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:26.030
the story I heard was very specific.
Yeah.
And like,
you know,

54
00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:30.140
is basically one of the stories reported in the times and I was like,

55
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.760
I remember hearing that story and the person was not,
you know,

56
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.650
it was pretty upset about it.
And then a lot of people heard the story.
Yeah.

57
00:03:36.651 --> 00:03:38.480
And then,
I dunno,
you know,

58
00:03:38.481 --> 00:03:42.110
another year would go by two years and three years and you're like,
okay,

59
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.880
I mean that's bad.
But like as far as my role in it,
you know,

60
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.660
as somebody who knows the story now,

61
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.420
it was just one of those things where you'd be like,
yeah,
that's fucked up story.

62
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.350
You know?
I mean,
it's not someone that like,
Hey,
you know,
that guy,

63
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.550
he fucking punched someone 15 years ago.
It was a real asshole.
And you're like,

64
00:03:58.551 --> 00:04:02.630
that sucks,
you know?
But 15 years ago is a long time,
right?
I mean,
kind of.

65
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.980
It's like,
is there,
is there,
it's not to like minimize the wrong doing,

66
00:04:06.981 --> 00:04:11.981
but like I sent there some part of the conversation about how people mature and

67
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.260
become different people as they get older.

68
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.100
And I'm sure a lot of people that are in their fifties and sixties you go like,

69
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.440
you know who are not celebrities.
You'd be like,

70
00:04:21.441 --> 00:04:25.070
do you know that when this guy was 26 he did this fucking horrible,

71
00:04:25.071 --> 00:04:28.460
stupid thing or something?
You're like,
Jesus,
but you're like,
well,
you know,

72
00:04:28.461 --> 00:04:29.720
as long time ago now,
I mean,

73
00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:34.721
that was kind of at least that part of the conversation exists in this,

74
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.940
right?
It's like,
it's,
it,
it's something really bad and he's being punished.

75
00:04:37.941 --> 00:04:40.940
So that's,
we're not saying that it's,
it's definitely,

76
00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:45.350
it has not been excused because he's being punished,
but it's also old behavior.

77
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.770
Yeah.
Like that's the Dustin Hoffman thing.
Yeah.
Dustin Hoffman,

78
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.330
this is where it gets really strange.
A lot of his stuff was 30 years ago,

79
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.420
1985 and shit.

80
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.630
I think part of the difference too between the Hoffman stuff and Louis and maybe

81
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:05.850
everybody else is Louise admission.
Right?

82
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.740
That's very different because even like the stuff I heard with Hoffman,

83
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.660
he is like,
he's definitely trying to justify uh,

84
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.050
versions and the behavior and like that's what people did,
you know,

85
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.630
is that what he said?
Oh yeah.
He's like,
you know,
on the set,

86
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.310
like you try to like get,
you know,
you have to break the tension or there's,

87
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:27.810
there's a monotony to it.
And so people would have these conversations and say,

88
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.880
so it's not,
it's like he's trying to,

89
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.820
it appears that he's trying to be less accountable for what he said.

90
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.560
Whereas Louie was like,
these stories are true.
Right?
So it's,
I think all the,

91
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.210
those things end up affecting how your redemption goes because they're like,

92
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:46.540
somebody like,
I did this shit,
I was wrong.

93
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.520
And I think in this country,
if people love punishment,

94
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.590
like,
are you punished for the thing you did?

95
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.520
We hate like somebody getting away with something.
So part of him,

96
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:01.700
I think coming back,
we'll also be that people realize that he paid a price.

97
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.090
Right.
I mean he lost deals.
He lost shows,
lots of money.

98
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.910
Definitely lost a lot of fucking touring money.
Yeah.
It's that day.
Is it?

99
00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:13.850
Probably at least a $50 million day for him,
you know,
with everything together.

100
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:15.230
So this isn't that crazy.
Yeah.

101
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.200
I mean what a weird kink jerk off in front of people.
Yeah.

102
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.650
I wonder how you develop,
I mean I guess I can imagine how you develop it bit.

103
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.590
Do you think that you could even do that?
Like I was trying to think,

104
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:29.120
could I even ask them,
Hey,

105
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.770
do you mind if I jerk off in front of you and then just get hard and actually be

106
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.960
like,
well that's the thing.
I imagine he had to be a leaking.
Right.

107
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:38.720
But like before that like to come that fast,

108
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.130
it had to be something he's thinking about like all day,
you know,

109
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.470
and like hanging out and then like,
Hey,
do you want to hang out?
Like,

110
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:47.840
do you want to come back or whatever?
And like,

111
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:51.830
so as he's getting closer to doing it,
I'm sure it's,
it's,

112
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.240
it's the only fuel that's on his mind,
you know?
So it's like,
you asked me that,

113
00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:58.010
I'd be like,
well,
that's not my kink.
So you're like,
hey,

114
00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:02.120
could you go from fully flacid to come?
These people are like,
I don't think so,

115
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:05.630
man.
I don't think I could do that.
No.

116
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.650
Kinks are fucking weird.
Kinks are weird.

117
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.500
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
