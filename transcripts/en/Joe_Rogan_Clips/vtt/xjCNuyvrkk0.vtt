1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.080
I think you're right though in the generational fix to it.

2
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.170
I think that's true of a lot of the stuff that,
like I,
one of the,

3
00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.260
I get asked all the time,
school shootings,
right?
It's like the topic of the day.

4
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.410
I don't have a solution for it,
but I know it's not going to be overnight.

5
00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:15.190
It'll be generational in nature,
just like it crept in generational in nature.

6
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.170
I think a lot of these problems,

7
00:00:17.171 --> 00:00:21.280
people look for a light switch solution where the solution in and of itself is

8
00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:22.480
the exact opposite of that.

9
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.840
<v 1>Yeah,
I think you're right.
Um,
I don't see any solution to that either.</v>

10
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.130
And I think there's a lot of positions that people feel like they're supposed to

11
00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:32.260
take.
And if you're on the left,

12
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.950
the big position that you're supposed to take his gun control,

13
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.650
get rid of the guns,
the guns or the problem.

14
00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:42.340
Look at all these people shooting people with guns,
guns,
guns,
guns,

15
00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:44.920
and all the mass shootings.
What they have in common guns.

16
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.190
They all have guns in common and they want to take away guns.

17
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.530
And then there's the people on the right and lucky you're not going to,

18
00:00:50.531 --> 00:00:53.350
I've never done anything wrong with my gun.
You're not taking my fucking gun.

19
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.210
And then there's this fucking in stock unstoppable battle between these two

20
00:00:58.211 --> 00:01:01.550
sides and that there's a lot of factors like what,

21
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.580
what happens to a human that leads them to get to this state of mind where

22
00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:10.780
they're able to go into a school and shoot it up?
Like what is that?
What,
what,

23
00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:14.470
what?
What could possibly be going on?
How do we stop that from ever taking place?

24
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.160
The,
the,
the,
these people have to be in some sort of insane pain.

25
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.940
There has to be something unbelievably wrong with their life that they're

26
00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:25.390
capable of doing this.
How do we stop that?
How do we look at that?
It's like,

27
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.310
is this is our,
our global community?
If this is our national community,

28
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.160
how do we stop this from happening and our national community?

29
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.610
I don't know what the answer to that is.
I think there's an

30
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.800
<v 0>answer to stopping school shootings and not to over simplify anything.</v>

31
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.020
There's,
I would say there's a couple key issues.
One of them is location.

32
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:47.500
The other one is motivation.
You can solve the location issue.

33
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.360
Like if we as a country where it legitimately interested in stopping school

34
00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:56.130
shootings,
how many have ever occurred at a school where the president,

35
00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:59.650
his children go zero.
Why?

36
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.740
Because it's defended,
right?
They actually take a proactive approach to it.

37
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.920
They're going to have layers of security defense in depth.

38
00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:11.530
They're probably going to have somebody looking out the front door or a system

39
00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:15.910
looking out the front door controlled entry points,
uh,
entry and exit points.

40
00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:19.090
You're gonna have a metal detector.
You can have security staff onsite,
right?

41
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.410
So you can control the location aspect.
And I,
you know,
I go to a,

42
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.510
every time I met my kids' school,

43
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.840
or it unfortunately or fortunately every building I've ever been,

44
00:02:28.841 --> 00:02:31.720
and I'm viewing it from a pseudo tactical perspective at least.

45
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.720
So I'll go walk around my kids' school and there's issues that I see from a

46
00:02:37.151 --> 00:02:40.000
perspective of somebody who would want to exploit that from aggressors

47
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:41.590
perspective,
but they could all be solved.

48
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.970
But that doesn't solve the second aspect of that,
the motivation.

49
00:02:45.971 --> 00:02:50.971
Because I have absolutely no answer as to why a 17 year old kid with think that

50
00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:56.431
a solution of any kind would be to kill their classmates.

51
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.820
I don't understand that at all.
And although people,
it's funny,

52
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:04.900
like at every shooting,
surprisingly enough,
there's two things,

53
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.430
a gun and a shooter and vast majority of the time I hear people talking about

54
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:10.264
the gun.

55
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.570
I think we've got to balance that conversation and talk about the motivation.

56
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.530
<v 1>Yeah,
100% and also psych medications.
You know,</v>

57
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:20.610
you gotta talk about that the rise in psych medications,
Scott,

58
00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:22.900
to be correlated with the rise of school shootings.

59
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.960
I mean the amount of people that are on psych medication,

60
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:29.050
and I understand that correlation does not equal causation.

61
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.560
It's not necessarily that the medication's forcing them to do this,
but there's,

62
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.070
I don't know what study has been done on what is,

63
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.280
what is the effect and,

64
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.150
and is there some sort of a connection other than the fact that they're all on

65
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:43.810
medication?

66
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.570
Is there some sort of a connection between taking certain types of psych

67
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:51.571
medication with certain biological makeup that allows you to have this diffusion

68
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.210
of reality like this?
This is just some,

69
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.160
some weird thing happens to them where they are capable of horrific things,

70
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.400
horrific actions like how much of that is monkeying with the human neuro

71
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:04.600
chemistry?
I don't know.

72
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.100
<v 0>That's why I think the location portion,
it's not that it's an easy solution,</v>

73
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.470
but it's,
it is solvable

74
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.870
<v 1>but isn't the problem funding.
There's no money for to pay for teachers.</v>

75
00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:16.820
They don't have money to like secure schools.

76
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.140
<v 0>It depends on how serious we want to take it.
If,
if,</v>

77
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.790
if we really wanted to stop it.

78
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:24.160
What I'm saying is there are his ways that can stop it.

79
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:27.580
I'm not saying those ways are easy.
I'm not saying that those ways are cheap,

80
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.610
but there are concrete things just looking at a structure from being vulnerable

81
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:34.750
to an assault.
There are things that could be done,

82
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.590
but that doesn't solve the school shooting problem.
Right.

83
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.150
It changes the address because the individual that would want to go do that at a

84
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:46.690
school.
If you make a target hard,
that doesn't remove the motivation.

85
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:47.740
That's what I'm saying.
There's location,

86
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:51.310
motivation and obviously a lot of other factors.
The location one,

87
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.930
if you saw that,
you still got to talk about the shooter.
Right.
And I mean,

88
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.880
that's where I bumped my head up.
Again,
I don't,

89
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.780
I would actually like to see this country have a conversation instead of

90
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.460
entrenched positions,
either the left or the right.
Uh,
all guns should be bands.

91
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:11.380
Come get them with my,
your coat,
my cold,
dead hands,
uh,
which I don't,
uh,

92
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.780
again,
I find myself in the middle of that.

93
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:18.760
I don't agree with either of those positions because it's more nuanced than just

94
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.580
the gun and the shooter.
It's the combination of all those things,

95
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:24.430
but I don't even feel like we're having a conversation in this country.

96
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.270
I feel like a lot of people are talking.
I don't think anybody is listening.

97
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.150
And I,
you know,

98
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:34.600
I go to the schools in the neighborhood where,
you know,

99
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:38.590
where my kids go to school.
I don't see a single change that they have made.

100
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.630
<v 1>Yeah,
I think you're 100% correct.</v>

101
00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:46.170
And that there doesn't seem to be any real,

102
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.800
there's no real plans to stop this stuff.

103
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.250
And I don't think anybody has a real answer.

104
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.850
And that's one of the reasons why it's so confusing to people because you could

105
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.170
on it and roll it over in your head all day long.

106
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.430
And there's nothing that stands out as obvious.
Like,
Hey,
there's a fire.

107
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.520
Go pour water on it.
It's obvious there's no,
there's no solution.

108
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.110
<v 0>And the low hanging fruit is the metaphor for this school shootings would be,</v>

109
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.960
there's a gun,
go pour water on that.
Right,
right,
right.

110
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.140
But the more nuanced and complex problem is actually the human being behind it.

111
00:06:17.141 --> 00:06:19.180
And I see people,
they just,
well that's too difficult.

112
00:06:19.181 --> 00:06:22.510
So I'm gonna throw my hands up and give up.
Yeah.
I mean,
but also too,

113
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.710
I think it's important to point out that actually it's a,

114
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.010
thankfully it's incredibly rare that it actually happens.

115
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.910
And it's funny because you look at the stats and you start digging into where

116
00:06:33.911 --> 00:06:36.800
the stats come from and two groups of people and,

117
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.980
and I'm sure you see this across a variety of topics.

118
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:41.950
We'll take the same study and derived two different sets of numbers.

119
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.320
There's school shootings and then there's shootings that happen at schools and

120
00:06:47.321 --> 00:06:50.380
you can make one number look bigger and one number looks smaller.

121
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.170
Like if you wanted to include the number of people who commit suicide in a

122
00:06:53.171 --> 00:06:54.004
school parking lot,

123
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.240
which at a national level is considered a school shooting because it occurred at

124
00:06:58.241 --> 00:06:59.074
a school,

125
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.770
you can inflate and conflate the number of times and the frequency with which it

126
00:07:02.771 --> 00:07:04.780
happens.
If you strip that information out,

127
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.080
it gives you a much more accurate perspective of how often it's happening.

128
00:07:08.081 --> 00:07:08.441
Same thing,

129
00:07:08.441 --> 00:07:12.760
and when you remove suicides from gun violence and the total number of deaths,

130
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.170
so it,
but again,

131
00:07:14.171 --> 00:07:17.590
that takes a refined and nuanced person that's willing to actually look at it as

132
00:07:17.591 --> 00:07:20.140
opposed to just repeating what their bumper sticker says.

133
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.561
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

134
00:07:20.561 --> 00:07:25.150
I saw that when Ted Nugent debated Pierce Morgan on television and was talking

135
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:29.020
to him about gun violence and the actual numbers,
and he was saying,
well,
this is,

136
00:07:29.021 --> 00:07:32.230
these are the real statistics and this is why the numbers are so high.

137
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.960
How many of these,
when you're including gun violence,

138
00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:39.070
how many of these people are like criminals are being shot in the act by police

139
00:07:39.071 --> 00:07:42.340
officers?
How many of them are people defending their home from a break in?

140
00:07:42.341 --> 00:07:46.270
How many of them are suicides?
How man,
once you get through that,

141
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.300
you get to the end of it.
Then you get to gang violence.
How many,

142
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.700
how many of them are uh,
responsible?

143
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.530
How many deaths are attributed to gang violence?

144
00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:58.310
How many deaths are attributed to,
uh,
you know,
I mean there's,
there's a,

145
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.900
there's a lot of different factors.
Then you get to these mass shootings.
Yep.

146
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.430
So the,
the mass shootings,
it's it,
it's a relatively small percentage,

147
00:08:06.431 --> 00:08:09.000
but that doesn't give anybody any comfort for anybody that's suffered.

148
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.500
<v 0>Of course.
Yeah,
it does.
And it,
again,
it's,
it doesn't excuse it.</v>

149
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.840
It's just thankfully it happens infrequently.

150
00:08:17.841 --> 00:08:19.330
I wish the number was zero.
We're not at a,

151
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.480
and I think the answer to getting it to zero will be generational because it

152
00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:27.020
grew generationally.
Yeah.
I think it will go away generationally.

153
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.100
<v 1>But how does it go to w w what,</v>

154
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:34.580
what fundamental changes have to happen in the way human beings exist that we

155
00:08:37.021 --> 00:08:41.820
stop any,
anything that right now we're to all the different,
I mean,

156
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.130
it would be a terrible world if we said,
hey,

157
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.730
we're just going to have to accept the people are never going to evolve
socially,

158
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.030
emotionally,
whatever it is.

159
00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:55.440
It's causing people to lash out the way they do what,
I mean,

160
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.350
what a horrible world it would be if we say no,

161
00:08:58.351 --> 00:08:59.970
that people are just going to be like this forever.

162
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:05.100
We're not just flawed but flawed and ruthless and cruel and violent and awful.

163
00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:06.690
And that's just the way people are forever.

164
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.450
<v 0>I mean,
I think there's improvements you can make on both sides.
Right?</v>

165
00:09:10.451 --> 00:09:13.960
So there's a,
there's a gun in there,
there's a shooter.
There are,

166
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.870
I couldn't be a more vehement supporter of the second amendment.

167
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.670
Like I completely and utterly support it.
Uh,
but I'm anti irresponsibility.

168
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.240
Yeah.

169
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.240
And there's a lot of things that we could do as a nation that would improve

170
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.640
safety via responsibility.
I mean,
look at this,

171
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.210
the stats on the percentage of American gun owners that don't own a safe,

172
00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:39.360
it's over 50% which is speaks to access and what sucks about any improvements

173
00:09:41.351 --> 00:09:42.184
that we make.

174
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.310
I you'll never know about it because you're never going to know about the school

175
00:09:45.311 --> 00:09:47.170
shooting that you stopped.
Really.
You know what I mean?

176
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.540
It because he doesn't make the news,
but that doesn't mean I'm I,

177
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.820
my default position is we can do better.
There's ways that we could,

178
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.120
I think that the reasonable gun legislation that already exists,

179
00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.970
there's ways that we could improve communication.
Inner Agency,

180
00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.610
like the Aurora shooter as a perfect example,

181
00:10:03.611 --> 00:10:06.700
it took a pistol and killed five people the day he got fired and injured five

182
00:10:06.701 --> 00:10:10.150
police officers.
He shouldn't have had the gun and he was a convicted felon.

183
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:15.420
His felony did not show up when they had the a background check for his job,

184
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.560
but it did show up for the background check,

185
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.360
I believe for his concealed weapons permit,

186
00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.560
but oftentimes I see it where there's this disconnect between agencies not

187
00:10:23.561 --> 00:10:27.700
sharing information very much like the military civilian military
infrastructure.

188
00:10:27.701 --> 00:10:31.750
Prior to nine 11 agency didn't want to talk to the FBI and the NSA because

189
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:36.130
budget and relevancy and this is mine and that's yours and this is my rice boy.

190
00:10:36.131 --> 00:10:37.840
Get the fuck away from me.
I don't want to share information.

191
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.710
I think we could do better on the regulations that are in place.

192
00:10:41.711 --> 00:10:43.030
I'm not saying add anymore,

193
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.390
but maybe let's figure out a way where we could share information or at least

194
00:10:46.391 --> 00:10:49.900
make sure we're living up to the letter of the intent and the letter of the law

195
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.530
on that side of the house.
And then on the other side of the house,

196
00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:58.650
I you had a pin tweet for a long time and I'm going to totally murder this,

197
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.080
uh,
when it comes to exactly what it was,
but some of the longest we're not,

198
00:11:02.081 --> 00:11:04.150
we don't have a gun prices.
We have a mental health crisis.

199
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.320
<v 1>I say we have a mental health crisis.</v>

200
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.990
Disguises a gun crisis or a mental health problem,

201
00:11:08.991 --> 00:11:12.350
decides the gun problem and just like we can do better on the firearm

202
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.500
<v 0>side of the house,
we can do better on the mental health side of the house.</v>

203
00:11:15.501 --> 00:11:18.740
And I just see people throwing their hands up and attacking the low hanging

204
00:11:18.741 --> 00:11:22.820
fruit because I think the mental health side of the house is a more difficult

205
00:11:22.821 --> 00:11:24.560
issue than the firearm.

206
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.190
<v 1>I think it's the most difficult issue.
You know,
I think,
uh,</v>

207
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.260
everyone that I know,

208
00:11:30.261 --> 00:11:35.120
including myself has had bad moments in their life and has struggled.
And the,

209
00:11:35.121 --> 00:11:38.630
the struggle,
especially mental health struggle,

210
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:43.660
I'll struggle with depression or being unhappy or anger or any of the things

211
00:11:44.451 --> 00:11:47.600
that keep you off of a healthy baseline.
Those,
those,

212
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.690
those moments in life are,

213
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.460
they vary wildly in how people experience them,

214
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.520
what to what level people experience them,

215
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.670
what impact they have on them and whether or not there can recover from these

216
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:01.300
things.

217
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.600
And for some people they feel like there is no recovery and the only way out is

218
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:06.970
to just go out with a bang.
Like literally,

219
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:10.240
and this is a lot of what you're seeing in these school shootings as suicide by

220
00:12:10.241 --> 00:12:13.720
cop.
Yeah,
I mean this,
this is one of the things that people want.

221
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.800
They want to go out in a blaze of glory and what,

222
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.780
what the fuck is going on?

223
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:24.010
Where we let people get to that point without stepping in and trying to help.

224
00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:25.990
And do they have anybody that even notices,

225
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.110
do they have anyone around them that knows that,

226
00:12:28.111 --> 00:12:30.720
that this fucked up in this far gone?
You know,

227
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.280
I mean we all like to think that that could never happen to us.

228
00:12:33.281 --> 00:12:38.010
That we could never get to a point where we're so despondent and filled with

229
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.390
anger and hate and fear and,

230
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.750
and self loathing that we want to do something horrific.

231
00:12:43.751 --> 00:12:47.680
But every person who does something horrific is a human being.
Right.

232
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:50.980
And the difference between you and them might be genetic,

233
00:12:50.981 --> 00:12:53.800
it might be environmental,
it might be life experience,

234
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:58.780
but they are human being just like you and I and something horrifically went

235
00:12:58.781 --> 00:13:02.980
wrong in their life to the point where they are in this position where they show

236
00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:05.680
up at that,
that school shooting in Illinois just a couple of days ago.

237
00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:09.910
Some guy got fired.
Yup.
Went back to work and just shot everybody up.

238
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.360
Like what the fuck?
That guy worked there for 15 years.

239
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.310
Like what is it that it that gets once someone gets to a point where this is,

240
00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:22.300
this is what flashes in their mind is a solution.
Go back with a gun,

241
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.590
make everybody pay.

242
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:28.420
<v 0>I've felt it myself that feeling um,</v>

243
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.330
overseas when in loose close friends,

244
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.290
that first absolute feeling you have is an as a,

245
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.880
an anger that I don't have the vocabulary to describe an all you want to do is

246
00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:41.380
burn the world to the ground.

247
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:46.060
But it was fleeting and I didn't do it and I just don't know how we provide the

248
00:13:46.061 --> 00:13:49.630
barrier for people if they can.
And when it comes to mental health,

249
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:54.460
I mean somebody with more horsepower between the ears than me knit in the is

250
00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:56.620
going to need to solve that problem because I don't understand it.

251
00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:59.590
But I do understand that feeling.

252
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.550
But what I needed was time and I don't know how to provide that.
Well,

253
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.420
you also had

254
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.240
<v 1>character and discipline and a lot of things that many people lack in your</v>

255
00:14:11.091 --> 00:14:16.091
ability to mitigate these horrific feelings and this severe depression and

256
00:14:16.311 --> 00:14:20.930
anger.
Some people don't have those mental health tools.

257
00:14:20.931 --> 00:14:23.750
They don't have those tools.
I mean,
you were already a seal,
right?

258
00:14:23.751 --> 00:14:27.200
You're already a guy who's endured more than most human beings will ever in

259
00:14:27.201 --> 00:14:31.520
terms of physically and emotionally and how to get through that hump to become

260
00:14:31.521 --> 00:14:33.890
one of the elite operators in this country.

261
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.390
That just having that as a baseline,

262
00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.150
like having that as a you,
you,

263
00:14:41.151 --> 00:14:44.930
you have the toolset to endure more than most.

264
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.790
Some people are just not capable of handling any real adversity.

265
00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.990
Anything bad comes down the pipe for them.
They just fall apart.

266
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.530
And I think for many people,

267
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.520
there's a real extreme feeling of a lack of purpose in life.

268
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.960
There's an extreme feeling of a lack of a lack of meaning,

269
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.710
that nothing they do matters.
That they don't matter,

270
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.320
that no one cares about them,
whether they're or they're gone.

271
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:16.880
People either mock them or disregard them all together and they want people to

272
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:19.430
know who they are.
And that's one of the reasons why they do these things.

273
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.010
I can see that for sure.
But

274
00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.780
<v 0>again,
if I'm being objectively honest about myself,</v>

275
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.600
I did have those tools and

276
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.680
probably the only thing that prevented me from acting out in that moment is that

277
00:15:34.681 --> 00:15:38.400
I didn't have access to the individuals that I wanted to act out against.

278
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:39.980
<v 2>Okay.</v>

279
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.040
<v 0>And I mean,
it's like I said,
I understand it.</v>

280
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.130
I don't have a solution for it at all,
but I understand it.
