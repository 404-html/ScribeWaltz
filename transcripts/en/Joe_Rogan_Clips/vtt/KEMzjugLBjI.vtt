1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.400
Um,
so,
uh,
you know,

2
00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:07.180
I have to prepare more for podcasts and,
um,

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.840
I feel like I personally,
I mean,
it,
it's,

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.950
it's as much as out of concern from my guests as well.
Like I,
I just,
you know,

5
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:15.150
this is a high wire act,

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.720
but I want a net normally so that people feel free to be totally on guarded

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.720
because they know that if we have a spazz attack,
we can,
you know,
we can,
uh,

8
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.680
you know,
even uttering spazz attack,
we'll screw.
So some people's careers.
Right.

9
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:31.350
He actually had a conversation about a podcast that I talked to you about one of

10
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:35.310
your podcasts.
We said that you actually started it over,
you started at,

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.140
let's try this again.
Let's just start from scratch.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
I,
maybe,
I,

12
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.990
I think it would,
I don't think it would be sporting to,
um,

13
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.030
say which podcasts that was.
But yeah.

14
00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:49.860
So I had a podcast that went completely into the ditch for the first half hour.

15
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.060
I mean,
just brutal.
And I said,
listen,
there's a really,

16
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:58.230
there's a good conversation for us to have here and now I know how bad Lee this

17
00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:01.470
can go.
All right.
So like now I know just where the track is,

18
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.280
I have to struggle to keep the train on.
And so we're going to reboot,

19
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:07.830
we're going to start again and we'll see what happens.
And you know,

20
00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:09.000
the podcast was,

21
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.500
was not perfect and I got some criticism for it,

22
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.730
but people didn't understand that we were like,
you know,
w we had,
uh,
you know,

23
00:01:17.731 --> 00:01:22.050
we had,
I had,
I had seen the pit of alligators and didn't want to fall in like,

24
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.290
you know,
well,
it made more sense though when you told me that because I'm like,

25
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:25.561
okay,

26
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:30.090
it was heated before you even got to go because you'd already gone through a

27
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.890
half an hour of back and forth.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
I,

28
00:01:32.891 --> 00:01:36.960
I think people need to understand what it's like to do one of these things too

29
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.180
because uh,
you know,
you do it so often,
it becomes pretty,

30
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.820
you're so good at talking,

31
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.320
you're such a good orator and you're so articulate that it comes off smooth and

32
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:46.551
easy.

33
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:49.320
You're just having a conversation with someone but you're always considering the

34
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:52.740
fact that people are listening to this.
You're always saying,
how do I,

35
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.830
how do I get more out of him or her?

36
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.630
How do I take this in and how do I get this person to expand upon this?
How do I,

37
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:04.200
you know,
how do I make this something,
make something out of this?

38
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.190
This is one of the things that I felt with Jack because he was talking in this

39
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:12.180
way and we're,
we're really working hard on fixing all these issues.
I'm like,

40
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:16.800
oh Jesus,
I got to change my gears here and try to figure out,

41
00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:21.510
cause like it's almost like we'd have to restart again every time a question

42
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:26.460
would be answered.
He would stop talking and I'd go okay to next to so long.

43
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:27.550
You forgot what you asked.
Well,

44
00:02:27.551 --> 00:02:32.540
it's almost like I have to restart the momentum of it,
but,
well,
again,
I'm,

45
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:35.200
I'm totally,
I'm that kind of speaker,
so,
you know,
I,

46
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.940
that wasn't a problem and I didn't know what he talked like I'd never heard him

47
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:43.320
talk ever.
So hearing him talk there and in talking to him live,
you know,

48
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:46.560
I mean some people are fucking effortless.
Some people,

49
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:50.670
like Ilan took a while,
like we had to start drinking now.
That was brutal.

50
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.920
But so like,
but that,
I mean,

51
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:55.840
you know how much I tried to micromanage that behind the scenes,
right?

52
00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.340
Like I was all in your grill.
I'm trying to figure that out.
And you know,

53
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.970
you guys basically broke all the rules.
I,
I have thought I laid down a penny.

54
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.700
Ilan did it,
cause he'll,
Ilan tweeted,

55
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.190
y'all be on Joe's podcast Thursday night at nine o'clock.

56
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.500
But you know,
I mean,
I,
I didn't want you guys to go live.
I wanted,

57
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.280
I wanted you to both have a chance to say,
wait a minute.
This is smoking a blunt.

58
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:22.210
Really the thing we want to be doing here.
Uh,
so you know,

59
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.300
you didn't take my advice and it was what it was when we were drunk.

60
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:27.280
By the time the weed came out,
that was what's,

61
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.240
what's interesting to me is we were drinking from the beginning of the podcast,

62
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:32.170
we started drinking whiskey.

63
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.340
We both had two or three glasses of whiskey right before the weed came out.

64
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.000
Nobody cared.
The fact that the CEO of Tesla was trunk,
right?

65
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:42.160
Like no one cared about that.
I mean it wasn't drunk,

66
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:44.860
but he shouldn't have been driving.
I don't know if that was obvious.

67
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.110
I don't know if they saw that you were drinking.

68
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.570
It was obvious in the beginning and pouring the whiskey.

69
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.440
I mean it was on the table.
We had ice.
We're clinking glasses.
Salute.

70
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.850
I mean it was very obvious.

71
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.770
I mean the problem for me there with that podcast frankly was that I feel like

72
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:04.771
you both got unlucky with w just where he was in his life at that moment.

73
00:04:05.001 --> 00:04:08.770
And because it was like,
yeah.
Cause.
So w what that podcast showcased,

74
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:11.200
at least for the first,
I don't know,

75
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:16.150
90 minutes was just how many user interface problems you could have with Ilan.

76
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.660
Right.
Like he did,
he did.
He just showed up as kind of fairly weird.
Right.

77
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.050
He's not,
he's not always like that by any stretch.
I mean,

78
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:27.730
he can give a very loose interview and you,
but you were working,

79
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.360
I mean it was just absolutely heroic work trying to keep that conversation

80
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.890
happening,
you know,
in the beginning.
But once we got loose,
yeah.
But it was still,

81
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:39.600
it's like,
you know,
he was just in a space that he,

82
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.590
he was so massively stressed and so overworked and just,
I mean,
he had,

83
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.870
you know,
fires everywhere that had to be put out.
And,
um,
so I just felt,

84
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:51.550
you know,
as a friend,
I just felt like,
okay,

85
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:54.940
this is sort of the wrong time to be doing this and this is,
you know,

86
00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.070
and so I just felt,
you know,
it just felt unlucky to me.
So,
um,
because he's,

87
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.530
uh,
again,
I,
I,
you know,
I see him in,
in many other moments and he can be,

88
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.923
um,

89
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.090
[inaudible] that was out of those actually a circumstance where I was looking at

90
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:12.600
the comments.
Right.
You know,
and,
and I was saying,
okay,
this is these,

91
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.650
these are people who are basically reading him as somebody who is much stranger

92
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:22.700
than in fact he,
he ever is.
And I could see why they were doing that because he,

93
00:05:22.701 --> 00:05:25.900
the guy,
he just seemed in a very stressed space in his life.
Well,

94
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:26.561
it was interesting.

95
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:29.830
He was very different when you first got here versus when the Mike came on.

96
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.870
Right.
Right.
When he first got here,

97
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.230
he pulls out the fucking blow torch and starts shooting this flame thrower in

98
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:40.990
the middle of the hallway and we're laughing and I'm like,
he's going to be easy.

99
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:45.910
This is great.
And then we sat down and then death right off the bat.
And,
um,

100
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.580
I'm just trying to massage it and get 'em get 'em get 'em going.
Although,
yeah.
