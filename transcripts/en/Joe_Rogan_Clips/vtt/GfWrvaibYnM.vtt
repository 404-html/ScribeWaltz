WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.010
Thanks man.
Thanks for doing this.
Thanks for coming in 100% man.
Uh,

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.790
people don't know the story.
We'll give them the brief synopsis.

3
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:09.450
I found out about your story online because there was this viral thing that was

4
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:14.280
going on about a chef who was getting protested by a bunch of animal rights

5
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:19.281
activists and Vegans who decided to camp out in front of your business and try

6
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:23.430
to the restaurant called Antler and Toronto try to,

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.440
I don't know what the fuck they were trying to do,

8
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.070
but you decided to butcher uh,

9
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.580
a leg of deer in front of them and it became this horrific thing.

10
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:38.460
Like how could you do that and a place that serves meat.

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.610
How could you prepare the meat right in front of them?

12
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.770
Like how did this all get started?

13
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.600
How did it become such a crazy viral story and why?

14
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.710
Why were they mad at you when there's a million other restaurants around you?

15
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.070
All right,
so it started in about December.

16
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.300
A boot include number one,
the Canadian,

17
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.880
the crazy Canadian.
Besides being on ice,

18
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.050
that's why it went viral cause I wasn't being nice.

19
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:10.130
I wasn't the stereotypical Canadian.
No.
Well you weren't even being mean.

20
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:12.240
You're just doing your job,
doing my thing.

21
00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:16.630
So they started in December and they really,
this right in front of your face.

22
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.670
They really got pissed off with our,
we have a little chalkboard sign out front.

23
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.330
Um,
I'll give you the car.
We have a 45 seat restaurant,
so we're a small,
uh,

24
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.850
have one business partner who's a my best friend and family friend.
And um,

25
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.750
we had a little chalkboard sign out front that said Venison is the new Kale and

26
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.380
you know,
we get cute with our sign.
We,

27
00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:38.790
we tease other restaurants around us like we have fun with the sign and it's
fun.

28
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.610
And uh,

29
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.620
the cyclist Vegan rode by and took huge offense to our sign and all of a sudden

30
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:50.040
one day these protesters just showed up.
So,
um,

31
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.870
originally I was just kind of frustrated because they're totally misguided

32
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.070
because,
um,
we take a lot of pride in where our food comes from.

33
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.740
We have Vegan and vegetarian dishes on the menu.
Uh,
and I,

34
00:02:02.741 --> 00:02:05.520
I really respect that type of diet.

35
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.170
So we were just totally floored with why this was happening.
And,
um,

36
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.850
so this started going,

37
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.800
they'd started come every week and they went from like two or three people being

38
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.450
kind of peaceful to being like 10,
15 people,
not so peaceful.
So,

39
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.540
uh,
it's when it turned not so peaceful.
They were shouting at our,

40
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:29.070
at our guests and shouting in our door and really trying to harm our business.

41
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:33.000
That,
uh,
I just kind of got fed up.
Last resort went down,

42
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:35.540
we get a hold dear a couple of times a month and we,

43
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.540
we butchered ourselves and I just said,
screw it.
Screw it.
I'm like,

44
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.400
I'm going to get these people to get out of here.

45
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.710
So I thought that that would make them go away.

46
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.740
How did you think that was going to make them go away and not escalate it?
Uh,

47
00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:53.000
I dunno,
I was,
it was just totally like last resort,
a totally fed up.

48
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.000
I wanted to defend myself,
defend our customers.
You know,

49
00:02:56.001 --> 00:03:00.250
you could see people walking in visibly upset.
Um,
you know,

50
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:01.930
they're being shouted at being screamed at,

51
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:05.230
called a murderer as they're walking in for dinner.
Like you're going on a date,

52
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:09.150
you want to have this time and then people are screaming at you,
uh,
you know,

53
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.720
just for eating.
So,
uh,
I was just fed up and I just kinda thought like,
you know,

54
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.880
buzz off and why?

55
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.410
So just one sign once I sitting is the new Kale one sign set this whole thing

56
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:26.530
off.
Yeah.
And you're surrounded by restaurants.
I mean,

57
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:29.170
I know where you are.
So,
so we're surrounded by restaurants.

58
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.220
There's an actual butcher shop across the street and if you go in,

59
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.790
there's like whole cattle hanging that's okay.
And their butcher shop,

60
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.320
you're a problem with your comparison to Kale.

61
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:41.300
You attack their sacred Hale God,

62
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.460
we're promoting a meat.
I Dunno.
That's totally bizarre.

63
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.970
Cause you were promoting it.
We were promoting it or,
yeah.

64
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.290
So it just didn't promote anything and they were allowed to cycle by and dream

65
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:57.880
of Broccoli without interference.
Yeah.
Man,

66
00:03:57.881 --> 00:03:59.740
I have no idea.
It's totally bizarre.
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:04.360
How many times did they protest you?
Um,
I think it's about eight now.
Eight.

68
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:08.140
They're coming weekly.
They still do.
They still do.
There's one this Friday.
Oh,

69
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:11.800
Jesus.
So they organize,
they organize them.
There's like Facebook groups,

70
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.560
there's a,
they're basically giving us an ultimatum.

71
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:19.530
We have to put their slogan in our window and they'll go away.
But yeah.

72
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.810
What's their slogan?
Um,
there's,

73
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.320
there's like,
I can't remember it word for word,
but it's,
you know,

74
00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:32.830
like killing animals is wrong and they have feelings while,
yeah.

75
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.230
Do you have to put that in your window?
We don't.
We're not going to,

76
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.240
there's no way.
Absolutely.
That's what they want.
Yeah.
So it's like eco terrorism,

77
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:44.410
extortion,
wherever you want to call it.
Wow.
Well,
the part,

78
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.660
the part of this that drives you the most crazy is the fact that you are

79
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:53.830
surrounded by restaurant.
We're surrounded by restaurants.
You're surrounded by,

80
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:55.810
like you said,
your cross street from a butcher shop,

81
00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.100
97% of the people in the world eat meat.

82
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.770
It's something,
something crazy like that.
I mean,

83
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.860
I'm sure everyone has really been pulled.
I'm sure it's not that accurate,

84
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.760
but it's somewhere between 95 and 97.
It's big.
It's big.

85
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.540
And I think we know we're an easy target.
You know,
her name is antler.

86
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.290
We were,
I think they're mad because,
um,
you know,
their,

87
00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:22.870
their thing is that we're promoting ethical farming and their beliefs is there

88
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:27.850
is no such thing as that ethical farming that all meat is murder.
And um,

89
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.460
you know,
if you look up murder in the dictionary,
it has to do with humans.

90
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.610
You know,
it has nothing to do with animals.
And um,

91
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.240
there is such a thing as ethical farming and sustainable farming and we work

92
00:05:37.241 --> 00:05:41.170
really hard to make sure that where we get our meat from,
his,
uh,

93
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.440
from the best possible place we can.
And it's local.

94
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:47.180
So it's supporting our local farmers that are,
you know,

95
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.370
within hours of our restaurant.
Now when you say that they started out nice,

96
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.270
like how many people were there in the beginning?
Two,
three,
four.

97
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.990
And then they weren't,
they had signs and they were just kind of,
you know,

98
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.820
promoting their message,
but they weren't really yelling and screaming.

99
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:05.850
And what escalated it.
Um,
so we would call the police.
We,

100
00:06:05.851 --> 00:06:08.120
we kind of got wind of it on their Facebook groups,

101
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:10.720
so we would call the police and have the police there to make sure everyone's

102
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.390
safe.
Because one thing like customers are scared,
our staff are scared.

103
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:18.350
Like no one's dealt with this before.
I've never dealt with this before.
Um,

104
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.650
so we would have the police there,
you know,
they were,
the police were amazing.
Um,

105
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.620
and then,
you know,
one time we kind of,
okay,
let's not call the police.

106
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:30.580
Let's see what happens.
Maybe it'll just,
they'll go away.
And uh,

107
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.620
so then like a megaphone came out,
uh,

108
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:36.770
our neighbors were coming down and getting in fights with them and it was,

109
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.170
it was ugly.
So we called the police to come and choose cry.
Keep the peace.
Yeah.

110
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.810
A megaphone.
Yeah.

111
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.270
Part of the problem with these kinds of things is it becomes a contest.

112
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.050
It becomes a battle,
you know,
trying to see who's going to win.

113
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.020
And they're absolutely on a team.
I mean this,

114
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.770
that's one of the things that happens with veganism.

115
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.960
And I think it happens with hunters too.
Excuse me.
People become very tribal,

116
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.250
you know,
and you know,
it's us versus them and they want to win.

117
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.000
And then it becomes this thing where,
you know,
look,

118
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.210
the reality is a lot of people are idiots and they don't have a lot going on in

119
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:17.030
their life.

120
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.050
And so when something comes up where it becomes a primary focus of their life,

121
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.280
one restaurant is a logical as it might be that becomes a battleground.

122
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.980
And it's an ideological battle ground for,
you know,

123
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:32.630
don't eat meat ever versus sustainable farming.

124
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.470
You know this,
look,
I'm sure I know you're a hunter.

125
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.620
I'm sure you feel a certain amount of remorse when an animal dies 100%.

126
00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:42.770
And you know,

127
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:47.770
that's a big part of sort of my beliefs in my philosophy and why I'm working on

128
00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:52.340
this cookbook right now is because,
uh,
I think that,
you know,
if you do eat meat,

129
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.620
you should be able to kill an animal and experienced that.

130
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:59.300
And I think that if people were to actually kill an animal,
they would see,

131
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.770
you know,
what goes into that.

132
00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:03.890
And I don't think people would consume as much mean and I don't think people

133
00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:08.000
would definitely,
you know,
they certainly wouldn't waste as much meat as they do.

134
00:08:08.001 --> 00:08:12.350
And it's,
it's just really upsetting and I think it's totally misguided.
You know,

135
00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:16.310
why we were targeted.
Well,
I mean,
like I said,

136
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:20.810
I think it just becomes a game.
Yeah.
It becomes a,
the big tribal game,
you know,

137
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.733
there's,

138
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:26.390
there's a real argument are real argument that I support against factory farming

139
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.520
and factory farming is the way most people are getting their meat in terms of

140
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:36.380
like,
in terms of like cheeseburgers and fast food and stuff along those lines.

141
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.500
I mean,
you're not getting it from the most ethical sources.
It's just,

142
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.370
it's not financially sustainable to do it that way.

143
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.390
Everything would cost more money.
Yeah.
And,
uh,

144
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.930
that's a real problem that we as a society,
it's not obviously not you or I,

145
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:52.550
that it was set up the system,

146
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.460
but that this system is a system that we find ourselves a part of.

147
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.570
It's a real problem.
I've removed myself from it for the most part,

148
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.710
but occasionally I'm on the road and I'm hungry and you know,
I'll eat some meat.

149
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.820
That's just whatever.
Totally.
It's,
it's a necessary evil,
you know,

150
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.240
in sort of sorts.

151
00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.440
It's not really necessary at all that maybe that's the wrong way to describe it,

152
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:16.000
but it's how the system's been set up and it's,

153
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.710
it's actually why I started hunting and doing what I do because I watched these

154
00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:23.730
documentaries like food inc and these things that kind of shine a light on,

155
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.240
you know,
the system and how this stuff is actually being produced.

156
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:29.910
And it's horrible.
It's a,
it's terrible.
He is.
Yeah.

157
00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:32.790
And I think that's the real number one problem and you know,

158
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:36.360
and this Vegan activist message to go after,
you know,

159
00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:40.080
these types of farming,
you know,
we support as well and we agree with.

160
00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:44.760
So the fact that we were targeted for this,
um,
was really,
really frustrating.
