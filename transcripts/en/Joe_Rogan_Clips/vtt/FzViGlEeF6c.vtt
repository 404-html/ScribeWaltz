WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.970
From the store.
Yeah.
No,
not a charity.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.470
You're donating to the charity of the store.
Yeah.
I don't care.
I don't care.
Yeah.

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.060
Yeah.
That's good.
Good.
Good donation.
Yeah,

4
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:15.750
that's a,
a place is a fascinating place really.

5
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:18.400
I was gone for seven years and you know,

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.320
I've been back for four now and it's,
uh,

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.340
it is,
uh,
I love the original room.
Oh,
it's incredible.

8
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:30.660
It's the room that's got it going.
The main wildlife,
all three.
I don't,

9
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:34.860
they're all different.
The belly rooms.
Okay.
And the main room,
Eric,
by the way,

10
00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:37.800
the main room performing in the main room does not bother me.

11
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.260
I hate the green room.
Really hate it.

12
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.690
Why the cocaine piano in the middle of the room and the best piano.
Yeah.

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.300
The point being is most of those people,
I don't want to see.
Oh,

14
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:52.170
hey around back there.
Yeah.
They just,
I know it was just such a negative vibe.

15
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.060
I think that there's a lot of comedians that play there that are a big bowl of

16
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:01.280
dead weight.
Wow.
Yeah.
Wow.
But there's a lot on the names,
but by,
by,

17
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.210
there's a lot that are joyful and great and I dig and I like watching and my

18
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:11.040
favorite thing to do is laugh at my fellow Comedians,
but on the flip side,

19
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.390
some people just,
man,
they're there.
Their presence just depresses me.

20
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.780
Interesting.
Yeah.
I don't feel that.
Okay.

21
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.120
Maybe do an impression of

22
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.130
just mimed my,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

23
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.510
no,
but some really I think,
yeah,
because you know the thing,

24
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:37.980
when I started in comedy,
which is 82 working through comedians,
really,

25
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:42.600
we're a group that stuck together.
You don't think that's the case now?
No.

26
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.000
I think that risk,
I think for the past,

27
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.360
I think it started changing in late nineties two thousands to where it was every

28
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:54.810
man for himself and a lot of people,

29
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:59.490
it wasn't like you're part of this fraternity.
It was like,
fuck you,

30
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:00.810
I'm going to do this.
You know?

31
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.520
My thing with competition is I go do your thing.

32
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:09.060
If the audience digs you more,
great.
If I'm auditioning and you're auditioning,

33
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:11.430
go beat me in the room.
I don't give a crap,

34
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.190
but there's such a competitiveness.

35
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.700
And I know that's part of why Eddie doesn't do spots because Eddie Murphy,

36
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.620
Eddie Murphy B.
Because when I work with them,
I would say,
why don't you go,

37
00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:28.290
he'd go,
he'd say the the looks that I get and the vibe that I get from comics,

38
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.320
it's not pleasant.
And I go,
I know exactly what he was talking about.

39
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.820
That's so weird.

40
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.850
I have the exact opposite feeling comedy now and about,

41
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:42.120
it's a particular like the store and like the comradery of that place.
I don't,

42
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:45.000
I don't get it by the way.
I dig a lot of people there,

43
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.010
but the people who I dig know I dig them right and I and the other one,

44
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.730
so I don't take,
don't know anything.

45
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.220
It's not like I spent time riding that horse,

46
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.380
but there's lots of guys and gals that are great.
But yeah,

47
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.550
so plenty of them that like please step away.

48
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.730
I was just having a conversation about this with a friend of mine recently who

49
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:05.830
was living for a while and a place that he hated.

50
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.850
And he was saying that if you're in a place where everyone's negative,

51
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.570
you really kind of forget that people can be positive without a doubt.
Yeah.

52
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:18.340
So why should I leave the comedy store and at least half of the Times I play,

53
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:23.000
they're leaving.
They're driving home feeling like not positive.
That's so weird.

54
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.170
By the way.
I sometimes now arrange it.

55
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:31.171
The only set that I do at the comedy store now is I sometimes will close the

56
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:36.280
seven o'clock original room show.
Uh,
cause there's no one after me.

57
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:38.770
So if I'm five minutes long,
no one's giving you crap.

58
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.490
And they've already seen the whole show.
There's no it just,

59
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.640
and I can do that zip in,
do it and get the hell out.

60
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.740
I'll do a benefit in the,
in the main room or like I did.
Uh,

61
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.650
what did Tony Show?
Right.
Kill Tony.
Yeah.
We're gonna bring you into the fold.

62
00:03:55.651 --> 00:04:00.420
Jeff Garlin bring wedding to the phone into the fold of the nice pieces fold.

63
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.820
By the way.
I know the Nice,
we have nice conversations with him,

64
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:08.080
but the other people are always there hovering over us.

65
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.430
I don't like all good.
I don't like a hover over is over.

66
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.940
And that is brutal when you're having a good time.
If you're not into a group,

67
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:18.700
if your group is not about making people,
uh,
like,

68
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:21.170
I don't care whether your political,
social,

69
00:04:21.171 --> 00:04:24.460
w w how you do your comedy.

70
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.880
But if your ultimate goal isn't to bring joy into peoples lives,

71
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.210
what's the purpose?
If it's not about the lapse and joy.

72
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.330
And so I find,
here's the thing,

73
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:42.070
I don't dig Lottie ego running around the store when I'm there.

74
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.920
And most of the people I don't like have the biggest egos.

75
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.970
Do you think that the most common you because you're a very accomplished guy,

76
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:51.380
so maybe that's why you're getting that weird vibe capable.

77
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.640
I've been told that before,
but if I thought that that would be weird.
So I don't,

78
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.380
I don't know.
Maybe.
Well that's cause you know,
there's a great line,
I'm not an,

79
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.400
I'm not an alcoholic,
but I do know this line from the program,

80
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:08.260
which is what you think of me is none of my business,
which I love.

81
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.480
That's a great perspective.
Great perspective.

82
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:13.090
So what they think of me is none of my business,

83
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.660
I just know what they're putting out there.
That's all.
Yeah.

84
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:18.850
I think sometimes people will look at you and go,

85
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:23.020
well here's a guy who has been on some of the all time greatest television shows

86
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:26.260
ever.
You know,
you're a god that's got a massive,

87
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.650
like your,
your,
your resume,

88
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:34.060
your accomplishments as a comic and performers.
It's very enviable.

89
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.270
So maybe perhaps a set like this myself as a generous guy on every level.

90
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.520
I liked being generous and I like helping comics,
you know,
sticking my hand out,

91
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:46.660
doing what I can to help.

92
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.930
So I don't feel that I put anything that they should be fearful of out.

93
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.760
No,
but I think it's their own issue.
I mean,
I remember when I was,
yes,

94
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:57.740
when I was starting out,

95
00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:00.440
I would get real uncomfortable when I was around really famous people.

96
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.950
I'd be like,
wow,
this feels weird to be around this guy in real life.

97
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.720
I mean I get that.
That can be,
but generally you are.
You've always been very,

98
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.590
very friendly.
I like to be a warm,

99
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.840
thoughtful person who most of the time prefers to stay at home,
go out.

100
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.620
If I'm gonna go to the farmer's market,
if I'm going to go to the comedy store,

101
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.300
I'm prepared to talk to people,
take pictures of people,
be warm to people,

102
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.500
engage with people.
Cause if I don't want that,
I stay home.
Right.

103
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.490
And so if I'm in a negative,
bad mood,
um,

104
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.170
I really will go do my setting,
get out.
But that doesn't happen very often,

105
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.360
but I'll stay home.
Yeah.
That's why you need that downtime,
right?
Yeah.

106
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.440
Cause you gotta you gotta be able to recharge.
Gotta be able to recharge.

107
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.490
And I never,
I used to not allow myself that I used to be worked so hard.

108
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.450
I was reading this article yesterday about Tom Cruise and about Tom Cruise's

109
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:58.070
life being very strict.
Jesus Christ.
Jeff Garland has going on with your phone.

110
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.260
What was that?
My brother Ringer.
What does that,

111
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.830
it's a theme to a man and a woman,
but a DA,

112
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.650
da Da da Da da Da da Da da.
Do,
do,
do.
No,

113
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.570
and a man and a woman is,
I thought that it's a French movie.
She's.
