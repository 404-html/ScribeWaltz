00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.300
I get a message from a friend of mine who says that while he was listening to

2
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:06.720
the show,

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.050
we were talking about something and then the ads for that thing started showing

4
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:17.670
up.
Yeah.
Oh God.
It's a,
it's Fong from my plastic cell.

5
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.570
He said you guys were talking about slouching with the avant today and this

6
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:24.630
popped up on his feet just now.
I never googled it before.

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.530
And it's some fucking alarm that goes off.
Like when you slouch forward,

8
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.940
have you seen us things?
You glue them on you.

9
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:31.770
I've been getting an ad for that too.
Oh,

10
00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:34.530
you have some IP is random coincidence could be that.

11
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:39.450
Or it could be targeting Joe Rogan listeners do the way it works.

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.840
So they found out that we were listening to,
they could just be going,

13
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:43.770
I mean maybe that,

14
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:46.770
but like there's a large audience here so they could just be going after like,

15
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.470
oh right.
But do you think like with Adam Green,

16
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:52.170
she said the other day that that's happening again,
talking about,

17
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:55.620
he was talking about Toyota trucks and then all of a sudden is Google ads

18
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.300
started showing up.
Toyota Tacomas and he and he was like,
dude,
he goes,

19
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:02.850
they're listening and the robots are listening.
So one's listed,

20
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:05.460
but they're also looking for like key terms and stuff like that.

21
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.660
But they're listening to your phone as you're having a conversation you think?

22
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.250
Yes,
I have a few instances.
I took screenshots because I was,
it was happening.

23
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:17.610
It happened three,
three consecutive weeks.
I touched something.

24
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.380
I literally held the object in my hand and within 12 hours I was getting an ad

25
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:26.360
for it.
Maybe your magic bro.
It's very strange.
One of them I have with list,

26
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.020
they're so weird.
It was like,
how the fuck am I getting an ad for this thing now?

27
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.810
I've never even seen this.
I've never talked about it to anybody.

28
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:36.090
I didn't tell anybody I was holding it.
Yeah,
you got to look for it.

29
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.800
Always be careful of like this idea that,

30
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.740
you know,
because sometimes things are just a coincidence.

31
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.130
And this idea that there's some grand conspiracy when it could be easily

32
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:51.370
explained by coincidence,
but the thing that Adam said,
he said it,
he goes,
man,

33
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.980
I never fucking Google Toyota trucks.
Is that a good,
uh,

34
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.950
I was trying to get that really not bad.
Not that good.
A little British.
Hey Mike.

35
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.770
Um,
but he was saying that,
uh,

36
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.010
they start popping up right after the podcast immediately.

37
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.870
So if that's the case,

38
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:10.740
they had to be listening to his podcast or they are listed one of them's list

39
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.550
because it's a,
you have a large audience,
someone from there's listen to it live.

40
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.050
Right.
And then they're just like,
dude,
they launched those at yeah,

41
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:24.030
but it has to get on his Google feed.
Yeah.

42
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.350
You think they spoil more fucking crime and stuff if they're listening?
Nah,

43
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.390
don't make money spoiling crime,
Bro.
I'm like,
you make money selling trucks.

44
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.730
I don't know.
I mean,
I,

45
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.460
I feel like for sure when I Google something and starts popping up,
we know that.

46
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:44.400
But that seems normal.
Dude,
if you call my phone right now,

47
00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:45.990
because I've been looking at dodge vipers,

48
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.620
it anything I click on dodge vipers pop up even on ads on Instagram.
Real.
Yeah.

49
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.460
They just want to,
they're just trying to get you,
they like,

50
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:57.990
when I look at houses in certain markets pop up.
It's weird.

51
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.920
They know.
They know.
Some mother fuckers look at and spend some money.
Yeah.
