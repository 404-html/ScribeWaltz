00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.040
The joe rogan experience we talked about next week.

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.010
Me going back there and shooting bows with him.
Yep.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.690
And talking just about whatever,
you know,
just kind of helmet once he is form.

4
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.910
That's right.
So,
uh,
we're trying to make that happen and,
uh,
I just,
you know,

5
00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:20.010
like I said,
if you have somebody's ear,

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.010
you just want to be able to tell them what's important to you and that's all I

7
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:27.690
want to do.
But I can you do that generally better over something I care about,

8
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:32.610
like archery or running or lifting weights or whatever like that.

9
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:36.990
So that's my goal,
just to,
you know,
share what's what,

10
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.220
because I feel like I have a pretty good pulse on what's important to sportsmen

11
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.090
and hunters here in North America.
And uh,
so I just want to share that.
Well,

12
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:49.470
I know Donald Trump junior is an avid archer.
Like he's really into it.

13
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.450
He's an avid hunter and he,
you got a chance to talk to him?
Yeah,

14
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.370
yeah.
Wow.
Quite a quite a while.
Yeah.
He wants to do the podcast,
this podcast.

15
00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:03.930
Yeah.
So he,
he went,
you know,
me,
me,
you and him can talk,
uh,
talk about hunting.

16
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.810
Okay,
we're in dawn.

17
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.070
So the smoke weed first for sure.

18
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.300
Oh for sure.
No total normal.
I mean cause that possible.

19
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.020
How's it possible that you grow up with Donald Trump as your dad?

20
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.480
You've got a golden toilet bowl when that little kid,
that's what I said,
I said,

21
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:31.100
you know,
I go,
cause I haven't met any of of uh,

22
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.910
Donald's kids except for Don Jr.
So I'm like,
well,

23
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.100
but I follow them on Instagram.
You know,

24
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:42.900
you kind of get kind of a sort of a feel for what the,
I said,
man,
I go,
you know,

25
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:46.320
in talking to you,
I said,
it seems weird to say,

26
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.480
but seem like a normal gun,
which is your dad's a billionaire.
I don't know.

27
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:54.960
Is he a billionaire?
Right.
Yeah.
So doesn't that seem,

28
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.530
it seems surprising.
He's like,
seems like just like we would be right.

29
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.610
Total normal.
I mean he's,
I follow my Instagram,

30
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:09.510
I see that the pictures of his daughter,
super cute,
the fishing pictures,

31
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.660
but I saw them on Tucker Carlson the other night and I told them this and we

32
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:17.661
were talking in Vegas and he was like just laying it down for a one minute clip

33
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.250
on Instagram on Tucker Carlson was to Fox News and laying it down and I was

34
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:24.090
like,
God,

35
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.490
I never really had followed his political or is his public speaking type life.

36
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.180
So I was like,
holy crap,
this guy is pretty dialed in.

37
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:36.810
It's probably the plan it takes over when he might,
he might,

38
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:40.200
I mean he's 40 so he's just kind of getting his feet under slides right in that

39
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:45.000
world and Trump dynasty just like they did with the bushes.
That's right.

40
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:47.730
Just know all of them.
Clinton's clenches,
you know,

41
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:50.850
once you're in there it's like that's all they want.
Is that interesting?

42
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.380
It's crazy.
But he,
I would feel,
I mean man,

43
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.260
well that's what it sounded like.
A good guy.

44
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.950
This guy don junior running for president.

45
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.330
<v 1>He's don junior is very reasonable.
Oh Man.
Totally.
Totally funny.
If he,</v>

46
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:09.310
if he says one thing wrong,
one thing,
one slip up of a word,
which by the way,

47
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:12.480
everybody does every day.
I do it every day.
Yeah.
Me Too.
One,

48
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.580
one slip up of the word Corey Knowlton right.

49
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.010
One fuck up like that.
And then this dunce,
I mean,
you,

50
00:03:20.011 --> 00:03:24.670
you see all this is magnified,
ridiculous hate that comes his way.

51
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.533
And the,
uh,

52
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.870
the attacks against him and people are people right now listening to this,

53
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:32.550
probably yelling at them because they're fucking jaws to Ford.
Here's Bruce,

54
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.900
here's a show.

55
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.960
<v 2>Okay.</v>
