1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.580
The joe rogan experience.
Like I saw a book of Mormon.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.360
That was the last time I went to a play.
Unless it was like,
for what?

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.250
You see Hamilton,
one of my kids look at me.
Yeah,
I don't want to.

4
00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:16.980
You think you're cultured,
man,
you're interested in all things.

5
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:20.570
I got shit to do,
man.
Whatever that hour is,
I got shit to do.

6
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.510
I literally know nothing about Hamilton.
I'm just joking.
You know?

7
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.540
It's funny because I went into it like,
what's it?
What's the crazy about,

8
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.210
you know,
I'm like,
this is going to be so overrated.
And then I watched,

9
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:32.820
I was like,
oh,
that was really good.
Yeah,
it was really good.
I love the pills.

10
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:35.930
Aren't forms exist,
you know,
love Broadway plays.
I'm not that big,

11
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.640
but I thought a book of Mormon,
I actually saw it twice.

12
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:42.540
I loved that and I thought it was,
I,
I,
you know,
it's funny.

13
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.840
It's something could be,
yeah,
it was June.
Fuck those dudes.
By the way,

14
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.800
Matt and tray,
they're on another planet like they're fine somewhere else.

15
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.341
No movie.

16
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:53.220
I watched that look talking about like movies that people don't talk about

17
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:57.090
enough.
That's so fucking perfect.
Team America.
Oh my God.

18
00:00:57.091 --> 00:01:00.810
That movie is like flawless.
It's one of the best movies ever for comedy.

19
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.950
But yeah,
it's,
it's,
you can't even believe what they accomplished in that movie.

20
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.350
Like they haven't seen the full uncut scenes,

21
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.710
the way they had sex and dropped blogs on each other.
A pistol at each other's.

22
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:14.190
Yes,
yes,
yes.
And uh,
the way they start the movie,

23
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.960
they told him that I saw the interview,

24
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:18.150
they told a story about the opening scene of the movie.

25
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.400
It's a really shitty Mary in it and then it widens out and it's a marrying it in

26
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:28.350
France using a marionette
opening scene.

27
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.950
So he said,
they said when they fucking screened it for the studio,

28
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.270
that's why they did that.

29
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.880
It was like a really shitty looking and you heard all the executives like,

30
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:38.070
what the fuck did we paid spend all this money on?
You know,

31
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.540
it just reveals how there's this sense of the full unedited sex version.

32
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.830
They did this like way over the top and pull stuff back.
Yeah,

33
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.510
it's really fun.
Yeah.

34
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.190
They just decided to do it this way so that they,

35
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.040
so they would have stuff to edit out for the DVD.

36
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.130
This is fucking crazy.
Oh my God.
And I think apparently they,

37
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.053
um,

38
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.760
they're doing everything my ass.
Yeah.

39
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.690
And they did this so that they could have like,
well,

40
00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:16.350
you gotta give us some of it,
you know,
give us a little,
we'll go,

41
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:20.760
they went so far over the line.
It's this every position,

42
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.020
everything.
They went so far,

43
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.110
so fucking crazy.
Like he's peeing on her

44
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.740
all over her face or open on and she drops a lot.
Oh my God,

45
00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:35.574
look at this.

46
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.480
And then they just keep going.
Oh my God.
It's so stupid.

47
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.420
I mean it just goes on forever.
Yeah.

48
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.230
But they did that so that they would have room for negotiation.

49
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.460
That's how they worked.
Yeah.
They,
uh,
those guys who are just geniuses,
man.

50
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:57.930
And that movies,
like the whole concept of they need an actor.
Yes.

51
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.630
How Important Act are and how bad is acting isn't scary.

52
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:06.630
Or an ace is fucking shitty.
Make the vibe darker,
darker,
darker,

53
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.720
darker.
And it's the Star Wars Cantina scene.
They're like,

54
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.240
we're going to Trans Morga Phi you,
which has more for you.

55
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:16.630
And then like all that stuff happens to his face.
It's like 20 minutes of like,

56
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.690
like they make it like it's face off and then they just hit and it just glued

57
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:24.080
some fucking hair to his face.
It's so fun.
Yeah,
there it is.
It's hilarious.

58
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.970
They're paint them a little brown.
Gee,

59
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.910
come on Gary.
Act your way in.
You know

60
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.780
we need a top gun actor.
That's what he says.
He goes,
you're a top gun actor.

61
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.030
It's too bad.
This took so long to make,

62
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:42.520
cause he doesn't want to make another one.
One was broke.
Damn Dude.

63
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:46.900
Like you're just fucking,
I can only imagine how much time I must take.

64
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.730
This is so painstaking.
Painstaking.

65
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.170
I mean are they moving each piece as it's happening and then filming it and

66
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:55.750
doing it over and over and over.
You and multiple camera angles.

67
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.690
Multiple this shot at like a movie.
That's why it's so good.

68
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.560
I need to watch it again.
Forgetting this scene.

69
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.290
I'll tell you this is him and then it,

70
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.790
then it's basically the star wars Cantina when he walks in and you know,
and uh,

71
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.280
hold on to that yet.
It's really funny,

72
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.800
but it is a movie that you could come home at like two in the morning and just

73
00:04:15.801 --> 00:04:18.490
so like,
oh,
I want to like kill an hour,

74
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.530
smoke some weed and just throw it on like at any seen it stopped at,

75
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.120
don't forget about the fucking south park movie.
Yes.

76
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:29.200
Your brush South Park movie where I don't know that they want to say gay with

77
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:33.940
the devil.
Devil.
Yeah,
I remember that.
The devil stick out and his Dick.
Fuck yeah.

78
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:36.460
I don't think it well,
are you kidding me?
I have to wash it in a long time.

79
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.000
Guarantee that'll hold up south park is still really funny.
It's still hilarious.

80
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:43.660
Yeah.
It's really funny.
I mean when it comes to overall content,

81
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.490
one of the funniest shows if not the funniest of all time dude,

82
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.500
they turned symptoms them
people love,

83
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.680
but it can rip on the family guy I port,
they remember the world war,

84
00:04:56.681 --> 00:05:00.280
they went into the writers room in the family guy and it was two manatees in the

85
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:01.114
tank.

86
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.560
And what if they drop a ball and I like drop a ball at a thing and then it just

87
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:09.580
a joke comes out.
So it's like old TV show reference,
you know?

88
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.800
That's hilarious.
They just broke his formula down.
Yeah.
It's funny though.

89
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.340
It's fucking hilarious.
I think.
I think Seth Macfarlane Fun.

90
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:21.100
Like I thought that was ted movies are really funny.
I didn't see them.
Yeah,

91
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.550
I still haven't seen or heard.
They're hilarious.
They're,

92
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:27.100
they're not like flawless movies,
but they're funny.
Like there's,

93
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.970
there's a couple of scenes in them that are like so funny that the whole movie

94
00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:33.550
goes up like 10 points because there's a few scenes in there.

95
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:35.240
Like there's a scene where uh,
uh,

96
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.000
or Ted's telling them about the weedy bought it.
He was like,
and it's like,

97
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:44.200
I forget the exact dialogue,
but it's like a,
he's like,
yeah,
it's called like,
uh,

98
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.320
he's like,
I got some weed.
It's called like,
kill me now,
please.
You know?

99
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:49.690
And he's like,
why don't you get that?
He's like,
well,
the only other options,

100
00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:51.190
but please make it,
stop.
Make it stop.

101
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:54.130
Like he's navy in the weeds and they're all like this,
like paranoia fueled.

102
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.820
We'd tape.
It's really funny,
you know,
sort of like maybe the,
uh,

103
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.510
the ges and the hair scene and something about Mary.
But it was so funny.

104
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:05.330
I took the whole movie.
Yeah.
And then it's like,
you remember that?
Yeah.

105
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.180
Cause there's other stuff that's really funny in that movie that gets lost.

106
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:12.200
Like Chris,
Chris Elliott,
having the best wife ever is really funny,

107
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.480
but he's still in love with Mary.
That's,
it's like a joke that kind of,

108
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.420
she's like,
I bake cookies.
You want a blow job?
And he's like,

109
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:21.080
still in love with another woman.
That's how amazing Mary is.

110
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.780
<v 1>[inaudible]
yeah.</v>
