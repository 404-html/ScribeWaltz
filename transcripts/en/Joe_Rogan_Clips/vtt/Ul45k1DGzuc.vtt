00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.490
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.710
An NLP is neuro linguistic linguistic programming.
Is that what you're doing?

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.860
And I'll paste it,

4
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:11.870
but it's mainly to language and think tricks that have popped up from over the

5
00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:14.760
air.
Not all NLP,
you know,
he said,
look,
a little bit of hypnosis,

6
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:18.360
hypnotic language,
blah blah,
blah.
Right.
And it gets them into learning state.

7
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:22.470
So what I do is I get a prepared them in a learning state,
give them confidence,

8
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:26.160
build them up so they can start to take on what Liam teachers.

9
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.540
So they said double whammy.
Really?

10
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:29.760
So he teach you some brilliance that nice as you are aware.

11
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.090
And then I just do my bit to get them where they have to get to.

12
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.120
Before I met you,
I thought that hypnosis was for idiots.

13
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.840
I thought you'd have to be a dummy.
I'm like,
yeah,

14
00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:45.540
you're getting me with that shit.
And then when you hit the tires me,
I was like,

15
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:48.600
wait a minute.
This is real.
Wow.

16
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.560
But I tried to explain it to me.
Oh to people,
you know.
I'm like,

17
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:56.550
it's not what you think.
It's not like you don't know where you are,

18
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:59.130
you don't know what's going on.
All of a sudden your parents are off.

19
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.360
It's not like that.

20
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.140
It's like you achieve this weird state of mind that you're aware,
do it.

21
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.840
Yes.
All's I do is guide it.
You do it and then the client does it.

22
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:11.040
Like whenever I do it with you.

23
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.090
Well as we've got an actual friend called Mike Parr,
it was,

24
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.010
I'd been working with him.

25
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.370
He loves it and white and Brown people [inaudible] to help his acting.
Yeah,

26
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:22.530
he did.
He mentioned me on a program called this morning,

27
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:25.160
which is a daytime show in England.
And uh,

28
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.680
he went on to it in a soap opera called Emmerdale.

29
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.780
He's normally in a long time and no need less time because I'm not an your

30
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.710
biggest fan by the way.
Yeah.

31
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.690
So yeah.
And we have done work with him and since of going on your show,

32
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:43.230
which I have to,

33
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.230
I really do appreciate it because my work's gone from a business woman of the

34
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:51.780
year CEOs and everyone now been,
it's just been,

35
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:55.710
it's just gone crazy because they needed to convince her and he was at so thanks

36
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:58.560
very much.
Well,
it's legit.
I'll tell you right now.
I mean,

37
00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:01.320
I don't know about other people,
but you know how to do it.
Thank you again,

38
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.120
it gave me some very interesting understanding about the mind and thought

39
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:10.230
processes and how it works and that expression that you look like to use all the

40
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:14.010
time.
Huck allow,
I think about that.
Explain what that is to people.

41
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.460
How can always,
uh,
increasing your peripheral vision?
It's Korea.

42
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.670
It's increasing your awareness just by basically cutting off your chest or

43
00:02:21.671 --> 00:02:25.320
chatter that goes on in your mind.
If you see a Liam,

44
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.570
when he fights before he fights,

45
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.400
he pushes his gloves together and goes into how cloud is every single time.

46
00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:34.430
What that does when,
I haven't shown you that yet,

47
00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:38.220
but I will show you later on if you wish is you anchor the gloves.

48
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.570
She anchor a positive state in the gloves and you push them together and then

49
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:45.820
you find Hakalau and it just gets you into,
well,
you can explain it.

50
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.170
What's unique about these seminars is,
oh,

51
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.700
I want it to do and here because I've worked with [inaudible] before and all

52
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:53.550
this stuff that he's teaching.
I'm not,
I know it works myself.
Um,

53
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.240
first time I used Vinny,
the story are,
we all started,

54
00:02:57.241 --> 00:03:02.241
I thought a top level ty called want cow Samara in nickname and [inaudible] you

55
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.160
had like an 8% Kayla ratio and I went to fight him in Jamaica.

56
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.421
I knew I could be in,

57
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:09.910
but there are a few aspects that you think all right with train and it didn't go

58
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:13.600
right at a time.
It
threw him off.

59
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.430
I'm not a liar.
Really fucked my shit up.

60
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.600
It fucked you up on Michael Jackson died.
Oh yeah.
Massive Fund.
Everyone knows me.

61
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.100
Knows I'm a massive fan,

62
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.580
but I'm not blaming Michael Jackson.
[inaudible] really?

63
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.200
Where you have a massive,
massive,
massive,
yeah.

64
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.120
Do you ever come out to his fights?
You ever smooth criminal course?
Um,

65
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.260
but yes,
I fought this Thai champion in Jamaica.
Like I said,

66
00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:46.030
a few things didn't go right and he smashed me to pieces.
It would,

67
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:49.570
the first time I ever got stopped,
um,
I knew I could beat him.
No,

68
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:51.700
I'm good at reading fighters.
I knew I could beat him.

69
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:54.940
So I begged and begged and begged for the rematch and promote Roy about six,

70
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.730
seven months later,
brought him to England and me and arena,

71
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.370
massive shore biggest showed the country devacy and vineyard spots.

72
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.770
Sportsmen before in the past said,
do you want to have,

73
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:04.310
if you want to do a little bit of work,
I know it's fun.

74
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.680
I'm mentally strong and mentally strong.

75
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.130
I don't need to do to build up to that fight or for,
you know what?

76
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.730
I'm going to train his idol.
They always,
as I've ever done before,
anywhere,

77
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:15.340
but there's no point.
You can never be too prepared because they'd all been in.

78
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:18.190
Can we do a little bit?
And,
um,
we did,
uh,

79
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.180
we did lots of different techniques and we have like keywords like warrior,

80
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.710
one of them.
Worry was the main one.
Yeah.

81
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.770
Bear in mind that the reason why I leave was reluctant to work with me.

82
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:33.460
It's the first time he met me.
I stole it wheelchair drunk,

83
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.250
steal anyone who was disabled chapters for everyone.
Can Brits,

84
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.430
I was strong.
Charlotte [inaudible],

85
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.020
he's called Richard Smith from members or Alisa.
And um,
anyway,

86
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.710
so it was a reluctant,
because I like to mess about,
you know,

87
00:04:49.711 --> 00:04:53.660
I like to be silly Cetera,
you know,
but he came to me and,

88
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.590
and uh,
we,

89
00:04:55.591 --> 00:05:00.210
we work together and my take on this story is I was common saying at the time,

90
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.630
great guy called Rob Cox,
who lives in San Louis,

91
00:05:02.631 --> 00:05:05.410
who knows everything about weight.
I rub Cox holes,
everybody,

92
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.780
everybody's got the kink simple.
And it was compensating with him.

93
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.770
Now Liam came to me and I wanted to put a word in that would,
that,

94
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:17.460
would that keep him strong?
So it was warrior.
Now.
It was really weird.

95
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:18.300
As I was compensating,

96
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.000
you can watch it on Youtube when I'm commentating on the fight,

97
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.140
he looks at me at round four cause I can see him and he looks through his p,

98
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.761
his trainer,

99
00:05:26.761 --> 00:05:30.270
Richard Smith and Andy House and his claws news five time world champion as
well.

100
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.870
So it's in a family and he looks over at me and he goes warrior.

101
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.100
He looks straight in my eyes.
I don't ever remember doing that over.

102
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.380
You were like the,
the state I was in my,
no Phi in,
it couldn't hurt me.

103
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:44.350
And then bearing in mind our bodily smash me a piece in the first fight,

104
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.210
I didn't get hurt with anything.
I would just,
it will occur in some totals day.

105
00:05:48.211 --> 00:05:51.400
I was so on point.
I'll make any mess up.
Our school didn't really,

106
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:54.460
I'll be pretty convincingly on points.
That's amazing.
And um,

107
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.480
I went to the after party afterwards I'd bottle of water,
sat down,
passed out,

108
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:01.970
collapsed ambulance,
came and got me,
took me,
it was bill.

109
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.310
I had a really bad concussion.
Wow.

110
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.600
But did you guys like the state I was in in the fight and um,

111
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.230
I didn't feel a thing.
Everything just are,
my eyes didn't feel any people.

112
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.880
We're like,
Hey,
it's actually explained so emotionally invested in it as well.

113
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.420
But when the kids,
you know side,
when he came over he said,
thank you.
I was like,

114
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.240
oh you want me to do that day as well.

115
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:28.241
So there are a lot that day in his family and I was so overwhelmed by it.

116
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:31.190
But look,
I mean it's only one aspect of it.

117
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:35.260
He's got a fantastic culture and Richard Smith and Lisa,
Lisa Smith,
Lisa,

118
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.500
you should we call hot Lisa and all the gangs like bad shit,
you know.

119
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.290
And everyone,
Steve Campbell,
eastern physician,

120
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.080
he's got so many people around him.
I'm just one little bit,

121
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.830
but it was weird because he went,
he went warrior and I said to him,

122
00:06:47.831 --> 00:06:50.250
do you remember saying what are you went no,
I didn't remember.

123
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.020
I'll have to look back at the video and what the concussion probably had a lot

124
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:54.500
to do with that.

125
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.620
Maybe I'll look back at the video and is a left hook in round form.

126
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.250
I had nearly like Ooh,
spins around and terms the one that probably,

127
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.330
you know it's interesting that that's catching on mental coaching.

128
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.990
It really is and there's a lot of fighters that used to dismiss it that I know

129
00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:10.400
now are using mental coaches.

130
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:13.880
I've had conversations with them before in the past and I was like,

131
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:16.040
what do you think about sports psychologists when you think about mentoring or I

132
00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:20.480
don't need that shit.
And then years later,
oh lost her two later,

133
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.870
their minds in a weird place and then they,
they decide,
okay,

134
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:24.810
I need something like that.
Now.

135
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.640
The thing is I think that fights are won and lost in the changing rooms.

136
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.120
I think that in the locker room as you say,
you know,
one little,

137
00:07:32.121 --> 00:07:36.350
it's like a little tiny bit of anthrax.
It thrown in in a reservoir,
a poison,

138
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:38.270
a whole say.
And then that's where it was mentally.

139
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.600
I've seen fires in the dressing room who I've trained with in the gym and they

140
00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:45.560
have been so strong at so much power in the gym that had been the best ever.

141
00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:48.540
And I've seen him in the changing rooms and I've seen him start to go up.

142
00:07:48.541 --> 00:07:53.541
The self can be out of place in it strongly money and I can see him just to

143
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.833
flair.

144
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.830
And a lot of fighters do have that problem and I'm dwarfed by the moment.
Yeah.

145
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.790
Yeah.
That's a common thing with everything,
with any kind of performance,

146
00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:06.950
anything where you're doing something that's difficult,

147
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.810
but fighting it has such dire physical consequences that the,

148
00:08:10.811 --> 00:08:14.830
the overwhelming anxiety and the pressure just to you,

149
00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.960
you see it so many times guys who were really good fighters,

150
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.420
that they have panic attacks in the dressing room and they just,

151
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.430
they can't handle it until the use as well.

152
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:27.430
It means you get such a diverse mix of clients that he eats everything is what

153
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:31.260
it means to you,
isn't it?
So that your fight against you,

154
00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:34.400
whether this fight is tie boxes in the world that they keep matching you with.

155
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:37.640
And,
um,
and,
and your job,
I'll you,
your interview,

156
00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:40.760
we'll all use like my key that the lines that you have to do while you're

157
00:08:40.761 --> 00:08:43.600
showing.
I think it's all relative to you,
you know,

158
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.250
and anxiety's a big sketch.
Yeah.

159
00:08:46.251 --> 00:08:49.130
Anytime you have to do anything difficult anxiety comes into play,

160
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.220
but it just doesn't come into play in anything remotely clinic except war.

161
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.410
It's like war is like the highest of it.

162
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.620
And then pass you get the low below that is like probably police officers and

163
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.720
first responders and then it's fighters and it's like,

164
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:07.440
there's nothing like that that walk to the fucking ring,
you know what I mean?

165
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.390
And you're just thinking about did I do enough?

166
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.210
Did I sleep enough that I eat right.
You know,
and you see,
ah,

167
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.970
I see so many.
I think that's why I've kind of got into it as well,
you know,

168
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.290
with different things that I saw so much potential.
She,
I,
I,
you know,

169
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:23.940
the first time,
well,

170
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:27.480
the first time I met him I was training someone to fight him.
Oh Wow.

171
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:30.540
And that was like,
listen,
he's only a kid.
So what you've got to do,

172
00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:33.840
get in his face and punch him in the face.
Art As often as you can.

173
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.640
It'll suit quit.
How wrong was I?

174
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.290
Only 15 who was he?
How old is the other guy?

175
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.300
28 oh Jesus.
