1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.240
Way more people reading tweets versus newspapers.
Right.
That'd be stunned.

2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.230
Like if you could get to seed the exact engagement in a good article in the New

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.790
York Times on the front page versus one of Donald Trump's tweets,
you know,

4
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.830
two people that motherfuckers are just waiting for their tweets come out as

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.190
Donald Trump to Kanye west.
Yeah.
Those are the two most interested tweets people.

6
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.550
Kanye west could just say grapefruit juice and fuck up all of the media to next

7
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.060
day.
What do you think he meant?

8
00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:31.090
Do you think he made it was hungry or he was thirsty?
Connie,

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.390
you just tweeted grapefruit juice.
One of the most,

10
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.520
one of the most interesting tweeters up there.
You wait for a Kanye West tweet.

11
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.450
Well,
he's got a free way of expressing himself.
Like,

12
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.320
here's an unfiltered way of expressing myself and a lot of people,
um,

13
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.750
people have mixed feelings about it makes views.

14
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.080
I know black community is a little stressed out right now.
Well,

15
00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:57.340
because of his Trump thing,
but she know what?
Uh,
I don't know how much of that,

16
00:00:57.341 --> 00:00:58.750
it's just two.
There's two things.

17
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.640
One Obama called MC jackass that could weigh on you.
That stung a little bit.

18
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.110
Yeah.
You know,
and then Obama,
when Obama has gone,
Trump takes office.

19
00:01:08.111 --> 00:01:11.800
Trump is willing to let him talk.
Trump's Trump,
Trump old charm him.

20
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.180
Here's the thing,
Joe,
what that set like when I do white clubs,
black clubs,

21
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.640
whatever,
do all type of clubs.
But the thing is,
um,

22
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.330
you,
you,
you first off,

23
00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:29.200
Kanye West has a voice,
not too many.

24
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.480
As much as black people want to throw the towel in on them.

25
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.910
We don't have too many voices that everybody is waiting to hear whether whatever

26
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.780
comes out,
he has a voice.
I believe that Kanye West is trying to say something.

27
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.550
I just don't know what the fuck he's trying to say because I'm not fluent in

28
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.970
easy,
barely know Swahili.

29
00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:50.790
I can't do [inaudible] easy.

30
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.640
And I think he's trying to say something,

31
00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:59.430
but if there was some type of interpreter,
you know,

32
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.200
this would be a dope ever Chappelle show was right now this is what,

33
00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:05.680
this would be a dope ass kid.
Kanye West says something.
It did.

34
00:02:05.681 --> 00:02:09.760
Dave Chappelle is his conscious interpreter.
That would be hilarious.
He does.

35
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.090
Connie says it didn't,
Dave yells up.
You know what I think,

36
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.790
and this is my only talked to him once the phone,

37
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.170
but what I think from studying them and paying attention,

38
00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:22.180
because we're supposed to eventually do a podcast one day is I think he's uh,

39
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.720
he's thinks different.
He does.
He connects dots different.

40
00:02:25.721 --> 00:02:28.600
And that's one of the reasons why he is so prolific with music.
That's what I'm,

41
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.501
that's the point.

42
00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:33.010
I'm making jokes and that's the point I'm saying about not speaking easy,

43
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.600
but here's some people that think like that.
They don't know how to get it out.

44
00:02:37.601 --> 00:02:42.110
It's like,
just speak.
I have been thinking about this.
I love you.

45
00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:42.944
You're my dad.

46
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.460
You Must Subarea here my dad.
You're like my father.

47
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.630
You know how hard that was for the black community here.
Fuck.

48
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.280
You could sell them a clean all you want,

49
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.720
but what you're saying you'd like my father,
it didn't.

50
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.140
Black people sit back like,
could you please explain that?

51
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.790
So we thought this was funny to me.
They of said,
yeah,

52
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.540
you're like a father figure to me.
Like when I was younger,

53
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.710
up until he was Korea hit me with the horrific,
you know,

54
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.080
father was in him in a shootout,

55
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.000
a drive by if this would fuck me up bro.
He said yeah,
when I was younger,

56
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.190
my parents
separated at a young age.

57
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.920
First off,
you had parents,

58
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.210
you already winning motherfucker.
None of my

59
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.900
dad,
my mother and my father.
You know what I'm saying now only that,
no.
Okay,
okay.

60
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:44.140
Cut My friends money.
His parents.
But he said my parents separated.

61
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:47.320
I mean they were married.
That's two winds

62
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.440
you up to before you get to and they separate it in.

63
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:57.490
Mom moved down the street,
you still got to see your fucking father.

64
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.150
So that was a little troubling.
But the whole thing is,

65
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.130
I'm pretty sure at some point kind of West we'll be able to speak a language

66
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:10.360
that everybody can understand.

67
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.720
Until then it's only half full of people to speak and understand it.

68
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.610
And also right here.

69
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.730
But here's my problem with all this and I've been thinking about this a lot.

70
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.240
They want to medicate him,
right?
Yeah.

71
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.560
Look how effective he is.
Just stop.

72
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:32.980
Just stop and think about culturally effective in terms of the music that he

73
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:37.810
makes it.
People love his,
he's a voice.
Yeah.
He creates clothes.
Okay.

74
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.040
He's married.
His place,
conversation and dialogue too.
He does.

75
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.550
His wife makes hundreds of millions of dollars.
They're insanely wealthy,

76
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:49.720
insanely successful.
If you want to talk about overall success,
they're together.

77
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.910
They have children's,
they're super wealthy.

78
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.290
He produces incredible art that's loved worldwide and they want to medicate him.

79
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.510
Just stop and think about how effective,

80
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.600
but they want to medicate what they want to medicate him to operate.

81
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:06.470
At what level does that think about how effective he is and yet they want us to

82
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.380
medication or off off.
When he's off medication,
he said himself,

83
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:15.580
he's his most creative stop and think about how creative he's been,

84
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.820
how successful is,
how well received.
Yeah.

85
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.820
Happy and all these other elements in his life,

86
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.750
but yet they want him to act the way they want him to act.
Well,

87
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.990
you would just want him to take the head off.
You know what I'm saying?

88
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.330
I've made whatever bro.

89
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.890
You can say whatever the fuck you what the black bean wasn't mad cause he would

90
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:38.650
have had,
they was mad cause it wasn't a fit for a new era.

91
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.740
If that was a new era they would have been more accepting of it.
Man.

92
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.060
We just don't what the ad side.
It's red and white now.
That's a problem.

93
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:49.870
Anything with red with white letters.
Yo,
I'm telling you,

94
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:54.690
it's like when I see,
it's so funny now whenever I see a red head I'm like,
Huh.

95
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.120
Like I'm immediately but after show upstate New York and else's,

96
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.260
why dude came up to me,

97
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:03.260
I have to show and he didn't have what looked like I'm making America great and

98
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:03.710
hit.

99
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.030
He had make America great again hat and it looked like he had the original one.

100
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:11.000
You know how you got to,
you know how you got a Boston fan and you're like,

101
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:12.420
you only been the same night.

102
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.430
It was a brand of American great before.
Like,

103
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.020
he probably sold the Hashtag [inaudible] did they,
here's the thing,
Joe,

104
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.830
this is my,
if I had the hat on this shit,
and at the end of the show,

105
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.690
he was one of the dudes that was continued to laugh in the most,
you know,

106
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.710
and I went up to him and I,
I was like,
Yo,
I gotta get a picture with you.

107
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.500
And I took the piston,
it was a video.
I was like,
yeah,
motherfucker,

108
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.120
y'all see his head.
And he started laughing and we had a good moment.

109
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.800
It wasn't,
no,
I wasn't angry him.
I'm not going to let

110
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.920
think it's hard to get away from it,

111
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.190
but I think Kanye would,

112
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:59.780
the hat he likes the idea of how it gets people flustered

113
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.600
contrarian.
They get special was triggered,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

114
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.310
Excuse me.
All right.
All right.
No,
but I'm saying it's like triggered,

115
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.830
like even,
and I,
when I,

116
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:15.940
when a guy had the hat on and I was talking to,

117
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.240
I heard an aside,
it was like this,
oh,
he's triggered.

118
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.973
And I wasn't,

119
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.400
I wasn't triggered by that when I was training what I would have been triggered

120
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:30.260
by just how you make me feel with that hot no period.

121
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.280
Period.
You know,

122
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.720
you can come at me like you could come at me with their head on with some fucked

123
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:38.840
up energy and I could feel it.
But the energy he gave me was like,

124
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.480
I know this may sound crazy.
We was like,
Yo,

125
00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:45.200
you're funny motherfucker with the hat on.
You're like,
okay.
I didn't give a fuck.

126
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.670
Right.
Cause I couldn't let him,

127
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:52.690
I couldn't let him make me feel like if that's what his intent was,

128
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.980
he's gonna make me feel uncomfortable.
I couldn't do it.
Smile.

129
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.910
He was trying to make you feel on guard.
I think he really does who he was.

130
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.460
I think that's who he was.
But I think that's what it was.

131
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.100
But I know that motherfucker laughing like a motherfucker.
