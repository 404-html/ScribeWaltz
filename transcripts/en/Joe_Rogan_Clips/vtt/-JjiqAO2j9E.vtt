1
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.090
But the past is the past is up for discussion.

2
00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:09.840
That's a pass is up for discussion.
Good.
Thrilled.

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.080
If somehow or another they were able to work it out where Jimmy Smith was at the

4
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:15.780
UFC,
we shall see.
That would be what I would like to say.

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.970
We shall see how that goes.
I would like to see that.
We will.

6
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.310
That's a big fuck up.
Yeah,
man.
It was,
um,
well let me say it like,

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.990
just a little background because I'll have people been asking me,

8
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:27.900
I haven't made any real public statements other than del Toro.
Hate her.

9
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.950
I just want to say,
yeah,
no,
never rebelled toward here.
Respect.
Yeah.

10
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.840
I enjoy watching it and like the fighters.
Yeah.

11
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.610
And I've always told everybody that you are the best out there.

12
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.630
Thank you so much.
Do an amazing job.
I really appreciate that.
Um,
number.
But yeah,

13
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:42.540
it's,
it's not a,
it's not a belt with a mean.
They were great to work with.

14
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:47.340
They were great about the,
the whole breakup thing.
Someone say it.

15
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.800
Yeah.
So what happened was I was,
I had a,
I had a,
a deal with a,

16
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.090
with an option urine and 2018 was my option here.

17
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.070
And when I was in a Verona,
New York doing the Verona show,

18
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.570
my boss sat me down and he said,

19
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:04.110
we're not going to renew 2018 we want a different,
we wanted different deal.

20
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.710
And when they come to you and say,
we want a different deal,
what?

21
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.080
They want a downgrade,
it's never,
it's never your,

22
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:12.150
when your girlfriend comes to you and says,
I want to talk,
it's never,

23
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.420
I don't give enough blowjobs.
That's never,
that's never what,

24
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:19.410
they never say that it's always going to be a better girlfriend.
Exactly.
Yeah.

25
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.680
It's always bad.
It's always bad.
So yeah,
that was it.
When they were like,
uh,

26
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.640
we want to change the deal around,
I was like,
okay.

27
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.810
And they did make a like an honors Dev or to keep me,
they,
they,

28
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.580
they really tried,
but they just,
they didn't make an offer that was,

29
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:37.650
there was worth me coming back and that,
that was pretty much a deal.

30
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.170
So it was kind of an amicable,
comparatively amicable.

31
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.060
It's fascinating to me that in the world of a mixed martial arts professional,

32
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:47.610
mixed martial arts,
there haven't been that many people that have done you.

33
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.070
What you and I both do,
this is a small handful of people.
You don't,
you're,

34
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.450
the weird thing is about our job really in it,

35
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:56.110
and I mean this from the bottom of my heart.
Um,

36
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.090
everybody thinks they've got a guy.
It's,

37
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.370
it's one of those jobs that everybody thinks they can do that they really go,

38
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.070
we'll just throw a fighter and then he'll be able to,
it.
I've seen,

39
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.010
I don't know how many of the unfit they want to do.
You know,

40
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:11.380
even locker room interviews aren't going to get next fight and do that.
And it's,

41
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.990
it's a job.
It's just,
it's really,
I mean it's,

42
00:02:13.991 --> 00:02:17.040
it's one of those things where everybody thinks they can throw somebody in and

43
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:21.150
do it.
And I've seen,
I don't know how many try and it's,
it's tough.

44
00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:23.520
You really have to work at it or having a knack for it.

45
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:27.210
It's not the kind of thing that,
you know,
it's almost like coaching.
I mean,

46
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.290
how many times you heard,
I've heard of great,
great Jujitsu guys,

47
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.730
like he's just not a great guy.
He's naturally really good.

48
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:36.450
He's not good at teaching it because Tim,
it just works and then you try it.

49
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:38.010
It doesn't work.
You know what I'm saying?
To her,

50
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.820
a great fighter isn't a great coach.
Some here,
a great fighters in,

51
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:43.740
it's a great broadcaster.
It just doesn't work that way.
