Hello Freak bitches.
He did this movie.

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.990
A lot of people were viewed it from the moment we announced it.
I'm like,
Hey,

3
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:09.850
I'm going to make a movie with my daughter and giant depths in and his daughter

4
00:00:09.851 --> 00:00:14.430
is going to be a two and right away I saw it like fucking the long sharp knives

5
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:17.540
come out and so as expected it goes to Sundance and you know,

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.390
so I'm not saying this movie is for everybody.

7
00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:21.330
It's for like 10 people in the world,

8
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:23.880
but the 10 people that love it will love it.
Like religion.

9
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.260
Having you always done that though,

10
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:28.710
you just kind of do what you like to do is turn my life.
I could turn it around.

11
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.320
Turn on you.
What I like about what you do is you are,

12
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.560
you're very much an accepted inside guy who lives like some guy from Jersey who

13
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:39.660
was trying to break into the business.

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.820
Like this is useful because you never really understand how people professional

15
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:46.260
see you.

16
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.620
You know how the world sees you because they'll tell you they didn't give given

17
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.860
moment.
Joe,

18
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.520
Joe Normal or Sally and normal people will live in the real world and shit,

19
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.570
but your peers and people like we work in entertainment and shit.
Yeah.
How Mary,

20
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.720
you're very unaffected.
You're a uniquely unaffected Casa.

21
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.000
Like ineffective.
No,
you're very effective.

22
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.380
You're effective at doing what you enjoy and that's why you have such a unique

23
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:13.290
and loyal fan base is because they know they're,

24
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.480
it's like in this world,

25
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.400
there's not a whole lot of unique visions.
There's a lot of ideas.

26
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:25.290
They get brought to producers and executives and a bunch of people pile in and

27
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:26.124
it becomes more of a,

28
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.520
an idea where it's trying to appeal to a broader audience and it switches up and

29
00:01:32.101 --> 00:01:33.950
then someone wants to bring it a love interest.
There's,

30
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:38.951
there's all sorts of influences that happen that homogenize as you drink some

31
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:42.840
milk.
I know.
That was my time is milk.
Oh my Lord.
That was perfect.

32
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:46.980
That's the perfect timing of a standup comic Logan.
Oh my.
It does really.

33
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:50.040
That's the best word for it because even though if it's good like you,
you,

34
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.600
you don't feel like that guy.

35
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:55.490
Like Tarantino is one of the unique guys where even though it was movies of

36
00:01:55.491 --> 00:01:58.110
these gigantic mega blockbusters,

37
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.350
it feels like he's doing his own thing that feels like this crazy fucker just

38
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:07.110
got the money and the wheels and they're listening to him cause he's Tarantino.

39
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.280
You are movies at the same kind of connects with more people.

40
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.770
There's more of a like,
oh yeah,
that's cool.

41
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:17.520
It's cinema of cool because you could just look out it even if you don't have an

42
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:22.290
experiential connection to it.
Like,
oh I once went to a 50s cafe as per,
yeah,

43
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.870
you're just like,
that looks bad.
St John Travolta dancing.
We want to throw me.

44
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.050
That's bad as all the way it shapes everything about it.

45
00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:34.051
It's just like cinema of cool and fed by a lifetime of movie loving and a movie

46
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:36.750
diet.
Yeah.
So if you love movies,

47
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.750
here's a God that distills everything.

48
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:43.730
That's the essence of Cool of cinema and I don't want to keep hitting the cool

49
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:46.180
Belks people like come on.
It's a hipster term,
but it,

50
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.540
it does distill it down to those moments.
Not so much like massive arcs,
but Ooh,

51
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:56.400
this feels awesome.
That's dope.
Oh,
that's metal.
Well,
yeah,

52
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.140
you have that same kind of thing.

53
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.110
You're your are very people comedies,

54
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.970
comedies in particular.

55
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.090
Like that was one of the more you in interesting and unique things about red

56
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:10.090
state because I had no,
you didn't tell me a word about it.
He said,

57
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:11.290
I don't want you to know nothing.

58
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.790
Just Colin's dry filthier than I met in me and me and Marin's sit there and

59
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:19.630
watched it and we're at the end of it.
We were like,
Holy Shit.
Holy Shit.

60
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:23.750
Like what the fuck was that?
He was crazy.
It wasn't a comedy at all.

61
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.890
<v 1>Oh Wow.
Like throw them a curve and be like,
oh,
he's like,</v>

62
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.520
we thought we saw everything.
Like I always felt most people saw him.
He was like,

63
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.370
oh,
he did clerks.
And then he's done about 96 variations.

64
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.960
<v 0>People need to see red state.
If you haven't seen red state,
that is a,
it's,</v>

65
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.520
I don't want to say too much cause I want people to go into it the way I went

66
00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:45.860
into it.
Just go see that fucking movie.

67
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.570
But that's another movie where even though it wasn't like the same voice,

68
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.540
it was still a unique voice.
Right.
You know,
it's like,
I think,

69
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.640
I don't know what it's like to make a movie,
but it's gotta be,

70
00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.180
the lot of people have a lot of say he nudges is bigger,

71
00:04:00.181 --> 00:04:01.000
the budget

72
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.590
<v 1>or you know,</v>

73
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.520
you have to listen to a bunch more people and you can't be unreasonable about
it.

74
00:04:04.521 --> 00:04:08.400
If you get him tremendous amounts of success like JJ Abrams and you're a nice

75
00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:10.920
guy at the same time,
you know,
you can get away with being like,

76
00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:14.340
I'm going to do whatever I want.
And people like what you want tends to work.

77
00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:17.640
So here go nuts.
But generally speaking,
the more money you,

78
00:04:17.641 --> 00:04:22.350
except the more input.
You also have to accept lower the budget.

79
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.820
And if it's coming out of your pocket,

80
00:04:23.821 --> 00:04:26.160
you don't gotta say Shit to anybody or nobody could tell you anything.

81
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.530
But you know,
if you're putting together something small,

82
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.810
it's still a smaller circle of people.
It's kind of answered.
She didn't.

83
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:33.960
You always have to be willing to hear what they're saying.

84
00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:37.590
If somebody is willing to give you ungodly of money and make pretend mind you,

85
00:04:37.591 --> 00:04:38.424
this is not like,

86
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.010
I'm going to give you funds and you're going to give me eggs and I'm going to

87
00:04:41.011 --> 00:04:44.370
sell those eggs and I'm gonna make more money selling those eggs.
They're like,

88
00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:47.730
we're going to give you money and you're going to take this goofy fucking idea

89
00:04:47.731 --> 00:04:49.820
you have and try to make it real and,

90
00:04:49.821 --> 00:04:53.870
and turn it into a movie that may work or may not work.
It's all crap.
Shoot.

91
00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:56.100
It's like buying a lottery ticket to a large degree,

92
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.640
no guarantees that the lever be an audience for it.

93
00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:03.930
So I learned that midway my career and realize,
well,
just work for you.

94
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.950
Sounds masturbatory.

95
00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:07.950
But it's like if you are the audience that you're trying to hit,

96
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.130
then you'll always be satisfied.
You know,

97
00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:13.830
it's like if you want other people to like it,

98
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.700
it's subjective and it might not find that people dig what you're doing.

99
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.120
And you know,
if you're looking for monetary success,
good luck.

100
00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:22.290
Nobody can guess that.

101
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.970
Like even when marvel releases a new movie and we know marvel is exceptional at

102
00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:30.510
what they do,
put them in Pixar,
marvel,
Pixar on care of the best of the best.

103
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.130
Even when they release a movie,
they clench a little bit because they're like,

104
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.070
anything could happen,
anything could happen at all.

105
00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:41.670
So generally speaking they're a little more insulated from like,
Oh shit,

106
00:05:41.671 --> 00:05:43.860
we lost money.
It's actually those monies.

107
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.180
Those marvel movies are so expensive now because dude,

108
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.100
it's like the same thing with the animated movies.

109
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.040
The animated movies are ungodly expensive to make,

110
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.680
but they print money and they print money,

111
00:05:55.681 --> 00:05:58.910
not just the first time they come at the box office.

112
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.940
They print money through all the licenses.

113
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:04.790
They print money where you know sometimes you go like they're doing a sequel to

114
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:06.320
that.
Why?
Why don't they do something new?

115
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.960
Because they've already built the world.
It's already there.

116
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:12.410
And a computer and they're like,
oh,
we need this new script and we're good.

117
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:15.200
We've done our infrastructure.
Like when you think about it,

118
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.670
if you were building something,

119
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:20.060
you built all this massive infrastructure and spent three years putting it

120
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:23.540
together and did it once and then you're like,
okay,
everybody goodbye forever.

121
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.390
It's kind of a waste of everything you put together.

122
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.760
That's why they immediately go for a sequel.
None.
Hey,

123
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:30.800
they know they're going to make money,
but B,

124
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.470
they're going to make more money because they don't have to invest as much time

125
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.740
and money as they did the first time.
So that's what makes a studio go like,
oh,

126
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:39.920
that's easier.
That's low hanging fruit and everyone's happy.
You know,

127
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:41.930
it's not like they're making art films that only few people,

128
00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:45.620
like generally they tend to make flicks that a bunch of people want to go see.

129
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.400
And that riles up people that want to see newer films or something like that.

130
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:52.670
Cause like,
why is it always the same movie over and over again?
But you know,

131
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:54.920
I submit to you if you're going to see a superhero movie,

132
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.010
expect a little fucking sameness.

133
00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:02.030
It's a story of like an exceptional being with powers that others don't,

134
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:05.300
and hopefully that person will use it for good.
You know,

135
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:08.180
you can only cut that cheese so many fucking times where,

136
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.200
and say it's something new.
I'll let you go.

137
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.610
I think the watchmen took it to a new place and I love the watching,

138
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.570
but at the end of the day,
it's just likes people in mass doing the right thing.

139
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:19.730
And yeah,
they fucked in space.
But other than that,

140
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.770
there was some people in mass trying to do the right thing.

141
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.500
They were murdered to the murder at each other.

142
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.050
Like is caught up in Batman v Superman.

143
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:29.180
I heard there were some murders in that movie in the movie.
I was like,

144

146
