1
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.250
One.
And we're live gentlemen,
Doctor Neil Riordan.
Am I saying that right?
Yes sir.

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.970
And Mel Gibson,
how are you sir?
Hey,
how you doing?
Welcome on board folks.

3
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:15.810
First of all,
thanks for coming here.
Really appreciate it.
Very nice.
Meet you.

4
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.240
Nice to meet you too.
So this,
uh,
you wanted to come in and talk about stem cells.

5
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.650
Yeah.
So what is,
what's your experience been and what,
what is,
uh,

6
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.340
what's this calling that you have here?
Well,
I

7
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.320
<v 1>was,
uh,
initially it was for my dad who was,
you know,</v>

8
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.140
he was 92 and uh,
and he was doing all the old man stuff,

9
00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:42.170
you know,
his hip was killing him and he was like,
uh,
he had,

10
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.760
he had multiple problems.
I mean,
I won't get into the whole litany of complaints,

11
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:48.260
but hey,
you know,

12
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:51.170
your engine starts wearing out and you've got to replace the carburetor and a

13
00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:56.060
few other things.
And I took him to the Mayo Clinic,
great place.

14
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.880
If I ever get into serious trouble,
that's where I'm going.

15
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.770
And they were fantastic there,
but they were able to say,
hey,

16
00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:06.530
you got to leave me here.
It'd be dead in 48 hours.
I'm like,
oh.
So they,

17
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.480
they clocked every problem that he had.
Everything from,

18
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.400
you know,
the prostate to the,
to the hip,
to the kidneys,
to the heart,

19
00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:19.910
to the lungs,
you know,
the whole deal.
And um,

20
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.820
he,
uh,
um,
you know,
they,
they stabilized him.
They said,
okay,

21
00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:28.340
we'll do this and we'll do this.
And they did some,
you know,

22
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.650
Orthodox medical procedures all allowed in this country.

23
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.910
And uh,
they were great.
But,
uh,
you know,

24
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:41.420
I still had reservations about him getting a hip replacement because he was old.

25
00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:42.254
And of course,

26
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.330
just the recovery from a dramatic surgery at that age is like,

27
00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:51.950
it's a big deal.
And I thought,
well,
what can I do on my brother says,

28
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:55.190
why don't you look into these adult stem cells?
I'm like,
Eh,
you know,

29
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.360
I've heard things about this,
you know,
you grow,

30
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.370
you grow a spare mouth on your head,

31
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.710
you end up with an extra asshole or something.
But I was like,
okay,

32
00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:10.310
we'll look into it.
So we did.
And of course,
a buddy of mine who was a,

33
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.590
who was a Mayo Doc,
he said,

34
00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:16.310
stay away from those witch doctors down in Panama.
He said,

35
00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:20.450
it's like a leprosy and banana boats and three legged dogs,
you know,

36
00:02:20.451 --> 00:02:24.920
and I'm like,
can we call him?
And so,
uh,

37
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.010
so Brad and I got on the phone to Neil and who else was it?

38
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.580
Doctor Pause or medical?
Yeah,
there was the two of these guys.
And um,

39
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.520
so they're talking to highfalutin terms,
medical,
all being Medicos,
you know,

40
00:02:37.521 --> 00:02:41.840
they sort of,
they know what a Mesenchymal stem cells or Mesenchymal,

41
00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:46.190
how do you say it?
Misses linkable.
Yeah.
Mesenchymal,
you know,
and uh,
you know,

42
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:49.700
Cytocon ms income,
all cytokines,
you know,
out of sight,

43
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:53.560
out of kind as far as I'm concerned.
But it's like they,
uh,

44
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.410
they give us the wristwatch show over the phone for about an hour and the

45
00:02:57.411 --> 00:03:00.100
doctor's asking them questions that can't even think of.

46
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.110
<v 2>So when we hang up,
I said,
no,
you know,
translate what is all at me.
And he's like,</v>

47
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:07.930
he translated a few things.
He says,
you know,
it sounded kind of interesting,

48
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:10.450
pretty good,
you know,
and from being a naysayer,
he said,

49
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:15.250
let's call him back and I think we call you right back.
And,
uh,

50
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:19.810
we spend another hour on the phone.
And,
uh,
well to his credit,
uh,

51
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:20.763
Brad,

52
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.000
Brad asked for a bunch of literature and I sent him maybe 30 articles and most

53
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:29.980
physicians wouldn't even look at it,
but it was all relevant to what hut had.
And,

54
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:33.590
uh,
you know,
for the heart,
heart problems and kidney problems and,
and,
uh,

55
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.470
orthopedic problems.
And he read all the articles and he read,
he read the upside,

56
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:42.550
the downside,
and,
and,
and then,
then we had a,
to his credit,

57
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.340
then we had a very educated,
uh,

58
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.840
talk after conversation and which he,
and he was,
he was really,
you know,

59
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:53.800
by this time informed I,
and he,
he,
he just said to me,
well,
you know,

60
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.510
he's 92.
He says,
what the hell you got to lose?
And I said,
no,
nothing,

61
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.470
let's go.
So I'm up for it.
We asked him,
is he up for it?
He goes,
hell yeah,

62
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.400
cause he's,
you know,
they took him into the hospital.
He was 92.
And they said,

63
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:09.940
what medications are you on?
He said,
I'm not on any.
And they said,

64
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.540
you're 92 years old.
How do you account for not being on any medications?

65
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:18.370
This is because I stay away from doctors and hospitals
and you know,

66
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.530
and he didn't have any problems.
He started to have have a rough trip.
Well,
uh,

67
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.660
we took them down there and he got,
uh,

68
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.540
I think it was like a double dose in the hip.
I think he gave a word,

69
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.670
you have to go,
this is not legal in America.
So what's going on right now?

70
00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:36.580
There are clinical trials going on in the u s but it's not broadly available.

71
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.880
And in Panama they passed the law in 2004,
which allowed us,

72
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.950
allowed doctors actually to go down there to be able to treat people with using

73
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:45.741
adult stem cell.

74
00:04:45.741 --> 00:04:50.741
So the bill was actually designed to prohibit the use of embryonic stem cells.

75
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.870
And in this at the same law,
they said it's okay to use adult stem cells,

76
00:04:55.871 --> 00:05:00.550
including those from a biblical cord basically from ethical sources.
And so,

77
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.880
um,
in Panama they,
they gave us a,

78
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:07.750
we have a license from the Ministry of Health to manufacture and use those cells

79
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.090
in addition to doing clinical trials there.

80
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:14.620
So it's one place on the planet where you can get a really high quality

81
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:18.400
umbilical cord.
These,
this type of cell,
there are two major kinds of stem cells.

82
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:21.460
We only work with one kind,
the Mesenchymal or we just call it [inaudible].

83
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.970
It's a lot easier.
And um,
so anyway,
that's,
that's,

84
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.030
that's how I think we were actually,

85
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.000
we actually owned apartments in the same building and Panama never met each

86
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:31.600
other.
And we met,

87
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.020
we met through his brother finding us on the Internet and then you go,

88
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.000
and then they brought him down to get treatment were we were quite hesitant to,

89
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.150
to take him,
you know,
cause the last thing you don't want is Mel,

90
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.640
Mel Gibson's dad to drop dead in your clinic and he wasn't in great shape,

91
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:50.410
you know,
so he wasn't in good shape at all.
But uh,
you know,

92
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.760
as I recall when he got there,

93
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:55.450
he was in a wheelchair and wasn't talking a lot and things like that.
And Yeah,

94
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.450
having a pretty rough time.
And,
and then,
uh,
so we,

95
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.090
after getting medical clearance for him to actually fly down there and melted

96
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.240
them down there privately,
uh,
then we,

97
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.090
we did some ivs on him first in the clinic and then to do the hip,

98
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.860
we need to do that.
Did some ips.
What do you mean?
So we give the umbilical cord,

99
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:20.330
these are,
these are isolated from the,
the basically the,

100
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.170
the meat of the umbilical cord.
Uh,

101
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.950
they're isolated and they're grown in our laboratory,
which is,
you know,

102
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.090
ISO 9,001 and very high quality and certified by the Ministry of Health.

103
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.260
Um,
the,

104
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.070
they're grown in the laboratory and they're certified to be free of everything

105
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.140
and in any kind of infectious disease.
And,
and,
uh,
I went into this

106
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.770
<v 1>clean rooms and they make it put on hats and gloves and you know,</v>

107
00:06:43.771 --> 00:06:47.370
you feel like all Frankensteined out and you'll walk into these cold rooms and

108
00:06:47.371 --> 00:06:50.520
you're watching cells divided under the microscope.
It's kind of miraculous,

109
00:06:50.521 --> 00:06:51.510
really look at this stuff.

110
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.660
<v 2>So intravenous stem cells,
right?
Intravenous.
That's correct.
And what,</v>

111
00:06:55.661 --> 00:06:58.510
what's the benefit of intravenous stem cells?
Like what does that do?
Well,

112
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.180
the good thing is that this,
this kind of stem cell,

113
00:07:01.181 --> 00:07:03.870
the Mesenchymal stem cells are found throughout your body.
And they're the,

114
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.180
normally what they do is they,
they modulate your immune system,

115
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.840
they decrease inflammation,
and they stimulate regeneration.
So,

116
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.750
and the good thing about them is they tend to home to areas where there is

117
00:07:13.751 --> 00:07:18.520
inflammation.
So intravenously,
they do a lot of things,
uh,
and,

118
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.110
but they can hone to areas of inflammation and uh,
and they,

119
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.760
they really reduce inflammation in the body because they upregulate part of your

120
00:07:27.761 --> 00:07:31.240
immune system that that controls the inflammatory process,

121
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.140
which I can talk more about later.
But,
um,
in his case,
you know,

122
00:07:35.141 --> 00:07:39.820
his kidneys were in trouble.
His heart was in trouble.
And the cells,

123
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.450
they don't,
unlike what we used to think in the early days,

124
00:07:43.451 --> 00:07:45.280
they don't become anything.
These kinds of,

125
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.060
this kind of stem cell does not become anything in your body,
but at homestead,

126
00:07:49.061 --> 00:07:54.061
areas of that need repair and it secretes things that stimulates the repair and

127
00:07:54.131 --> 00:07:56.800
decrease the inflammation and helps out with the immune system.

128
00:07:56.801 --> 00:08:00.450
So the vast majority of what we treat our autoimmune diseases and um,

129
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.150
[inaudible] hots case,
we gave him IB so that,

130
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.900
that he could basically have these things on board.

131
00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:11.590
So creating the,
the secrete the cytokines and the,

132
00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:13.960
and the growth factors that are normally secreted.

133
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.050
And when you're 92 and you have multiorgan failure,

134
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.530
you're basically running on fumes.
And so you put these days,

135
00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:25.531
Jiro young healthy cells and they secrete these things that kind of restarts

136
00:08:25.721 --> 00:08:29.950
everything.
Yeah.
And so what was his response to this IV?
The treatment.

137
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.480
<v 1>Wow.
Uh,
I,
you know,
I,
I could,
I can wax lyrical about that.</v>

138
00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:39.280
He's almost a hundred years old and,
uh,
from pretty bad shape.

139
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.370
It was like bee stings.
It was like he got a new lease of life.

140
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.270
Like he got a big dose locally in the hip,

141
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.730
which a fixed all his inflammation and pain and he started walking again and his

142
00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:56.220
kidneys were good and his heart,
he had a prolapsed valves there and they healed.

143
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.780
<v 2>And uh,
his,
um,
cognitive powers improved.</v>

144
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.140
His eyesight improved.
Whoa.
You know,

145
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.030
and other stuff improves that I,
he would hate me to talk about.

146
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.890
But he had two nurses that reported to me and it was like,
holy mackerel.

147
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.230
Wow.
Using it as a towel rack.
Well,

148
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:26.530
Dan Bilzerian was telling me about intravenous stem cells,
these,

149
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.050
and so his boss route and you know,
boss,
former UFC heavyweight champion,

150
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:31.730
he went down and got some,

151
00:09:31.731 --> 00:09:34.520
he's had some pretty significant neck injuries and neck fusions,

152
00:09:34.521 --> 00:09:37.400
and he said he got intravenous stem cells.
And the way he described his,

153
00:09:37.401 --> 00:09:38.760
like with his Dutch accents,

154
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:43.120
like it was like I had lightning coming off my fingers like that.

155
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:47.210
He can go to you.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
He said it was phenomenal.
I mean,

156
00:09:47.211 --> 00:09:49.700
he said it's one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had.

157
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:53.610
<v 3>Okay.</v>
