00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.250
The phrase quantum is another one that's fraught with woo indeed.

2
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.990
Right.
And some people,
uh,

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.050
like Deepak Chopra and the like,

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.230
they love to use that word because as soon as you use that word,

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.580
you can kind of get away with almost anything afterwards.

6
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.270
<v 1>Yes.
I have to say I have quantum mechanics is a strange thing.</v>

7
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.120
And I saw the blame me for certain things.
I don't want to be unfair here.

8
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.540
I'm not saying that's,
I blame it.
It gives some people got the impression,
okay.

9
00:00:31.541 --> 00:00:33.190
The fact your theory doesn't make any sense.

10
00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:37.090
That's nothing against it said crazy things.
Quantum mechanics is crazy.

11
00:00:37.091 --> 00:00:39.640
So we wanted to except some other crazy theory.

12
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.760
Of course quantum mechanics has the virtue of that.

13
00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:45.990
It does agree with an awful lot of experiments and it gives you a huge insight

14
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:48.400
since the things that that one didn't have before.

15
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.170
So just the fact that it's crazy isn't,
isn't enough to,
to make,

16
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.330
to make it something you should study seriously.

17
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.360
<v 0>Well,
um,
well it's very,</v>

18
00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:02.510
very difficult to understand even for people who study it.
Yes,
indeed.

19
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.460
So for someone like myself,

20
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.720
I'm trying to pay attention to this without devoting my entire life to it and it

21
00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:12.790
gets,
it's becomes a big problem because there's,
yeah.

22
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:13.770
<v 1>Yeah,
I did too.</v>

23
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.780
I I in one of my books I tried to explain there are actually two mysteries in

24
00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:21.020
quantum mechanics and they get muddled.

25
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.160
One of them is the whole subject is pretty crazy.
Yes,

26
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.800
but it's coherent and it makes sense and if you study it properly and you say,

27
00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:32.030
okay,
that makes sense.

28
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.520
And this includes things like non local effects where you can have two things

29
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.840
now they know eating thousands of kilometers apart and you can see these quantum

30
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:42.900
entanglement effects.

31
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.720
So they're are still in some sense connected with each other even though they're

32
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.480
that far apart,
which is pretty amazing.
That's baffling.
It's baffling.

33
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:55.481
But that's part of the comprehensive or part of course it's muddied up because

34
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:59.060
there's the other part which has to do with this collapse of the wave function

35
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.660
and standard quantum mechanics really doesn't make sense.

36
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.740
But people get them muddled in my year you think because this doesn't make sense

37
00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:09.870
and that does mean well,
it's all a bit crazy and so anything crazy is,

38
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.000
is is up for grabs.
But it seems to me that quantum mechanics,

39
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.060
the things which are crazy and they do hang together under the theory works and

40
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:18.890
you understand that that's fine,

41
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.160
but the things which involve the collapse of the wave function,

42
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.340
that's not fine because we don't have the right theory yet.

43
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.660
That's why it doesn't make logical sense because it's not the right theory yet.

44
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.580
That's my view.
I mean I'm a minority and saying this,

45
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.420
most people who study the foundations of quantum mechanics say,
well,

46
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:40.550
we haven't got the right interpretation right yet.

47
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.240
We have to think when it means and so on.
They don't think,
well,

48
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.040
maybe it's not quite right.

49
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.490
Maybe there's something when these effects get big enough,

50
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.140
something else comes in and we,
we need a new insights and new theory.

51
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.610
So that's what I think

52
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.390
<v 0>now in something like super position where something be both still and in motion</v>

53
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:03.910
at the same time.
As soon as you say that.
Yeah,

54
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.580
to the common person like myself,

55
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.260
my brain glazes over and uh,
my eyebrows raised up and I go,
okay,

56
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:11.760
what does,

57
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.220
and then you're talking about entanglement things hundreds of thousands of

58
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.790
kilometers apart that are somehow or another interacting with each other in a

59
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:21.880
way that we don't totally understand or we don't have a theory that absolutely

60
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:24.040
explains in a concrete way,

61
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.700
<v 1>but it does as long as you don't get to the measurement,</v>

62
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.050
the measurement entanglement pot is pretty well understood.
But the measurement,

63
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.530
the measurement part is not busy.

64
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.740
The puzzles about the entanglement is when you come to the measurement,
uh,

65
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.440
he make a measurement over here and the management over there and they can be,

66
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.510
well now I thought I wasn't going to me,
she's apart.

67
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.280
The record was only 143 or something a little while ago.
Wow.
It's a,

68
00:03:47.281 --> 00:03:48.840
it's a long time,
a long distance,

69
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.560
but there's hardly any movement of material.

70
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.950
So the thing that you see in the scheme I have,

71
00:03:55.951 --> 00:04:00.951
which involves the collapse of the wave function involves certain amount of

72
00:04:01.381 --> 00:04:05.250
displacement and mass.
Now,
if it's just photons that's light,

73
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.220
and these experiments tend to be just light,

74
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.960
then there's no mass displacement in the state.
And so sure,

75
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.200
what quantum mechanics says is fine by me.
Okay.

76
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.260
It's hard to get your mind around,
and I certainly agree with that,

77
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.370
but it's logical.
What's not logical comes apart.

78
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.000
But when you worry about the measurement issue and the collapse of the wave

79
00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:30.930
function,
and poor old Schrodinger was very upset by this,
quite right.

80
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.310
Yes.
