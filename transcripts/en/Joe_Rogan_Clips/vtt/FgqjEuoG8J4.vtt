1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
This phone is never slapped in my pocket obviously.
And the one plus.
Yeah.

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.920
You said that that was your favorite phone before the Google Pixel three.
Yup.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.730
And what,
why do you like the Pixel three better than that phone?

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.790
Cause I've heard great things about the one plus.

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.650
I love the oneplus still and I would have no problem using it today.

6
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:20.430
But this camera is so much better than every other phone.
Yeah.

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.760
Now is that because you take a lot of photos for youtube and blogging and that

8
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:29.580
kind of thing?
Yeah,
just social.
I tweet a lot of photos at Instagram,

9
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:33.030
a lot of photos and I just much better.
Yeah,
that's much better.

10
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.531
Then the one plus,

11
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:39.210
which is already a $600 phone and is the one plus what?

12
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:41.760
I mean the the galaxy note nine,

13
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.120
it was supposed to have a very good camera as well.
I can't tell the difference.

14
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:46.320
I'm not good enough.

15
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.240
Most people won't until you put them next to each other and then you kind of go,

16
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.260
oh interesting.

17
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.120
There's a much like when you put an iPhone photo next to a pixel photo,

18
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.410
I phones have notoriously great cameras,
pixels having a choice,

19
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:03.300
the great cameras,
you might be totally fine with either one,

20
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:06.870
but if you put them next to each other you will notice massive differences

21
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:08.040
between the photos.
Yeah.

22
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.090
So did you notice comparisons that are online that we could pull up right now?

23
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.840
Um,

24
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.840
my last one I compare it I a pixel to to iPhone 10 to one plus five t two two

25
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:22.381
other phones.

26
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:25.770
I did like a five camera blind test and what I did was I put the five photos

27
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:29.550
next to each other but didn't tell you which one is which and ABCD or eat and

28
00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:33.120
you go down the list and I have like seven,
eight,
nine photos in a row,
a,
B,
c,

29
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:35.940
d or e.
Pick your favorite one.
A lot of people went with B.

30
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:38.880
A lot of people went with D and they didn't know which one.
It was not the end.

31
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:41.520
I revealed which one was which.

32
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.880
And a lot of people were surprised by which one they picked.
Oh,

33
00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:48.150
I picked the pixel over the iPhone every time.
Really interesting.
Uh,

34
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.100
and a lot of times when you put them side by side,

35
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:53.790
you'll notice like I iPhones like to boost the shadows a lot more so that

36
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.760
they're much more they lit.
Yeah,
this is that aside.
So like a,
B,
c,
d,

37
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.380
n,
e which one do I like better?

38
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.460
And I already can tell immediately which ones the pixel and you might not

39
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.710
because I wreck,

40
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.460
I remember Pixel two had cooler colors and more contrast in any other one.

41
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.950
And this is a great backpack.
Yeah.

42
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.570
So another thing about these is it helps to see it in a high resolution because

43
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.010
that difference in detail and sharpness between them,
uh,

44
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.540
is another thing I paid attention to.
Which ones he,

45
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.780
I want to say that was the one plus,
but I forget now.

46
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.340
I'm pretty sure be as the pixel cause this great knack pack is starting to look

47
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:36.930
a little bit blue and that was a big characteristic of the pixel two from last

48
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.950
year.
And that was a big issue with the screen as well.
Right.
The,

49
00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:42.990
to the Pixel.
Xl.
Yeah.

50
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:46.560
Look at this contrast like you see like all these are like pretty good,

51
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.340
but when you see B and you see how much more contrast that has and you look at a

52
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.670
and how much it's lifted.
The shadows.
Yeah.
He's got,

53
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.940
he's got a pretty even tone and he's also the one plus.

54
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.790
I don't remember what it is.
I'd have to back to the video.

55
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.020
She switched them around with each one every time.

56
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:05.600
It was the same as the same every time.
Be as the same every time.
I know.
Um,

57
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.570
I don't,
I'm already pretty sure that B is the pixel.

58
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.730
Go to go to the top left one with the selfie.

59
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.690
So again,

60
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:18.691
like that gray sweatshirt is starting to look at blue and B and e look how much

61
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.000
higher,
brighter.
Those shadows are.
Like my black hair,

62
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.790
it looks kind of gray at that point.
And then that one.

63
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.580
So there's a lot of things you don't notice until you put them side by side.

64
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.420
It's so nitpicky,
they all look so good.

65
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:36.010
They all look pretty much like the same pair of Syrup.

66
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.750
Yes,
he is a little bit tighter.

67
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:39.800
So I'm gonna go see as the iPhone because the iPhone has,

68
00:03:39.801 --> 00:03:42.910
has a little bit of a tighter selfie camera.

69
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.200
A lot of android phones have a wider angle selfie camera because you can fit

70
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:47.921
more people in them.

71
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:51.190
But Apple's always told me they go with a tighter angle because there's less

72
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:53.050
distortion and they want it to feel more natural.

73
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.340
You just take a picture of yourself and you look great.
Um,

74
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.340
well here we go.
Iphone x?
No.
Okay.

75
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:04.630
So you know too in the household I did add a real camera into the,

76
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.280
into the mix.
I'm a real good,
yeah,
I hope so.
It's $10,000.

77
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.210
That was a real camera looked pretty good film or is that,

78
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.840
it's a photo.
So it's a,
it's a medium format.
50 Megapixel Hasselblad,
x one d.

79
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.810
It's a crazy camera.
Your phone actually.
It's pretty God damn good right there.

80
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:23.440
It does.

81
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.030
But there's just a little bit more to the Pixel to pixel two has,

82
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:29.800
so this is a portrait mode comparison.

83
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.940
So I remember I was trying to test like the blurry background versus an actual

84
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:37.450
good camera.
And whenever you look at these portrait mode photos,

85
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:40.750
what they're doing is they're sort of trying to outline the subject,

86
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.100
keep it sharp and then blur the background artificially and year after year

87
00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:48.550
they've gotten better at this because the fall off between the blur isn't just

88
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:49.990
like a cutout in real life.

89
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.650
You get sort of like a gradient of how much blur you have.

90
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.010
So Pixel two has typically the sharpest cutout and the best like separation

91
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:03.790
between the background where the iPhone kind of just takes the face,

92
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.600
keeps the face sharp,
and then sort of has a more natural fall off.

93
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:11.020
So your body might not be in focus,
uh,

94
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.160
and note eight and it's just not as good.
Yeah.
And that image,

95
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.780
that's a really,
uh,
that in that when you really see how good the pixel to us.

96
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.780
Yeah.
Like that.
And so it takes all three.

97
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.190
Got better at that especially.
Yeah.
So,
and now you can change.
Something.

98
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:28.300
Note was doing last year.

99
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:32.680
You can change how blurred the background is on iPhone 10 s now pixel three,

100
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:35.860
note nine,
all of them.
You can change how blurry the background is.
