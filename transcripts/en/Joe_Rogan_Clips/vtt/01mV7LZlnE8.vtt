00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.630
Studies.
Have you personally had any experience with interdimensional beings?

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.190
Well,
because it's all taboo and people,
let me tell you,

3
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:12.180
I have my hundred percent tell us about it.
Doing DMT.

4
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.730
I 100% communicated with something.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.210
The question is whether that's something was actually in my imagination or in my

6
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:22.020
mind or that something was something that takes place in another dimension.

7
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.280
I don't know.
I can't be sure.
There's no way to put it on a scale.

8
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:27.720
There's no way that throws you run it through a task,

9
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:31.650
but what I do know is that it's the same experience.
I can be sure.
Okay.

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.900
I mentioned Eric Muller,

11
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:38.220
who you know a man Maquel Mahler because he's the one guy willing to let me tell

12
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:40.770
the story.
I've literally talked to,
I see a hundred people.

13
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.490
It's probably more than that because I've known about this for a long time.

14
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.930
He is a Christian,
but he heard about all this,

15
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:51.900
so he went down to a couple places in central South America and did it twice.

16
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.450
Both Times.
It was 30 to 40 people in the group and he's like,
well,
Alex,

17
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.490
I just don't believe in demons.
But I did.

18
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:03.540
She basically aliens coming to the edge of the forest and we were all sharing it

19
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:04.830
and come on,
we're all seeing the same thing,

20
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:08.040
but I think it was a chemical reaction.
You don't have,
if you,

21
00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:09.030
everybody gets drunk.

22
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:12.690
We all think about what happened to us in high school or college or what's good

23
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:14.190
or what's bad.
We all have different experiences.

24
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.030
When you're taking on a hallucinogen and suddenly you're all seeing the same

25
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:21.180
thing,
it just means it clicked off.
The part of your brain is a filter.

26
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:25.200
It's you go crazy because a lot of schizophrenia and people just see more and

27
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:26.940
then they see everything.
It doesn't mean they're right.

28
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.490
It just means that the filter is off.
Well,
I always said,
you'll give her,

29
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.100
run your hand over an insect that can't see.
They have no idea you're there.

30
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.440
They like certain insects.
They just don't see anything,

31
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:40.740
whether it's a centipede or whatever.
And how do,
how do we know what they see?

32
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.760
We don't know.
You're right.
We,
we,
we,
by dissecting dead ones,

33
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:48.050
we have an understanding of what sensors they possess and we can we think a,
B,
a,

34
00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:50.490
B or a fly sees like in a bunch of little,

35
00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:55.320
like I told hexagon that they have different,

36
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.270
yeah.
We don't know what the exact experience was.

37
00:01:57.271 --> 00:02:01.230
I told you the whole story got computers hooked up to the damn bugs.

38
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:05.310
They've got everything hooked up to the bugs.
The differences,
let me tell you.

39
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.160
Yeah,
they've got roped up 35 years ago.

40
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.500
They had remote control rats with microchips.

41
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.310
They could send 500 yards of the alarm dot building shit with a camera on their

42
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:17.090
top.
They had 30 years ago to dolphins too,
right?
Yes.
Trapped.

43
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.330
They've gotten this dolphins head main line,

44
00:02:19.331 --> 00:02:22.350
scientific American roaches with a chip on their head that run around.

45
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.890
The difference is the where the reason that's dangerous is that once you open

46
00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:31.770
that gate,
it's all bad.
They has it all bad.
Why?

47
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:36.771
Why can't you experience that interdimensional being in learned something from

48
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:40.830
it and be a better person who you come out of it because for whatever reason,

49
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.950
at first it's all beautiful.
It's showing you're an ass tech base.

50
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.480
Catnapping all the local tribes and killing whoever's the tall for the smartest.

51
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.490
Every time it gets control,

52
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.790
it starts murdering everybody and it always starts beautiful.

53
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:54.720
It always starts crying.

54
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.350
So you're talking about ancient civilizations with a ritualized psychedelic

55
00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:03.351
drugs and they up killing everybody on every case and every case the priest say

56
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:07.240
we have to pro babies are the fires.
We have a cut their hearts out.

57
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.480
We have to buy congenital.
True or false.

58
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:15.481
Supposedly the mushrooms were used by the Aztecs so that they wouldn't resist.

59
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.800
They'd get them all high on mushrooms.
It was beyond that.

60
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:22.250
We had a cocktail at a cocktail.
They don't resist dozens of hallucinogens.

61
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.000
Intox was they'll give him an enema.
True or false though.

62
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.930
They didn't use mushrooms just to keep them sedated so they get near ground.

63
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.150
It makes sense if you get it,
they killed.
Pull this up.
I think the temple,
I,

64
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.780
I forget how you said t t o con too,
Ican,

65
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.460
but in this one tempo,

66
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:44.461
I think they killed some insane amount of people after it was constructed as

67
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:47.470
after the construction's tens of thousands.

68
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.030
They sacrificed tens of thousands of people that,

69
00:03:50.031 --> 00:03:53.560
the ones that we're actually working to build the temple once they killed

70
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:57.590
everybody and real real university hedge.
Who I,

71
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.820
I want to hear from them.
These are the Mayans.
And they said,
yeah,
no,

72
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:02.140
we're opening here at dimensional gate.

73
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.520
The gods want blood and they didn't take it internally to the mouth.

74
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.910
They would take enemas of dozens of hallucinogenics and alcohol and show the

75
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:15.880
priest would take a couple of drugs and then the priest wanted to communicate

76
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:19.930
with the aliens and the aliens wanted blood and they also show it was more like

77
00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:23.550
we're chopping hearts out.
Yes sir.
Okay.
We did a thousand.
Okay.
The Gates Open.

78
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.080
Here it goes.
Jamie says,
it says they between two.
Wow.

79
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:32.830
Between 10,040,
80,000,

80
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:34.470
400 persons were sacrificed,

81
00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:38.390
sacrificing the ceremony in 1487 when the Aztecs,
uh,

82
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.940
completed the temple.
And how do you say the temple named pull up the,

83
00:04:41.941 --> 00:04:46.330
the the top of it.
How do you say good.
It's uh,

84
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.170
it's all over.
How do you say the temple name?
Oh,

85
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:51.790
it doesn't say that's matching your city.

86
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.470
Tila con I think I'm saying she goes shit each where they think they killed

87
00:04:56.471 --> 00:05:00.010
about 5 billion people.
Flushing.
This is one day fucking insane.

88
00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:03.720
They killed 80,000 people in a couple of days.
That's banana.

89
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.571
That's come out of the way.

90
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:09.571
You go down there and you're walking around in the woods and the Mayan guy goes

91
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.590
the bones and they pick up and you're like,
it's not gravel.
It's petrified.

92
00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:17.410
Bones are everywhere.
Oh my God.
Let me go further.

93
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.970
The priesthood were meet sellers.
This happened in Europe as well.

94
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.080
They would hang people up and the stores,

95
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.790
the market is below the temples and show you would eat the meat and the most

96
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:32.470
valuable meet was warriors.

97
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.620
Like when you won the ball throwing game that went on for days,

98
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.640
they would kill you.
They killed you.
The ones who won were murdered.

99
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.910
This is the thing.
They used to think that they sacrifice the losing team.

100
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.860
Now they realize the sacrifice,
the winning team.

101
00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:46.780
I had a bit about for awhile where I was like,

102
00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:50.980
that must have been the longest fucking game ever to see such a drop in the ball

103
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.270
fucking up.
They were all fighting because they wanted to fund.

104
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.080
They believe they were.
Yeah.

105
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.490
They shed quits caught Lopota on the flying serpent.

106
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.910
[inaudible] the quality app is going to,
you're going to interface,

107
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:07.700
you upload to its brain and you look at their paintings.

108
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:12.380
It's all like space ships and dials and they have perfect in the Spanish museum

109
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:14.740
for 200 years previous on a hoax because there's,
there's,

110
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.460
there's drawings of a 200 year old Spanish,
uh,
textbooks,
but you know,

111
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:23.320
see it a a,
it's about like a half foot long.
It's a,

112
00:06:23.321 --> 00:06:26.720
it looks like a jumbo jet with the windows and the engines.

113
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.330
Two or false.
The Mayans smoked penis blood.
They did.

114
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.373
They did.

115
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.610
What they did was I made that you were just being silly.
No,
no.

116
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.080
That's true.
Selves that they took.
They took long lines of leather.

117
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.200
Chad wore leather and it had it had it had nails on it and,

118
00:06:47.231 --> 00:06:47.540
and,
and,

119
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.280
or had like spiky things that glass and they would put it in their genitals.

120
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.660
Oh,
the most skilled priest,
the high priest,

121
00:06:56.661 --> 00:07:01.030
while they were sacrificing people for our thinking,
hallucinogens would,

122
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.440
would like not try to cut his testicles off,

123
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:07.160
but all of the most skilled would sit there and draw them through their smoke,

124
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.270
the blood
toxic to their ancestors.

125
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:14.800
The lower the lower priest within pulling up to the answer,

126
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.880
they would put it on sacred leaves and then they would smoke the genital blood

127
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:24.280
of the high priest and they would talk to the ancestors.

128
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.080
I believe it's just fun.
People are so goofy.
Look,

129
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:29.780
if you see those African ladies with a giant plates in their lips,

130
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.660
if you believe that other,
the next,
the next,
yeah.
How about that?

131
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:35.210
They stress their necks out to the point where if they take those things out

132
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.350
ahead,
head will fall off.

133
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.080
People are willing to do all kinds of crazy things to their body.

134
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.380
I'm not surprised they,
they'd smell blood.
