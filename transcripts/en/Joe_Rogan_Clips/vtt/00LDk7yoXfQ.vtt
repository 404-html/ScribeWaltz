1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.750
We just lost Brody Stevens just died.
Got off his meds.
Yeah.

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.130
He,
um,
he,
he didn't like the way it felt to be on them and you know,

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.870
so he's so hard.

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.130
That's such a hard one to tape because everyone loved that guy.

5
00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:19.480
And to think that everyone,
I mean,
he has no haters.
I don't know.

6
00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:23.470
A single person was like,
that guy was a dick.
No,
no,
no,
no one.

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.331
Everyone loved them.

8
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:27.310
And everybody really hard from close friends to people who just knew him a

9
00:00:27.311 --> 00:00:31.570
little bit.
Like I knew him just a little bit.
He was so sweet,
but he was so,

10
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.700
so tortured.
He was just in pain all the time.
And yeah,
it's just,

11
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.800
it's so strange that you think the thing that people like most is for other

12
00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:44.920
people to love them and care about them.
And everybody loves Brody,

13
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.600
but yet he couldn't.
It just couldn't go on.
But I never,

14
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.360
I've never known Brodie to have a relationship.

15
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.450
I've never known him to have a special someone in his life.

16
00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:59.260
And I mean that alone probably be very,

17
00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:01.010
very depressed as well,

18
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.260
especially if if everyone loves you but you don't feel connected to any of them.

19
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.880
Right.
Like how empty that feels.
And that's the core of depression.

20
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.160
Yeah.
But it's also the core of depression I had having had depression.
Yeah.

21
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.240
One of the things that hits you is that feeling that you just can't connect and

22
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.230
it was yours coming about when your first marriage was breaking up.
I mean,

23
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:23.940
I have lifelong depression,

24
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.040
but I didn't get it treated until that point when it was like,
you know,

25
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.970
it was like,
uh,
yeah.

26
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:33.480
Cause of the marriage was breaking up and I had to fly to Africa twice in a

27
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.590
month to send my kids.

28
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.000
And I remember the time that like a protected a reporter from you all at the

29
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:43.350
TCA.
Yeah.
He was on malaria medication and drinking,

30
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.650
which apparently enough,

31
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.810
super sweet kind Dave was,

32
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:53.230
was going to kick someone's ass and I literally had to like hold on to him.

33
00:01:53.231 --> 00:01:56.280
I kind of want to see that I wasn't,
I hadn't because that was,
yeah,
the thing,

34
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:59.280
I just been been flown to Africa twice and it just got back.

35
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:03.780
We did the tcs and I think I also threw a glass at uh Oh fuck.

36
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:08.010
I'm blanking on his name.
Tony.
Tony,
Tony,
Tony,
uh,
Jesus.

37
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.530
Fuck them blankets and a nice guy.
Sorry Dude.
We're handle Tony.
Jesus.

38
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.730
I love Tony's a great guy but I was like out of my skull and I just,
yeah,

39
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.730
well that was,
that was her partner.
I took his report.

40
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:24.960
You took his tape recorder and Duncan and his drafts and threatened to kick his

41
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:27.030
ass.
Yeah,
cause I was,
yeah,

42
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:31.020
I was drunk and I was like,
oh my God,

43
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.840
go ahead to do something.
Sorry I missed this.
I have to stop this.

44
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.450
Oh this is crazy.
Yeah.
Well then it was after that that,

45
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:42.960
that I just went on antidepressants because I crashed really hard after that and

46
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:45.930
it was like one the things about that go to work,
you can't do anything.

47
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.280
You were experiencing that combination apparently of the malaria medication and

48
00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:55.281
alcohol is like a crazy conversation and then you add to that jet lag and the

49
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:59.920
trauma of being separated from my kids,
the malaria pills on their own.
Thank you.

50
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:04.300
Mentally I looked her,
I left Harare,
uh,

51
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.920
to the sound of my,
My,
my eldest child screaming,
daddy don't go.

52
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.860
Which even now I can't talk about,

53
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.980
Ooh God.
See,

54
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:22.120
it's not worth having kids.
No,
no,
it isn't.
Yeah,

55
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.530
I have one.
I have a 17 year old.
Yes,
it's good.
They're on their own now.

56
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.890
In the year you could just write him off.
Yeah,
that's right.

57
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.960
Next year he's going to call it.
But anyway,
if you are out there,

58
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.000
get on meds and stay on them,
like Brody should've stayed on his meds.
Well,

59
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.541
you know,

60
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:45.541
I just wish we could evolve known how he was and how close he was to that.

61
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.180
Yeah.
Well that's the thing.
It's like people who think like,
uh,
like suicide,

62
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.520
things that if you're close to suicide,

63
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:58.390
it's the most rational choice you'll ever make when you're,

64
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:02.320
when you're that close.
It just seems like the most sensible way to go.

65
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.980
That was the issue is because it's otherwise it's too much pain.
Yeah.

66
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.230
I heard someone describe it as,
um,
it's not even an emotional decision burning.

67
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.690
It's jumping out of a burning building.

68
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.680
It's like there's that choice into the burning building,

69
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:18.250
or was that feeling where you go,
this is not an emotional decision?
I mean,

70
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:22.330
there's no choice.
I've had two friends hang themselves as here.
Yeah.
Wow.

71
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.920
Yeah.
I mean,
that,
that is,
I never thought I would ever say that.

72
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.880
They never thought that that would be a way that people would be going out

73
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:35.110
either.
Yeah.
Or remember what we had Drake say there.
Yeah.
Oh,

74
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:40.090
he was hard.
Yeah.
That was a hard one.
I knew Drake back in the,
uh,

75
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.900
essentially my open Mike days.
He was a,

76
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:46.990
an established comedian in Boston and I was just starting out.

77
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.020
Oh yeah.
