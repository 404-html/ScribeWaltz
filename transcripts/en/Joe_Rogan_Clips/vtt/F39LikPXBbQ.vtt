WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.350
Right?
Yeah,
there's a void there.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.240
They need to fill some people addicted to eating.

3
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.040
Those are the same addiction essentially,

4
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.170
but one is a lot better to have than the other.

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.830
You know,
it's like even with,
I mean there's even with Kanye,
right?

6
00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:18.831
Like I see Kanye as like this guy who's just wildly insecure and he's trying to

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.450
justify his coolness constantly by taking things that are not cool at all and

8
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.740
making them cool within a community,
within his community.
Right?

9
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.430
So it's like everything Kanye does like down to like,

10
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:39.030
it started with like the wasp culture.
I'm going to take like preppy New England,

11
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.541
you know,

12
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:43.560
polos that are pink and shit and I'm going to make that cool now before the hip

13
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:45.270
hop community.
I mean,
I grew up in New York,
we were like,
Yo,

14
00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:48.360
that's some gay shit bro.
What the fuck is that now?
Kanya where's it's like,
Nah,

15
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:51.720
you gotta look fly in this,
these pink waspy things in my Khakis,
whatever.

16
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.450
Then he takes grunge culture,
right?
There's fuck,

17
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:57.540
have you seen the bright that's ripped sweaters and all that kind of shit?

18
00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:00.420
That's Seattle Nirvana.
Shit.
But he's like,
Yo,
I bet I'm so cool.

19
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:04.290
I could make it cool.
Right?
They takes dad sneakers.
I'm so cool.

20
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.760
I could you take my community loves cool sneakers.
I'm gonna make dad sneakers.

21
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.960
Cool.
And then what is the most uncool thing to his community?

22
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.310
What Trump
and what does he try to make?
Cool.

23
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.410
It's selfish is all about him.
Oh,

24
00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:27.411
he cares is about proving that he's that dude and he takes the most uncool thing

25
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:31.110
and puts it on his head and he's like,
Yo,
I'm going to make Magda cool.

26
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.170
And that's when people are like,
at least his community was like,
Nah,

27
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:35.320
we're not going to,
we're not going to play it.
Play with

28
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.350
<v 1>that shit.
You know what I think?
I think,
uh,</v>

29
00:01:38.351 --> 00:01:41.530
you know how like you have something that's supposed to take like eight volts.

30
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.870
You have like a charger.
Yeah.
It's supposed to take,

31
00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:45.940
like when you go to Europe and you plugged your shit,
right.

32
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.520
Well like when you plug something into the wall,

33
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.080
like we have alternating current,

34
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.720
like you could have something that takes way more amperage.

35
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.260
I think Kanye has the wrong plug to the universe and in a,

36
00:01:58.931 --> 00:02:03.220
in a good way with that mother fuckers getting like a hundred volts all the
time.

37
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.890
So he wants to deal,
he ever talk to him?
No.

38
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.210
I talked to him on the phone and it was a stream of consciousness that was so

39
00:02:10.211 --> 00:02:14.320
intense.
I was like,
okay,
now I get it.
I kind of go,
we had a long conversation.

40
00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:15.280
He's a very nice guy.

41
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.000
We had a long conversation for like 1520 minutes on the phone,

42
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.150
which is a long conversation these days on the phone.
Yeah.
Blew the fuck.

43
00:02:22.151 --> 00:02:25.780
Talks to the phone anymore.
He does.
Yeah.
But you're at your thing.

44
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.550
He's getting a hundred volts bro.

45
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.240
He's got design going through his head and new song lyrics and new fashion and

46
00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.630
all this.
And I think he's just catching whatever he can.
Yeah.

47
00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:42.060
And holding onto it and waiting through the waves to fill them.

48
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.990
But I don't know to fill,
there's a little bit of that.
But uh,

49
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.330
with him it's almost like affirming that he's okay because he's so much

50
00:02:49.331 --> 00:02:53.350
different than everybody else.
Like Elon Musk,
like a lot of other people.
Sure.

51
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.220
Pete,
what's up?
Did,
uh,
when he used the confederate flag,

52
00:02:57.221 --> 00:03:01.620
do you know about his statements on that?
He,
he said that like,
he,

53
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.850
he used this in a quote,
what does he say?
Oh,

54
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.920
react how you want any energy's good energy.

55
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:08.290
The confederate flag represents slavery in a way.

56
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.010
That's my abstract take on what I know about it.
Right?

57
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.550
So I wrote the song new slaves,
so we the confederate flag and made it my flag.

58
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.790
It's my flag.
Now what are you going to do?
Not what are you going to do?

59
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.950
It's how can I take my equity and see if I'm so dope?

60
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.070
But that's also his recognition that you can take something like the n word and

61
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:33.280
use it as a positive.
You could do anything.
I mean,
look,
if,

62
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.150
if black people really decide,
I used to do this bit,
okay,
go.

63
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.370
I used to as bit about,
uh,

64
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.870
to remember when the fucking duck dynasty guy was,

65
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.170
he was talking a lot of shit about gay people was like,
I don't understand it.

66
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.980
I don't understand.
And I was like,
look,
I don't understand yellow cars.
Shit.

67
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.520
If you understand why you wasting all your time.
Yeah,

68
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.660
you better be nice because I go,
if you keep fucking with gay people,

69
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.270
they're going to do something and they're going to do something and you're not

70
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:02.230
gonna be able to take it back.

71
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.400
Like what if gay people decided to take over Cammo and the bit was like,

72
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:10.990
look what they did to the rainbow.
I go own the rainbow.
I go,

73
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:14.850
you can't wear a rainbow shirt anymore.
Everybody like bath.

74
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.360
He used to be leprechauns and pots of gold.
Now it's dude's,

75
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:24.361
but fucking would have to do is start off every gay porn in a duck blind two

76
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:31.051
dudes cammo dynasty and you get the gayest black guy in the world in camels like

77
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:35.110
some about duck hunting,

78
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.160
make me holidays and some dude just drops in out of nowhere.

79
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.290
I'm pulls his camel down to the sucking his dick.

80
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.040
If they just had all porno in camera,
it would turn Cam.

81
00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:50.770
I went to a gay thing and if black people just just went whole hog on the

82
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:54.550
confederate flag,
look at them.
They got Cammo wallpapers son.
Absolutely.

83
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:56.500
That's like some Andy Liba.
Which shit though?

84
00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:59.470
That's like some vanity fair cover nonsense.
You know,

85
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:02.790
that's like some organized shoot.
Very Metta.
Those are weird.

86
00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:04.690
Or what they're doing now.
These guys are smart.
They are,
by the way,

87
00:05:04.691 --> 00:05:09.030
that's a shit pattern.
That's a bad cammo pattern.
All ducks ducks.

88
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.650
Maybe it's,
there's,
it might be their pattern.
So I bet it is a swamp.

89
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:19.520
It's like,
I dunno,
the gay shit is like,
you know,
it's just,

90
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.330
it's not the climate for it.
And I feel you.
Oh,
it could be.

91
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.590
Don't you mean remember deliverance,
but it's really like a pig.
Yeah,

92
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:30.790
but that was,
that was rape.
Yay.
That was Cambridge.

93
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.550
Everybody says it's not sex.
It's about power.

94
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:39.310
Well then they didn't do it right,
but they also didn't get raped.

95
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.780
Let's get a fuck you,
I mean,

96
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.910
powers of part of it for sure,
but they're just going to fuck you man.
Fuck.

97
00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:52.210
Like this ain't sex,
bro.
Just so we're clear,
bro.
That guy is fucking you.

98
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.620
This is about sex and power.
I get it.
You're not gay,
but it's still suck.

99
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.270
People want it,
man.
That's the thing.
I don't know.

100
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.740
I think the Kanye thing like he's just a guy who thinks way different.

101
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.170
Like for whatever reasons,
the connections.

102
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:09.290
That's one of the reasons why I think this Kim Dash in relationship works so

103
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:14.291
well is cause like I bet she just handles normal regular stuff and he could just

104
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:20.000
be Kanye.
You know what I mean?
Like it seems like they've,

105
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.730
does he think people how different death defense

106
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.680
tell me.
Convince me because the music is phenomenal outside of that.
Okay.

107
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:34.250
It's real simple.
Yeah.
Have you ever been locked up in a mental institute?
No.

108
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.700
He has.
Yeah.
They don't just lock you up bro.
They never locked me up.

109
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.070
You know my wife Never,
I never came home.

110
00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:44.060
My wife has some fucking two gorillas that are in those,

111
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:46.940
a lab suits that are staring at me.
I'm like,
what's with the big guys?

112
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.600
Big Guys are going to take it to a nice hospital.
Like sure,

113
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:54.670
we'd like to handle this quietly.
What the fuck.
I'm not going with some hospital.

114
00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.160
I can't spell good leg kicks Gel.
You don't just go to the mentalist too,
bro.

115
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.930
They fucking,
they velcro.

116
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:06.440
You put the mental tissue doesn't mean that you are genius.

117
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.190
There's a lot of crazy people who are just crazy.
Yeah,
yeah.

118
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.930
Well he's definitely crazy.
Sure.
But he's also,

119
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.020
but he's brilliant to see the work that comes out of that crazy is genius work.

120
00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:17.840
Right.

121
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.840
So what is it about him that allows him to be so prolific as an artist here?

122
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.710
Notice how prolific is.
Yeah,
so you guys constantly,
constantly banging out songs,

123
00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:31.250
Khan and there,
there's,
he doesn't have bad albums.
No,
he's,

124
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.640
he is phenomenal at music without a doubt.
Phenomenal at music.

125
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:37.790
But this is all from this energy that's inside of him.

126
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.910
He figures out how to channel that energy and put it in good ways,

127
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:44.060
but occasionally,
like it's not awesome.
It's easy.
It's not a coincidence.

128
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.900
It's not a coincidence that when Kanye was on stage,

129
00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:51.290
I think it was in San Jose and he said that he didn't vote,

130
00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:53.030
but if it was going to vote,
he would have voted for Trump.

131
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.940
And the crowd went crazy and they booed the shit out of him.

132
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.270
And then he canceled his tour and then he went to demand mental health
institute.

133
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.200
All that shit happened together because he felt the pain of this.

134
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.050
Then his response to that was to double down.

135
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.970
His response to that was to attribute qualities to Trump that he doesn't even

136
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.990
really have.
Right.
And so Trump in his,
in a lot of ways,

137
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.870
very wise,
the way he handles things socially,

138
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.920
he let Kanye coming to the White House where that maggot hat and just ramped up

139
00:08:21.921 --> 00:08:25.370
a storm.
So Kanye could define who Trump was.

140
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.340
He could defy what loving Trump meant.

141
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:30.470
Should we get defined why black people should,
should embrace Trump.

142
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.510
He could define all this in his head to sort of justify what went wrong with
him.

143
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.420
Right?
And then Trump just sits there and goes like this and let them talk.

144
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.700
And then he leaves.
The Trump goes,
what the fuck?

145
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.270
Phone call or it's a pizza Dick.
Suck

146
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.310
this shit right here.
That's it.

147
00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:52.050
This is now look at that white lady with her arms crossed in the background.

148
00:08:52.051 --> 00:08:56.850
Like what in the fuck I need to know like what the fuck am I watching?

149
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.560
The blonde chick right there in the center.
Look at her face.
She's like,
okay,

150
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:05.400
what that's her face says,
okay,

151
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:09.900
what Kanye is like showing Donald Trump his phone and cut Donald Trump's get his

152
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:14.190
lips,
purse,
phone.
Amazing.
Cushner show me some lyrics.

153
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:19.050
Devious smile.
Coasters face dude.
Dude.

154
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.200
How about the black dudes sitting there like,
I can't believe I have

155
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.270
just
face.
He's like,

156
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:31.230
what in the fuck do I do when I get fired from here?
Cause I know it's coming.

157
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.700
I know it's government

158
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.140
about the dude in the back of the beard who get the brother in the back.

159
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.250
He's like,
man,
fuck it up.
You gotta be fucking Shit.

160
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:45.720
Me Ryan Gosling with the boom mic.
Oh look at that guy.
Yes,

161
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.060
Magda all the way.
He's like,

162
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.660
I can't wait to get on Gab and talk about this amazing meeting of the minds to

163
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.760
look at his face.
Has who Trump reached out to,
you know,

164
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:01.170
I'm friends with his son though.
Like text friends.
Really?
Yeah.
He's a nice guy.

165
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:02.004
He's a hunter.

166
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.120
We know each other through mutual friends and one of our mutual friends who

167
00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:11.040
committed suicide.
Oh Shit.
So I was like,
no,
but,
uh,
he's a nice guy.
I mean,

168
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.620
I don't agree with a lot of things that,

169
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.920
a lot of people that I know agree with.
Yeah.
I think,

170
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.120
I think we're allowed to be reasonable and cordial with each other.
Yes.

171
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.540
What's the matter?
What are you laughing at?

172
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.780
What is Jim Brown was also sitting at that luncheon.
