Hello Freak bitches.
How about Donald Trump going hard at ESPN?

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.880
Yeah,
but he's wrong.
He's so we're leaving.
No,

3
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:12.700
there were ratings are up like that's so crazy.
Ravens aren't up.

4
00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:14.940
Are they down because of him?

5
00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:18.210
People leaving cable and somebody said that the ratings are up though.

6
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.910
Recent ratings.
Maybe.
Maybe.
I just read things and I just go with them.

7
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.210
NFL is back.
I mean they're just up because the summer's over,
but,

8
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:30.180
but in general they're down just in,
you know,
ESP,

9
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:32.850
they had all those cuts who had kind a bunch of people budget cuts.

10
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:35.570
He cut so much talent,
but that was it.
Oh,
what's her name?
Jim.

11
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.830
The hill came out was like on her,
granted she is an employee,
the of ESPN,

12
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:44.820
but on her personal social media on Twitter,
she was saying he's a race,

13
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:47.640
stuff like that.
He's a white supremacist and a,

14
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.820
she said he's the worst president of her lifetime and a lot of people said that.

15
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.250
It's just the fact that she's a public media figures.

16
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:55.740
Everybody wanted her fired and that this is like,

17
00:00:55.741 --> 00:00:58.560
it's weird outrage culture we live in.
Right.

18
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.110
She's entitled to Her fucking opinion.
Now,
the thing is,

19
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.200
does ESPN want people on their network being all political and talking about

20
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.720
shit like that on their social media and do they have rules about that?

21
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.580
Because some companies do have rules about that,

22
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:12.960
whether you agree with those rules or not.

23
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.020
Some companies do have rules on what you can and can't say on social media,

24
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.150
but here's the thing that I found fascinating.

25
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.590
Donald Trump didn't talk about her,
talked about ESPN.

26
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.560
I thought that was a chicken shit thing to do.

27
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.480
Like there was a woman who works for ESPN.
Hold on.
Oh yes,
that's true.

28
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.960
That's what I'm saying.
There's a woman that works for Espn,

29
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.740
a very specific person,
not ESPN.
You know,

30
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.130
telling lies should apologize or whatever the fuck he wrote.

31
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.400
He didn't call her out.
He didn't call her out.
I think he's,

32
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.250
he seems like he's knows he can't do it,
especially not now.

33
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.160
Everybody thinks you're a white supremacist can pick on the black lady.

34
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.200
He picked on Rosie O'donnell all day long.
Right?
He'll go after everybody else.

35
00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:58.440
Call him a loser girl,
Miss America.

36
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:00.630
And her little speech slammed him too.

37
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:03.530
She would like said all bunch of shit about him.
And did you see this Jones?

38
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.240
The host does that Kirk Cameron,
it looks like Kirk Cameron.

39
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.790
That's homeboy from survivor.
Who is it from survivor?
I'm sorry.
Not from thrive.

40
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:12.960
Some bachelor Bachelorette.

41
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.110
You ever seen him getting roasted and when he's accused of cheating on his girl

42
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.260
classic anyways,
yeah,
that Miss America,

43
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.770
she said Brown shit about Trump and no one's going after her necessarily.

44
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:26.070
She's quote unquote gaining millions of fans right now.
Right.

45
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:30.590
But what's interesting is I watched someone posted something about uh,

46
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.100
Anthony Bordain.
Anthony Bordain was caught by TMZ of the airport.
Okay.

47
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.000
Very quick.
Sort of silly interview.
They ask them a question,

48
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.170
if you had to cook for Kim Jong Lewin and Donald Trump,

49
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.550
what would you serve?
And he goes,
hemlock.
And he walks away.
It's a joke.

50
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.360
It's a fucking,
one line is also funny.
He's a funny guy.

51
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.630
He says a one liner and all these people are saying,

52
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:59.550
should he be fired from CNN for saying that he would poison Trump if he had who

53
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.320
you know,
good luck to secret service is going to contact you.

54
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.940
And so I look at his fucking Twitter page man and it's crazy.

55
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.870
All these fucking psychos are telling the secret service.

56
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:11.800
They should investigate it.

57
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:16.750
CNN or are you going to fire him like you fired razor as long with people,
man,

58
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.660
outrage out.
Excuse me,
outrage culture.

59
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.960
People are getting excited about things being outrageous instead of just going

60
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.180
the fuck this weed is got me coffin instead of just looking at it and going,

61
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:29.950
well I don't agree with that.
Fuck that guy.

62
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.260
Or going well that was obviously a joke,

63
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:35.620
which was like the normal person would do it.
Like affects you like not at all.

64
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.850
Do you really think that Anthony Bordain wants to fucking poison Donald Trump

65
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.570
and they should lose your jobs?
Exactly.
Well hills,

66
00:03:42.571 --> 00:03:46.570
she's amazing by the way she's raised on his culture.
Outrage culture.

67
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.660
People just decide they can try to affect something and then things start

68
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:51.970
getting ramped up.
The momentum kicks in.

69
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.090
All these other people jump on board and they get excited about being a part of

70
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:57.690
a group that wants to get Anthony Bordain kicked off these yesterday,

71
00:03:57.691 --> 00:04:01.240
what they want,
some sort of weird direction.

72
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.910
They think they're important enough where they can get these people fire and

73
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:05.350
they think if they get together enough,

74
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:07.300
they're going to have the power to affect that person's life.

75
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.150
Even believe they're right.
Bunch of pitches.
Right.

76
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.040
And I kept seeing,
you know,
threatening the life of Potus.
I kept saying,

77
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.880
you've got it.
What are you talking about?
The king,
you guys are out of your mind.

78
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:21.670
This is a person with a terrible job.
[inaudible] game of Thrones.

79
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.340
Donald Trump is a person with a job that no one wants.
Okay.

80
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.560
That's what he is doing a good job at it.
No,

81
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.840
but is anybody doing a good job at it?
No.

82
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.790
<v 1>Okay.</v>
