00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.910
Can,
I know youtube got like 2 million subscribers.
Really?

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.110
Like on Twitter I have 12 million people following.
It's a lot,
man.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.400
That's a lot quells medium people following me.
My Brazilian Instagram,

4
00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:14.640
I got like 1.5 million people.
People.

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.540
People are very active in social media in Brazil.
It is good.

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.630
It's something that is from our nature to connect with people in Brazil.

7
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:27.480
So that's why social media huge any was,

8
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.900
it was like an alternative for the traditional media.

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.460
What does this the most personal Twitter,
look at you motherfucker.

10
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.590
I got a story on the New York Times.
That's crazy.

11
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:44.400
New York Times magazine saying you're the most influential person on Twitter.

12
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:45.900
That's incredible.
Now what?
Why?

13
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:48.720
Why are they saying you're the most influential would,

14
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.830
what were you doing that was influencing people?
I have no idea.

15
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.620
I was surprised.

16
00:00:55.621 --> 00:01:00.360
One day I woke up and it was a story on the New York Times saying that it was

17
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:05.361
the most inflammation profile on Twitter and in second place the Dalai Lama take

18
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:09.240
this one Dalai Lama,
I'll by my third

19
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.330
I was the first one.
So these,
they did like a huge story about me.
Wow.

20
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.020
And incredible.
It was man,
Twitter was something huge in Brazil.

21
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.260
What is the difference between the way people use Twitter in Brazil and America?

22
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.090
Is there a difference?
No.
For for me,
I just used Twitter for jokes.

23
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:30.860
That's what I did for quite some time.
It was a,

24
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.380
Twitter lost a lot of his strength in Brazil because people like to connect.

25
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.800
Assault.
Facebook is huge and Instagram is huge.

26
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:43.900
So you have your family over there,
you have a,

27
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.510
you'll have everything,
you'll,

28
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.410
hey you have your people but you feel talking you for just like scrape.

29
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.140
Twitter feels like you're screaming and someone is going to listen.

30
00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.530
It's not like on Facebook that people follows you and then if he likes shoe,

31
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.370
your post is going to be like in the,
in the top of his page.
Twitter.

32
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.600
There's just something that is there.
So it lost a lot of power in Brazil.

33
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.590
But one thing that is happening right now is our new president and we have a new

34
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:17.610
president now that is a right wing guy who was just elect and then he got

35
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:20.790
stabbed.
He was like,
when did he get stabbed?

36
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:24.000
There was like two months ago real during the process of the election.

37
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:28.650
Holy Shit got stabbed in the gut,
like Whoa,
did you see that?

38
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:32.160
And that was crazy.
I didn't hear about that and he's like a very white rain.

39
00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:37.161
He won the election and he is trying to do with Twitter with Trump did whether

40
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:42.320
he's doing and here like run instead of going to press conferences and in

41
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.530
everything who just go on Twitter and see what he wants.
Wow.
Yeah.

42
00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:51.531
Twitter is a unique in the way people just use it to insult people and so angry,

43
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.000
so angry.
Like if you just,

44
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.420
only if you didn't know anything about people and you just looked on Twitter and

45
00:02:59.421 --> 00:03:02.770
you just like saw how we like when people must be fighting in the streets,

46
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.940
it must be just a bloodbath out there if you really thought that people

47
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:09.460
interacted in the real world.
The way they do on Twitter,

48
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.730
you would think that everywhere is just weapons and clubs and getting shit,

49
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.990
running people over with cars,
wishing everyone dies.
But I think man,

50
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:21.220
there's a difference and I think we have to knowledge that there's a difference

51
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:24.880
between your behavior on the web and outside of the lab for sure.

52
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.460
And sometimes you don't realize that,
oh,

53
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:32.080
the ward is boarding is sensitive and everything else if you go outside is not

54
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:33.350
that much.
It's the same.

55
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.650
It was always a distorted lens that you could see humans through.

56
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.870
It's not how people really are and it's also,

57
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.320
it's not a healthy way to communicate because you don't worry about what the

58
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:46.150
person thinks about what you're saying.

59
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:49.990
You're saying things that you don't necessarily even really mean because you're

60
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:54.870
trying to be inflammatory,
you know,
took to get some attention.
Yeah,

61
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.610
I mean that's a lot of it.
A lot of is just screaming,

62
00:03:57.611 --> 00:04:00.070
screaming for attention and insulting people,

63
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.060
and then you look at people's pages.
That's the most disturbing thing to me.

64
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.710
When someone say something Shitty to me,

65
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:09.010
I'll go to their page and I see that just saying it's shitty things all day
long,

66
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:13.870
like kind of life is this man so fucking terrible life.
What I'm doing right now,

67
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:17.200
I have the series that had one Instagram where I just,

68
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:22.360
I get like the Guy Kersey me or saying some shit about me and I just show his

69
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:26.560
face and it's enough.
And it's funny because it's,

70
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.950
it's funny to see who is Zach Kuwait's me.

71
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.100
Then I called this,

72
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.490
the people who hates me and then I put wicked wrote and then only his,

73
00:04:35.491 --> 00:04:40.120
like his face is done.
The Nao.
It's enough for you to see how that's fucking,

74
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.300
you don't have to take things too serious because if you take a look of their

75
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:47.860
lives it's,
you can see why they are so mad.
Yeah,
there's,

76
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:49.930
there's a lot of that.
There's a lot of angry and they'll,

77
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:53.080
most of them have private accounts.
Like you can't look at their pictures.

78
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.690
They're hiding,
they're hiding who they are.

79
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.500
They just talk shit in the comments that showed an bro.
Yeah.
That's weak shit.

80
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.880
[inaudible] that shade.
So we giving people a chance to like,

81
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:07.730
it's row blind shots,
man,
this crazy.
I think that the,

82
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.490
the being anonymous on the web,
it's a good,

83
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.630
he's a good thing because it allows you to be free at the same time.

84
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.100
A good for whistle blowers,
for people like proporting crimes,
reporting,

85
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:22.810
corruption scores,
you know,
like that.
For that it's critical.
That is,
that is a,

86
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:26.290
uh,
there's a way to do it and they'll expose yourself,

87
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.060
but at the same time he creates that,
but it's,
you know,

88
00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:30.490
it's the sign up for the new era,
Bro.

89
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.540
Just a new thing that we all have to navigate.
Is it just a new thing?

90
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.990
And it's like we were talking about earlier with social media being so recent in

91
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:38.681
human history,

92
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:42.730
there's never been anything where you could just talk to the whole world and do

93
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:46.300
it from your phone while you're sitting at a red light.
You could say something.

94
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.870
There's a story about this woman wasn't named Justine Sacco was out the woman's

95
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:54.430
name who said something racist and went to a plane.
Yes,
yes.

96
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.450
She said,
uh,
I'm going to Africa.
Hope I don't get aids.
Just kidding.

97
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:04.250
I'm white,
lol.
So she was fucked up on Ambien and she was a,

98
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:06.620
or a Xanax or ambien.
I forget what it was she was,

99
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:09.730
she was on some sort of psych medication.
Okay.

100
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.850
And something that affects your brain and drank too.

101
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:15.080
She had a couple of drinks,

102
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.100
just thought she was being funny and then wakes up 16 hours later in Africa and

103
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:23.030
her life is over.
That's crazy.
Fucking crate.

104
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.950
And it was just one of those days where there was like a slow news cycle and

105
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.870
people just jumped on that tweet.

106
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:34.220
And the thing about it too is that they don't want you to recover from something

107
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:37.610
like that.
They want,
that's,
that's you for the rest of your life.

108
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.580
That's what I felt.
That's what I felt.
I'm the baby fucker.

109
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.460
Yeah.
So everything that I say right now,
it's like,
wasn't cute.

110
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.390
Like fucking babies and all fuck the babies.

111
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.980
I don't think they're attractive.
I don't feel,
I don't feel attracted at all.
