1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.270
There's a,
there's just a bunch of different ways.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.300
That's the beautiful thing about MMA.
There's a bunch of different ways to do it,

3
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:10.530
man.
There's Ben Ascaris way just grab ahold une.
Gorilla fuck.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.230
Begged me to the ground is my man to like,
love that dude.

5
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.530
I've known Ben since before he started fighting.
Like he,
he came,

6
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:21.180
stayed at my house,
my dog bit him and shit.
You had a little Chihuahua.

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.250
Beethoven Shit.
Ben.
Yeah,
Ben is my homeboy man.
And I think that,
uh,

8
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.220
I was nervous about him going into UFC because I was thinking it,
you know,

9
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:32.940
they was going to get him too late.
Yeah.
You know,
because like when he,
you know,

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.630
but I still,
I think he's still,
he's in his glory.
He's,
he's never taken any day.

11
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.990
He never takes no damage.
So I was just nervous that they get them too late.

12
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.350
But you know,
Ben has been instrumental and Tyron Woodley's camps.
I mean,

13
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:46.290
he's just,
his brain is just like,
we think on the same lines.

14
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.810
He's a brilliant guy and he's always sending me books.

15
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.600
Ingestions like he's smarter shit.
Yeah.

16
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.610
But he's also very analytical in his approach.
He's not,
he's not gonna,

17
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.730
you know,
no disrespect to George Grew Gel,
but have George go gel,

18
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:03.500
abandoned his Jujitsu and just start banging.
Ben's not,
no,
no.
He,

19
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.980
he's never going to do that.
Never happened.
And I liked the way he thinks too.

20
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.280
He's like,
you know,
like he didn't,

21
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:12.380
he doesn't spend time away from what he's good at.
He stays in that row.

22
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.310
Always coaching.
Constantly wrestling.
Yeah.
Yeah.

23
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.640
He's always coaching kids.
But I mean even even with himself,
like we'll go,

24
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:21.660
we'll go up there.

25
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.010
Depending China for nothing will go up and Ben will give Tyron how ever many

26
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:29.820
rounds he needs.
Real.
Yeah.
You know,
most guys,
I got to bring it like two,

27
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:33.930
three guys and they get time or some work battle,
give them work no matter what.

28
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.200
No matter what kind of shape he's in,
he gives higher and work well.

29
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.790
He was talking about,
you know,
if they do open up that 165 pound division,

30
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:44.530
which I guess they're talking about because there's so much talent and a

31
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.780
division.
I really think if they moved it to 75 and they had a 65,
75 85,

32
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:49.950
I think that's better.
Yeah.

33
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.850
And then Ben would fight at 65 cause he doesn't want to,
you know,
fight Tyron,

34
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.620
tell him and tire and a real good friends.

35
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:59.760
But I like a lot of match ups with him.
I really love the Robbie Lawler fight.

36
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.720
I mean,
I know they pulled off that fight because of the Anaheim card fell apart,

37
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.320
but they're going to fight.
Is it on Brooklyn?
I think they're fighting March 2nd.

38
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.480
Is that what it is?
I think Susan Robinson,

39
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.190
him and Robbie and I felt like they were going to make that a headliner for a

40
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:15.024
fight night.

41
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.620
I felt like I saw a Robbie's face as a head.

42
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.390
I don't know if that's been solidified.
Just text and ask.
Yeah.
Yeah,
right.

43
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.240
Or Texts Dana.
Um,
it's a,
it's a great matchup though.
That's,

44
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.170
that's where you see where Ben fits in is against worldclass competition.
I mean,

45
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:38.840
you'll see where he fits in against world class competition or see if Robbie is

46
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.540
done or not.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It's a great fight for both guys.

47
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.240
Or if Robbie is still a savage.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

48
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.410
I mean I like Robbie taking the time off too.
Yeah.

49
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.110
I think that's important for Robbie.
I mean,
you look at the wars suck.

50
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.190
I went through the Carlos condit fight,
the fucking,

51
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.500
the fucking Rory Macdonald fight.
I mean good.
Jesus Christ.

52
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:01.990
I don't know who gets out of that unscathed.

53
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.830
Not a single human that's ever lived gets out of that landscape and he needed

54
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:07.350
that.
He needs time off.
Yeah.
Yeah.

55
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.830
Cause when you get hit like that and just he's a,
but he's a fighter.

56
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.070
When he was screaming in his lip was split open.

57
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.380
I mean it was like a zipper was open.
Yeah.

58
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.710
And scream and I'm interviewing them after the fight and I'm like,
dude,

59
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:25.390
I can see your teeth.
Like literally see his teeth right through his,
his mouth.

60
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.490
Through his lips.
Oh yeah,
my God.
Yeah.
And he didn't give a fuck.
No.

61
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:34.290
Stitch it up.
No.
Like,
yeah,
he's,
he's a fighter man.
That's,
that's,

62
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.220
that's the type of guy like,
Hey,
get on that bag.
And those meet at you.
Well,

63
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:40.870
he used to not even spar,

64
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.240
which is really crazy when he's fighting in Strikeforce.

65
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.540
He wasn't even sparring and I asked him about goes,
well,

66
00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:50.440
I already know how to fight.
Questions are over.
Thank you.

67
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.410
I mean also till you got an a,
but you got to look at it too,
like where he can,

68
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.310
where he comes from,
like them dudes in the Midwest don't got no filter.

69
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.250
You know what I'm saying?
They just,

70
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.910
they was just trying to kick the shit out of each other.
Every spar and practice.

71
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.170
That was every practice,
every practice,
the militants days,

72
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.320
just knocking guys out,

73
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:08.380
drag him off the floor until they wake up and then bring another guy and then

74
00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:10.810
when you wake up,
bring them back in and bring it back in.

75
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.500
It's really crazy when God's get KOD.
I remember that from boxing gyms.

76
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.880
He'd watched guys get dropped like bunk and then they'd be sparring like 10

77
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:22.420
minutes later.
Like,
what are you doing?
Oh,
you should be in the hospital.

78
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.270
Do you understand what just happened?
Your brainstem.
See,

79
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.330
I don't like that part of the game.
You know what?

80
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:31.220
I don't even know if it's even necessary.
It's not necessarily necessary.

81
00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:35.260
It was ignorance because if that guy gets hit again,
he could get like,

82
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.400
do you know Joseph Valtellina after he beat marked a bond in glory,

83
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.350
he won.
He won the title.
He was fucked up for months.

84
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.560
Like he couldn't,
he couldn't have any lights on.
He got to be in a room.

85
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:51.520
He said that the light from like a charger from a cell phone charger,

86
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:55.030
that little tiny little light would fuck his head up.
He'd give him headaches.

87
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.170
He had a severe concussion from a fight.
He Won.

88
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.060
He got clipped with a giant knee in that fight and just boom,

89
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.120
send his head back.
And even though he won the fight,

90
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.420
he still was fucked up for a long time afterwards.

91
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.480
So I was looking at use of seat two 35 take shape with two title fights and

92
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:19.960
three x UFC champs.
So is that on the cards?
It says it's Jones,
Anthony Smith,

93
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:24.220
who Tyron versus who smile and then ask Cronin Lawler.

94
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.800
Whoo.
That's it.
Here we go.
Is that March 2nd?
Uh,

95
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.590
that's in Vegas,
right?
Yeah.
God Damn.
Pray to the MMA.

96
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:34.630
God's Keith that card together.
Keep that a,

97
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:38.090
and then I'll forget a Pedro Munoz and I'm Cody Garbrandt.
Ooh.

98
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.620
Is he on that fight sooner too?
Yeah.
Wow.
Wow.

99
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.040
That's some fucking card,
right?
Yeah.
Fucking card.
