WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.140
Gotcha.
Um,
somebody told me Wolf Blitzer got on jeopardy and they exposed them.

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.240
Yes.
I remember reading that.
Well,
because you know,
people get on television,

3
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:10.950
they read off a teleprompter.
You think their brand,

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.860
they seem brilliant and then you get him alone.

5
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.810
About Louis goes on a jeopardy and wins.

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.920
What Lucy did he,
yeah.
Remember they have celebrities.
I once in a while.

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.780
When did you do that?
A couple of years ago.

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.780
Did he go on with regular people in when I forget who he's against.

9
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:31.830
I think it was other famous paper that makes sense.
Most famous Jonathan Groff.

10
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.660
Well,
he's a very smart,
well,
do you remember he went on jeopardy.

11
00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:39.060
He against regular people.
Yeah.
He won the whole tournament.

12
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:43.590
A comic.
So folks don't take a slight does.
He's still right for there he is.

13
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:46.650
Wolf Blitzer minus $4,000 dumb ass.

14
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.610
Yeah.
It didn't work out so well.
Ah,
fuck it.
Fun.
It is hilarious.

15
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.630
You know,
people can pretend to be smart.
You know,
you read all right.

16
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.400
Shell prompter that give you the script,
you know.
But John was Jonathan Groff.

17
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:06.030
Does he still write for Conan?
It's a good question.
I don't know.

18
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:10.500
The last time I saw him,
uh,
but he was fucking really,
really bright.

19
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.760
Funny Guy Too and really funny.
Yeah.

20
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.360
I don't think he does stand up anymore though.
Lead just rights.

21
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.920
That's how smart he is.
And he's like,

22
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:20.940
enough of this nonsense is jokey joke.

23
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:25.860
Non said enough is enough.
I'm starting to feel that way.
Um,
but why,

24
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.620
why do you hate CNN?
I'll come on all the fucking shit they put out there.
And uh,

25
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.250
just an example,

26
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:35.850
how about before the went Donna Brazil had the notes for Hillary before the

27
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:40.230
fucking Barney.
Yes.
Remember that.
Would this amount,
and not to discredit you,

28
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.620
CNN was,
she was a pond it right.
And they still had a run.

29
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.930
That's what's coming to us that they had her on after that.

30
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.910
He told Dale questions we're going to be,
yeah.
Well her book was amazing though,

31
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.060
that that's what's interesting is they fucked her over and then she came into a

32
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:58.860
book and then rip them.
I have it.
I haven't read it yet.
Similar classes,

33
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.560
just so they put the,
what I read about how they rigged the DNC is how they,

34
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.380
how they,
uh,
Fuck Bernie out of the primaries.
Yeah.

35
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.680
Woo Woo.
Yeah.
Bernie gets screwed.

36
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:14.310
It's a dark business.
Fucking,
it's all the same.

37
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:15.810
They're all in coach.

38
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.220
But you don't think like the mainstream media is a little like a propaganda arm

39
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:24.570
for the Democratic Party?
Well,
they definitely negative coverage.

40
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.000
They definitely think they're working for the good,

41
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.620
but it's the 3% negative coverage with Trump.
Trump is,
and you know,

42
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:36.120
he's an unusually polarizing figure.
Sure.
I mean,
was it that way with,
um,

43
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.850
I guess I was probably pretty negative with Bush all.

44
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:41.820
It was a different world back then.
No it was,
but they always,

45
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:42.840
since I've been a kid,

46
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.490
I mean Reagan was a dummy and just to fucking be actor and an idiot,
no racist.

47
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.570
You can look at the ship year after year was true of George Bush,

48
00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:56.160
senior George W.
Bush,
Dick Cheney warmonger.
But it's the same shit,

49
00:02:56.161 --> 00:03:00.970
racist,
bigot race and it works and forth.
Board was a moron and Ford was,

50
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.500
remember how he's portrayed on SNL?
He was always falling.

51
00:03:03.501 --> 00:03:06.560
He couldn't walk three feet,
which was kind of trow actually has got it.

52
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.660
And he was an athlete,
but it,
but it's always been that way.

53
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.630
The mainstream media has always sort of been more liberal.

54
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.330
But then you have Fox News,
which goes far the other way.
Well,

55
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.320
what their opinion shows.
But at least when you watch Fox knows,

56
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:23.820
which everybody who hates Fox,
who's never watches it,
number one.
Uh,
but,

57
00:03:23.821 --> 00:03:27.820
but they at least have liberals on and Shepard Smith.
Yes and hates.

58
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.450
Yes he does.
He looks like every guy that bullied him as a kid.

59
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.870
Do you think that's why I hate them?
Yeah,
that's it.
That's the only reason.

60
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.450
The only way to raise,
and most of them hate him.
He,
here's what,

61
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.580
here's what they don't bring up.
Even Hannity and all these guys,

62
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.880
you get your head going like a,
of fuck.
What's change?

63
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:49.420
A second that he's getting irritated with me already.
I gotta get you out of La.

64
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:53.590
I'm afraid you're going to get disease and everything's good.
Over nine.

65
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.180
Tell me about it.
Uh,
but uh,
what,
what were you just talking about?

66
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.360
Why they hate Trump?
Because they never bring up this though.

67
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.720
They never cause he's a alpha male,
blonde haired,

68
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:08.020
blue eyed fucking billionaire.
That is the,

69
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.660
that's the embodiment of the devil for the left.

70
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.600
They never bring that up on the shelf.
Do you think that's really what it is?

71
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:18.250
Has nothing to do with him lying all the time and lie about the number of people

72
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:22.520
at his inauguration as opposed to Obama going,
oh,
you can keep your healthcare.

73
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.380
I mean the fucking,
you know,
he doesn't lie any more than any other president.

74
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.110
You don't think so?
If he does,
it's trivial shit.
He's a salesman.
He's a,

75
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.920
there's a fine line,
but it's definitely a salesman.
But Oh,
he's a bullshitter.

76
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:36.701
But that's what we need.

77
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:41.050
We're a cooperation where corporate the countries don't think so.

78
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.850
That's what I always heard.
It's kind of like that little bit.
I mean,

79
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.140
it's some,
some sort of an organization.
He really is.
Hillary Clinton Lion.

80
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.870
Oh yeah,
for sure.
Well,
why don't you get called on it?
How's that fat Twat?

81
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.300
Not In cups.
Oh,
how dare you.
It is.
Good question.
You know?
Yeah,

82
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:01.840
it's a great question.
I was talking to Mike Baker who used to work for the CIA.

83
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.820
Oh,
I thought you meant my fucking web guy cause he bugging.

84
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.670
He wanted to come out here with me and Mike Baker from the CIO is if he,

85
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.260
if he did anything remotely like what Hillary did,
he'd be in jail for 30 years.

86
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.400
Yeah,
of course.
Yeah.

87
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.520
I remember the kid in the submarine that worked for the Navy,

88
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.820
he took pictures of submarine.

89
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.020
I mean he liked took a selfie and it had bad shit in the background that it

90
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.470
wasn't supposed to take photos of.
And how long was he in jail?
I don't know.

91
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.470
I would just like to see some equity as far as people being held accountable on

92
00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:33.190
both sides.

93
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.130
That's how maybe it would have been different if Hillary made it through.

94
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.430
Maybe it would have been different in terms of like media coverage.

95
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.220
If she actually became president,
they would have sucked her ass.
Yeah,

96
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.480
I think so.
I don't know.

97
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:50.950
Man Wants Donna Brazile's book came out and people have an understanding about

98
00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:52.780
the inner workings of the Party.
I mean,

99
00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:57.520
I think look it politics or it's dirty,
dirty business.
