1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.570
Deem years.
These are important relationships.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.700
It's not employee employer.

3
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:09.540
It's if you quit and you did tell me you're leaving.
I want to be,

4
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.260
I want to go my car and cry.
I've been working with you for 15 years.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.280
My relationship that I have with many people that I work with is intimate.

6
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:20.580
I've seen their children born,
I've seen them go through breakups,
I've seen them,

7
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:22.290
their parents die.
I've seen,
you know,
like

8
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.190
we got a war every night at six o'clock 150 people are coming to eat in the next

9
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:33.450
three hours in four restaurants.
We,
you know,

10
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.780
it's a job that's so freaking high stress environment for five minutes,

11
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.100
for for two hours.
It's week.
We got to walk properly.
We got to where we were.

12
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.640
We're knowledgeable of each other's space and there's a ballet,

13
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:50.520
you know when you're washing the glasses and the food's coming up behind you,

14
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:53.250
you know you have a sixth sense to know,
to move,

15
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:57.570
not to get the plate to burn your elbow.
And you know,
there's this ballet,

16
00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:00.890
we dance every night with these people.
And for us to think that like,

17
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.710
and most people still think that we're behind the stove cooking.

18
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.960
I've got more phone calls to get help finding a doctor,

19
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.280
therapist,
whatever,
you know,
nutrition is for the staff.

20
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.110
Then I got calls about recipes or food or you know,
our job is,

21
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.910
I'm an expert in drainpipes artisinal plumbing,

22
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.380
artisinal electricity,
artisinal refrigeration.

23
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.160
I know about Greek boring now because you've done it yourself like Sarah,

24
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:38.820
very decrepit old buildings and you can't,
you know,

25
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:43.821
we're running a restaurants with employees and a constant burden of payroll and

26
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:49.290
we can't just call everybody all the time too.
So,
so you know,

27
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:53.280
by default any good cooking school today,
like what Fred is saying,

28
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:57.810
and Fred is the example of what a great chef should be.
It'd be a very good cook,

29
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.940
a very good person when people skills but should also have a minor and

30
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.740
electricity,
plumbing and refrigeration technologies stayed.
You know,

31
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.090
even even now,
like we both,
we both don't drink.
We both,

32
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.050
I wouldn't say a health kick butt,
just like wouldn't be there.
You know,

33
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.670
mind and body.
We want to be like present and that's,
that's my belt.

34
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:24.750
Something cool.
I want to appreciate it.
Not Be cloud.
Overlook that.
That's that.

35
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.550
Like people don't think about that when they get into this job.
You know,
they,

36
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.510
they think it's this warrior thing.
This we're savage,
we're going to drink,

37
00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:35.070
we're going to party,
we're going to do this.
No.

38
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.480
If you want to do that till you're 60 and then get a little cottage and right

39
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.370
paint,
water,
color,
buy but buy a sailboat.
You have to think about it.
You know,

40
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:48.580
it's like you can't live that life of drinking and you know,

41
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.990
why do you think that life is synonymous with chefs?

42
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.100
We've been promoted and taught ultimately that you will get paid.

43
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.980
You will make money,
you will persevere.

44
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.190
If you understand how to promote excessive eating and excessive drinking,

45
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.020
you will be recompensed.

46
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.300
If you build a place where people come and eat too much and drink too much and

47
00:03:09.301 --> 00:03:12.850
that spend too much,
then you will be able to have a life,
a car,
a house,

48
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.350
and raise children.
Okay.
So it's all good.
First you have to learn how to cook.

49
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:18.940
Then you have to learn how to run a restaurant.

50
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:22.150
Then you have to learn how to write a restaurant looks like and how to run.

51
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.410
And you know,
how to host,
how to host,
what the playlist should be like,

52
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.070
how to fix a plumbing disaster,
how to fix the electricity disaster,

53
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:32.290
how to fix a city staff situation,
disaster,

54
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:37.291
how to run a clean house or people are working together with all their different

55
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.790
idiosyncrasies.
Uh,

56
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.820
but for my whole apprentice ship,
alcohol was a reward.

57
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.290
You know,
uh,
you did a good job tonight,
drink,
you know,

58
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.910
and then it went from reward,
do,
Oh shit.

59
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.580
There was like a blood bath in the restaurant.
You know,

60
00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:01.390
we had to pick up this guy at the hospital.
Okay,
it's not a reward.

61
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.660
Let's forget about it.
Let's drink,
you know.
And it was,

62
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.520
it was always there.
You know,
it's great service.
Let's have a drink,

63
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.770
shitty food industry.

64
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:14.860
We are also in the wine industry because 50% of what you're doing is selling

65
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:15.521
food to people.

66
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:18.280
And the other 50% of what you're doing is selling alcohol to people.

67
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:23.281
So by default you're part of the people that sell a liquid drug dealer in that

68
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.090
you're in that world every day and you go to wine tastings,

69
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:30.490
you talk with people said solve an alcoholic bartenders.

70
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:32.080
You talked to people that sell wine,

71
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.870
you're partake in eating and other your colleagues,

72
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:37.060
restaurants and drinking wine.
Next thing you know,

73
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:38.170
you have a little bit of celebrity,

74
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:43.171
you've been open for 15 years and you look back and you'd go the seven days in a

75
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:46.390
week or seven days in a week and

76
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.510
I drank six of them.
I'll feel good on Sunday.

77
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.370
I'm just kind of recovering.
And then what?

78
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.170
What happens is one week turns into two to four and then you kind of look back

79
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:04.171
and you realize in 2017 that you may have drank 48 weeks out of 52 you know,

80
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.370
and then it goes quick.

81
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.410
Then it's 10 years and you're a 10 year restaurant and you've been drinking five

82
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:22.210
days out of the week for 10 years and then all of a sudden you kind of have a

83
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:22.601
problem.

84
00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:27.601
You realize that like my day to day is based on food and wine.

85
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.630
Right now I don't want my,
it's not making me happy.

86
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.580
I've had all the wines have had all the foods.
Am I better for it?
Not really.

87
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.630
What am I better for?
Restriction eating less eating,

88
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:44.830
clean drinking only on very special occasions.

89
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.710
Do you still drink on specialty?
I don't.
I'm completely sober or no.

90
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.620
<v 1>Did you make that decision based on the idea that you weren't able to control it</v>

91
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.420
or just that you,

92
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.040
I'm one of this decision would be to just eliminate it and

93
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.450
<v 0>textbook case of the person who couldn't drink.
Yeah,</v>

94
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.270
I tried several times to stop.
I googled it.
I read about it.
It didn't work.

95
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:09.770
I was intervention by Fred and my managers of the restaurants in January 12th

96
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.290
around their 16th.
I think we figured,
um,
and of this year,
yeah,

97
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.020
I'm eight months sober or something.
Congratulations.
Thank you.

98
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.310
And I'm really good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So you look healthy.
I'm happy man.

99
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.480
That's like the skin,
everything.
It's an amazing,
when that happens,

100
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.590
conversation like I was angry for a long time,
you know,
I had like,
you know,

101
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:33.410
it's not only alcoholism,
you know,

102
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.520
I think all alcoholics are codependent somewhat,
you know,
like,
it's just,

103
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.620
it had been part of my whole apprenticeship not being sober for so,

104
00:06:40.621 --> 00:06:45.440
so many years.
Uh,
it was all under control and funny for a very,
very long time.

105
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:49.220
It was always a big part of my life,
drinking wine,
eating food,
um,

106
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.240
until it wasn't,
you know,
then one day I was,
you know,

107
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:57.890
45 my relationship with alcohol changed.
I became dark.
I became unhappy.

108
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.630
I had success,
I beautiful children.
I was not happy.
Uh,

109
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.290
you know,
I tried many different things.
Nothing worked.

110
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.520
I was intervention by people that I,
that I work with,
that are dear to me,

111
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:12.410
that I love very much.
Like I still love me.

112
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:15.130
They're charging tired of watching me,
you know,

113
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:20.140
make bad decisions and I just went to a great rehab called Chatsworth that

114
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.343
<v 2>okay</v>

115
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.693
<v 0>educated me.</v>

116
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.510
It always sitting in a classroom with a pad and paper for six hours a day

117
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.410
learning about the disease called alcoholism,

118
00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:37.411
learning about a disease that 30% of the population has a,

119
00:07:38.171 --> 00:07:42.100
you know,
and a how and why I was an addict.
You know,

120
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.550
at first I was an addict with food then now you're not a young age after a

121
00:07:45.551 --> 00:07:48.790
traumatic event and I was an addict about with beer then I was an addict with

122
00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:53.410
marijuana,
like we know all drugs and then I was an addict with wine.
A follow up,

123
00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:55.510
a couple more traumatic events in your mind,
you know,

124
00:07:55.511 --> 00:08:00.510
horrendous apprenticeship and the stress of leadership in these restaurants.

125
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.121
You know,

126
00:08:01.121 --> 00:08:04.840
one thing led to another and my relationship with alcohol became not positive

127
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.890
with help.

128
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:10.420
I understood through with education I understood and now everything's great.

129
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.590
It's funny too because

130
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.360
<v 2>yeah,</v>

131
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.110
<v 0>I saw it as,
as,
as an example,
you know,
I don't like to tell him it may be,</v>

132
00:08:17.111 --> 00:08:18.970
it's a little bit of mentoring.
You know,

133
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.490
I was the canary in the coal mine for Fred,
you know,

134
00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:25.510
and I decided that I was like,
fuck,
you know what?
After Tony passed,
I was like,

135
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.120
you know,
I was,
I remember I was working in a,

136
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.510
on a new project doing tilings and I was like,
oh,

137
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.310
I heard the news in the morning.
I went,

138
00:08:33.311 --> 00:08:37.360
I went to tile all day and then I couldn't wait to get home and have like two

139
00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:42.190
bottles of wine.
And I was like,
why?
And we were the same about that.

140
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.810
It didn't matter.
Like what?
We love that a point.
Look for example,

141
00:08:46.811 --> 00:08:50.680
we loved MMA,
right?
We love going to the fights.
We were like so fortunate.

142
00:08:50.681 --> 00:08:54.880
We go and see you.
We met the FERTITTA brothers.
They discuss like we did,

143
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.370
we sat with them at dinner table.
We met you,
we met all those guys.
Uh,

144
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.410
David loves wine making meth,
all the wine makers.

145
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:06.240
We met the best people in the field that we loved.
Charmed life,
not happy,

146
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.860
not happy,
ungrateful,
fucking little pricks.
Well,
you know,

147
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:15.810
I think part of the problem is that alcohol is a depressant.
Correct?
Just you,

148
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.560
you get down,
it just,
it brings you down,
it brings you down,

149
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.770
it brings your energy level down.
It brings the spider bites,

150
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.610
I'll call it a solvent,
and it destroys your soft brain tissue.

151
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.290
And I was taught that in Rehab.
So when you drink acetone,
I don't know,

152
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:36.670
well if it was made by a lovely French vineyard with Barnyard Roma,

153
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:38.910
but do you,

154
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.740
do you miss anything about the flavor of wine with a meal or anything?

155
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.610
Have you ever tried not dance?
I don't even know.

156
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.460
I go to wine tastings.
I was just so raw wine in Las and Las Angeles.

157
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.330
I went to taste all the natural wines.
Beautiful natural wine festival.
Uh,

158
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.080
and you can taste them still.
I taste them.
I don't swallow.
I rinse my mouth out.

159
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.720
Very much involved in natural wine and the,
and,
and,

160
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.950
and that in viticulture reading and all that stuff.

161
00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:08.400
That's gotta be so weird to have a mouthful of delicious one is spit it into a

162
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:11.670
bucket.
No,
it's the same.
Really.
Yeah.
It's like,

163
00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:15.990
cause that's why did I drink wine?
I'll factory the nose.
The flavor,

164
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.650
understanding the winemaker,
his philosophy,
the,

165
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.220
the geography of where the wine comes from.

166
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:27.930
His work with,
you know,
with using organic and biodynamic viticulture,

167
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.410
uh,
not using sulfur,
uh,

168
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:35.340
just making this amazing organic beverage with very little intervention,

169
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.910
natural line without side effects.

170
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.230
I don't have to swallow it because the drug is the same drug that it's an that's

171
00:10:43.231 --> 00:10:47.400
in all the other ones that they can't change flavors.
What's different?
Yes.

172
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:51.060
You know,
and what I like is more of the story.
That guy,
the vineyard,

173
00:10:51.061 --> 00:10:52.830
the varietals,
the,
you know,

174
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.100
what'd you eat at a fine restaurant and have a delicious steak and uh,

175
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.880
we do wine accompaniment and then just spit it into a bucket.
I've done it.

176
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.870
Goes to the bathroom.
I had to,
I wasn't really worried.

177
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.750
Shuts his mouth and he goes to the bathroom.
I was worried a mouth full of wine.

178
00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.810
Roz Ryan,
Ryan grave,

179
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.970
our friend from Atlanta that worked with us for years.

180
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.210
Ryan goes to a restaurant and asks for a bucket

181
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.690
and he'll sit with other people,

182
00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:22.080
people in the wine business and they all drink wine and he tastes the wine and

183
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:26.190
he has discussions about wine and he tastes it and spits it and you know he's an

184
00:11:26.191 --> 00:11:29.070
alcoholic.
He's a recovered alcoholic three years,

185
00:11:29.071 --> 00:11:31.540
but he's a wine buyer and he's very much about,

186
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.830
he was my mentor when I got out of that Rehab Cause in rehab they were telling

187
00:11:34.831 --> 00:11:39.510
me you may never be able to go back to the restaurant.
What?

188
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.460
Yeah.
And I was a high risk of re offending and I was like I can't like I go,

189
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.670
I don't know anything else.
Like I have no education.

190
00:11:47.671 --> 00:11:51.870
I've been in kitchens since I'm 17 way too late for med school and we don't do

191
00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:52.591
well in that arose.

192
00:11:52.591 --> 00:11:56.480
I also don't want to clean iceberg lettuce with the fruits and vegetable store

193
00:11:56.481 --> 00:11:58.930
and try to make a go of that.
And you know,
it's funny too,

194
00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:02.500
like even like dealcoholized beer,
non alcoholic beer,

195
00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:06.100
it's better than alcoholic beer.
What are you talking about?

196
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:10.780
Heineken zero zero man.
Chris.
Really Chris.
Outstanding.
Really?

197
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.040
Heineken zero zero.
Outstanding.
It's really good.
I just fine.

198
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:19.330
Well I've only had like,
oh duels no,
that's not good.
Okay,
so,

199
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.990
so Heineken does it correctly.
Did the,
the the order of non alcoholic beer,
okay.

200
00:12:23.991 --> 00:12:28.991
In my head is Heineken Zero Zero Carlsberg Zero grolsch zero roll backs zero and

201
00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:38.530
then everything else is not good after let me out to death because I'm also

202
00:12:38.531 --> 00:12:43.210
celiac.
Right?
And there's a gluten they make in Montreal.

203
00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:45.790
That's no gluten and no alcohol.

204
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.630
Now you can insert any joke you want.

205
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.980
People that are signing off the pie.

206
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.510
I thought these guys are going to talk about heroin and kid fuck meat meat.

207
00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:01.440
They'll eat meat.
Yes,
I'm sure.
I'm sure that this is,
um,

208
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.630
that's fascinating though that you actually still taste it and still,

209
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.480
it's almost like if you're a heroin,
a heroin addict,

210
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:11.060
just scratching the skin with a needle,
we don't penetrate.

211
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.110
I don't recommend that.
You know,

212
00:13:14.111 --> 00:13:18.310
my therapist and the people that Rehab do not recommend that I taste wine and

213
00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:22.090
spit it,
but sure they don't.
But I have friends.
Again,
I know a lot of,

214
00:13:22.091 --> 00:13:24.910
some liaise and even I know wine makers,

215
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:29.970
some of the most famous wine makers in the world I've met in Burgundy at an abd

216
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:34.960
that are completely sober.
Wow.
Because they want it to break.
This cycle of,

217
00:13:34.961 --> 00:13:38.080
my great grandfather was an alcoholic,
abusive person.

218
00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:42.190
My grandfather was an alcoholic,
abusive person.
My father was an alcoholic,

219
00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:46.990
abusive person,
and I didn't want to take over this thousand year old winery,

220
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.440
the legacy of my family.
I didn't want to work here.
And I'm sure like,

221
00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:52.180
you know what?
All the Epi genetics stuff,

222
00:13:52.181 --> 00:13:55.820
if you don't drink when your kids are young,

223
00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.130
like they might be a thing where you can stop the passing of the gene.
You know.
