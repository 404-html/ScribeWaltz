WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.590
Fleet will change or not.
We're not.
That just keeps quashing them,

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.140
but I wonder did the problem is I'll way is connected with the communist

3
00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:13.940
government.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah,
yeah.
That they're completely integrated.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.950
So it's,
I mean,

5
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.930
the separation of business and government over there is,
it's very sketchy.
Right?

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.680
Yeah.
Fuck.
Do I know,
I'm just,

7
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.590
I just wonder if there's a fear of Asian success.
Yeah.

8
00:00:29.591 --> 00:00:34.380
I mean,
how could that be though if the Samsung Samsung has everywhere they're,

9
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.940
I mean,
they're going to come for everybody.
So they're coming for us right now.

10
00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:38.530
It's only a matter of time.
You know,
who's they?

11
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.970
The people who want equality of outcome for everyone.
Oh,

12
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.830
who are those people?
The people who are really into identity politics,

13
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.630
do you think?
I,
I didn't really think that's what was holding back Walway.

14
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.740
I thought it was the government,

15
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.710
the government was worried about them getting too much money and power.

16
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.150
But I guess if you're asking me in terms of my,

17
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.980
my view on things and in my experience,
that's where I would take it.

18
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.400
So the equality of outcome people,

19
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.570
the reason why they're trying to keep Asians or at least limit the number of

20
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:13.740
Asians and Co,
but does that have the opposite effect?

21
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.800
Doesn't that make Asians work even harder?
Yeah.

22
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.020
And I mean if you keep them out of Harvard,
they're just going to go to Yale,

23
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.030
go to,
it doesn't have numbers like that.
So at cal tech,

24
00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:29.010
there are a lot of Asians there cause they don't,
uh,
they don't discriminate,

25
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.640
so they just dominate.
So you could use,
caltech is a petri dish.
Yeah.

26
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.020
Hmm.
But what's wrong with that?

27
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.380
It's like it doesn't the nation,
but no,
no,
no.
The other thing,

28
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.020
like what's wrong with certain cultures dominating?

29
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.970
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
I think,
well,
I mean,

30
00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:52.780
if you're asking me in terms of what people see as a problem,

31
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.440
I think because it looks as though other groups are not getting a fair chance.

32
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.280
It doesn't look,
it makes,
it doesn't make people feel good.
Right.

33
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.590
Because it means that you're acknowledging at some level that some people are

34
00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:09.430
doing better than other people.
And that makes some people uncomfortable.
Right?

35
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.660
It's the participation trophy world.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The equality of outcome world.

36
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.370
Yeah.
That's exactly what it is.
Right?
Right.

37
00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:19.630
But it's gone to a place where it becomes indefensible.

38
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.990
So instead of re trying to raise up people whose scores are lower and give them

39
00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:27.431
any blog,

40
00:02:27.431 --> 00:02:31.630
take people from impoverished areas with poor education and give them more of a

41
00:02:31.631 --> 00:02:35.070
chance,
which is what affirmative action was supposed to be about.
Yeah.

42
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.970
Instead of that,
you're doing it from the top down.
You go and go on,

43
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.250
and I was too many of these people that are doing good.
We've got squash it,

44
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.810
we're going to limit their ability.

45
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.920
But how could they do that in good conscience?
That's what's crazy.

46
00:02:47.921 --> 00:02:49.780
But did doing it from that perspective,

47
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.830
doing it like looking at a race that's super successful,

48
00:02:53.831 --> 00:02:58.831
that is also a minority and saying too of them.

49
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.880
Well,
that's the thing.
I mean,

50
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.390
I think these people do think they're doing something good.

51
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.990
They're doing it for the better of society and for these other groups.

52
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.850
I like to see it too.

53
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.540
Have you ever talked to someone about it that's pro discrimination against

54
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:16.120
Asians?
I have after I wrote that column for the Globe and Mail,

55
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:18.970
a number of people came out of the woodwork to tell me how wrong I was.

56
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.300
And there was some white,
some Asians too.
Yeah.

57
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.940
Well to say don't let yourself be used by the far right to justify,
you know,

58
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.470
taking down other groups.
Well that's an interesting way of looking at it.
Yeah.

59
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:34.870
So that,
I mean that's one way that you could look at it,

60
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:38.320
but how that way possible to look at it,
that doesn't even make any sense.

61
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.530
You how would the far,
right,
so the far right,

62
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.610
the hold of the superiority of Asians in academics because there are other

63
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:51.130
racial groups that they don't like or I guess they dislike more than they

64
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:51.941
dislike Asians.

65
00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:56.860
So they'll use Asians as a way to justify discrimination against those other

66
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:00.970
groups.
I don't,
I don't really buy that.
But,
um,
that's one argument.

67
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:04.660
I've heard arguments sucks.
I'd like to sit down with someone with that argument.

68
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.950
That's a stupid argument.
That argument doesn't work.
Yeah.
It doesn't work.

69
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.860
But what I find the most sad is there are Asians who are totally fine and they

70
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:14.230
say,
I'm willing to give up my spot for someone else,

71
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:15.790
because I think diversity is important,

72
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.580
and I think that's someone who needs friends.

73
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.240
You need friends so bad,
you're willing to say that,

74
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:25.240
but that's a virtue signaling thing.
That's one of those,
I hope so.

75
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:28.270
I hope it's purchasing the lead.
It's not someone who actually thinks that way.

76
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.220
They could actually think that way,

77
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:33.970
but the people cut their balls off and killed themselves because they thought

78
00:04:33.971 --> 00:04:37.240
the comment was coming in.
The spaceship is behind it.
They thought that too.

79
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.630
People think all kinds of things.
All kinds of things.
Yeah,

80
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.500
and that is one of the main reasons why I wanted to talk to.
