1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.360
Yeah.
That's how people died.
A lot of people live that way too.

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.040
A lot of people live that way until they died.
I mean that.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.120
Do you think about those people that made it across this country and the people

4
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:16.630
like Lewis and Clark and all of these pioneers,

5
00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:19.440
they just didn't even know what the fuck was around the next corner and they

6
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:20.700
just walked on through with,

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.450
would they have like donkeys with shit on their back?
How much food do you have?

8
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.400
Yeah.
Do you even know what the fuck you're going?

9
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.730
<v 1>Yeah.
He hit an impasse.
You,</v>

10
00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:31.720
you hike for miles and then you come up to a mountain and you got to double back

11
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.380
<v 0>and go around this Christ,
no Google earth,</v>

12
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.233
no nothing.

13
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.370
Shit maps and dog shit maps written by people you hope knew what the fuck they

14
00:00:42.371 --> 00:00:46.690
were talking about.
You know,
he'd get maps from native Americans,

15
00:00:46.691 --> 00:00:49.090
get maps from a sailor and try to figure it out,

16
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.520
<v 1>and then you randomly go into the wrong territory and a Indian Indians want to</v>

17
00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:55.120
kill you.

18
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.540
<v 0>You know,
there's an interesting,
a film that's out on Netflix right now,</v>

19
00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:02.950
the ballot of Buster Scruggs,
a great movie,
and it's all about that.

20
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.910
It's all about the old west.
It's really weird,
man.
It's so weird.

21
00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:10.010
They're the weirdest guys of all time.
It turns the Kahn brothers.
Yeah.
Yeah.

22
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:12.130
The Big Lebowski.
You one of my all time favorites.

23
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.700
They've just made so many cool,
weird films,
but this one's really weird.

24
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.670
It's like a bunch of non connected stories.
I thought they were connected,

25
00:01:18.671 --> 00:01:19.181
but they're not.

26
00:01:19.181 --> 00:01:22.420
They just all taking place in the same time period and it's called the old west

27
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.040
<v 1>and the end.
Pretty similar.
Like they're all fucking dark and you got to go.</v>

28
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.140
Go into it.
I would highly recommend it,

29
00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:33.280
but go into it knowing it's going to be fucking dark.
You've got to go there.

30
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.550
Just accept it.
But Tom Waits,
his one is fucking amazing.

31
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:41.740
Amazing Dude.
Amazing.
Yeah.
I thought it was Dick Nolton for a second.

32
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.360
Oh yeah,
it was done.
It's multi.
Alright,
dude is so good.

33
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.330
That one.
That one was really good.
The singer guy was really good.
I love that.
He,

34
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.730
well,
I don't want to spoil it.
I don't want to spoil it.
But now it's,
yeah,

35
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.340
they're all,
they're all great,
but at the end of it,
I was like,

36
00:01:57.341 --> 00:01:59.080
what the fuck did I just watch?
Yeah.
