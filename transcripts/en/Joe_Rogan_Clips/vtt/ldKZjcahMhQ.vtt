1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.560
Hey to recover from anything.
That's right.
They want to know that you're dead.

2
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.150
You're dead.
It's over.
Yeah,
your career's done.
You're life is over.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.790
You said the wrong thing.
You've done the wrong thing.

4
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.380
I mean obviously there's some reasons for some people to be Pi like Harvey

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.530
Weinstein's perfect example,
right?
That guy should be in jail.
Of course for sure.

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.910
Is this rapist.
Yeah,
this is right.
At least alleged rapist.

7
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.300
What for sure.
He's done a lot of horrible shit.
Correct.

8
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.040
But then there's people that like,
like what did Samantha Bee say today?

9
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.780
She called Ivanka con.
Yeah.
Yeah,
exactly.
What happens there?
Thanks.

10
00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:37.740
He gets in trouble.
I bet she doesn't.
She's not going to get in.

11
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:42.500
I bet she doesn't because she is left wing.
She's left wing base to say,

12
00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:43.020
sorry,

13
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.890
I'm aligning some of the shit that Keith Olbermann has said about your job at

14
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:47.600
ESPN.
It's,
they don't care.

15
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.190
There are fucking so many tweets that he put out that are crazy calling Trump a

16
00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:56.050
Nazi and fuck you think about like what people say,

17
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.920
<v 1>Bell like Ben Carson and black conservatives.</v>

18
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.300
We get Ben Carson was literally called a porch monkey [inaudible] and that's

19
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:05.550
totally fine.
He's black.
It doesn't matter.
They they've s

20
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.390
<v 0>who created this system.
Who was it that did it though?</v>

21
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:10.580
It wasn't like a famous person.
It was a famous person.

22
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.910
Absolutely called the porch monkeys.
Black Person.
Famous black person.

23
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.440
That's like,
if I call a Guy Guinea.
Yeah,
but it's,
but it's,

24
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.040
it's porch monkey is like an,
I don't care who it's coming from,
right?
Like,
yeah,

25
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:25.690
but black people are allowed to say racist shit is out of the black people with

26
00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:29.310
Theresa.
Okay.
It's not okay.
None of it's okay if the uncle toms,

27
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:33.440
the we go with stuff that we have laws or rules culturally and I don't like

28
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:37.490
those laws and rules.
Right.
Push back here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I agree.
Well,
it's it,

29
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.170
it's definitely hypocritical.

30
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.530
Like someone was saying that there was a tweet that I retweeted today,

31
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.450
that's Smallville girl.

32
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.310
That Smallville show was still on the air and that girl is apparently she,

33
00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:53.210
she's admitted to sex trafficking and that some of it was her idea.

34
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:58.100
I read the Smallville still on the air and they're pulling Roseanne from Hulu.

35
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.750
Right.
Roseanne swear she did not know that lady was black.
She swears she,

36
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:04.790
I mean she doesn't,
she doesn't look there it is.
If you don't,

37
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.480
Allison Max has branding the sex slaves.

38
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:11.330
Was her idea branding them.
Nice.
Alison.

39
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.220
That's means like burning a logo into their bodies.
All right.
What is,

40
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:18.560
why with that?
I don't know enough about that story,

41
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.820
but that bitch must be off the chart,
which is crazy.
Yeah.
Ooh,

42
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.210
<v 1>but it's,</v>

43
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.580
it's only accepted like if you have any ties whatsoever to conservative thought,

44
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.620
if,
if you have even like liked a tweet that Trump sent out,
like forget about it.

45
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.543
Forget about it.

46
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.160
<v 0>Well,
I'm not even conservative,</v>

47
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:39.180
but I have conservative people you talked to and people call me all right.

48
00:02:39.181 --> 00:02:42.770
And all this crazy shit.
They're just looking to silence and labor.

49
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.600
<v 1>Right.</v>

50
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.320
They're obsessed with labels and I hate that idea that you can't say something

51
00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:48.820
like they were literally,

52
00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:51.580
I mean everyone piled in every celebrity on the sun piled in.

53
00:02:51.581 --> 00:02:55.060
When I tweeted a couple of weeks ago that I was having a conversation,

54
00:02:55.061 --> 00:02:58.330
I don't know if you saw this,
I was like,
I was having a conversation at lunch.
Um,

55
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.220
cause I've just been observing Chelsea handler.

56
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.960
I just think she's a weird person.

57
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:05.230
Like I don't know what happened because I used to really like her.
Like,
you know,

58
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.030
10 years ago.
That's when you were liberal.
Yeah.
Well when she was at her show,

59
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:11.830
like she was not politically correct.
I mean,

60
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:13.750
I don't know if anybody remembers the show Chelsea lately,

61
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.280
but she was making fun of everybody.
And now with the era of Trump,
she's like,

62
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.420
something's weird.

63
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.080
So she's getting older and I think she wants to be an activist now.

64
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.110
And I think she's looking for more meaning and importance because she doesn't

65
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:30.150
have a family or children.
And I,
I tweet that.
Oh,
you tweeted a tweet it,

66
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.970
but it's true.
I'm like,
I'm talking to like a friend at lunch.
I was,

67
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.960
and uh,
we were talking about like,
why some of these like older woman,

68
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.260
I have just gone bonkers.
And you know,
my friend made a comment,
she's like,

69
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:47.140
if you don't like use your eggs,
they scramble.
Like just saying like,

70
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.580
Oh shit that my friend said,
but I didn't even tweet that.

71
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.460
I didn't tweet that French put that shit on TV show.

72
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:56.370
It's really funny if you don't use your eggs,
they scramble.

73
00:03:56.371 --> 00:03:59.970
So I was like cracking up.
I know,
but there's something there,
right?
It's,
it's it,

74
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.540
there's something there.
It's not politically correct.

75
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.000
But I observed the pattern of Kathy Griffin.

76
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.140
I observe the pattern of Chelsea handler and Sarah Silverman on the fence.

77
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:10.150
Not as bad but in that neighborhood.
So I tweet out,

78
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.120
do you think there's something associated like between like woman who don't have

79
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:16.840
children and they need something to nurture and foster and try to raise and in

80
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:17.950
this sense it's society.

81
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:20.800
Like they are just trying to parent the hell out of society.

82
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.260
And you think Sarah does?
Sarah goes back and forth.
She's more,

83
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.640
she's like,
she's a kind person,

84
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:29.980
but there's something like once in a while she'll,
I'm just like,
what?

85
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:32.530
Like I did actually go back and I said,
you know what,
Sarah,

86
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.130
I shouldn't put you in the same category as Kathy and Chelsea,

87
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.971
but it's like this.

88
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:41.320
They're like obsessed with like everything and they're completely wrong and

89
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:43.710
educated about everything and yet they,

90
00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:45.220
they think they can say whatever they want.

91
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.670
So I tweaked this and I mean everyone was like,
you'd be like,
delete the too.

92
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:52.930
Like Ellen Ellen,
Ellen shows producers.
Like,
I mean,
Jake tapper,

93
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.220
like delete the tweet.
I was like,
I'm not deleting Jake.
Jake tapper jumps,

94
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.990
Jake tapper,
you know,
he said,
he said like,
this is literally,

95
00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:04.420
so I tweaked,
this has nothing to do with Trump.
Anybody.
He's like,

96
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.310
this is the girl who like supports Trump and works for turning point USA,

97
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:13.240
which loves Trump.
I'm like,
what?
What does the weirdest like logical jumped ever?

98
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:17.590
So yeah.
And I just like,
I'm like,
Jake,
stop yourself.
Like,
come on.

99
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.200
So in the end everyone was just like,
delete the two.
And I was just like,

100
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.570
how about,
what was the actual wording of the tweet?

101
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.520
I think my exact words were at lunch with a friend talking about like how

102
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:31.120
bizarre Chelsea Handler,
Kathy Griffin and Sarah Silver.
And so if Sarah,

103
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:34.780
someone had just tweeted something like pro ms 13 it was like the whole Israel,

104
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:37.810
like it was bizarre,
you know,
and how crazy they've gotten.

105
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:41.100
And then I just said like,
do you think that's something really happens?

106
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.380
Women if they don't have children?
And that was,
it was just a question.

107
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.483
So the question,

108
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.350
that's such a hot spots or you're going after a soft spot on them.
Yeah,

109
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.660
yeah,
that's it.
Right.
And I'm like,
Sarah Huckabee,
Sanders,

110
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.950
any,
that's why I said,
I was like,

111
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.890
imagine they can say anything to [inaudible] going to lose her job.
Right.

112
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.780
She can say anything to Ivanka.
You can say anything to Sarah Sanders.

113
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:05.960
Anything to anybody.
To me.
Right.
Anyone that supports Trump,
it doesn't matter.

114
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:08.990
But then like these women who literally go after these people,

115
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:13.330
like the amount of vitriol that Chelsea handler has thrown to Ivanka,
you know,

116
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.070
to every single woman in the world.
Chrissy Teagan's off like a net.

117
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:19.130
Like she just like angry.
Like,
you know,
just like hate,
hate,
hate.

118
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.100
And then like you say one thing about them and like they like,

119
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.900
how could you even question,

120
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.590
how could you even ask a question if it's because they don't have kids.

121
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.040
And I'm like,
the fact that you guys are so outraged makes me sort of think that,

122
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.640
you know,
yeah,
a little bit.
And I didn't delete the tweet.

123
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.490
If you didn't have any point at all,
it wouldn't work.

124
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.390
And that way it would just pick a stupid to be upset at you.
They're like,
oh,

125
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:43.760
this person,
she doesn't know what the fuck she's talking.
And I tweeted that,

126
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:44.151
I was like,

127
00:06:44.151 --> 00:06:46.640
there's gotta be something here because you guys are all losing your minds.

128
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:49.880
You know,
I,
it's so Sarah Silverman responded,
Kathy Griffin was like,

129
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:54.570
they went nuts.
This was like a full on like Kathy Griffin is so happy.
So I know,

130
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.470
I know,
but she's busy and they'd gotten bizarre.

131
00:06:57.471 --> 00:07:02.240
And at one point these people to me were funny and something sort of just

132
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:05.210
happened.
And like Trump is the,
the means like they,

133
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.240
whatever they're going through in life,
the outlet is Trump.

134
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:09.740
And anybody that likes Trump,

135
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.920
what people think there's a cultural war going on and there most certainly is

136
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.120
areas for sure.
You know,
so they feel like they're on a side and they have to,

137
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.200
you know,
they're going to lob grenades during the war.
Yeah.
And it gives people,

138
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.120
it also gives people a sense of purpose,
