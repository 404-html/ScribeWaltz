00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.440
Hello Freak bitches and Kuhn.
No,

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.960
Cabo warm,
warm.
There's me

3
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.330
chewing up.
Oh God.
Damn storm,
man.
This is when fear factor was awesome,
man.

4
00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:20.100
If I met this dude right now,
today,

5
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.480
if I saw that dude today,
I'd be like,
nice to meet you.
Like I never,

6
00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:32.430
I don't remember medium.
That's so great.
My memories such dog shit.
Wow.

7
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.460
My memory's pretty good for like normal stuff,

8
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:39.420
but I think I've seen too much all these people.

9
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:42.450
I don't know who these people are.
This is where obviously met them.
That dude,

10
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:46.770
it's going at town though.
Look at them.
This is when fear factor was amazing.

11
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.920
Not Ludicrous,
man.
Call me.
I'll give you some tips.
When did we talk about this?

12
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.540
Like one of those stunts is like,
oh no,
you're going to get your cell phone wet.

13
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.410
I'm like,
no,
no,
no.

14
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.840
They're on a budget.
Yeah.
Luda might've ate up that budget

15
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.060
fast and the furious gig money.

16
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.660
Now he's stuck in that world with the Tyrese and all those guys on their

17
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.560
franchise.
Did we talk about ty Reese and the rock?
Oh my God.

18
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:19.830
Did we talk about it yesterday?
We mentioned it off.
We didn't talk about,

19
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.700
I have no idea.
I was,
I was a on youtube looking at something else.

20
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:27.660
I was looking at,
uh,
some automobile thing and uh,

21
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.340
I saw the rock and then I saw the rock distant Tyrese and I was like,

22
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:35.940
this is real.
And I went to it.
No,
it's real.
They apparently,

23
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:40.610
Tyrese talked a bunch of shit about the Rock and the rock did a review of
Tyrese,

24
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:43.830
his album,
but they're also in a movie right now together.
It doesn't matter.

25
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.860
He doesn't like them.
Yeah.

26
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.260
The things coming out because the rock made a deal to make a,

27
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.990
a spinoff sequel to the fast and the furious franchise that's not bring

28
00:01:52.991 --> 00:01:57.360
involving anyone that's in the Fresno area and they're mad.
Tyrese is like,

29
00:01:57.361 --> 00:01:58.380
you're splitting up the family,

30
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.170
which means nobody wants to go see a Goddamn Tyrese movie.

31
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:04.970
That's the real problem.
Yeah.
I'm on team rock whenever he wants.
I love the rock.

32
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:07.860
You too.
He's a sweetheart of a guy.
If you meet him in person too.
Oh,

33
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.690
you got to meet him.
Yeah,
he's great.

34
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.370
At Tate did if movie with him Jumanji he's a fucking great guy.

35
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.110
Like a legitimately great guy and he inspires the shit out of me.
You know,

36
00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:21.570
a lot of people think that that meat heads stuff like in the gym,

37
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:24.690
like push harder,
get it done.
You know,
all work,

38
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.080
all play all day.
You know,
like all that.
Krista,

39
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.680
I find him inspirational.
I don't care if it's,

40
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.320
I don't care if it's simpleton stuff.
I think he's great.
I love him.

41
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.050
It was pretty good.
Yeah,
we got gimme some volume ma'am.

42
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.620
<v 1>I just wrapped a phenomenal workout here and the Iron Paradise got after it.</v>

43
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:44.080
Hardcore,
hardest workers in the room.
It's how we do it.
Um,

44
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.670
the number one question that I'm asked everywhere I go around the world is

45
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:49.620
always,
how is it that I stay so motivated?

46
00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:53.640
What are the motivating factors in my life that keep me in this psychological

47
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:56.700
space?
Um,
number one will be gratitude.

48
00:02:56.701 --> 00:03:00.670
I try and find a way to be grateful for every single I have,
every single day.

49
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.540
Wins,
losses,
loved ones,
you name it.
My life wasn't always this way.

50
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:06.340
It was much different many moons ago.

51
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:10.450
So these days I'm grateful to the bone for everything.
The other thing is hunger.

52
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.130
Uh,
you always hear people say,
well,

53
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:15.190
it's about being number one about being at the top or how about this?

54
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.980
You always got to find somebody out there who's going to work harder.
Well,

55
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:19.630
I don't know that that might be bullshit,

56
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.230
but I know no one is going to be hungrier than I am.
Uh,

57
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.680
and I try and find a way to be grateful.
So I hope that helps.

58
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.840
It's two o'clock in the morning.
If you're watching this,

59
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.450
you better be doing something productive and not freaky shit.

60
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.420
While you could go do some freaky shit Saturday night.

61
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.840
<v 0>Need a little editing.
Yeah,
but I liked the point.</v>

62
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.790
Get inspirational that all that saying about gratitude,
that's real.

63
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.490
It's legit.
And who fucking works harder than that guy?

64
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.450
He's always on a new TV show.
He's got 10 movies.
Juggling at the same time.

65
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:51.670
Probably sleeps two hours a night.
Look at him.

66
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.490
I could do without all these pictures of people hopping in private jets though.

67
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.520
I get it.
I hear rich is that the private jet thing to me is,

68
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.450
is just,
that's a weird form of Selfie.
You know,

69
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.620
like the private gym photos I get,
but the private jet photos,

70
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.980
here's the guy that,
that fake the private jet.
Oh Wow.
Bao.

71
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.000
Bao.
Bao.
Wow.
That's amazing.
Now,
isn't it?
Yeah.

72
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.680
Like people pretending to little bow things.

73
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.320
And what's funny is nowadays flooding that someone on the plane busted him.

74
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.643
<v 2>Okay.</v>

75
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.020
[inaudible].
