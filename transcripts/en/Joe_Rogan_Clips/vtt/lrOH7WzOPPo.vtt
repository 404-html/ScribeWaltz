00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.970
Till I got choked out 10 years ago that I think about some times when I'm

2
00:00:02.971 --> 00:00:03.690
lifting,

3
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.220
I'll be tired and I'll think about a guy who caught me 10 years of my life.
Fuck.

4
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.130
That's what's big about life man.
Cause I think about not being choked out.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.660
I think about a lot of shit like that.
Yeah,
just keep pushing.

6
00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:19.880
They grind them.
We like a motherfucker man.

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.470
And that's what you're talking about earlier too.

8
00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:25.970
It's like the mind has these reserves.
You can trick it and pull him out.

9
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.390
He's inspirational reserves like you did with when,
when you,

10
00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:31.220
when you guys were going through buds.
Yes.

11
00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:34.340
We just found that trigger and then all of a sudden you throw in that boat in

12
00:00:34.341 --> 00:00:38.090
the air.
The mind always has to tactical advantage over you.

13
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.240
Why is it it knows your fear.
Ours and noisy insecurities.

14
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.650
It knows where their height and you can't hide.
You can't hide that motherfucker,

15
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.700
man am I forget the tactical barriers on your son that's going to get you man.

16
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.590
It's a beast.
That might be best lesson,
right?
That your mind,

17
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.280
your mind knows everything.
You cannot hide from it,
so don't ever try it.

18
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.920
Don't try.
It might as well go ahead and beat that motherfucker.

19
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.320
Got to keep going at it.
That's also what you did in this book.

20
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:09.321
You didn't try to like paint yourself in a glamorous or flattering way at any

21
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:12.900
point in time.
You were honest at every step of the way,

22
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.370
which I think is just gigantic for people too because you can tell when

23
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:21.390
someone's stroking themselves are bullshitting themselves and is the message

24
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:25.470
just won't come through.
Right,
but this your you come through in this book,

25
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.760
you know like who you are and what you became and how you became who you are and

26
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:32.730
who you used to be and why you were the way you used to be.

27
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.360
All that comes through.
It's like there's no filter.
This is just your,

28
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.370
your thoughts like you,

29
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.180
what you remember about your life and what you think about right now.

30
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:45.960
Just all comes out onto the pages.
Hardest thing I've done my entire life.

31
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.740
I'm a manager.
I have fucking,
I don't know how to go buy this book.

32
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.370
Then I walk up to people.
People walk up to me.
I was like,

33
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:54.710
what are you thinking about motherfucker,

34
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.410
thank puppy peed in the bed and was fucking ass.

35
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.790
When you're thinking about,
oh that's hilarious.
I know,
right?

36
00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:09.270
Like you like thinking about me opening it up.
All you know all about me.

37
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.640
How about you motherfuckers?
Tell me something about you.

38
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.910
That's what people love,
right?

39
00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:18.430
When they know some shit about you and you don't know nothing about them,

40
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.460
nothing about nobody.
That's anonymous trolls it man,

41
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.260
they get at me that co there's a lot of those but that they're all doing that to

42
00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:28.420
themselves.
They don't even understand when you do that,

43
00:02:28.421 --> 00:02:30.140
you're doing it to yourself.
Right.

44
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.880
If you are attacking someone cause you know that they have a weakness but you're

45
00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:37.510
pretending you don't have one,
you are attacking yourself.

46
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.780
You are chipping away at your own personal sovereignty,

47
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.430
chipping away at your own respect.
So true man.
Can't respect yourself.

48
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.370
You're a pussy.
You're talking.
Shit happened though Joe.
To me,

49
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.900
I started looking at people realizing I know something about you

50
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.270
because they don't want to talk about it.
Right.
I already know it.
Yeah.

51
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.410
If you're talking about me.
Yeah,
I know you're fucked up.
Yeah.

52
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.200
That's what all these cats that come out right now who don't like me,
whatever.

53
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.920
I'm like,
really man,
this should happen 30 fucking years ago.
15 years ago.

54
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:12.310
You're still,
you're still fucked up about that.
Oh man,

55
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.030
I know something about you brother.
Does that get over everything?
I'm good.

56
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.190
It's water under the fucking bridge grind.
The grind does that.
That's it.

57
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.800
You're not grinding harder.

58
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.560
If you're worried about something that someone did to you years ago,

59
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.750
you're being a pussy to yourself.

60
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:32.350
May Not getting out there in squeezing that fucking soul out every day.

61
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.170
If you grind hard,
and I got ton of,
we're about your monkey ass.

62
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.090
I gotta tell him about you man.

63
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.390
Cause tomorrow I got to go back to the grind and tomorrow I go back to the grind

64
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:44.590
again and again and again and again.

65
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.370
I don't have time to put you into the Haight Bank.
There's no hate.

66
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.460
It's all filtered out,
man,
through the grind.
If you don't get it,
there's,

67
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.430
there's great joy in the grind,
great Jordan and suffer.

68
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.830
It's totally cleanses your body out,
man.

69
00:03:56.831 --> 00:03:58.570
If any kind of hate it makes you grow up.
