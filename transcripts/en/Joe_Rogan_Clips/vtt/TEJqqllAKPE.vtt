1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.990
The joe rogan experience,
you know?
Yeah.
And I've always admired that.

2
00:00:04.991 --> 00:00:08.710
You figured out when we were really young,
I mean when I met you,

3
00:00:08.711 --> 00:00:13.450
you quit and you know,
we were both in our early twenties and you were like,

4
00:00:13.451 --> 00:00:17.680
fuck this,
I'm not,
I'm not going down that road.
And you didn't need anything.

5
00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:21.700
You didn't,
you didn't need alcoholics anonymous.
He like,
no,
not doing it.

6
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.050
<v 1>I did some therapy that helped.</v>

7
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.230
I just needed to realize that once I realized that and I had gone to Alanen

8
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:32.330
because of my dad adult child of alcoholic meetings,

9
00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:35.990
which helped me phenomenal amount just to realize that,
um,

10
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.800
that it's a disease and that,
you know,
you're powerless to it.

11
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.000
And that for me,
I was able to apply what I learned in there.

12
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:47.630
Cause I went to a couple AA meetings and in Boston it was like guys would get up

13
00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:48.350
and they were like,

14
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.400
and then I blew a guy for a sandwich and I passed out in a fucking dumb,

15
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.910
you know,
it's like I couldn't relate.
I mean,
my thing was like,

16
00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:58.430
I fucked a fat chick,
you know,
that was my bottom.

17
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.880
I had a three way with a couple of girls who were,
uh,
you know,

18
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.240
placentas jump Annette.
And so,
uh,
so I could but,
but I,

19
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.950
I read the literature of the 12 steps and it helped me because it made me

20
00:01:09.951 --> 00:01:14.951
realize that when I wanted to drink something was going on and to this day I

21
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:19.220
just have that reaction.
I know that I still want to drink all the time,

22
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.070
but when I really want to drink I stopped and I go,
all right,

23
00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:23.990
what's stressing you out?
What do you need to deal with?

24
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.580
And then I just kind of focus on it.

25
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.500
<v 0>No,
yeah,
there was,
um,
when I was a kid,
my,</v>

26
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.920
uh,

27
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.950
my dad was an architect and so I'd worked on a lot of construction sites and I

28
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:37.790
met a lot of junkies,
a lot of junkies,

29
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.570
a lot of people in construction sites are either alcoholics or drug addicts.

30
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.920
And there was this one guy that I really liked.
He was a funny guy,
man,

31
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.510
really funny guy.
And he's in the band.
His name was Robbie.
Funny fucking dude,

32
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.620
loved hanging around with them,
but just stay off the coke,

33
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.760
couldn't stay off the coke and you could totally tell he would.
And he would,

34
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.330
he'd be honest about it to see how he went off the rails and,
you know,

35
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:05.540
and you know,
and he would,
we would be working together.

36
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:08.840
He was a carpenter and I was,
you know,
like a,
a labor.

37
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.660
So I was like an apprentice and so he'd be,
you know,

38
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.510
talking to me why he's explained to me how to do things and stuff like that.

39
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.330
And uh,
it's like,
yeah,
you know,
I'm just fucking tired of this.

40
00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:20.120
I'm getting my shit together.
The bands getting back together,
game,

41
00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:21.500
we're writing songs and this and that.

42
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:25.610
And then he come in and Monday looking like shit,

43
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.600
just looking like shit,
real grumpy,
didn't want to talk,

44
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.620
had a headache and you know,
and he didn't meant it,
you know,
went off the rail.

45
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.960
<v 1>The saddest thing is that when you first start doing drugs,</v>

46
00:02:37.961 --> 00:02:42.240
and I dunno about you,
but I,
I had a phenomenal time doing cocaine.
You know,

47
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:46.230
I mushrooms and all this stuff I did as a teenager was like beef.

48
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.510
I never got hooked on it.
And if you do it,
you know,

49
00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:54.490
maybe I did coke 50 times without ever getting hooked.
It's a blast.

50
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.430
That's the,
that's the best kept secret.
But then once you get hooked,

51
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.510
you're not having fun anymore.
You're just maintaining,
you're just feeding it.

52
00:03:03.511 --> 00:03:06.010
See adult crash,
you know,
with,
with heroin,

53
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:07.780
you're just trying to avoid withdrawals.

54
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:10.090
You're not even feeling that great anymore.

55
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.340
<v 0>I think with Robbie to,</v>

56
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.690
part of the problem was he was very disappointed in himself.
Yeah.

57
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.280
And it was booze too.
He would just go off the rails and try to keep it,
you know,

58
00:03:20.281 --> 00:03:21.114
it's like

59
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.040
there's a lot of people out there that they have a dream and then the pressure

60
00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:29.580
of trying to reach that dream,
like his dream is to be in a successful band.

61
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.660
Right.
And the pressure of trying to reach that dream and see it to fruition,

62
00:03:33.661 --> 00:03:38.640
it's just seems,
it seems unreachable.
Yeah.
It seems too far off.
And here you are,

63
00:03:38.641 --> 00:03:38.971
you're,

64
00:03:38.971 --> 00:03:42.720
you're in your thirties and you're working in a construction job and you know,

65
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.840
you fucking work all day in Boston in the winter,

66
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.980
you're tired as shit when you get home,
you don't want to go to band practice.

67
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.290
You get home at six 30 have dinner,
now it's seven 30 you got to get up,
right?

68
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.510
You've got to get up in a few hours.
What are you doing?

69
00:03:57.511 --> 00:03:58.740
When are you going to bed?
You know,

70
00:03:58.741 --> 00:04:02.220
you've got to get up at six then you go to band practice and the drummer doesn't

71
00:04:02.221 --> 00:04:05.370
shell ups and can't practice or he's 45 minutes late,

72
00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:09.890
his car breaks down and you're fucking pissed and screaming at you.

73
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.750
Yeah,

74
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.000
<v 1>yeah,
yeah.
And then try to have a relationship on top of that.</v>

75
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:17.170
Tell that girl you can't go out on Saturday night ever cause you're doing gigs

76
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.920
<v 0>and then the Gig suck and you're not making any money.
And they're like,</v>

77
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:23.070
she should get a job.
The GIG sock,

78
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.820
you should get a job and then you're in a band.

79
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.410
So girls are throwing themselves at,
you have an affair.
She's got some coke now.

80
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.410
It's good.
No,
sorry.
Turned around.
Turn it around now it's exciting again,

81
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.540
<v 1>sometimes when I've worked at casino,</v>

82
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:46.930
there will always be that band in the lounge is playing like born to be wild and

83
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:51.931
all those songs and like you'll see people that are like 57 dancing and you and

84
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:58.000
you see them in their dancing and it's like they're just reliving the only joy

85
00:04:58.001 --> 00:04:58.721
they had in their life,

86
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:02.710
which was like when they were young dancing a rock and this band is fucking,

87
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.810
they're gods to them.

88
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.253
<v 2>Mm.</v>

89
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.100
<v 0>The time when you're young,
when you're having fun is so fleeting.
Yeah.</v>

90
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.210
Then all of a sudden responsibility stuck up and all a sudden,
you know,

91
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.340
you have to pay bills,
you have obligations.
You have so much to,

92
00:05:23.341 --> 00:05:27.300
you have to think about.
Yeah.
For so many people,
there's just,

93
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.220
there's this period of their life where they looked back to whimsically I,

94
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.700
that was the time when I was free.
I was young.

95
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.920
My Dick got hard all the time.

96
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.450
I could go two or three times,
three times in a night.
You like,

97
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.180
shit man,
I can't

98
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.660
<v 1>leave it.
And you think anything is possible.
I mean that's really,
it can happen.</v>

99
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.410
That's the loss of innocence is when you realize that a certain point that you

100
00:05:54.411 --> 00:05:57.950
do have to pick a path and stay on it.
Oh yeah,
you better.

101
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.340
He cause you gotta pay the bills with it and you know,

102
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:05.540
and then what's so sad is you see people that work so fucking hard for not a lot

103
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:06.950
of money and you know,

104
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:10.640
Bill's just add up and then they save just enough when they get their vacation

105
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:11.600
twice a year,

106
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.050
the good alike accrues and they'll just drink nonstop for a week.

107
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.100
And at the end of it,
they're just hung over.
They blew the excess money they had.

108
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.470
And that was it.
That's what you worked all year four.
I had a friend of mine,

109
00:06:25.471 --> 00:06:27.200
I work in a restaurant and uh,

110
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.410
one of the guys who worked with saved up his money for eight years,

111
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.050
went to Vegas and blew in in one day.
Ha ha ha.

112
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.700
Oh,

113
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.020
it was the most heartbreaking story.
Oh,
this poor guy.

114
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:43.970
I think he was a dishwasher.

115
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.190
And he worked there for eight years and set aside 50 here,

116
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.080
25 they're set aside for eight fucking years.
Yeah.

117
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.270
And I think it was some good amount of money,

118
00:06:56.271 --> 00:07:00.950
like $30,000 Shit went there with a plan.
This is it,

119
00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:03.950
baby.
I'm good at blackjack or whatever the fuck he played.

120
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.800
He read a book of guys read books.

121
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:17.340
Okay.
