1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.820
Now these people that live this life,

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.090
do they have something they're working towards?

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.210
Did they have an idea that they're working towards?
Does it mean when you,

4
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:11.670
when you press them on it and ask them like,
why you here?

5
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:14.820
Do you ever plan on leaving?
Do you ever see yourself going somewhere else?

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.240
That's a really good question.
I asked him all those questions.
So,
uh,
no.

7
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.510
They felt like that was their calling,
their calling.

8
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.310
They were doing what they were supposed to be doing.
Hmm.
And,
um,

9
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.300
that they were committed to that lifestyle.
So no,
they were in a,

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.690
there was no thought of going back.

11
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.720
There had been monks that have left the monastery,

12
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.340
just wasn't the right lifestyle for them.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.780
But the monks that were there when I was there,
you know,

14
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.690
50 years they were committed and they're not going anywhere.

15
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.930
That's what confusing to me.

16
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.350
Like I understand that they're enjoying and I understand that they're,
they,

17
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.230
they liked that life,
but that it's a calling,

18
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.100
like the calling to do nothing or just think,

19
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.270
maybe it's just sacrifice,
serve God.

20
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.770
Um,
live a life of purity.
This is not right.
I understand.

21
00:01:08.771 --> 00:01:12.210
I couldn't do it.
But I think that's kind of the mindset around it.

22
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.500
And um,
step away from

23
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.790
the regular life that they were living.
What's interesting is that the,

24
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.850
they weren't born into the monastery.

25
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.950
A lot of these guys made this decision in their twenties,
thirties,
you know,

26
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.310
so what were their jobs before they did it all over the board.

27
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.460
All over the board.
Literally,
uh,
one guy,
I mean,

28
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.890
one of the most of the lifeguard is a teenager.
Wow.
I mean,

29
00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:43.740
just all over the board.
So,
um,

30
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.770
but regular jobs just always felt connected to God and connected to this higher

31
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.710
living a life.
Just,
you know,
under these terms.

32
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.000
But what's fascinating to me is that you're saying that there was so happy

33
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.860
because if you get a rent,
I mean,
how many,

34
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.300
how many people were in this monastery?
Uh,
eight and they're all male.
Yes.

35
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.140
Eight men.
If you get eight random men in there,
you know,

36
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.260
what's the youngest age of the guys who 35,
35 up to 70,

37
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.320
you get eight random.
35 to 70 is now is how many of them are happy,

38
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.460
actually truly happy,
maybe too,
right?

39
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.590
How many people do think are happy?
Well,

40
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:26.400
they just did a study as a famous Harris study on happiness in this country.

41
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:31.020
I think 67% of the people are unhappy that it's fucked.

42
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.360
Here's what I did.
This jail,
you'll,
this is a good test.
Maybe you,

43
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.250
you'll want to do this.

44
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.650
I did this when I was speaking at an event for 500 Wall Street people recently

45
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.690
and it was fascinating.
I'll,
I'll take you through it.

46
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:44.190
You can tell me if you're comfortable with it,

47
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.300
but if you take all the areas of your life and put them in a blender,
okay,

48
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.140
so take a,
where you live,
your relationships,
your finances,
your health,

49
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.050
everything,
everything.
Put it in one fucking big blender and blend it up.

50
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.100
And on a scale of one to 10 with a 10 being the Dalai Lama of happiness and a

51
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:07.240
one being a guidance at rock was zero.
Being someone that's at rock bottom.

52
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.340
What your happiness number

53
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.050
<v 1>me?
Yeah,
I'm pretty fucking happy.
Well,
I don't know.
I wouldn't do it that way.</v>

54
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.140
I definitely wouldn't give it a number.
Okay.
Because I feel like the,
you're,

55
00:03:18.141 --> 00:03:20.750
you're making something,
you're,

56
00:03:20.751 --> 00:03:25.751
you're turning like a constant state of thinking and expression and

57
00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:33.150
consideration.
You're turning it into a number.
And I just,

58
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.980
I don't like that idea.

59
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.800
I don't like that idea because I think it's a management issue.

60
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.240
I think a lot of what happiness is a management issue and decisions that you're

61
00:03:42.241 --> 00:03:46.080
making right now.
Like you could be in a shit state of mind right now,

62
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.000
but you can make some decisions to adjust that and over the next couple hours

63
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.500
you'll get to a much better place.
And these constant management decisions,

64
00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:57.960
they waver in and out of your life on a daily basis.

65
00:03:57.961 --> 00:03:59.770
Like this idea that you could have a good mindset,

66
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.930
then all of a sudden you'll be happy.
That's horse shit.
Like it's,
that's like,

67
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:05.250
it's like the tide,

68
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.820
it comes in and it comes out and there's gonna be days where you're just not

69
00:04:08.821 --> 00:04:12.240
feeling so good physically and that's going to affect the way your happiness

70
00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:16.110
level is.
It's never static.
It's not the exactly the same.
True.

71
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.340
But if you look at it overall at 30,000 feet and you had to give yourself a

72
00:04:20.341 --> 00:04:24.270
grade,
we happy as fuck is what I would say.
Happy.
Okay.

73
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.310
I'll take that.
I'll take that.
Most people in that room,
yeah,

74
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.040
raised there.
I said if anyone is seven and uh,
you know,

75
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.330
for anyone listening that wants to do it,
raise your hand if you're,
you know,

76
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.120
<v 0>seven or below.
I don't want to put anyone on the spot.</v>

77
00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:42.930
And majority of the room stood up being a seven and thinking,
you know,

78
00:04:42.931 --> 00:04:46.350
like seven's pretty happy number but a seven

79
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.880
<v 1>if my son comes home with a 70 on a test</v>

80
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.680
<v 0>to c minus.
Right.
And all I'm saying is,</v>

81
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.600
but what was interesting about the test though,

82
00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.080
if you do actually go through the process for those that like go through the and

83
00:05:00.081 --> 00:05:01.510
get a number in their head or whatever,

84
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:05.690
do you want to give yourself a grade your brain or automatically goes to a 10

85
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.710
and then subtract the two or three things pop in that make you better bring your

86
00:05:09.711 --> 00:05:10.544
happiness down.

87
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.780
It's a great way to identify what's making you unhappy and that,

88
00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:16.760
you know what I mean?
Like you started at 10 you're like,

89
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.830
oh fuck my relationship or this or that.

90
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.030
Usually it triggers an automatic like this is what's fucked up in my life

91
00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:27.230
response and you can,
it helps you identify.
But it's interesting.

92
00:05:27.231 --> 00:05:31.460
We have benchmarks and so many things in our life.
You have an Iq test,

93
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.470
you have tax brackets to measure your,
your wealth or financial statements.

94
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.040
You have Iq tests.
Like I said,
you can get on a scale to measure your weight,

95
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.290
but you're right,
happiness is one of those things.

96
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:44.360
It's like how do you benchmark it?

97
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.340
<v 1>You know what I mean?
It kind of fluctuates and it's like hunger.
I mean it's,</v>

98
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:51.640
it's,
it's,
it's something that's go,
it goes in and out.
It's always there.

99
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.580
But happy as fuck is a is a good answer.
Yeah.
But I,

100
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:59.581
this is something I've cultivated for a long time and avoided things that make

101
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:04.670
me unhappy and figured out what those things are and been very rigid about

102
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:06.320
eliminating them from my life.

103
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.450
And one of the big ones is eliminating interactions with people that are

104
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:14.220
negative.
That is gigantic and B,

105
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.640
because I've realized that I'm not really as independent as I used to like to

106
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:20.474
think I was,

107
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.050
I used to like to think that my thought process was independent and that I don't

108
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:27.140
give a fuck what anybody thinks.
That's nonsense.

109
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.580
People say that because they absolutely care what people think and it bothers

110
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:35.060
them so they say,
I don't give a fuck,
but that I don't give a fuck.

111
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.800
Stuff is almost entirely nonsense.
You do care and you care in both ways.

112
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:42.960
You care if people are critical of you've care if people are positive view,

113
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:48.190
but you also care if people are living positive lives and they're motivating

114
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:52.520
you.
That's that's a big one.
People are fuel and other people.

115
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.440
It's one of the reasons why I like talking to people.

116
00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:57.230
One of the reasons why I like to do podcasts because I get a lot out of,

117
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.220
you know,
like just talking to you about your time in the monastery or your,

118
00:07:00.221 --> 00:07:02.540
your push to get to that hundred miles.

119
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:07.541
Like you get energy out of people like that and you think about this energy and

120
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:10.400
you think about this inspiration when you're doing other things.

121
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.260
And it also sets in your mind that when you meet these exceptional people that

122
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:19.460
move you,
like what are the characters?
What are the qualities that they have?

123
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:22.130
What are the characteristics that they,
that they possess?

124
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.370
And those things become significant and important to you.

125
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.750
Whereas if you live around a bunch of people that are complaining and bitching

126
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:33.620
about everything and they see the negative in everything and they're always

127
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:37.370
whining,
those people are the opposite of that.

128
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.190
They're the opposite of inspiration and they're,
they're just there.

129
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.560
They're mud and you're just like,
whoa.

130
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.980
It's like you're up to your ankles and bud,
you try to trudge through life.

131
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:49.840
It's difficult.
You're not light.
It's not,
it's not pushing it.

132
00:07:49.841 --> 00:07:53.870
It's not a wind at your back.
The winds in your face and it's rough,
you know?

133
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:58.871
And over time I've learned that these people,

134
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.400
you just,
you're not going to fix him.

135
00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:04.070
I used to want to fix them when I was young.
I used to want to go,
hey man,

136
00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:07.550
I see what you're doing.
Like,
dude,
don't do that anymore.
Listen,
just try it.
Just,

137
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.180
just do this and,
and stop doing that and start doing this.

138
00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:13.760
And if you just work towards this,
you could be successful.

139
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:16.760
And then a week later the guys doing the same shit and you're like,
okay,

140
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:20.540
I'm wasting a significant amount of my energy on someone who doesn't want to

141
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:22.730
waste any of their energy on themselves.

142
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.790
And so managing the,

143
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:28.400
the community and the tribe that you're in,

144
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:33.410
making sure that you're a good member of that tribe,
that your doing your part,

145
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.161
you know?

146
00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:39.161
And there's a lot of cynicism in these days about a inspiration and about

147
00:08:41.301 --> 00:08:43.760
motivation because there's a lot of fake shit.
You know,

148
00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:48.761
you can go on Instagram and you see a million of these inspirational quote pages

149
00:08:49.431 --> 00:08:52.490
and there were run by people that are probably depressed.
You know,

150
00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:54.230
you see a lot of people that are,
you know,

151
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.280
talking about how to get ahead in life,

152
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:58.740
but they're not really doing anything themselves.

153
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.960
So there's a lot of cynicism involved in that.

154
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.100
But there's also sincerity in it and you can get,

155
00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:08.280
if you just look at it with a pure heart and a pure mind,

156
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.110
you can get a lot of energy out of that.

157
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.980
And when you're around happy,

158
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.740
inspirational people that are successful,

159
00:09:16.741 --> 00:09:20.220
it makes you feel better and you get inspired.

160
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.150
And if you act on that inspiration,
your life will be more fulfilled.

161
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.240
And it's not just inspirational in terms of financial success,

162
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:31.050
but in terms of doing difficult things,
whether it's running a hundred miles,

163
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:33.600
it doesn't pay you a goddamn thing other than the the,

164
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:38.690
the wealth of the knowledge that you can push yourself to such an extreme or

165
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:39.541
anything else.

166
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:42.630
Whether it's someone who becomes really good at playing chess or someone who's

167
00:09:42.631 --> 00:09:45.630
really good at martial arts or,
or whatever it is,
there's,

168
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.850
there's a great feeling in these overcoming these difficult things because life

169
00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:55.851
is never this just constant state of I'm at a nine all day and when I'm with my

170
00:09:56.641 --> 00:10:01.230
wife,
I hit 10 Yay and I stay like that.
That's not real.

171
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:06.410
What's real is like you saying that you went to this monastery and felt all

172
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:10.200
this,

173
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:15.200
this anx about meditating and being alone and not having your phone and not

174
00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:19.110
having the input,
but then when it comes out of it,
then you have this reward.

175
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:19.800
So you,

176
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.570
you push through this and you had these uncomfortable feelings and you came out

177
00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:28.620
of those uncomfortable feelings with this newfound appreciation for time and

178
00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:33.621
this new found respect for your own existence in your own space and carving out

179
00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:37.440
three hours for yourself a day.
That's where it all comes from.

180
00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:42.120
It all comes from life lessons and the lessons that are learned through struggle

181
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.510
and I think that there's a lot of people out there that think somehow or another

182
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:48.210
you're going to get to some place where you're living in silk sheets and you get

183
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:52.590
your toes done or someone's dropping grapes into your mouth.
I don't want that.

184
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.350
I've never wanted that.
That guy's not going to be happy.

185
00:10:55.351 --> 00:10:57.180
He's going to be bored our into the grapes.

186
00:10:57.181 --> 00:11:01.170
You can we get those fucking grapes away from me.
Stop painting my toes.

187
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.040
What am I doing in this bed?
I got to do something.
I'm not stimulated.

188
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.780
The human organism,

189
00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:11.660
the animal that we are needs constant stimulation because it evolved.

190
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.660
Trying to find food and escape enemies and find shelter,

191
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:19.470
escape nature,
escape the elements,
try to survive.

192
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.220
And this is the great joy that you haven't taken care of your children,

193
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.880
that you can protect your children from the elements and the enemies and feed

194
00:11:26.881 --> 00:11:30.300
them.
And,
and it's also the great sadness that you see in losers.

195
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:34.110
When I see a loser,
I see some guys,
43 years old,

196
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:37.090
lives in his parents' basement and he fucking hates the world.

197
00:11:37.091 --> 00:11:39.270
And like that was a baby man.

198
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:43.110
This is a baby that somebody just gave shitty nutrients to,

199
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:48.290
whether its nutrients in the forms of food or in the form of thoughts and ideas

200
00:11:48.961 --> 00:11:50.250
and the examples.

201
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:55.400
And this kid developed this horrible defeating patterns of behavior that have

202
00:11:55.991 --> 00:12:00.991
led them to this point where there's this middle aged person with no future and

203
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:05.830
no idea of how to get out of this Rut and probably never will escape it and

204
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:08.710
might just wind up sucking on a gun.
You know?
I mean this is,

205
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:10.420
this is the world that we live in today.

206
00:12:10.421 --> 00:12:15.190
And I think part of that world is because we have been fed this line of Horse

207
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.580
Shit that you're supposed to seek comfort and I don't think you are.

208
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.140
I think you're supposed to seek lessons and you supposed to seek difficult tasks

209
00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:24.340
and and and,
and,

210
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.270
and accomplishments and through those things and through doing things that are

211
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:31.570
hard to do,
even if it's just a fucking 90 minute hot yoga class,

212
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.840
I do a 90 minute yoga class,
man.
I those last 20 minutes,

213
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:36.820
I do not want to be there man.

214
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.270
And I definitely don't want to give 100% and I can cheat.
I can,

215
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.610
I could kind of half acid.
I can,
I can,

216
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.520
but if I don't and I get through it,

217
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.240
when that time is up and the lady says no day and everybody gets up,

218
00:12:49.241 --> 00:12:52.930
I'm like fuck man,
I made it,
you know,
I lost 15 pounds.

219
00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:54.630
My fucking Yoga Mat is drenched.

220
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:58.930
The point where I get literally wring it out and fill up a jug up with water.

221
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.360
But through that struggle,

222
00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:05.560
I will now have a better day and I better fucking do it again tomorrow or do

223
00:13:05.561 --> 00:13:07.690
something else.
Because if I just think,
well,

224
00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:12.100
tomorrow I'm just going to coast and eat Twinkies and watch TV.
Oh,
hello sadness,

225
00:13:12.101 --> 00:13:15.490
my old friend.
Hello.
Depression.
Because when you're not doing anything,

226
00:13:15.491 --> 00:13:18.580
you feel like shit,
and that's just a part of being a human being.

227
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.730
And we can pretend that we're something other than what we really are and we

228
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:26.110
could pretend me,
man,
I'm just cool.
Just chilling,
doing nothing.
Bullshit.

229
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.400
You're a fucking human.
You're a human being.
You,

230
00:13:28.401 --> 00:13:31.990
you evolve from the fucking hundreds,

231
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.300
thousands of years of hunters and gatherers and people who are struggling.

232
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:39.130
Those real human reward systems are carved deeply into your DNA.

233
00:13:39.131 --> 00:13:40.420
And if you don't respect that,

234
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.800
if you don't respect the mechanism of happiness and fulfillment and what you

235
00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:49.570
really need to do in order to feel satisfied in life,
comradery,

236
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:54.610
love,
family,
friendship,
struggle,
testing yourself,

237
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.760
learning,
all those things are imperative.

238
00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.770
They're all a giant part of being a person.
