00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.580
The joe rogan experience.
I think we learned a lot today.

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.890
Um,
I did not know that you could make a fucking phone call with an artificial

3
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:12.840
intelligence thing that could say,
um,

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.960
and would make appointments for you and shit.
We all learned that,

5
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.220
that scared the shit out of me.

6
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.060
I didn't know about these Choo Choo train fake vagina attractions that these

7
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:28.570
kids are hacking as wacky kids.
I learned that I'm,

8
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.690
I am very confused when it comes to the future.
Very.

9
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:34.524
This stuff is,

10
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.860
I think this is all happening in front of us and I think it's insanely crazy and

11
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.080
insanely transformative and it's happening.

12
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.080
We don't have a fucking clue as to where it's going and there's nothing we can

13
00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:48.510
do about it.
So we're all like,
well,
it is what it is.

14
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.600
I think it's nuts.
I think we are,

15
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:57.780
we're 20 years from the fucking matrix and we're seeing it happen.

16
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.850
We're seeing it happen right now in front of us.

17
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.180
We're seeing the little baby steps like,
Nah,
Nah,
we're so far off.
Yeah.

18
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:07.140
I went to that whole thing the other day.
It was nothing.
Went to the conference?

19
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.580
Nah,
nothing impressed me.

20
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.760
Would you rather find out that we're about to be in it or that we've been in it

21
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:14.190
the whole time?
Which would make you more comfortable?

22
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.510
That's a very good question.
Damn,
that's a good question.
What do you think,

23
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.540
uh,
I think we're already in it.
Soc Two is that one,

24
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.900
well,
gun to the head,
what would you do?
Why would she say?

25
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.960
I think the reality itself is obviously some sort of weird thing because you're

26
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:36.030
looking at it,
you looking at it through your eyes.

27
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.140
Your eyes are determining the positions that things are in and what they look

28
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:42.780
like and where things are.
And these,

29
00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:45.090
all these things that are going on around you all the time,

30
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:47.790
do you have no control of,
and they're everywhere all over the planet.

31
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:50.250
People living lives and you interface with those lives.

32
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:53.490
Occasionally you're just accustomed to the manner in which you do it.

33
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.890
So it seems normal.
But every night you close your eyes and you go unconscious.

34
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.180
And who knows what the fuck happens to your brain.

35
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.480
And then you wake up in the morning and you have to pee and you're struggling to

36
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:07.050
try to figure out what happened yesterday.
And then while this is happening,

37
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:09.720
your ex girlfriend's fucking your best friend from high school and they got

38
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:12.400
together and you know,
it's like,
can't believe Jamie left.

39
00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:14.040
I mean he said he was gonna stay forever.

40
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.650
And then next thing you know like this is these,

41
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:19.740
all these lives intersect with each other all over the world.

42
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.720
It is kind of a hologram.
It's kind of a crazy react.
If,
if the,

43
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.800
if real life wasn't real,
it would be super interesting.

44
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.500
You'd be like,
look at the way life works.

45
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:36.501
Look at the way they breathe in air and breathe out carbon dioxide and the trees

46
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:39.300
breathe into carbon dioxide and breathe that air.

47
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.900
But they keep chopping down the trees.
They keep chopping down the trees,

48
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:45.510
they don't care.
They're like,
who cares?
I want paper.

49
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.020
I want to wipe my ass with a tree.
They just wipe their ass with trees.
Literally,

50
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:54.021
they grind millions of trees down every year and turned into pulp so they can

51
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:58.290
make paper to wipe their ass.
They literally wiped her ass with nature.

52
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.700
Why don't they just use soap and water?
No,
no.
I want a treat.

53
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.440
I want some pulverized tree to wipe my ass with tissue paper.

54
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.410
It's tissue paper.
It's fucking trees.

55
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.510
It's tissue paper really made out of trees.
It's a hundred percent yeah.

56
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.010
Synthetic tissue paper that's made out of like dolphin tears.
Somebody force,

57
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.900
what did they,
what?
It's like synthetic toilet papers.
That real shit.
I mean,
look,

58
00:03:27.901 --> 00:03:30.210
they have tofu chicken,
right?

59
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.410
You don't think they have like some sort of an organic and make plastic out of

60
00:03:34.411 --> 00:03:36.530
it,
I think.
Hmm.

61
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.660
Do they make hemp toilet paper and would it be too rough?

62
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.890
They'd be the best thing ever.
Free free bathroom tissue,

63
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.940
hemp 20 someone's doing it and so on to putting it together.

64
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.440
<v 1>Sure.</v>
