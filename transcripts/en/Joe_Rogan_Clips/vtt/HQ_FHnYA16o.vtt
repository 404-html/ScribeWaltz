WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.310
There's of the year,
you know,
such as every quarter,
you know,

2
00:00:02.311 --> 00:00:05.970
for a week where you're eating a plant based diet or you're restricting me,

3
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:09.720
you're basically giving your body a break from being in that constant anabolic

4
00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:12.240
state.
And I think that the,

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.890
the carnivores diet causes a lot of people to miss out on some of those
elements.

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.360
And then if you look at the blood work of uh,
um,
you know,

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.930
that doctor who doesn't cry or die,

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.040
he publishes blood work online and I don't know what else is going on with them

9
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:27.420
from a health standpoint,
but,
but you know,

10
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.430
I had really high blood glucose and really low testosterone and some things that

11
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:36.580
suggest that it might not be healthy to eat just meat,
you know?
And,

12
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.360
and did you have any really low testosterone?
That's interesting.

13
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:42.890
It's like 200 to 300.
It was really low.
Like really low.
Yeah.

14
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:47.040
Diagnosable hypogonadism combined with uh,
uh,
you know,

15
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:51.060
almost like borderline diabetes.
It did.
Is it possible to do it after a workout?

16
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.100
Uh,
he does a lot of rowing show,
real high intense pressure testosterone.

17
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:57.000
That's significantly,

18
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.030
it would increase your HSC RP and your inflammatory markers,
right?

19
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:01.050
Which is why you never want to,

20
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.680
you never want to go to a doctor for a heart checkup after you've done a workout

21
00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:06.570
cause they're going to tell you you're going to have a heart attack based on the

22
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:07.700
levels of HSC RP,

23
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.080
but you know that blood work is just one example and I don't want to pretend

24
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:16.620
like that.
One example you know,
is going to paint with a broad brush,

25
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:19.740
the entire carnivore diet phenomenon.
But I just,

26
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.890
I think that unrestricted protein intake,

27
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.100
an unrestricted meat intake probably has an accelerated aging effect on the body

28
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:27.480
and well,
here's the different doctor.

29
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.030
Ron Rosedale is a doc who has some good information on that.

30
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.230
He's got a good video online.

31
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.520
What's going on with this carnivore diet is there's no science behind it.

32
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:37.700
There's a lot of people that are giving it a shot and a lot of people are

33
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.030
finding good results.
But I find that people when they just change things,

34
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.470
there's a period of time where they say they feel great and I that is absolutely

35
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:49.920
100% of placebo effect.
It's the same thing as like a Vegan Diet.

36
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:54.210
You feel fantastic and named me,
well name me one population,

37
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:59.211
one blue zone that eats meat like and nothing else.

38
00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.881
And there's,

39
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:04.170
there's actually very few centenarians who are purely Vegan for their entire

40
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:06.960
life because you can,
if you don't do it the right way,

41
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:10.080
build up fatty acid deficits,
amino acid deficits.

42
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.850
Korea is when you don't get vitamin B 12 a Dha,

43
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.100
but at least it's been studying screen on Vegans,
right?

44
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.670
You spend a lot of studies on vegans and we know that if you eat,
uh,

45
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.480
like e three live,
you know,
you,
oh you can,
you can supplement.

46
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.110
There's a lot of really smart vegans.
I mean there's guys like rich roll,

47
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.400
like they do things the right way,
right?
It's,

48
00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:32.870
it's the ball jeans a lot easier to see the piece of meat.

49
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.120
It's very little to get some of the B 12 and some of the other amino acids

50
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:38.910
you're trying to free up by soaking and sprouting and fermenting,

51
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.200
which my wife does a lot of it,
but I watch her like she,

52
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.390
she's in the kitchen like three hours a day making vegetables bioavailable cause

53
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.250
you wanted to take her hours to make sourdough bread.
Do you know,

54
00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:53.370
to actually make a bread where the gluten is pre digested and it's actually

55
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:55.000
healthy and the glycaemic index is lower.

56
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.050
She's not Vegan and she's just a rancher girl and she likes to do goats and

57
00:02:59.051 --> 00:03:02.800
chickens and we eat meat.
But she,

58
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.540
she's very into like an ancestral preparation of vegetables deactivating a lot

59
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:11.800
of these,
these stressors that doctor Steven Gundry talks about.
And you know,

60
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:12.461
before we pockets,

61
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:15.970
we're talking about Tom Brady and how he does like a no night shade,
no tomato,

62
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:19.630
no potato,
you know,
and I'd rather eat those things,

63
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:23.590
but actually figured out a way to render them more digestible and friendlier to

64
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:25.840
the human body.
Yeah.
That's the other thing too,

65
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:29.890
when people talk about food that has protein in it,
um,
you know,

66
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:34.100
like Broccoli has so much protein,
true,
not really bioavailable.

67
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.730
That shit ton of Broccoli.
It's just not the same.

68
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:39.870
Your body doesn't absorb it the same way it does it grass fed,
rib eye steak.

69
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.240
Yeah.
Body absorbs that protein instantly.
He knows exactly what that is.
Yeah.

70
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.530
By the way,
there,
there was a study that just came out about stem cells.

71
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.580
They found that carnosine,
which you find in copious amounts in,
you know,

72
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.120
grass fed,
rib eye steak with blueberry extract,

73
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.050
enhanced your stem cell production.
I mean,
it was a hugely significant number.

74
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:00.580
I don't remember the exact percentage,
but,

75
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.880
but this combination of polyphenols and flavonols with meat is a good combo.

76
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.400
That's why when I did the Carnivore Diet,
not the cardboard,
I,
that's why I was,

77
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.850
when I was eating meat,
I was doing lots of salads.
I was doing lots of,

78
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.680
I had like wild blueberry extract powder.
I had these vegetable powders,
you know,

79
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:22.030
I was doing a lot of big salads for lunch,
flavonols,
polyphenols,

80
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:25.480
any of that.
Uh,
same thing with the high saturated fat diet.

81
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.250
A high saturated fat diet,

82
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:32.251
like the whole coconut oil thing is highly inflammatory in the absence of plant

83
00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:36.550
polyphenols and flavonols,
which is why if you're doing a high fat ketotic diet,

84
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.550
it needs to be a plant rich,
high fat Ketonic Diet.

85
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.910
Otherwise things on those lines.
You can get a lot of your father,
I mean,

86
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:44.440
Avocados,
yes,

87
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:48.310
but I'm talking about more like you doing coconut oil and butter and you know,

88
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:50.890
your avocado chocolate pudding and all these things.
You know,
you're,

89
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.950
you're Kenogenic fat bombs and all these recipes that are out there,

90
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.180
but he got itas badge out,
eat a lot of plants.
Even in the animal kingdom,

91
00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:01.510
you see animals when they rip up another animal,
like a carnivorous animal,

92
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.370
they're in the intestines and the reading.

93
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:07.120
A lot of the organs that are chock full of what grass plants or herbs,

94
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.230
whatever that omnivorous animal that the carnivorous animal is eating.

95
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.940
Predict exactly when you're talking about carnivorous diets,

96
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.180
the real issue that I have with it is there's almost no research other than Dr.

97
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.110
Baker doing those tests on himself.

98
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:26.360
Which according to you are not very promising.
I didn't,

99
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.340
I have some friends that are trying it.
Um,
my friend Jordan Peterson,

100
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:34.960
his daughter had some serious anti,
some serious,
um,

101
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.890
uh,
immune system issues,
autoimmune disorders,

102
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.690
and uh,
like to the point where she's had a,
she's,
I believe she's like 30,
31,

103
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:46.090
she had a hip replaced.
She's about to get one of her,
uh,

104
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.330
ankles replaced like serious arthritis,
real problems.

105
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:51.310
The only thing that's been able to clear that up,
his meat,

106
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.050
just a pure meat diet with some people,
but she might have some,

107
00:05:56.051 --> 00:05:59.330
I wouldn't say the only thing,
allergic reaction to plants.

108
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.690
I mean there might be something,
I don't hurt the meat wasn't the medicine.

109
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.180
Probably the elimination of whatever.
She's what I'm saying.

110
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.340
She might have some sort of a,

111
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.420
a real serious problem of some sort of allergic reaction to some plants or to

112
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:17.270
gluten and maybe a bunch of different ways.
A lot of these diets are,

113
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.660
it's the elimination,
not the magic of just dating me,

114
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.820
but Sean Baker keeps going on and on about how meat heels and meet this and meet

115
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:29.930
that all carnivorous diet and you know all these people are trying it.
Like man,

116
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:35.210
it's got a lot of good stuff going for it.
But but restriction of plant matter,

117
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:39.920
in my opinion,
long term is not a good idea and eating meat all the time,

118
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.000
long term is not necessarily good idea and eating only plants with the absence

119
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:46.550
of some meat based protein is for a lot of populations.

120
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.260
Not that great of an idea.
Yeah.

121
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:53.150
Well that's the point is that for most people you're going to have to experiment

122
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:56.030
a little bit to figure out what works best for you.
And there are people that,

123
00:06:56.031 --> 00:07:01.031
especially if you use ie three live and algae and get your beat 12 vitamins and

124
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:04.700
your fat soluble vitamins,
you can live off of Vegan Diet.
It can be done,

125
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.290
but you really have to be careful about it.

126
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.700
But then there's other people where they can't and,

127
00:07:08.701 --> 00:07:12.890
and you really have to figure out what the fuck is going on with the whole

128
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:16.130
carnival thing to me is kind of tweaking me out because I just don't,

129
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.010
it's like they start talking about the,

130
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.810
the poisons and Fido toxins and all these things that are in plants that are bad

131
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:26.600
for you.
I'm like,
okay,

132
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.530
the issue with mild hormetic exercise bad for you.

133
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:35.531
Sunlight's bad for all that stuff cause I'm a medic stressor is that your body

134
00:07:35.541 --> 00:07:38.380
responds to that in a positive way and show some of that.

135
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.290
Some of the rodents outside of Chernobyl are living longer from the radiation.

136
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:43.700
And I'm not saying like go,

137
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:46.640
go move your cabinet next to a nuclear disaster website.

138
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.290
But the idea is that so hormetic stressor,
mild amounts of Uva and UVB.
