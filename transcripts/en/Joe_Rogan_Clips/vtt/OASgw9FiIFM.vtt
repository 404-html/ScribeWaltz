1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.330
Oh,
Trump got a lot of criticism for saying they were going to pull troops out of

2
00:00:03.331 --> 00:00:06.190
Syria.
Yup.
And when,
when you see,
you know,

3
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.250
the debate about that or actions possible actions against North Korea and all

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.470
this kind of stuff,
like how do you,
do you,
do you view this,

5
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.790
I mean obviously you view this as a guy who has served,
it's been overseas,

6
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.500
but do you,

7
00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:23.680
do you look at things like these are potential issues that are coming up and

8
00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:24.880
things you need to be concerned with

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.130
<v 1>the Syria and,
well the Syria one,</v>

10
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:33.840
there are guys from the community over there.
They've been actively engaged.

11
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.320
Iraq,
it's funny,
the news reported for a long time.

12
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.610
We've withdrawn from Iraq,
all US troops out of Iraq.
No they weren't.

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.990
We've always had a presence there since we invaded in 2003 so [inaudible] and I

14
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:46.824
can go

15
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.400
tit for tat on a lot of issues where the news gets it wrong,

16
00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:55.950
which is why I don't necessarily look at it for me to inform my opinion.
Uh,

17
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.690
serious.
Certainly any area where

18
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.100
we allow a place for the,

19
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.950
and the only word I have for it is evil to grow.

20
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.263
It's going to happen.

21
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.890
The problem with the strategy that I see it is,

22
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.360
is that actually you.
So we started in Afghanistan,
and again,
this is my opinion,

23
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:20.780
not the military opinion.
I can only speak for myself.
We went into Afghanistan,

24
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:24.380
we were incredibly effective.
So we cut the head off of that snake,

25
00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:27.650
but it spawned two more.
Uh,
you go into Iraq,

26
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.990
you can argue whether or not we were effective,

27
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.840
but then all of a sudden we started seeing foreign fighters coming in from all

28
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:37.550
of these different countries and the tactics that we started seeing used in
Iraq,

29
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:42.551
like my first deployment to Afghanistan in 2003 now 2002,

30
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.140
uh,
it was not uncommon to drive around in vehicles that were not ballistic.

31
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.700
They were not a resistant to mines.

32
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.590
It would just Tacoma a thin skin to combo that bolt would zip right through.

33
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.140
Fast forward to Afghanistan in 2008 and they're starting to see vehicles being

34
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:04.220
detonated by bombs that we first saw in Iraq that were coming across the border

35
00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:08.930
into Syria where they were had the ability to allow,

36
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.740
again,
for lack of a better term,
that evil to grow,

37
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.710
to learn to come across the border,
to engage American forces,

38
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:17.870
then to flee into a sovereign nation.
We couldn't do anything about.

39
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.510
Then we started seeing that in Afghanistan,

40
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.720
but we got effective anytime that these people would get together and have a

41
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:24.261
large group,

42
00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:28.370
we'd get effective at either capturing them or killing them so they realize they

43
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:30.830
need to be disaggregated.
So now we've spread this.

44
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.220
I think the last stat that I saw was isis is in 64 countries and the problem

45
00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:39.440
that I see with the u s military is that we're very,

46
00:02:39.441 --> 00:02:41.990
very good at going in and cutting the head off of the snake,

47
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.660
but we're not good at creating and holding infrastructure and the timeline

48
00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:50.750
required to hold that infrastructure is well beyond the Palette.

49
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.010
I think of most Americans,
and the best example I can point to is South Korea.

50
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.700
We still have basis with an American presence in South Korea.

51
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.830
That war ended decades ago.
We still have basis in Germany.

52
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:07.390
We have basis in Italy now.
We're not necessarily using it for the same purposes,

53
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:09.790
but if we really want to control that area,

54
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:12.340
we have to be prepared to stay there for that long.

55
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.670
And I don't think the u s military one has enough personnel to do that and I

56
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:21.130
don't think the American populace has the Palette to allow that to happen.

57
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.140
<v 0>Do you think that that's necessary in order to protect people from whether</v>

58
00:03:27.481 --> 00:03:32.350
whether it's isis or whatever comes after isis?
I mean,
yeah,

59
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.230
obviously isis is fairly recent,
right?

60
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.370
<v 1>Al Qaeda,
Isis and they chat.
Yeah,
the Isol and all that.
Yep.</v>

61
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.340
<v 0>Whatever could be next.
Yeah.
So you,</v>

62
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.240
you feel like we have to maintain presence in that part of the world,
period.

63
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.040
<v 1>I think we should use the military as a measure of last resort.</v>

64
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.870
I think that war should be a measure of absolutely last resort.

65
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:56.050
And I would love to see us evolve to a point where we use it less and less and

66
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:57.760
less.
Um,

67
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.150
I describe it as you're standing at a dam and you can see it,

68
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:05.250
a little spout coming out.

69
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.420
Do you put your finger in the spout knowing that it's not going to fix the

70
00:04:11.421 --> 00:04:11.960
problem,

71
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.960
but it was going to buy you time to hopefully have somebody come and fix the

72
00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:15.681
damn right.

73
00:04:15.681 --> 00:04:18.920
That's the option I would go for versus just leaving it as it is and allowing it

74
00:04:18.921 --> 00:04:22.790
to continue to weaken the dam or another sprout and come out my theory that the

75
00:04:22.791 --> 00:04:26.840
military is really well served to provide that space,

76
00:04:26.841 --> 00:04:28.730
to put that finger in that sprout.
So yes,

77
00:04:28.731 --> 00:04:33.200
I think if we find an area where these ideologies are thriving,

78
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.920
we have to do what is necessary to remove that ideology and hopefully destroy

79
00:04:39.291 --> 00:04:43.820
it.
Not,
not resettle it somewhere else,
but actually destroyed.
So yes,

80
00:04:43.821 --> 00:04:46.640
the short answer is absolutely.

81
00:04:46.641 --> 00:04:51.440
If we find areas where we can squash this down,
we have to go.

82
00:04:51.441 --> 00:04:55.610
But I just hope that there's people smarter than me that had a much longer term

83
00:04:55.611 --> 00:05:00.320
strategy because all we're doing,
in my opinion,
is the finger in the dam.

84
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.130
<v 0>And is there a longer term strategy,
like when you see all the global conflicts?</v>

85
00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:07.610
I mean,
is there a time that we get,
I mean it's,
it's,

86
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.700
it sounds insane to say that there's never going to be a time where there's no

87
00:05:10.701 --> 00:05:12.590
war.
It sounds like an insane thing to say.

88
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.140
<v 1>I don't know if there's ever been a time,
at least globally,</v>

89
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.370
not that the u s was involved,

90
00:05:16.371 --> 00:05:18.770
but I don't know if there's ever been a time where there hasn't been worth,

91
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.030
I don't think their house,
I don't think there can be because,
and I,

92
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.470
I think we talked about this the first day I met you.

93
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.300
There's x people and there's white people.

94
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.770
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

95
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.080
<v 1>They're not going to get along.
It doesn't matter what your belief is.</v>

96
00:05:30.081 --> 00:05:32.120
You have an access somewhere that has another belief.

97
00:05:32.121 --> 00:05:33.860
And if you go to the extreme end of that belief,

98
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.190
that individual may be willing to take action against you,

99
00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:39.980
violent action against you for your belief.
And there's,

100
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.350
I don't think there's a way around that because humans are just too diverse,

101
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.770
<v 0>but is it possible that one day we'll move past this?
I mean,</v>

102
00:05:45.771 --> 00:05:50.771
is there any plans at all to try to facilitate some sort of a peaceful world

103
00:05:51.081 --> 00:05:52.900
civilization where you know,

104
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.590
all nations kind of get along and some sort of a mutually agreeable?
I mean,

105
00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:58.130
does anybody

106
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.800
<v 1>have some sort of hundred year plan?
Isn't that hilarious that,</v>

107
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.990
that's a funny thing to say.
I mean,
they didn't brief me on it if it exists,

108
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.710
but isn't that fucked though?
I mean,

109
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.050
human beings are always going to shoot until each other.

110
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:11.060
We're always going to have war.
Isn't that fucked?

111
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.280
Since the inception of human beings,
it seems like at least at some level,

112
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:19.900
and it thankfully it's microscopic in comparison to the overall total,
right?

113
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.900
But it's happening.

114
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.900
I think it's happened since man has been walking on earth and the only way that

115
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:31.400
we feel today that we can protect ourselves is to have the more dominant,

116
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:35.480
more powerful military and to make sure that we're the ones who get to dictate

117
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:39.050
whether or not evil flourishes.
Yeah,
I mean that's,

118
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.810
I would want a maybe a,
I want the,

119
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.340
the dominant ability of our military to continue to grow,

120
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.640
but I'd like to see,
and I think it's already moving this direction,
smaller,

121
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:52.700
more surgical uses of it.
I just,
the military in my opinion,

122
00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:56.990
is not good at building infrastructure and holding terrain for a long period of

123
00:06:56.991 --> 00:06:59.570
time.
It's just not what we're designed to do.
Right.

124
00:06:59.571 --> 00:07:03.490
It's not the design of the military for that matter.
What,

125
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.410
what is the overall view about getting out of Syria?

126
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.900
It probably depends on the people that you ask.

127
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.220
What about people that you talk to?

128
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.430
Both sides of the coin.
I will get answers from.

129
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.580
I think we're making a difference to,
we're wasting our time

130
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.140
and I got that on the initial invasion of Iraq,

131
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.610
the initial invasion of Afghanistan.

132
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.330
There is one of the things that I enjoyed about the community I came from is

133
00:07:30.331 --> 00:07:32.820
that critical thinking was it's rewarded.
It's not,

134
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.980
there's no attempt and people think about this,
you know,

135
00:07:34.981 --> 00:07:37.170
you watched full metal jacket,
you know,

136
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.450
choke yourself with my hand and you get told what to do and how to do it,

137
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.610
how much time you have to do it.

138
00:07:41.611 --> 00:07:44.430
People think that critical thinking has no place in the military.

139
00:07:44.431 --> 00:07:45.600
But where I came from,

140
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.480
that's what we're looking for is people who are able to critically think.

141
00:07:48.481 --> 00:07:52.440
So there would be,
we would have political arguments,
religious arguments,

142
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.270
philosophical arguments in the team room and then come together and go do

143
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.180
exactly what it is that our nation expected us to do.

144
00:08:00.181 --> 00:08:02.310
So you're going to get both.
You get,

145
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.500
there are people who are conservative and Liberal,

146
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.720
Republican and Democrat and everything in between.
So I wish I could give you a,

147
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:09.990
like a very precise answer,

148
00:08:09.991 --> 00:08:14.640
but I have heard every spectrum of answer from this is awesome to,

149
00:08:14.641 --> 00:08:16.770
this is stupid.
I've,
you know what confuses me?

150
00:08:16.771 --> 00:08:20.010
I've heard different opinions on the sod,
whether Assad is evil,

151
00:08:20.011 --> 00:08:21.180
whether he's gassed his,

152
00:08:21.181 --> 00:08:24.240
his citizens or whether or not he's a victim of propaganda,

153
00:08:24.241 --> 00:08:28.380
some mass smear campaign like Whoa,
this is way past my pay grade.

154
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.660
I've heard the same thing and it's beyond mine as well too.

155
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:34.560
It's frustrating cause you know when you don't know whether or not this is some

156
00:08:34.561 --> 00:08:38.490
propaganda or this is a real threat or whether you know he or whether it's

157
00:08:38.491 --> 00:08:42.180
something like the Saddam Hussein's situation where yes,

158
00:08:42.181 --> 00:08:45.150
he was an evil dictator but also removing him.

159
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.860
Mike create a power vacuum like Libya had a power vacuum.
Yup.
Kadafi with Libya.

160
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.080
I mean Libya is a horrific example of that,
right?
Yeah.
And I don't,

161
00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.420
I don't know the longterm solution to those problems.
It's like I said,

162
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:01.254
I,

163
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:06.180
I spend enough of my waking hours truly questioning whether or not anything that

164
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:11.181
I was involved in made my family or your family or Jamie's family safer did.

165
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:15.840
I did,
I did my actions.

166
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.890
You road what the rest of the world thinks about the United States of America,

167
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.260
and I mean,
I,
I flew back and forth.
I think it had an impact in the moment.

168
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.610
I think it had an impact stopping the water coming out of the dam.

169
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:31.620
I think it was essential that it needed to be done,

170
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.580
but I don't know if any of that has an impact beyond that,

171
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.710
that time period that it occurred.
