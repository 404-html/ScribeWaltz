WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.330
Corns fucking terrible for you.
Terrible.
Absolutely terrible.
And,

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.060
and literally you can read that sign and all these people be like,
oh,

3
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:07.020
that's so beautiful.

4
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:09.930
Like all those corn stalks and then it'd be food for us forever.

5
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:14.931
And why cook when you cannot the percentage of diners or dinners rather eaten at

6
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:19.500
home that were actually made at home in the u s it is so weird to having you

7
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:23.490
here.
Not Jamie's the shit,
but this is just dinner.
So right,

8
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.640
so this is how many people are cooking,
but really that's the only meal.

9
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.610
A lower and lower.
So it's below,

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.520
it's somewhere in the 60% range.

11
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.010
So the percentage of it dinners eaten at home that were actually made at home in

12
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:43.011
the u s somewhere around 60% so in that 60% you got to think there's the mom or

13
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:49.980
the dad that's cooking and then the kids that are eating the food,

14
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:51.300
so they're not cooking shit.

15
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.950
So it's probably way lower than that in terms of the actual human beings that

16
00:00:55.951 --> 00:01:00.380
are eating cooked food that they cook themselves.
So how can you,

17
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.641
how can it,

18
00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:06.641
how can you stand on any sort of laurels at all without at least asking some

19
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:10.440
questions?
Yeah,
I mean,
people that their answers are,

20
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.070
they feel better if they think that they're doing no harm.

21
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.400
And the way to do no harm is to eat vegan.

22
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.600
So this is the ideology behind it.
And I understand it.
I get it.

23
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.340
I appreciate it.

24
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.580
But the fucking anger at people who don't follow that path is where it gets real

25
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:31.380
squirrely.
And it's a small number of people,

26
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:33.750
and I've talked about this in my act,

27
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.060
that the problem with vegans is the problem with people,
it's not veganism.

28
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.540
It's people.
If you get a room that has a hundred people in it,

29
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.870
the odds of one of those people being a fucking idiot is 100% it's almost a

30
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.400
hundred percent that one of them is a fucking idiot.
Yeah.

31
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.990
So if you get 300 million people,
you have 3 million fucking idiots.

32
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.830
And some of those folks are vegans.
And that's the problem with veganism.

33
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:02.100
It's not,
it's not veganism itself.
It's,

34
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.020
there's a certain percentage of human beings that they don't have to do anything

35
00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:10.530
to become vegans.
Right.
They just joined this group.
It's not like you have it.

36
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.580
Well we're,
we're thinking about louring you in to the Vegan culture,

37
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:17.430
but we want to know what your philosophy is.
Are you a hateful person?

38
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.320
Are you a person is looking to be a Vegan.

39
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:22.320
So you could just talk shit about other people.
Are you looking to be angry?

40
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:25.740
You're looking to be in a group or a gang,
a plant based gang,

41
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.220
and put the word Vegan in front of your name and just start talking shit.

42
00:02:29.221 --> 00:02:33.420
Cause that's a lot of the people.
Yeah.
And so people read all these angry,

43
00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:37.080
hateful things that these people,
right.
And they go,
oh well this is vegans.

44
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.220
But it's not,
it's not the most vegans are not like that at all people.

45
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.840
Most people are not like that at all.

46
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.410
But there's a certain percentage of them and they claim veganism and they

47
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:49.830
usually put that name,
the word Vegan in their fucking screen name.

48
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.120
That's how you can spot those assholes.
Yeah.
Proud.
Yeah,
they're into it.

49
00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:56.760
They're in a plant based gang.
Yeah.
That's really what happens.
Yeah.

50
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.720
And so what it is,
is not necessarily even a problem of diet.

51
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.730
It's a problem of human nature,

52
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.590
is that people love to stand on the moral high ground that will love to point

53
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:11.320
down to all the other people,
whether it's a religious issue,

54
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:14.770
like you're not eating Halau or you're not eating kosher,
or are you a,

55
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:17.590
you're eating meat on Good Friday.
Whenever the fuck it is,

56
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.330
they just decide that they have this moral high ground that you don't have,

57
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:24.190
so fuck you.
I'm doing it right.

58
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:27.730
And it really comes from our own questions of her own existence and this

59
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.970
messiness that we're all inherently aware of that life eats life big time,

60
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.390
big time.
There was a guy that I did a podcast without a Maine and he was,

61
00:03:39.391 --> 00:03:44.100
uh,
he was for sure a vegetarian.
He might've been a Vegan,

62
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.760
but then he started and he's a forge or big time.

63
00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:49.410
It's actually pretty remarkable what he does.

64
00:03:49.411 --> 00:03:53.520
But I think 99% of his food he finds in the forest year round,

65
00:03:53.521 --> 00:03:56.070
he's just into it.
Big Time process.

66
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.850
All of this food from wild apples to acorns to Tovar.
It's,
um,

67
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.200
what's his name?
Um,
Daniel vitality?

68
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.280
Yeah.
Oh,
Daniel Vitale's.
Okay.
Yeah.
Have you heard of him as well?
Yup.
So,
um,

69
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.870
so I did a podcast on him and he,
and he told me that,
um,

70
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.070
and he'd eat insects.
He didn't want it.
He has completely against hunting.

71
00:04:17.071 --> 00:04:19.440
He didn't want to kill anything.
He's like,
that's why he's eating insects.

72
00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:21.890
And he's like,
and I would get a little bit of hate mail.
Um,

73
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.960
when I started eating a Damsel,
flies and dragonflies,

74
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.610
like I'd get a little bit of hate mail.
And then,

75
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.970
and then a friend of his was like,
Hey,
you know,
we should,

76
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.840
let's go gig some frogs.
Let's go get some frogs,
you know?
And he's like,
yeah,

77
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:37.650
I dunno.
Okay,
so I'll do it.
So when he started catching frogs,
it's like,
man,

78
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.090
like there's a lot of meat on one of these frogs.
Like it's,
it's,
it's,

79
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.580
it's like 20 dragonflies,
you know.
And,
and he got,

80
00:04:44.581 --> 00:04:46.680
he got a little bit more flack for it.

81
00:04:46.681 --> 00:04:50.340
And then it's a buddy of his wanting to take him fishing and they caught a trout

82
00:04:50.341 --> 00:04:53.970
and he's like,
oh my God,
this is like three frogs.
Like this is three frog.

83
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.620
And so what he's equating it to is how much work he has to go through to get

84
00:04:58.621 --> 00:05:00.320
this protein or to get this,
you know,

85
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.170
to get this plant like you find one apple that's 15 acorns,
you know.
And so like,

86
00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:08.850
he's equating this to work.
And so he get just kept moving up the food chain.

87
00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:12.900
And um,
and he's like,
and then one year he killed a Turkey and he told me,

88
00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:14.790
it's like I killed a snowshoe hare and he's like,

89
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.680
I was blown away at how much meat was on a snowshoe hares.
He's like,
that was,

90
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.460
you know,
three meals for him and his girlfriend try a moose.
Yeah.

91
00:05:23.461 --> 00:05:25.500
And so he just kept moving up.
He killed a Turkey.

92
00:05:25.501 --> 00:05:27.120
Then this last year he killed a black bear.

93
00:05:27.121 --> 00:05:29.850
But he's like every stage that he's moved up,

94
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.800
his hate mail is went up exponentially,
but significantly.

95
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.820
And so it's just,
people equate all these things to,
you know,
they really,

96
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.140
we relate more to mammals,
obviously we're mammals,
you know,

97
00:05:40.141 --> 00:05:44.850
and then you bring in something like a bear that has anthropomorphic,
you know,

98
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.570
mannerisms,
right?
You,
you watch a black bear for a half a day and you're like,

99
00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:49.870
you see your dad,
you're like,
oh,

100
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.880
I just sat on his ass for four hours sometimes in the [inaudible] on his

101
00:05:53.881 --> 00:05:58.880
toenails.
Yeah.
He's like,
itch does ear farted pooped over there next to the girl?

102
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:02.270
And then,
you know,
and you're like,
oh my God,
it's my dad wanting my dad.
You know?

103
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:05.780
And,
and so,
you know,
there's things like that,
but,
um,

104
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.303
that's where this,

105
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.520
I think that's where this really cool engagement comes from with hunters is,

106
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.840
and there's a lot of hunters,

107
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:13.940
like I talked to a lot of hundreds and I don't want to be negative,

108
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:16.130
I'm trying not to be negative,
but I talked to a lot of hundreds that have no,

109
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.930
I have nothing in common with them.
Absolutely nothing.
Like Johann I hunt.

110
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.790
I don't even think we have that uncommon because I see how Johan and this had

111
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:25.840
nothing to do with how,
like what we were just saying about vegans,

112
00:06:25.841 --> 00:06:27.740
that the problem is just being a human being.

113
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.430
That's the amount of people that choose to hunt that or they're not well

114
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:34.670
informed and they're fucking idiots.
Yup.
And so that's,
that's the stuff is like,

115
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:36.350
same with the vegans,
you know,
there's,

116
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:40.250
I'm sure there's Vegan set sit at home and just grab their face and go,

117
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:41.780
I can't believe somebody just said that.

118
00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:44.020
I can't believe they sent a death threat.
Yeah.

119
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.250
We're Vegan for God's best friends is a Vegan.
Yeah.
And,

120
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.500
and I know it's hilarious.
Comedian,
he's a Vegan.
I know some vegans too.

121
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:54.360
And I actually know some vegetarians that,
um,
you know,

122
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.500
it was an education for me,
but I had some vegetarians hit me up for meat,

123
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.670
you know,
and I was like,
uh,
oh,
you're vegetarian.
And they're like,
well,
yeah,
yeah,

124
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:02.870
we're not going to eat this meat,

125
00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:06.710
but we'd love to have some fish or deer meat from you.
I was like,
oh,
okay.

126
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:08.840
Now I'm starting to,
this was a while ago,
but I'm like,
okay,

127
00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:09.830
now I'm starting to get it here.

128
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.700
Like people have ethical concerns about where their meat comes from.
Yeah.

129
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:14.900
My friend Jake Shields,

130
00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:18.830
he's a guy who fought in the UFC and he's a worldclass Jujitsu black belt.

131
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:20.150
He's been a vegetarian.
It's whole life.

132
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:23.330
But he said he would eat meat that was hunted.
Yeah.
It was like,
cause that's,

133
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.500
you know,
there's no ethical,
it adds up in his head for him.
Right.

134
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.890
Like answers his questions and so ugly.
But that's exactly it.

135
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.300
I've had some awesome conversations with,
with people that were not hunters that,

136
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.730
um,
asked great questions.
You know,

137
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:40.910
way better than conversations I've had with guys that call themselves hunters at

138
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:45.080
times.
Some.
Yeah.
I mean,
this again,
it's the problem with human beings,
right?
It's,

139
00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:47.450
there's,
there's certain people that just aren't thinking that much.

140
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.500
And then there's certain,

141
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.190
there's certain parts of the hunting culture that are really a boring there.

142
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.150
There,
there's,
there's,

143
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:58.151
there's people that think it's funny or fun to shoot as many animals as they can

144
00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:02.200
and they don't,
they don't have any consideration to the,

145
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.240
that this life has been taken so that your life can be nurtured or get nutrition

146
00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:12.500
from this animal.
And they're not thinking of it in terms of this cycle of life.

147
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.390
They're just thinking of in terms of,
you know,
it's,

148
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.560
it's like the worst aspects that you get,

149
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.660
like in a movie about hunting.
