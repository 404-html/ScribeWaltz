1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
I've had some,
I had some conflicts online.
One of them with a,
a bunch of vegans.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.460
They,
so you entertain somebody,
you're trying to be you like,

3
00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:10.030
I don't got time for that,
I'm not going to entertain.

4
00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:13.890
But every once while you just want to punch a troll in the phages would read the

5
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:14.431
comments.

6
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:17.880
That was the problem is that occasionally you read the comments are like Holy

7
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.870
Shit,
like people just want you dead.
Because anyway,

8
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.880
I had this whole thing in my act about chasing down the Hashtag Vegan cat.

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.990
Somebody wrote to mean shit to me and had this Hashtag Vegan cattle.
It's like,

10
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:32.010
what the fuck is that?

11
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.250
I went there and there's a whole community of people feeding their cats

12
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:37.680
vegetables and but,
but in,

13
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.590
in doing this and like tracking this down and Che and like it,

14
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.710
it makes you realize like,
okay,
I gotta write a bit about this.

15
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.380
Cause I could just get mad.
Easily writes,
it writes itself.

16
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.380
I could just get mad and be upset that someone's being mean to me or to turn

17
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.820
this shit into fuel.
Or You could just go,
fuck it.

18
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.320
Just destroy the whole Vegan community.
There's nothing,
it's not the feet.

19
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.550
It's nothing wrong with vegans.
Is his the same shit every other group.

20
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:02.820
I don't really know too many vegans that aren't assholes,
Bro.
I know some vegans.

21
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:06.390
It aren't assholes.
I don't know.
Rich Roll.
He's a great guy off John Joseph.

22
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:09.180
He's a great guy.
Neal Brennan.
He's a Vegan.
He's an asshole.

23
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.080
He's a little bit of an ass phone man.
Neil Brennan is a mother fucking prick.

24
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:17.150
What are you talking about man?
He's still telling people to turn into s when it,

25
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.570
the asshole is in him.
Especially people wear glasses because they were,

26
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.680
they have like million different frames.

27
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.190
That's when you had the next level of being an asshole when you switch your

28
00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:29.640
glasses up.
But Neil Brennan is a Vegan.
He's one of those.

29
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.590
I don't think vegans should be allowed to go to a barbecue and complain.

30
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.210
They complain.
They all come to a fucking barbecue.
They got the patties,

31
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.793
they upset.

32
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.160
If you've been cooking meat on a grill that was designed to cook dead animals,

33
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.630
they'll sort don't get up and they get upset.
So all vegans are assholes.

34
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:54.450
I'm sorry this is not all of them,
but I see what you're saying.

35
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.740
All the ones that I know it did it because it cause when I made them,

36
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.370
but they made the transition.
It can't just become vegans.
They got,

37
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.950
they just got to let you know I'm Vegan now.
They can't wait.
You say dinner?

38
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.000
Is it Vegan options?
It Vegan,
Vegan.
They just can't do it.

39
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.140
They got to make an announcement.

40
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.870
I think I let everybody know that I'm a Vegan and now and I'm an asshole.

41
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.210
They think they're saving the world and the worst is a Vegan that always gets

42
00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:25.620
cold.
Yo,
whenever I see Neil,

43
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:30.090
Brittney coffin,
whatever,
I see a car.
I say,

44
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:33.900
so how's that big a live call?
You fucking flew habitats by the fuck.

45
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.540
How he say that to Ian Edwards?
I'm like,
dude,
you look tired.
Exhausted.

46
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.530
I take pictures of each and every time we fly together and he falls asleep.

47
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.770
I take pictures of me and just sit there.
I'm like,
well the fucking protest.

48
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.160
I mean I'd have be 12,
and your diet get a stake in your motherfucking daddy.

49
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.240
He said he would eat meat,
but he would only eat elk that I killed.

50
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.510
He said he would eat some,
uh,
some elk meets.
I'm going to cook him some elk meat.

51
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.130
We're going to,
we should film it.

52
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.890
It probably like bounce around like super person.

53
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.140
Like he's been eating nothing but lentils for the last 20 years.
El Cutoff.

54
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.240
Where does one go to even shoot an elk?
Utah.

55
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.030
Colorado has a lot of them.
There's some of them.

56
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.470
How do you transport?
Is there loss?

57
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.390
Can you transport your killer?
You have to break it down wherever.

58
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.390
Where have you killed it?
You law,
you have to have,
uh,

59
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.050
first of all you have a tag and then when you,
when you have a tag,

60
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.100
you're allowed to get a certain kind of animal.
So say if it's like,
uh,
you have,

61
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:33.820
uh,
a buck deer tag,
that means you can kill a male deer.

62
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.110
And then once you kill it,

63
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.970
then you break it down and you either bring it to a butcher shop and they turn

64
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:43.480
it into cuts for you.
Or You could do it yourself and wrap it up,

65
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:47.500
but you have to have a tag and you have to register that you killed that animal

66
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.490
and you have to keep that,
that that with you,
that paperwork with you.

67
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.840
So if you transport the meat across state lines and some game warden pulled you

68
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:58.300
over and did you have a deer in your car and you were,
yes,
I do,
sir.

69
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.730
He's got to see that you have the paperwork for it.

70
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.180
I don't want to sell races and all,

71
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.580
but I don't know a black person that could tell that story that you just about

72
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.700
killing.
Butchering up to transport.

73
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.860
Yeah.
That's what you have to do.
That's how you do it.
You got to put them on ice.

74
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.810
I mean,
you have to,
you have an obligation to try to save the meat.
You know you,

75
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.900
when you have an animal and it's down,

76
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.030
you want to get it into like a packaged form as quick as possible.

77
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:28.960
You want to break it down.
