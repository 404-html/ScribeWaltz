1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.090
You gotta be on in those moments?
Yes.
That's all.
That's what I'm saying.

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.950
Help me too.
Do you,

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.410
do you miss being not sober that summertime sometimes.
Yeah.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.150
Yeah.
I um,

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.440
I miss well they pros and cons that,

6
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.180
that if I do,
I'll end up doing too much for sure.
For sure.
I can't control it.

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.130
It's just the way you are.
Just the way I am and I don't want to,

8
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.500
I don't want to push it again because when I get that way,

9
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.690
my kids don't talk to me.
I get a divorce,
I'm thrown out of my own band.

10
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.440
Uh,
what else?
I lose everything.
I mean,

11
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:42.120
it's happened enough times for me to finally realize,
you know what,

12
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:46.300
it's not worth it.
Right.
You know,
I get it.
You see what I'm saying?
Yeah.

13
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.190
And I got a lot of beautiful friends.
I've got a beautiful,
um,

14
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.510
bunch of friends to keep me in line.
You know,

15
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.630
I got two sponsors,
one on the west coast,
one on the east coast.

16
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.980
I had to call up all the time ago.
I want to get so fucked up.
Right.

17
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.510
How does that work?
When you call them out,
what do they do it Steven?
No,
no.

18
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.460
Fuck Dude,
I do too.
And I keep it together.
Exactly.
And I was,

19
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.600
they'll just say what else is new?
Did you guys ever talk about it that way?

20
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:16.710
Like fat people talk about food they used to eat.
No,
cause we don't do that.

21
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.250
What was it called?
Looking back and take it into the dinosaur shit.

22
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.520
No one would do that.
But you do.
If you go to like an AA meeting,

23
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.120
they do get up and tell awesome stories.
Oh fuck.
You're getting fucked up.
Right.

24
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.910
See when you get sober,
if you don't,

25
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.660
if you don't continue your aftercare by going to a couple of meetings every now

26
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:36.180
and then you're going to wind up using again.
Really?

27
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.100
Especially someone like me who watched Janis Joplin up there.
Okay,

28
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.480
1968 I'm in a high school.

29
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.600
She's got bangles and beads like this shit on and she's,

30
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.560
she's drinking southern comfort and she's spitting and using the f word,

31
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.650
smoking cigarettes.
Nobody did that back then.

32
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.520
She was a powerful watching her and she's fucking the power in song.

33
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.330
That's why I covered that.
How my country album.
Yeah.
Yeah.

34
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.240
To this day,
I listen to that song like at least once every couple of months.

35
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.390
Put that in the headphones.
You see how serious what songs can do for you.
Well,

36
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:23.070
when you,
when you grew up in the 60s and what we did was we experimented,

37
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.890
you know,
I mean,
if you think about what they tell us,

38
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:30.240
Christopher Columbus discovered America know the bow of his boat was full of

39
00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:34.530
booze and he fucked Queen Elizabeth or whoever.
She goes,
go,
good boy.
You know,

40
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.950
and she sent him on his way with some money.
He said,
bring them back.

41
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:42.780
Some countries you think,
and by the way,
he wasn't the first person here.

42
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.380
That's what America wants us to believe.
Anyway,
so,
so Christopher Columbus,

43
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.580
he's got that in his head to go to go check shit out.
Right?
He's drinking,

44
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:54.180
he's going by the stars at night.
It's kind of like that.

45
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:58.330
It's like he never took LSD.
It's,
I've taken acid.
Okay,
so then you,

46
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.170
you know what you look out.
We used to take acid in high school and we would,

47
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.730
we'd go to these,
um,
uh,
ski slopes in the summertime,
right?

48
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.890
Beautiful Green hills going up.
And we'd ride the chairlifts stoned as fuck.

49
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.790
And we got our stuff from San Francisco,
from Ozzie.

50
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.910
I would call him up and go,
dude,
more colors,

51
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.770
more colors,
rate to bounce,
going to kill me.
But that's what,

52
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.050
so you understand that that's just,
it's,
it's like,
you know,

53
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:32.470
is it fucked up in its drugs?
Yeah.
But you're also,
it's like,

54
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:33.580
I'd love to do Iowasca.

55
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.570
I'd love to hear maybe my bucket list,

56
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:41.800
and that's what I'll talk to my sponsor about.
Hey,
I got this,
uh,

57
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.720
I'm in Maui.
Maybe I've been here too long,
but I'm over.
And Hannah,

58
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.980
they're doing IOWASCA.
