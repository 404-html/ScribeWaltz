00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.780
The joe rogan experience that happens.
I mean,
I,
I,

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.370
I'm convinced of certain things and then I find out I'm completely wrong.

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.810
You know,
it does happen.
I told you that you better back off the ghost.

4
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.720
Um,
I used to believe a great deal.

5
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:18.720
I still pretty much believe pretty much,

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.870
I think basically this is my entire philosophy on all weirdnesses okay.

7
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.810
If you look back 500 years to what they knew scientifically,

8
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:32.580
then it's superstitious.
It's magic.
It's ridiculous,
it's ignorant,

9
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.453
et Cetera,
et cetera.

10
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.500
I believe that that's exactly what we are now to 500 years in the future.

11
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:39.960
So I don't consider it paranormal.

12
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:43.450
I consider it future science goes for future science,

13
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.850
go surf future science aliens or future science.
It's all future science.

14
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:49.170
And I'm down for that.

15
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.960
I'm ready to party with the future science and I'm ready for that.

16
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.080
Except that my problem is the people that tell ghost stories or those fucking go

17
00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:01.940
shows because they're so bad,
they're so faked.

18
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.490
There are so painfully faked.
I really believed it for a while.

19
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:08.490
Like I really absolutely bought into it.
Hook,
line and sinker.

20
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.220
It's like they're watching the little there,
the,

21
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.040
there's all different kinds of ghosts.
Like the ones that look like,
um,

22
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.370
he walks or not your walks,
which are the ones that are the jet,

23
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.170
the first movie star wars and they like were there little robes and they were

24
00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:26.390
busy.
They were like,
oh,
you know the first ones,
they're like,

25
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.760
we're selling robots.
I don't know.
They didn't really have faces.

26
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:32.790
They just had like cloaks the robot sellers.

27
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.820
Well apparently there are ghosts that are little cloak creatures and they scare

28
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:40.160
the crap out of me.
The cloak ones do,

29
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.740
they move fast and I don't understand what they're doing here like,

30
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.100
but I mean you can explain demons.
You can explain demons.

31
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:52.101
If you think about like dog ghosts or wolf ghosts or lion ghosts,

32
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.730
that's a demon.
Could be.
They growl.
They have like weird eyes.

33
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.610
They're hostile.
They scratch you animal.
So you,

34
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.540
you have a real belief in ghosts.
Yeah.

35
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.020
Not 100% but

36
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.720
I bump into them sometimes they think and I don't see them,

37
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:16.230
but I feel them and hear them and that like I know go ahead.

38
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.890
A little smile.
That little smile.

39
00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:23.540
That's why not we're talking about it cause we're on the weirdness podcasts but

40
00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:27.960
like I don't talk about it cause it just doesn't get a good response

41
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.720
when you bought,
I believe you,

42
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:33.090
you don't seem like a liar by any stretch of the imagination,

43
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.830
but I have a huge imagination.

44
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.120
I could very easily be tricking myself into something.
What do you feel?

45
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.130
What happens?
I just bump into that and be like,
they just,

46
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.930
if you walk into a room,

47
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.450
I mean it happens maybe once a year and you walk into a room,

48
00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:55.110
you walk somewhere or something's going on and you just feel it and it's a very,

49
00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:58.200
very strong and you,
I just,
I talked to them.

50
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.030
I just say like mostly hotel rooms.

51
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.960
Let's just say if I'm in a hotel room on tour and I led their move,

52
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:09.300
if I don't like it or I'll just say alone in that room,
I'll be like,
hi.
Okay,

53
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.460
I'm playing a show and so I'm only here for two days,

54
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.500
but I really need to get some sleep.
Um,
you can come to this.

55
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.350
I tell them they can come to the show if they want.
Oh,
that's hilarious.
I'm like,

56
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:22.030
this is what I do for a living,

57
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.820
and I try to like hear and think what they do for a living.

58
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.980
I would be psyched if I was a ghost and I fell on you.
I'm like,

59
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:31.780
this chick's cools
that.
Don't you want to scare?
Let her sleep,
man.

60
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:35.680
Let her sleep.
Fuck down.
I got the pots and pans ready to make a racket.

61
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.210
Let her sleep.
She's cool.
Let's go to the show.

62
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.500
I put them on my guest list was like,
you've got a plus one.
That was nice.

63
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.790
You don't have to reserve a seat.

64
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.190
<v 1>Obviously you have an active imagination and do you think that maybe your mind</v>

65
00:03:54.771 --> 00:03:56.840
fucking yourself at the time?
Like when you're saying,

66
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.731
well you're talking out loud,

67
00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:00.200
are you doing it because it's comforting because you enjoy it?

68
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.310
<v 0>Probably,
but,</v>

69
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.350
but if you asked me on a lie detector test whether I think I really encountered

70
00:04:06.351 --> 00:04:09.380
something,
I'd say yes for sure.

71
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.270
I mean there's been enough experiences in my life that it just seems like just

72
00:04:14.271 --> 00:04:15.470
part of future science.

73
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.300
<v 1>There's a guy named Rupert Sheldrick,</v>

74
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.790
he's a scientist and he believes that things have memory.

75
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.980
He thinks that everything has memory things.

76
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:27.020
That's why people don't want to live in haunted houses.
You know?

77
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.690
Don't want to live in a house where someone died.

78
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.400
He thinks that objects have memory.
They can't express it,
but that they have it.

79
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.480
<v 0>I agree with that.
It might be,
we're like,
we haven't,</v>

80
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.040
I think it's less the object retaining it.
I mean it must be retaining something.

81
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.190
I think it's more our psychic ability to perceive the past.

82
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.090
Yeah,
that's what I think.

83
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.120
I think it's more like you see the chair and then you can psychically feel what

84
00:04:56.461 --> 00:04:58.620
happened in that chair.
I'm not really sure how to like,

85
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.040
you're not seeing the chair imbued with some aura.

86
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.950
You're actually looking into the past.
Yeah,

87
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.640
that's what I think cause I've had dreams that were like prefiguring figuring,

88
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.900
I think you can dream if something's impactful enough.
I think you can dream.

89
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.890
Okay.
Let's say something really bad happens to you.
Imagine something horrible.

90
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.620
Okay,
I dunno,
this studio explodes.
Okay.

91
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.760
A couple months maybe before then you might have a dream.

92
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.020
Well,
let's just say something goes really,
really wrong or bad.
Nothing traumatic.

93
00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:37.410
You might be able to have a dream ahead of time.

94
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.540
That would be how you would synthesize that traumatic experience.

95
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.970
Just as if it had happened before and you were dreaming after the fact before

96
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.460
you've had that happen.
I have,
would you,
how it happened with,
um,

97
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.280
I'm saving that for my book.
Is that okay?
Yeah.
That's okay.

98
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.740
But it was a very powerful,
very absolutely fuck off.

99
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.390
Absolutely.
Absolutely good.

100
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:12.230
But it was very convincing to me and hard to explain any other way.

101
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.870
Have you ever had any other sort of psychic premonition?
Yes.
Really?

102
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.900
Yes.
Do you remember the last big fire we had in la when it was like encroaching

103
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.360
recently?
Yeah,
that one.
Um,

104
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.580
the night before that fire I was out walking with my son again.
My son,

105
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:30.890
he's like all over this podcast.
I don't know why,

106
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.100
because he barely speaks to me at the moment.
And he's like,
yeah,
yeah,
fine,

107
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:36.140
good talk to you later.
Um,

108
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.500
and I just felt incredibly uneasy and he suffered from asthma when he was young

109
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:43.790
and really badly.

110
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:47.640
So when it would be when there was a lot of particulate matter in the air,

111
00:06:47.641 --> 00:06:49.910
or if it was just bad air conditions,

112
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.510
I would tend to be very worried about him and keep him home or informed the

113
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:59.120
teachers or whatever it was.
It just,
he get really bad asthma attacks.

114
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.990
And so I have a predisposition to be on the alert,

115
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.290
but this is the night before no fire had started yet and I just was very

116
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:10.190
anxious,
very anxious,

117
00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:13.700
and I couldn't settle down and I couldn't think for months.

118
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.970
I hadn't been like that.
I mean,
and I said to him,
I'm like,

119
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:18.500
I don't know what it is,

120
00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:23.420
but I feel kind of unsafe if something happens tomorrow you have to like,

121
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.500
you have to be my witness that I've sensed something was coming.

122
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.330
Now you probably think I'm this horrible mother,
I never do this.
It happens.

123
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.340
Like I think I've said that to him twice in our entire life and

124
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.310
I forgot about it the next day.
I forgot about,

125
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.730
I didn't think about it at all until,
you know,

126
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.710
we were socked in and this sort of Brown muck as we are.

127
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:52.310
And like the sun became the eye of Sauron and ever,
you know,

128
00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:55.370
everyone's like freaking out and we're looking at all these images and I was so

129
00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:59.000
distracted by all these images that I completely forgot my sense the night

130
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:02.960
before and what I think that was until I remembered it.

131
00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:04.460
Then I called up and I'm like,
ah.

132
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.950
And I think it's more like,
I don't know something's coming,

133
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.280
but I have maybe time,

134
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:16.970
maybe the envelope with time is a little bit more mushy than we think.

135
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.710
Maybe we perceive time is very orderly and very linear,

136
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:23.450
but maybe it's really not.

137
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.810
And it could be pushing back like the experience.

138
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:29.990
And maybe I had the experience before I perceive the experience or I don't know

139
00:08:29.991 --> 00:08:32.360
what that is,
but that happens to me a lot.

140
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.590
I've heard people describe,
nobody likes hearing about it.
By the way,

141
00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:39.830
I never talk about this stuff in my real life because nobody likes.

142
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:44.180
What do you mean it makes people uncomfortable and they look at you funny.

143
00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:47.240
So I just never talk about it except for on the podcast.

144
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.500
Why would it make them uncomfortable?
It just does.

145
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.490
I'm fascinated by that because I don't experience it and I've never,

146
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.040
I've never had a premonition

147
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.850
<v 1>that came true,</v>

148
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:01.680
but I do have a really good ability to know if someone's crazy.

149
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.610
I'm really good at that.
Apparently.
I'm not.
No,
you're not crazy.
No,
I mean,

150
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:10.540
I don't know if someone's don't even on a lot of crazy people blind spot.

151
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.620
That's where you can pick out fires in the dos days,
but you can't pick out nuts.

152
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.910
Yeah.
I don't have any psychic ability though.
I've just,

153
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:23.790
I think I just know though.
Mm.
Uh,
don't,

154
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.480
if you can tell if someone's crazy or not,
you might have some,
I mean,

155
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:30.080
you might have some perception.

156
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:34.830
I think it's pattern recognition and data chunking.
Oh,

157
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:36.360
see I've met so many people.

158
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.650
Then when I see things that are off little things that are off and you probe,

159
00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:43.080
like you're talking a little,
things are off more and you're like,

160
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.890
you see the looking into the eyes,
you see calculations,
you're like,
okay,

161
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:49.830
something's going on here.
This is not a,
it's not a normal person.

162
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:53.640
There's a person putting on a normal mask.
Like there's something off here.

163
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.360
It just smells,
smells fishy,
you know?
I just think it's that.

164
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.860
I just think if we have them as guests,

165
00:09:58.861 --> 00:10:02.190
I mean are they are sitting across from me?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Bat Shit crazy.

166
00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:06.120
What do you do?
I've had people on what I was sure they were pilled up for sure.

167
00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.270
I'm like talking to him like this motherfucker's Adderall to the gills.

168
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.730
Like when their Adderall,
there's talking,

169
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.230
there's just something about the way the talk to not really cut least fair.

170
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.070
It's not,
that's not what it's about.
It's not about me.
It's about the future.

171
00:10:17.071 --> 00:10:19.530
It's about children.
It's about that society.
What I'm trying to do is be,

172
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:22.110
I'm an entrepreneur.
I'm going to build businesses.
They just start,

173
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.810
they just info wars.
Alex Jones,

174
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.840
we got him high and drunk and he was talking about on the show.

175
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:32.460
Is that what goes down here?
And I like,
oh,
look at this.

176
00:10:32.461 --> 00:10:36.900
I am in a den of inequity Ellis.
Yes.
We've got some,
like that's some Sutton.

177
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:37.973
That's what is that?

178
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:47.590
Yeah.
