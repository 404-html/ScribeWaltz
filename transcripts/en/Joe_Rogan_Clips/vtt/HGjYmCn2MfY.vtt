1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.940
Speaking of debris.
Speaking of debris,
uh,

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.440
there was this asteroid that collided with Earth,
uh,

3
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:12.410
over,
uh,
[inaudible] in the Soviet Union in Russia,
sorry,
uh,

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.180
just near the Siberia in the euro mountains just on the coast of Siberia than

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.190
the border of Siberia that was visible to everybody in broad daylight and he had

6
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:26.760
to like avert your eyes when it happened and they felt a shock wave and the

7
00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:30.690
shockwave broke windows and sent 600 people,

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.890
nearly a thousand people to the hospital.
What happened?
Well,

9
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.520
because they saw the light and they can't,

10
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.650
they got up from their table and went to the window to see what had happened.

11
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.530
There's a time delay between the shockwave and the light because light travels

12
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.630
fast and s sound travel slow.

13
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.320
So we'll go to the windows in the shockwave hits and it blasts broken glass into

14
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:53.154
their face.

15
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.310
So there's a big bandaid collision that we had people all needed basically

16
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:03.270
bandaids.
Okay.
No one died,
but nearly a thousand people were injured.

17
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.430
So at an auction,

18
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.340
but that actually exploded and pieces of it were recovered at an auction.

19
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.060
I purchased a piece of that media.
Right.
But you can also purchase

20
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.370
some of the shards of glass that the shockwave had broken.

21
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.410
What do you do with this shit?
I've got it.
It's just a habit.
I'm a part of.

22
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.450
It is a shot across our bow.
That's what that dough and died.

23
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.650
But it's a warning.

24
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.650
There's no better way to a warrant then to have a bandaid cover your injuries

25
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:41.070
that could of vaporized you or rendered your species extinct.

26
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.370
What's crazy is the ones that don't even make impact,

27
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.860
it's still do devastating damage.
Yes.
Yes.
Now it didn't,

28
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:48.510
that one didn't even touch earth.
Right.

29
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.760
It incinerate a 10,000 square kilometers of forest.
Holy Shit.

30
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.750
Yeah.
So February 15th,
2013 and uh,

31
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.670
there is a half a ton that people rock was a thousand pounds.
Oh yeah.

32
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.770
Oh yeah.
That's just a piece that made it through.

33
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.850
Is it iron or the actual piece would have been a about the size of this room.

34
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:14.400
So a small home.
Wow.
So,
but yeah,
that's amazing that,

35
00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:17.820
that small rock go back up to that again.
Please look at the size of that.

36
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:20.670
That's not that.
No,
no.
That's what's left over most of it.

37
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:25.190
It's a vaporized on that,
on the explosion as it came through the atmos.
Right,

38
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:29.140
but they're saying that that piece of it weighs a thousand pounds a,

39
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.900
do they give it the weight of it over a half ton?
Yeah.
Oh,
we have to,
yeah,

40
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.550
a thousand pounds.
That's crazy.
That rock.
Is that fucking heavy?
Yes.
So,

41
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.990
so the solid,
yes.
Well,
I,
I have to read that to know for sure,

42
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.490
but I think it was an iron meteorite.

43
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.150
I have a knife that was made out of a piece of media or as do I though the

44
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.970
beautiful,
oh yeah.
It's a kitchen knife that I use.
Oh,
see I,
mine is like a,

45
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.290
it's like a crocodile Dundee knife.
Ooh.
Yeah.
That's not a knife.

46
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.060
That's the knife.
But it's waiting.

47
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:04.510
I want to make a or get someone to make a handle for it.
It's just the,

48
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.540
it's just a metal that would be a four.

49
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.720
It's a forged metal with the glade,

50
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.670
but then you get a pearl handle attached to the base of,
yeah,
so it's a handle.

51
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:17.380
This UN un,

52
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.690
it's an unadorned piece of metal that would become a,

53
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.370
you know,
a knife.
Oh yes.
Completely sharpened.
Oh yeah.

54
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:30.400
Where's the fucking handle?
There is the metal hand.

55
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.740
Have you ever seen knight a kitchen?
Knives?

56
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.680
The metal goes all the way down down the center of the handle and you'd see

57
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.550
you'd screw wooden handles on the side.
So you just need the wooden,

58
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.930
I just need the wood or the or the,
if I'm patent they would be Pearl,
you know?

59
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.560
Yeah.
We're all handed revolver.
Pearl pistol.
Yeah.

60
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.840
So yeah,

61
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:57.040
it's a part of history and it's a reminder that if you want to think about the

62
00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:59.410
future of civilization,

63
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.970
you have to include a defense plan against asteroids,
the dinosaurs,

64
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.330
dinosaurs.
I bet if they could,

65
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:11.140
they would have had a space program to not go extinct.
No Shit.

66
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.080
I'm thinking now,

67
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.400
is there anything that we're doing now other than occasionally looking up?

68
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.030
Yeah,
we're looking at with monitoring and cataloging them.
Yeah.

69
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.520
But we don't really know what to do.
The day would come,
well we know what to do.

70
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:29.590
There's nothing funded.
Their engineering conferences,

71
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:32.710
how would you deflect an asteroid?
Okay,
how would you destroy one?

72
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.880
And if we see one way and it's calming 100%,

73
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.430
just kiss your ass goodbye.
That's right.
We would,

74
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.360
we would have the power to tell you when you would die and what part of earthy

75
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.010
would hit.

76
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.540
So there's people that have very delusional ideas about what we can and can't do

77
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:50.830
with asteroids.
And that drives me crazy.
No,
it's not that we know how to do the,

78
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.990
I've seen the engineering plans,
they look very good,

79
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:56.470
but there's nothing in place,
right?
There's project sentinel,
you can look it up.

80
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.370
That is,

81
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.900
has tasked themselves with organizing world governments to protect earth from

82
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:03.160
species killing asteroids.

83
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.290
And you need the world because you don't know in advance until it's discovered

84
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:09.520
what part of earth it's going to hit.

85
00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:14.460
And if it's going to hit in the Indian Ocean and Indian,
if,

86
00:05:14.461 --> 00:05:15.460
if,
um,

87
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.200
the surrounding regions don't have a space program or are there countries that

88
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:23.080
do have a space program going to sit idle?
No.

89
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:27.640
What you want to do is you want to have a fund and every country pipes in a

90
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:32.170
little bit of their GDP and then or,
or whatever,
uh,
uh,
uh,

91
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.890
um,
you know,
do you measure it however you want it?
Whatever you think is fair,

92
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.960
do it the way,
uh,
the way the UN does it.
Okay.

93
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.730
So there's attacks of the world relative to your wealth and then that money pays

94
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:46.541
to save the world.

95
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:50.800
When we find such an asteroid that that's how you get the Sentinel Project

96
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.800
Sentinel is,
is uh,
has thought this through.

97
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.760
So if there were engineers and scientists ample time,
there's possibility,

98
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.490
there's a possibility that they could actually implement some of these plants.

99
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.810
It's all about how much time you have.

100
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.830
Because what you want to do is go out and nudge it a little bit,
a little bit.

101
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.890
You just have to give it a sideways velocity relative to its path towards earth.

102
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.090
If you do that early enough,

103
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.040
the s the sideways velocity sort of accumulate like a ship turning slightly over

104
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:24.380
the ocean of the course of time,
it'll deviate quite a bit.
Correct.

105
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.550
So that angle grows.
I mean it's the same angle,
but the,

106
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.920
it spreads out and it's the,
the ocean example is perfect.

107
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:33.320
There's a perfect analogy.
So if you do that early enough,

108
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.980
you do it enough so that it misses earth and it's still out there to harm you in

109
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:39.680
another day,
but it won't render you extinct on that passage.

110
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.640
How much time do we need today?
Uh,

111
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.020
if I would say we could probably get something built in 10 years.

112
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.530
Oh Jeez.
What?
Neil degrasse Tyson.

113
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.270
Why don't you just do 10 years?
I'm looking for him and that's,
oh no.

114
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:58.820
Oh my gosh.
So it's a year.
If we have a year.

115
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.530
The good thing about species killing asteroids is that they're large and

116
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:07.280
visible.
What about city Killen ones?
Them talkers slip through.
Yeah,

117
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:12.230
they'll slip through.
Yeah.
But most of earth's surface is not city,

118
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:16.160
so it'll probably hit the ocean or,
or land.
But yeah,
if it does,

119
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:20.570
it would take out a city.
The whole city gone.
Yeah.
Yeah.

120
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.360
Oof.
This is a branch of government part of,

121
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.140
I don't know if it survived the Trump changeover,
but it's uh,

122
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:32.170
it's part of a homeland security where worries about devastation to a region

123
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.550
where the grid is taken out as well.

124
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.680
So you can't bring emergency services that bring are the food,
water,

125
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.210
medicines,
uh,
any other form of transportation or communication.

126
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.240
How much thought is there to putting in a more robust grid?

127
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:56.360
Uh,
yeah,
what you would need is,
that's,
that's a good point.

128
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.150
So you need a grid that can sort of,
uh,

129
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:04.250
rewire itself rapidly to then bring power to a region,

130
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.560
uh,
that that's what you would need.

131
00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:09.680
And it would ditch sort of doing that now making a grid,

132
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.100
sort of a lightening proof,
you know,

133
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.870
a power surge proof.

134
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.740
I grew up in New York City where there were a couple of very famous blackouts

135
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:22.730
when in 1966 and other,
and when was it?
1978,
I think.

136
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.830
And it was like,
Whoa,
how should this,

137
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.900
how is this even allowed?
You don't have a backup plan.
Yeah.

138
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.760
You don't have a way to rewire this to redirect the electricity.

139
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.170
So yeah,
you'd need that and you'd want that.

140
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.980
And I thought the new grid is supposed to have those kinds of protections built

141
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.080
into it,
but I don't know enough about it to comment

142
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.560
it all it take is one one impact.
Oh yeah,
one big one.
Yeah.

143
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.020
It takes out the grid.
It takes out the grid.

144
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.980
And what do you have solar power you place?
Uh,

145
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.050
we just put in Pat Pat solar panels.
Yeah.

146
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.150
You live in a place that's ever seen and we have a place in the country escape

147
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.180
to,
yeah.
It's a good move to have the escape spot.
Yeah.

148
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.370
You have a place in upstate New York?
No,
no,
it's on long island.
Yeah.

149
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:15.540
I used to think of it as an escape because we thought of getting it after

150
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:20.400
September 11th.
Yeah.
Got It.
And Oh,
three Oh two,
something like that.
But,

151
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.810
um,
now it's just a good place for me to refuel and through a lot of good writing

152
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:28.020
there and this sort of thing.
Look out for ticks and know,
oh my God.

153
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.940
Long islands overwhelmed with Lyme disease.

154
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:34.650
They got a new tick apparently that prevents you from eating meat,
Vegetarians,

155
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.513
bread that

156
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:42.450
it's called the lone star tick and it prevents you from eating the meat of

157
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:47.310
mammals.
Yes.
Makes you allergic to Alpha galactose.

158
00:09:47.311 --> 00:09:51.090
Is that what it is?
It's Alpha Gow than another great radio lab podcast.

159
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:55.980
I detailed I think the vegans and the Vegetarians,
I think that,
yeah,

160
00:09:55.981 --> 00:10:00.200
I think that he's still your fish.
Yeah.
Chicken not eat a mammal.
Yeah.

161
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.650
Just can't eat red meat.
It's something in red meat.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
uh,

162
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.570
that's one of the challenges,
right?
But goddamn ticks.
Yeah.
They are everywhere.

163
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.120
And we looked at it the other day.
There's a,

164
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.060
cause I have quite a few friends that have Lyme disease and it's something you

165
00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:18.570
do keep for life.
And,
uh,
uh,
quite a few friends,

166
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.920
like seven or eight I think at this point that have devastating Lyme disease.

167
00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:25.890
And it's all east coast people.
They're making love in the brush.

168
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.150
Like what are they doing walking around going for a hike,
you know?
I see it.
Yeah.

169
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.200
I'm a city person.
So even though I moved to the country,

170
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.650
I go for a hike on my deck.
You don't go anywhere?
No,
no.
Sit back.

171
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.250
Just look out pool on the deck.

172
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.390
But you're out there and the gorgeous country,

173
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:45.380
don't you want to go wander around a little bit?
No,
no.

174
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.180
It's honestly not a thought.

175
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.460
My wife was from Alaska has those thoughts all the time,

176
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.000
but the power of ticks overwhelms her power of curiosity.

177
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.940
Those are powerful people in Alaska.
That's a different type of,
you know,
their,

178
00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:00.390
their,
their,
their,
their bread differently about their strong,

179
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.010
those people can survive and they have a sentence to unity up there.

180
00:11:05.011 --> 00:11:09.360
It's really interesting that unity I think comes from the fact that they're all

181
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.510
in the same risk factors together.
Yup.
And if the,

182
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.830
if you and I have the same things that can kill us,
that makes us friends.
