1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.440
The joe rogan experience.
Wow.
This,

2
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:08.730
what year was this dear God,
I don't remember.
I've been having so much on it.

3
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.420
Yeah,
no,
you're great.
For a WHO's been hit in the head,
as many as you,

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.260
I never had a concussion.
I will say that we must have never had a concussion.

5
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:19.470
Wheeling.
Nope.
Well,
what does it concussion?
Concussion is like,
well,

6
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:23.640
they check your pupils.
They're not dialing correctly.
None of it.
None of them.

7
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:26.940
No concussions at all.
All that hard sparring.
Nope.
Never.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.120
I find that hard to believe this.

9
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.090
He never got hit with a shot that they didn't see coming.

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.020
And I think that's never,
nope.
Nope.
Wow.

11
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.090
Besides one time in a huge fight where a dude hit me in the side of the head

12
00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:38.610
with a brick and I saw it last second,
I at least rolled with it.

13
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.340
And that didn't give you a concussion?
He,
I,
he,
uh,
it was a huge bro.

14
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.470
It was hip hop night at the nightclub I was bouncing at.
Oh,
sounds like fun.

15
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.180
And the head and the Illinois Gang bangers and the Iowa gangbangers started

16
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:54.930
going at it.
And I tried breaking it up and they all attacked me,
right?
Jesus.

17
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.510
So that's when I,
everybody was wearing,
it was winter time.

18
00:00:57.511 --> 00:00:58.620
So I was choking people.

19
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:02.130
A guy got me in a headlock and I was grabbing people by their coat lapels and I

20
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:05.010
hit my head in between his head and his head and I'd choke him unconscious.

21
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:08.850
I'd find a new coat and I was working my way backwards out the front door and

22
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:11.130
finally snuck out of the headlock,
put him in a rear choke,

23
00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:14.190
went backwards off the door.
He went limp.
I dropped him.

24
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.950
And then as I turned to get out into the street,

25
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:20.400
cause there was cops everywhere at that point.
There's dogs,
it's a snow storm.

26
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.451
Last second.

27
00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:24.780
I see this coming at the side of my head than I duck and it bounces off of my

28
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:27.390
head and this dude goes,
yeah,

29
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:30.320
like I was going to go down and I turned and I looked at him and rifle then with

30
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:31.590
a right hand and knocked him out.

31
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.560
And then the next thing you know there's just dogs diving into the crowd.

32
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.100
It was a good one.
And it was a fun one.
Dogs.
That's not good.
No.
Yeah.

33
00:01:39.101 --> 00:01:42.450
The dogs work.
They work.
They work real well.

34
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.150
That's not good because they don't know who the fuck they're biting.

35
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.090
They might bite you.
They might bite the bad guys.
I mean,

36
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:51.900
who the fuck dogs don't know who the bouncer is?
Clear crowd out real quick.

37
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.180
Fuck yeah,
they do.
Now Moz,

38
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.810
is that all you're using a back then it was shepherds real.
It was all German.

39
00:01:57.811 --> 00:02:00.240
Shepard j a melon was hadn't even entered the scene at that time.

40
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.330
I have a buddy who trains dogs who doesn't like Mel.

41
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.550
It says there are two blood thirsty.
He said they were aggressive.
Yeah.
He goes,

42
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:08.370
they don't listen as well.
Interesting.
He goes,
he goes,
I can trust the shepherd.

43
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.070
He goes,
bite,
hold and release.
Yeah.
He's like,

44
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:13.920
if I stick a Malmo on and it goes through the fuck knows.
He goes also,

45
00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:17.280
I don't trust him like as a pet.
Right.
You know he wants a dog.

46
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:22.110
That is is a real train bite dog,
but also good with the family.

47
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.180
Yeah.
I can hang out with your kid.
Right.
Well,

48
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:27.960
that's like I iPhone mastiffs before,
right?
And massive mass stuff there.

49
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.381
You know,

50
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:32.670
I had brindle mastiff and I always love to have males and I had a stalker for

51
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:34.680
three years who was a psychopath,
right?

52
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.630
So that was when I got my first mass duff king.
He was 210 pounds,

53
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.090
but he was a brindle.
Scary look like a Bengal tiger.
Right?

54
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.730
And he that those dogs are so powerful,
you know,

55
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.400
at that size when they're truly in shape where you can't stop them.

56
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:54.240
And there were people that were using mastiffs for police work and they stopped

57
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:57.330
using them because a 210 pound mass mastiff on a human being,

58
00:02:57.331 --> 00:03:00.910
they can kill them really fast.
This is not a,
this is not a bite dog.

59
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:05.200
This is a dog that can just have a screw,
go loose and rip somebody,

60
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.090
throw it out in a heartbeat.
It's just too big and tall.

61
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.920
AFFEC hurts him if something hurts him and they think,
oh,
this is a fight,
right?

62
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.100
I'm just going to rip your fucking head clean off your body.
Right.

63
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.070
And that massive tested me a couple of times.
Ooh,

64
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.470
for Alpha position in the house.
Oh No.
It was one time up,

65
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.720
a plastic bag in the wind was rolling through the woods and on my property.

66
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.800
And he ran and he grabbed it and I told him,
you know,
King come here front.

67
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.770
And it came up to me and I put my hand on the plastic bag and he goes,
hey,
sorry.

68
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.450
Alright,
here it is.
This is,
this is test time.

69
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.540
So I ripped the bag and it came out of his mouth right.

70
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.370
And he really got pissed off at me.
I was testing them.
So at that point I'm like,

71
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:48.100
well I can't back down to it now.
This is it.

72
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.200
So I put my fist against his teeth that he was showing and I was going do it
Joe.

73
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:56.590
It sees this Christ do it.
And he's like this with his teeth going,

74
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.230
I'm going to Joe it,
Joe it.

75
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.350
And finally he turned and backed off and then I pet him and he was wagging his

76
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:05.740
tail and I was like,
all right.
Ooh,
that was,
that was kind of scary.

77
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.970
Ryan Parsons got in a fist fight with his massive.
Really?
Yeah.

78
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:14.350
He had a Neapolitan mastiff in college.
They got in a fistfight.
He goes,

79
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:18.490
it was a real fight.
And he goes,
I had a fight with my mom.
I'm like,
maybe.

80
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.230
Maybe he did.
More likely you punched your mastiff cause it was a real fight.

81
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:25.200
I wouldn't be talking to you may be chunks missing out.
Yeah,

82
00:04:25.201 --> 00:04:28.690
you'd be fucking dead.
I'm Neapolitan.
That's a giant fucking dog.

83
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.140
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
