Where do you think MMA is headed?
When you,
when you,

2
00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:06.320
you look at the sport and you,
do you have a sense,
I mean you,

3
00:00:06.321 --> 00:00:07.740
you've obviously been there from the beginning.

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.710
Do you have a sense of the direction?
I have an idea.

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.930
You know what I think is going to happen.

6
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.090
It's everything has got to evolve or a dies.
Right?

7
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.210
All right.
And when you talk about the evolution,
there's evolution for fighters,

8
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.730
there's evolution for promoters,

9
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:27.540
there's evolution for fans as far as what they get to watch and how they get to

10
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:28.350
watch it.

11
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.270
And all of that has to evolve for the sport to continue to rise and build.

12
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.490
When the UFC sold,
you know,
and this is no disrespect to anyone.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.390
Look at the greatest thing that the UFC had was Lorenzo Fertitta.

14
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.980
I'm just being honest.

15
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.040
Dana was fantastic for the UFC as far as his work effort and the amount of work

16
00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:55.920
he put into it.
And you know,
nonstop just going after deals,

17
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:59.310
trying to make things happen.
You know,
he was the work horse for it,

18
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:02.850
but the rental is the brains behind it.
You know there's a wizard,
oh my God.

19
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.040
And the loss of him is great.
Yeah,
I agree.
It's already,

20
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.610
you've already seen things.
Well it's also the,
the issue is the price.

21
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.030
They had to pay $4 billion for something that's probably worth two.

22
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.620
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I mean,
I don't know.
I'm not a business person but,
but again,

23
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.620
seems like a lot of it.
How did it get,
you know,

24
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.260
how did it get to that point where they,
exactly.
Yeah,
he's a wizard.
He is,
he,

25
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.520
you know,
and that's,
but it is one of those things that you look and you go,

26
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.130
all right,
things have,
they've changed and the,

27
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:39.690
and the way he went about doing things,

28
00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:42.960
cause look at the one thing that Lorenzo was not afraid of with spending money

29
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.330
right now.
That's how the UFC survived.

30
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.720
You know that here's a guy that gambled and he was 54 million because he has $44

31
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.450
million in the hole.

32
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.870
And when he then put 10 million more into the ultimate fighter.
Exactly.
Yeah.
No,

33
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:56.341
that was a,

34
00:01:56.341 --> 00:02:00.660
that was a time buy and he paid for all the production and it launched the
sport.

35
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:01.494
Absolutely.

36
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.250
Because you know he deserves everything that he got from that and he deserves

37
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:06.930
that giant pay out.
No doubt about it.

38
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.140
My concern is that the monthly nut is so gigantic that I just wonder if like

39
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:18.750
some people say there's too many fights,
they said it's too many fights,

40
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:23.070
too many televised fights and that this is,
you know,
this is a part of the,

41
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.740
that saturated traded,

42
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.420
so it's very difficult to sell the paper views because people are like,
no,

43
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:30.990
I'm not going to buy this when I get to watch next week on fs one,

44
00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:33.690
there's a big card.
I'm just gonna wait for that.
And that's true.

45
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.290
You look at it for a while there,

46
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:40.890
they were almost competing against themselves with paper views and it was you

47
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:45.360
had to pay per views in a month and you went and said,
I'll buy that one.

48
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:47.850
I'm not going to buy that one.
Yeah,
you can't be in business against yourself.

49
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.840
They got rid of that.
There's also mistaken,

50
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.050
they kind of especially initially did a lot of sort of Hollywood style

51
00:02:56.491 --> 00:02:57.151
promotion.

52
00:02:57.151 --> 00:03:00.880
Like when I thought there was a real problem was when Ronda Rousey was making

53
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:03.850
her come back against Amanda Nunez and they weren't even mentioning Amanda
Nunez.

54
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:07.660
Mike,
you guys are out of your fucking mind.
Okay.
This is the,

55
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.340
this is the woman that I was saying before.

56
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:12.340
Rhonda got one that's down by Holly Holm.
I was saying,

57
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.210
Amanda Nunez is more dangerous.
She's fucking dangerous,
man.

58
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:19.150
Especially see her in this last weekend against Raquel Pennington and like,

59
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:20.600
Holy Shit just got good.
