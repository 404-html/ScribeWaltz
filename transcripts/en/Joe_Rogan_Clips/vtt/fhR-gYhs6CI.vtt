Hello Freak bitches.
They cringe.
And,
and,

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.523
but,

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.750
but it became like this game of trying to like show that we were going to get

4
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:16.530
our message across no matter what any human being wanted because we knew we were

5
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:19.650
so sure that this was what God wanted.
Wow.

6
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.080
What made you leave
a lot of things?

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.310
It started my very first sort of conscious doubts came from conversations on

8
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:32.430
Twitter.
So wow.
Yeah.

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.180
Something good God done through Twitter.
Yeah.
Lots of good things.

10
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:39.890
I also met my husband there.
Oh,
there you go.
While I was still at the church.
Oh,

11
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.710
it's Kinda,
uh,

12
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.950
I don't know that he would use that word to describe himself.
I would actually,

13
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:49.080
I was just talking to Sam about this and I was like,
when people,

14
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.560
the problem with the word,
when people,
when you say atheist,

15
00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:55.500
people think jerk and like selling all.
So many people do.

16
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:56.880
So many people think that it's like,
oh,

17
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.500
you're absolutely certain that there is no god.
And so it's,

18
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:04.230
it's a word that I hesitate to use to describe myself too,
but,
but I'm not,

19
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.470
I'm not a believer.
I don't even like to say I'm not a believer because I,

20
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.761
I love people,

21
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:13.761
I believe in people and that there is so much hope and for people and that we

22
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:18.450
can,
I don't know.
Anyway,
so conversations that you have on Twitter did,

23
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:21.780
what do you like?
What,
what doors open your mind?
Right.

24
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:26.220
So I got on Twitter and it was like an extension of the picket line,
right?

25
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:29.190
So when you go out there with picket signs and you know,

26
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:31.710
people would come up to us and ask us questions.
And so it was this,

27
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:34.830
it was a constant,
a constant conversation.

28
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.400
And so I got on Twitter to take that,
you know,
to,

29
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.740
to the Internet to reach more people.

30
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.150
And so one of the first things I did when I got on Twitter was to attack this

31
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.630
Jewish man named David Abbott Ball,
who ran a blog called judicious.

32
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.890
He was listed as the second most influential Jew on Twitter,
uh,

33
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.970
on this number one.
Um,
I actually can't remember,

34
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.770
not memorable and I'm part of my story,
I guess you can check it.

35
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:04.950
It's the JTA is list.
If you want to change.
But anyway,

36
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:07.920
so he was listed as number two,
and uh,

37
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.030
so he responded initially with,
uh,
you know,

38
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:15.480
sarcasm and,
and,
and hostility.
Um,

39
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.290
but pretty quickly he sort of changed tactics and started instead of like

40
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.420
mocking me,
although he still did do that some too.
Um,

41
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.770
he was asking questions about our picket signs and I started asking him

42
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:27.950
questions about Jewish theology because I,

43
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.960
I wanted to better know how to counter it,
you know,

44
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:33.390
to from the scriptures because I was sure that they were wrong.

45
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.170
Jews killed Jesus and,
and they reject him as the Messiah.

46
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:40.740
And so all of these things,
um,
so,

47
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.690
um,
right,
so we're having this back and forth and this goes on for about a year.

48
00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:48.030
And during that year,
I actually met him twice.

49
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.040
I protested him twice once to his functions or was he giving speeches?

50
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.030
So in Long Beach,
actually at the judicious festival,

51
00:02:57.031 --> 00:03:01.480
they had this Jewish cultural festival.
Great Name.
Yeah,
that's great.
He's great.

52
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.170
Um,
so he,
he was going to be there.
Uh,

53
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.050
and you know,
I went and I was protesting him,
uh,

54
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:12.460
and he came out to the picket line and it was,

55
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.350
it was one of those like very rowdy pickets.

56
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:17.260
There was a bunch of a counter protestors and they were,
it was,

57
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.950
I dunno guys dresses like the Easter Bunny and Jesus and you know,

58
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.750
it was actually got pretty violent.
So I was actually super violent.
Well yeah,

59
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.150
and the cops,
this my,
I told you,
we called the cops.

60
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:31.840
Like the cops were just standing there watching people like actively assaulting

61
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:36.280
us,
like hitting us.
And so we're like walking around trying to,
you know,

62
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:39.220
to not be head cause we're,
we're not going to hit back.
We weren't there.

63
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.350
Like I said,
the church is very against violence.

64
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:44.840
Like they're not going to be violent to people or defend themselves just,

65
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.753
just to,

66
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.630
so I was actually really glad when David came out because he became like a

67
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:53.410
buffer between me and the rest of the counter protestors because everybody could

68
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:56.680
tell that he was,
you know,
he's wearing his delicious shirt and whatever.
Anyway,

69
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.120
so,
so the conversation continued there.
And then also at another protest,
uh,

70
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.960
six or seven months later,
um,
and then,
uh,

71
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.320
it was not long after that second protest,

72
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.680
we're talking again and he was asking about one of our signs that said,

73
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.820
death penalty for facts.
And you know,

74
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.330
of course I'm reiterating why the church believes that.

75
00:04:17.331 --> 00:04:18.940
And he has in the book of Leviticus,

76
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.110
God calls for the death penalty for gay gays.
And,
and then enrollments will,

77
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:24.920
and then the New Testament,
uh,

78
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.050
it's reiterated to commit such things are worthy of death.
So,

79
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.180
um,
and so I'm telling David these things and he says,

80
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.820
um,
it's like,
yeah,
but didn't Jesus say,

81
00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:40.570
let he who is without sin cast the first stone?
And I said,

82
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:42.910
what we always said to that,
which was,
uh,

83
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.410
we're not casting stones were preaching words.
And he said,

84
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.240
yeah,
but you're advocating that the government cast stones.
And I remember,

85
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.890
you know,
this is all through Twitter.

86
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.730
So I see this message and like I kind of gassed.
And I was like,

87
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.940
I had never connected that Jesus there.

88
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.360
Of course he was talking about the death penalty specifically about the death

89
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:08.980
penalty.
And we were advocating it.
And so I wasn't sure how to respond,
but he,

90
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.290
David kept,
kept going.
He said,

91
00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:14.500
and what about this member of your church who had a child out of wedlock?

92
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.250
And I said,
what about it like that?
This is another point,
you know,
people,
it was,

93
00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:20.740
it was,
you know,
common knowledge.

94
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:22.940
People knew about this and what throw this in our face.

95
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.640
And we would say the standard of God isn't sinlessness,
it's repentance.

96
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.140
So she doesn't deserve that punishment because she repented.
She stopped,

97
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.560
she wasn't having premarital sex anymore and she knows that it's wrong.

98
00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:37.690
And she changed her mind and she changed her conduct,

99
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.960
which is what repentance is.
And he said,
yeah,

100
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.370
but she would have been killed if you had instituted the death penalty for that

101
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:49.150
sin.
And it was the first time,
again that I connected,

102
00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:53.260
that if you kill somebody,
as soon as they sin,
they,

103
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.250
you lose the opportunity to repent and be forgiven.
And again,

104
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:02.720
so I'm just sort of staring at my phone and you know,
in Topeka,
Kansas,

105
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:06.920
he's in Jerusalem and I really quickly ended the conversation.

106
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:10.790
I don't even remember quite how,
but it was just sort of this like I hadn't,

107
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.490
I didn't know how to handle this because like I said,

108
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:14.480
the church is full of lawyers.

109
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:18.440
They're very intelligent and their arguments and their theology for the most

110
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:22.100
part is very well constructed and super consistent.

111
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.510
And so for there to be this,
you know,
this,
this hypocrisy,
this contradiction.

112
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.960
I didn't,
my,
like my brain was,
it felt like it was exploding.

113
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.850
So I went to a couple people in the church,
including my mother.
Um,

114
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.190
and the response was,
feel free to stop me at anytime by the way,

115
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:40.880
I feel like I'm filling.
That's why here.
Um,
so she,

116
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.420
she's reiterated the same verses that I had told David that,

117
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.440
that supported our position,
but she didn't address the contradiction.

118
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.240
And when I seem to unsatisfied with it,
uh,

119
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.860
she said I was getting wrapped around an axle and a just sort of,
you know,

120
00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.320
push it aside.
And the response was,
so just to shut,
shut me down.
Uh,

121
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.040
and then to move on to the next thing,
which is,
it's a very human thing,
right?

122
00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:07.190
When somebody puts something in your face that that is this contradiction that

123
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:11.120
you're not ready to deal with or that you can't,
you,
you,
you know what I mean?

124
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:13.700
You compartmentalize,
you kind of sort of push it aside and try not to.

125
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.330
So the way that I dealt with it was to,
uh,

126
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.420
stop holding the sign.
Cause I knew that if somebody asked me about it,
I,

127
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.950
I couldn't defend it because I didn't,
I didn't believe it.

128
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.260
But there was nothing else I could do at that point.
And,

129
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.420
but the importance of that conversation,

130
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:36.530
this is obviously just one small contradiction in one small inconsistency and a

131
00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:38.390
vast,
you know,
we still,

132
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.790
I still believed that everybody outside the church was basically isn't a

133
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.450
completely wrong and,

134
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.480
and evil and or delusional and that the church was basically right except this

135
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:53.250
one point.
It's a culture of tattle tales,

136
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.820
not out of bad intention,

137
00:07:55.821 --> 00:07:59.270
but because they believe that they're trying to help you.

138
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.900
They don't want you to go down a bad path.
So,

139
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.490
so we know when I,
it was,
it was the,
I first thought of leaving on,

140
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:12.790
it was July 4th and I was with my sister at the time and when it first occurred

141
00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:15.380
to me that I might,
that I might have to leave the church,

142
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.610
that the church might be wrong.

143
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:20.360
I thought I had to leave like that second because if it even occurred to me that

144
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:23.810
meant I didn't belong there and that God was going to punish me and that I,

145
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.810
I just felt like immediately so much guilt and like I was a betrayer booze.

146
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.510
All your social life connected still to the church.
Yeah.

147
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:37.130
And was this where you had you already known your husband by then?
I had,
yeah,

148
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.960
he was definitely part of it.
So,
but like it wasn't like that.

149
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.670
It's like the beginning,
like,
so,

150
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.360
so he was just another person on Twitter at first.
Um,

151
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.890
and it was,
it was,
it was like friendly conversation and it was,

152
00:08:50.891 --> 00:08:54.980
went over to the front of the course of several months,
um,
I don't know,
eight,

153
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:59.460
eight or eight months or so,
seven or eight months.
Uh,
and then,
and it was never,

154
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.230
there was never anything,
you know,
about feelings or you know,
relationships are,

155
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:07.440
all that stuff is total for ventures.
No,
nothing like that.

156
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:12.300
Like not even like not even anything like nothing.

157
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.090
Like it's just that my mind didn't work that way and that there is,

158
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:19.770
there can be no relationship like that with outsiders but outsiders,

159
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.850
outsiders.
So you know,

160
00:09:22.851 --> 00:09:26.460
and I actually thought I was never going to get married because most of the

161
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:29.460
people in the church,
about 80% or so of the people in the church,

162
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.180
there's only 80 people or so anyway.
Or my immediate and extended family.

163
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.380
So I thought there's no way that I'm going to,
I'm just not going to get married.

164
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.840
It was,
it wasn't,
it wasn't like an like an easy thing at first,

165
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:46.520
but it was just,
it was just the facts on the ground.
You know,
like I,

166
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.800
I could actually ground where you had to date someone inside the church.

167
00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:51.820
There was only 80 people in the church are all your family.

168
00:09:51.821 --> 00:09:55.050
You can't date your family.
Fuck yeah.
Wow.
I mean,

169
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.550
I should say there were a couple of people my age,
like,
and they can't,

170
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.000
they had just joined the church,
like,
you know,
that.
But I had no,
like,

171
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.400
I had no interest in any of them and know,

172
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.840
and uh,
but yeah,
it's,
it's,
it was kind of strange,
but I,

173
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:17.520
so I actually had a dream about meeting,
I should say.

174
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.260
Also my husband at the time,
I didn't know he was totally anonymous on Twitter.

175
00:10:22.261 --> 00:10:25.800
Like I said,
it's just his words.
I didn't know what he looked like.
I didn't know,

176
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.010
you know,
his name or where he lived or anything about him,
uh,

177
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.170
except except these words.
Um,
and he was,

178
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.720
he was just curious and kind and,
and that sort of,

179
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:44.100
and he loved people.
And so he would sort of always be pushing,

180
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.930
pushing the conversation back to,
it's like I'm giving him,

181
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.730
just like I've told you all those verses about protesting funerals and why we

182
00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:54.510
have to go and do this and the importance of it and why we have to thank God for

183
00:10:54.511 --> 00:10:57.470
these tragedies,
because God is sovereign and he's in control.
So I'm,

184
00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.600
I'm talking about the scripturally,

185
00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:05.310
like the justifying all these things and he kept pushing it back to,

186
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:10.920
cause he's not super well versed in the Bible.
Um,
so he didn't know how to,

187
00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:14.310
it's like,
I see that the Bible says these things,
but what about the family?

188
00:11:14.311 --> 00:11:17.310
Like I just cannot imagine going and doing these things to people.

189
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.720
And so this is all happening like on as I'm,

190
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.840
so I'm also still having conversations on Twitter with so many other people.

191
00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:28.620
So it's like Twitter became this like empathy machine for me.

192
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.290
Like so it's not just like on a picket line where,

193
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.770
where people are butting heads and you know,
arguing and debating and,

194
00:11:34.771 --> 00:11:38.910
and yelling and it's,
I'm,
yes,
having these,

195
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.830
they can be kind of aggressive conversations,

196
00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:45.480
but I'm also seeing like photos of their cats and then you know,
exchanging,

197
00:11:45.481 --> 00:11:46.830
you know,
joking with their friends.

198
00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:50.940
And so I'm seeing a side of people and sort of being immersed in this community

199
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:56.380
in a way that I had never been before.
And so it was really,

200
00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:58.960
it's like,
I'm trying to say like when you say,
why did you leave like theirs,

201
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.370
it took,
it was so much sort of happening,
you know,
around this time.

202
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.650
So when by the time this like pile up of things,

203
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.790
um,
you know,
and I'm processing it as I'm going through this,

204
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.850
I'm also talking to my sister,
uh,
and,

205
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.080
and she was the only and other people in the church,
but she was the only person,

206
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.320
if I ever had a doubt or a question or a like,

207
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.270
if I thought we're doing something wrong here,

208
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.510
she was the only person who would say,
yeah,
you're right.

209
00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:31.890
That doesn't make sense that I should say my sister is,
um,

210
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.060
creative and artistic and had a like a little bit of a reputation for being kind

211
00:12:37.061 --> 00:12:40.420
of rebellious,
not as like submissive as ma,

212
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.940
me and our other sister.
Um,

213
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.560
so it was just this dynamic of,
uh,

214
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.491
you know,

215
00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:52.720
between the two of us where she was the only person that could fully articulate

216
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.300
my thoughts and feelings too.
Um,

217
00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.220
and so when I first thought of leaving and I turned around and I thought I

218
00:13:00.221 --> 00:13:04.180
literally,
it was,
we were painting at a friend's house,
painting the walls,
and I,

219
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.980
I turned around to set my paint brush down.

220
00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.140
I thought it had to go and leave that second.

221
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.840
And I turned around and saw my sister and,
uh,

222
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.610
I thought I can't leave without talking to her.
So the next day I,
um,

223
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.780
she came home from work over the lunch hour and we would always like go up to my

224
00:13:19.781 --> 00:13:24.781
room and we were talking about all these doubts we were having and I was crying

225
00:13:25.631 --> 00:13:30.610
and I put my head in her lap and,
and I couldn't even art,

226
00:13:30.611 --> 00:13:35.380
like articulating the idea of leaving was too much like an aids.
It's terrifying.

227
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.980
Um,
and it's just seemed like impossible.
And I said,

228
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.830
what if we weren't here?
And she said,
what do you mean?
And I said,

229
00:13:44.831 --> 00:13:48.940
what if we were somewhere else?
And so that starts this conversation where,

230
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:49.420
you know,

231
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:53.680
I cannot let go of all the things that I thought that the church was doing
wrong,

232
00:13:53.681 --> 00:13:58.300
that are where our theology was wrong,
where we were applying it wrong.

233
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:03.010
I mean in a way that that was destructive and unscriptural.
Um,

234
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:08.260
and she kept pushing the conversation back to we're never going to see our

235
00:14:08.261 --> 00:14:09.094
family again.

236
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.240
We're going to lose everyone and everything that's ever been important to us.

237
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.190
There is no hope outside this church.

238
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.130
All the things that we had learned about outsiders that you know,

239
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.240
that they were evil and they could never truly love each other or care about

240
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.560
care about one another.

241
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.760
They're really just enabling one another on the path to how so.

242
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.610
And so this,
this back and forth,
you know,

243
00:14:30.611 --> 00:14:35.100
it goes on for about four months before we finally actually left.
And,
uh,

244
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:40.120
it was as bad or worse is,
and it could have imagined.

245
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:45.060
But to get back to the
bad or worse,

246
00:14:45.061 --> 00:14:50.020
you could have ever imagined.
So I should say,
so you left.
How did you leave?

247
00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:55.310
Uh,
we were talking to my parents and,

248
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:59.750
you know,
and it was another,
another issue had come up and I,
I couldn't,

249
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.760
we couldn't,
it was a battle that we weren't gonna fight again.
We,
we,
we,
we can,

250
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.890
I should say in those four months,
I kept trying to,

251
00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.570
to articulate these doubts in a way that the church would accept,

252
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.620
like trying to convince them,
not being as like,
but as time went on,

253
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:16.880
I became more and more open about,
about these questions and doubts.
Um,

254
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.360
and I,
I just,
I couldn't,
we couldn't fight it anymore.

255
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:24.410
I just looked at grace and I said,
we have to go.
And cause we,

256
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:27.800
and I should say also,
we had already been packing.
Like we had,

257
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:32.540
we had started packing our things about a little over a month before that and we

258
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:36.590
had started like taking boxes to our friend's house.
Um,

259
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.930
and with the understanding,
he's actually our,

260
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:43.730
he was our high school English teacher,
um,
that we had kept up with on Twitter.

261
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.950
And he basically told him,
you know,
if something changes,

262
00:15:48.951 --> 00:15:52.430
if the church changes and these things get better,
uh,

263
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.620
then we'll,

264
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.650
we'll take all our stuff back and just pretend like none of this ever happened.

265
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.590
And he was just,
you know,
understanding and compassionate and,

266
00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:06.230
and really supportive.
Um,
but so we had done all this stuff already,

267
00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:08.960
but we actually had to go and pack the rest of our things.

268
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:13.550
So we walked out of our parents' bedroom and went and started packing and,

269
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:18.560
you know,
people started coming,
my brother and some of the elders and my aunt,

270
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:22.670
my cousin,
you know,
people,
I,
we were very close,
like our whole,

271
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.250
my whole life revolved around the church.

272
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:30.740
And so to look these people in the face and say that,
you know,
this,
the,
you know,

273
00:16:30.741 --> 00:16:32.860
the US,
them mentality,
it,

274
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:38.120
the bonds that are created in environments like that are incredibly strong.

275
00:16:38.121 --> 00:16:41.330
At least they were in our church.
And again,

276
00:16:41.331 --> 00:16:46.270
most of these people are also in my family.
Um,
so it was,
it was awful.
Uh,

277
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.840
and,
um,
you know,
crying and packing and trying to explain to them why,

278
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.910
why we're leaving and I can hardly talk,
you know,
be just,
just,

279
00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.980
I was so overwhelmed,
but,
um,

280
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.060
they actually had to go back the next day with a u haul to get the rest of our

281
00:17:02.061 --> 00:17:06.250
stuff or our parents helped us pack.
It's not,
it's not one of those,
uh,

282
00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.460
like there are some groups like that where they don't want you to lead.
They'll,

283
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.040
they'll try to stop you from leaving.
Like I heard,
um,
the Scientology,

284
00:17:13.041 --> 00:17:16.910
the Miscavige I can burn us for it.
Ron.
Yeah.

285
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:20.440
He was talking about like,
like actual,
um,

286
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.580
obstacles to you leaving,
like physically.
Like they're not going to,

287
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.330
you can't get out of the gate.
Like nothing like that.
You know,
my,

288
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:28.071
they always would say,

289
00:17:28.071 --> 00:17:30.320
this is a volunteer army and if you don't want to be here and then you don't

290
00:17:30.321 --> 00:17:33.020
belong here.
So it's just the,
uh,

291
00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.710
it's the threat of losing everything and

292
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.020
being ostracized by,

293
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.070
and just sort of expelled into this world that you believe and have always

294
00:17:43.071 --> 00:17:47.570
believed is,
is evil and without hope and doomed.
So how'd you do it?

295
00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.540
How did the,
your,
your,
you got all your stuff packed.
People are coming in,

296
00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.690
they're saying,
yeah.
I mean like they're,
they're,
they're trying to convince us,

297
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:58.800
but once they understand that we're not being convinced that would,
that,

298
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.480
you know,
they,
they walked away.

299
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.590
So I mean that night our dad dropped us off at a hotel and then Jesus Christ.

300
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:09.300
Yeah.
Like it's,
it's,
it's so immediate that you become this,
you become other,

301
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.180
you become an outsider at like in the next morning when he went back,

302
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:14.190
I rang the doorbell,

303
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:19.290
I rang the doorbell and I lived in that house from the day I was born.
Whoa.

304
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:23.250
Felt like you had to ring the doorbell,
but this is not my world anymore.

305
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:28.280
Wow.
Chris was like,
why don't you ring the doorbell?
And it was like,
there's,

306
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.250
there's no other,
there's,
there is nothing else.
Like,
it's,

307
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.230
this is not our home and it says not.
So we go and,
you know,

308
00:18:34.231 --> 00:18:37.590
we're packing all of our things.
It was just,
it was awful just to,

309
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.420
I had been in those four months I had been so terrified of,

310
00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.580
because I know knowing what was coming,

311
00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:48.300
like just imagine you're going to lose everyone in your life.

312
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:50.570
They're just,
you're just going to like,

313
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.930
you're not going to like how your parents met and fell in love or like your

314
00:18:54.931 --> 00:18:58.950
grandparents and family recipes and photos and memories.

315
00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:02.820
And what did the houseless I'm like taking photos and voice recordings and just

316
00:19:02.821 --> 00:19:07.230
all the time,
like an every,
it was just,
it's just,
it's overwhelming.
It's just,

317
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:12.330
um,
so let's go back to your first job.

318
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:17.520
What was it?
What was the first job?
I worked at a,

319
00:19:17.521 --> 00:19:21.570
um,
very briefly like,
so I should say my sister and I,
we were in,

320
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.930
it was a couple months before I actually got a job.
Um,

321
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.490
we spent the first month with,
um,

322
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.470
a cousin of mine who had left the church a few years earlier.

323
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.020
She lived really close.
She had left her as well.
Yeah.

324
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.720
So you guys knew some people had made it out.
Right.
But like the thing is it,

325
00:19:36.721 --> 00:19:39.960
there's,
there's so many,
my sister calls them mind fucks.
Right?

326
00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:43.560
So like the thing about people who leave is that they are demonized more than

327
00:19:43.561 --> 00:19:47.350
anybody else.
Like even more than gays or Jews or any other outsider.

328
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.230
It's x members who get the worst.

329
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.440
You hear the worst things about them because they knew the truth and they

330
00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:57.070
rejected it.
Right.
So I was w w when it came,

331
00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:58.020
when I thought of leading,

332
00:19:58.021 --> 00:20:01.980
like the last thing on my mind was that I could go to an ex member.
I thought,

333
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.040
you can't trust them.
They're people like,
so it's,
it's just this whole,
uh,

334
00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.690
this intensely negative,
instinctive reactions to those things.

335
00:20:09.691 --> 00:20:11.550
But obviously I overcame it.

336
00:20:11.551 --> 00:20:15.630
And I reached out to her a few weeks before we left and she was amazing.

337
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:16.380
Like within,

338
00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.900
I hadn't talked to her in three and a half years and had said all kinds of

339
00:20:18.901 --> 00:20:23.760
terrible things,
you know,
about her,
um,
after she left.
But,
um,

340
00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:29.100
but she was wonderful and she said like,
within like 30 seconds of like when I,

341
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.860
when she understood that I was planning to leave,
uh,

342
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:36.470
I want you to come live with me.
And it was,
it was amazing.
And,
uh,

343
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:41.590
so kind.
And so where I've lived there for about a month,
um,

344
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.880
my sister was still in school,
so she was,
we were traveling back to camp,

345
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.110
the Topeka,
sorry.
It's like,

346
00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:49.000
so it's a half an hour from my cousin's house and you know,

347
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:51.480
four days a week while she was still in school.
And so we,

348
00:20:51.481 --> 00:20:54.550
but we were constantly running into our family and driving by the pickets cause

349
00:20:54.551 --> 00:20:58.000
they'd pick it every day and to be guest several times a day and,
uh,

350
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.990
like at the grocery store and on campus.
And so it was just,

351
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.430
we needed to get away.
So we ended up going to deadwood,
South Dakota.
Um,

352
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:10.720
my brother had been a fan of the TV show and,
uh,
and uh,

353
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:14.500
it just seemed like a nice,
quiet,
like placement.
How many people went with you?

354
00:21:14.501 --> 00:21:18.130
It was you,
your sister,
and your brother.
No,
it was just,
just you and your sister?

355
00:21:18.131 --> 00:21:20.770
My sister.
Yeah.
Did anybody else join you after a while?

356
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:24.460
I have a brother who left about a year and a half after my sister and I did.

357
00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.510
And I have another brother who left about eight years before I did.
Wow.

358
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.670
So another seven.
There's 11 kids.

359
00:21:30.671 --> 00:21:35.671
So seven are still at home and four of us are out to talk to them.

360
00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.150
Yeah.
The,
the people who are out.
Yeah.
What about the people that were in?
No,

361
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:45.130
they won't have anything to do with us.
They're just like,
I've talked your mom.

362
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:51.100
No,
no.
Uh,
sh they,
well,

363
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.150
the thing is like,
so back to Twitter,
like that's how I know what that,

364
00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.850
what they're up to.
Like I said,
I see folks like they post photos,

365
00:21:57.851 --> 00:22:02.851
like I'm watching my little brother grow up on their photos on Twitter and see

366
00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:08.380
what my parents want.
I'm on.
It's awful.
I mean it's,
it's,
I'm glad,

367
00:22:08.381 --> 00:22:10.450
I'm so glad to be living now and not,
you know,

368
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.410
before social media where I can actually see these things and,

369
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:15.460
and know what they're up to.

370
00:22:15.461 --> 00:22:20.200
And a little bit about how they're to want to reach out.
I do.
Yeah.

371
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:25.210
I mean,
I do on,
on Twitter,
you know,
there's this great about Twitter.
Um,

372
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:30.160
sometimes like I have,
they blocked me on my main account.
Not all of them,

373
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:34.910
but a lot of them are mom block you.
Uh,
she actually created,
she,

374
00:22:34.911 --> 00:22:38.170
she got kicked off of Twitter at one point,
so she had to create a new again.

375
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.210
So she didn't block me on her new account yet.
Um,

376
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.560
but our old account.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
Um,

377
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.230
yeah.
Their mom blocks you on Twitter.
That's big thing,
right?

378
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.950
Really terrible.
See that you're blocked.
What does that,

379
00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:02.380
what does that lump in your throat like?
Just want you to imagine like,

380
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.010
I can't believe,
like,
it's so hard to think back to like,

381
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.550
I was incredibly close with my mom and I love her and I miss her.

382
00:23:09.551 --> 00:23:13.720
Like I used to make coffee for her every morning and like we'd go on walks

383
00:23:13.721 --> 00:23:18.310
together and
um,
wow.

384
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:23.100
Actually,
I,
I saw her to pick it a little over a year ago.
She didn't,

385
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.890
she didn't say anything to me.
She didn't even talk to,
you know,
she,

386
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:30.100
she couldn't like baby that came from her body,
loved you and raised you.

387
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.510
She can't like,
it's,
it's,
it's,

388
00:23:34.511 --> 00:23:36.940
so like when I think about like when I was at the church,

389
00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:39.630
and this is one of the hardest things to articulate,
I mean to that,

390
00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:42.610
the feeling of like when somebody leaves,

391
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.540
like there is no interaction.
So some people would ask like,

392
00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:50.150
well what if you saw her at such a place,
you know,

393
00:23:50.151 --> 00:23:52.910
wherever at the grocery store or whatever.
Like what,
what would you say?

394
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:57.680
They would ask me this while I was still at the church and it's so,
it's like,

395
00:23:57.681 --> 00:24:00.980
uh,
I,
the only thing I can compare it to is like,
it's like dividing by zero.

396
00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:04.520
Like the situation does not exist.
Like there's nothing there.

397
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.190
The idea of trying to talk to her,

398
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:13.210
it is impossible.
Right.
And go crazy.

399
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:18.020
That's the call.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.
That's the,
like in Jehovah's Witnesses,

400
00:24:18.021 --> 00:24:21.470
they call it a dis fellowshipping,
right?
Yeah.
They all habit.

401
00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.110
Excommunication Qology houses.
They all have it.
Yeah.

402
00:24:24.111 --> 00:24:27.570
It's one of the ways they control people to fear of alienation and the fear to

403
00:24:27.571 --> 00:24:32.390
be calming like them.
Yeah,
exactly.
So they'll talk to gay people,

404
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:36.500
they'll talk to people with rainbow shirts on,
they'll talk to ex soldiers,

405
00:24:36.501 --> 00:24:40.970
they'll talk to those people.
They won't talk to you.
Right.
That's insane.

406
00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.510
But this is one of your mind on acid when I,

407
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:50.060
um,
one of the great things about Twitter and,

408
00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:54.260
and just the Internet in general is that it's a thing where it's like,

409
00:24:54.261 --> 00:24:57.580
they obviously like my little brothers for instance,
like they are,
you know,

410
00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:01.220
hearing all this bad stuff about,
you know,
my sister and me,
anybody who leaves,

411
00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:02.630
they all,
they'll hear bad things about us.

412
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.270
But the good thing about the internet is like they can go on,

413
00:25:05.271 --> 00:25:09.290
they can go to my Twitter account and see what I'm actually saying.
So I'm still,

414
00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:14.090
I go through these phases where like I,
I,
I,
I will tweet and then I get like,

415
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:19.040
I can't,
I just like the fear of judgment I guess from my family.

416
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:19.371
And I just,

417
00:25:19.371 --> 00:25:23.150
I just choose to focus on other things and not post things on Twitter,
but like,

418
00:25:23.151 --> 00:25:26.210
I still,
I follow them on this other account that I created that's not blocked.

419
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:29.120
Right.
And it's just WBC accounts.
So like,

420
00:25:29.121 --> 00:25:31.420
and I see like things that they say and,
uh,

421
00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.700
like doctrines that I now believe are unscriptural.
And so like,

422
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:39.170
I will tweet them,
you know,
versus like,
I want this contradicts you.
Like,

423
00:25:39.171 --> 00:25:43.700
and try to like basically doing what I was doing for them now against them,

424
00:25:43.701 --> 00:25:46.170
like just in this,
in these instances.
And,

425
00:25:46.171 --> 00:25:51.171
and so there is some engagement a little bit with my family on Twitter because,

426
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.980
especially because of any,
like anything that I do publicly,

427
00:25:54.981 --> 00:25:58.700
so maybe something about this,
I dunno,
but like when my ted talk came out,

428
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:03.230
there was a couple of articles and like,
people were tweeting it a lot and,
and,

429
00:26:03.231 --> 00:26:07.010
uh,
so my uncle and my aunt both were tweeting,

430
00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:11.150
tweeting me and tweeting about me.
And so I was,
you know,

431
00:26:11.151 --> 00:26:13.960
we're having this rub,
Rti,
I guess,
like just,
you know,

432
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:17.360
going back and forth about these,
these Bible verses.
And debating.

433
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.140
And so all of that stuff,
it's,
it's,
it's,

434
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.260
I hope at some point,
hopefully we'll have,

435
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.630
we'll have some effect and in some ways it already has.

436
00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.450
So like the day that I left,
there was a,

437
00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:30.900
we're going to get to that job sometimes here.

438
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:37.610
The day that I left my,
one of my cousins,
you know,

439
00:26:37.611 --> 00:26:41.180
came into my bedroom while I was crying and packing and I was asking like,

440
00:26:41.181 --> 00:26:45.150
just very calmly,
this is my best.
My best friend,
she was a year older than me,

441
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.630
is a year older than me and,
uh,

442
00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:50.610
she's asking me why we're leaving and I'm describing a lot of things.

443
00:26:50.611 --> 00:26:54.350
And one of the two I described specifically at two signs,
uh,

444
00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:58.200
one of them was the death penalty for fags and another one was facts can't

445
00:26:58.201 --> 00:27:00.140
repent.
And,
uh,

446
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:04.920
she sent me a message the next morning and like I was describing versus that I

447
00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:07.560
thought,
you know,
contradicted those two signs.
And,
uh,

448
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.540
the following morning she sent me a message,

449
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:13.530
a text message to super early in the morning,
just like,
uh,
just joined me out,

450
00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:17.940
basically like that.
I know that that Leviticus and Romans one,

451
00:27:17.941 --> 00:27:22.710
like the death penalty,
like there's no,
there's,
you have no argument.
Like so,

452
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:26.220
so what's your really your problem?
And,
um,
so,

453
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:30.930
and then for a while after I left,
like those signs were like everywhere.

454
00:27:30.931 --> 00:27:33.960
Like she's holding my cousin changes her profile picture on Twitter to her

455
00:27:33.961 --> 00:27:34.890
holding those two signs,

456
00:27:34.891 --> 00:27:38.730
like screaming into the camera and like one of the elders like making a snow

457
00:27:38.731 --> 00:27:40.410
angel with those two signs and it's like,

458
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.870
so they're just like doubling down on this,
right.
And uh,
so this goes on,

459
00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:44.940
it's like during this time,

460
00:27:44.941 --> 00:27:49.080
like I'm talking about it in like giving a few interviews,
like talking about it,

461
00:27:49.081 --> 00:27:51.450
they're like on Twitter a little bit.
Um,

462
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.830
like reiterating the verses that contradict them.
And then like,

463
00:27:55.831 --> 00:27:58.520
after more than two years,
like I wake up one morning and I check,

464
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:03.780
I'm checking their twitters and uh,
there was a blog post and they said,
uh,

465
00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:07.960
about that fags can't repent sign.
And I was like,
oh my God.
It's like,

466
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.690
like opened the blog post and it's a,

467
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.290
for the first time ever they had publicly disavowed assign and using the same

468
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.940
Bible verses that I had been.

469
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:19.890
And I know that's like a very small point in the grand scheme of things.
Right.

470
00:28:19.891 --> 00:28:24.540
But that's,
that's reason,
that's critical reasoning.
But,
but like,

471
00:28:24.541 --> 00:28:26.250
so this is,
this is the goal,
right?

472
00:28:26.251 --> 00:28:30.480
So like to knowing this is like story behind it.

473
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:34.200
I don't,
I don't,
it was after my brother left,

474
00:28:34.201 --> 00:28:38.610
so I don't really know,
you know,
at no,
nobody who's left since then.
I also,

475
00:28:38.611 --> 00:28:42.300
I have to do,
actually have my cousins have left since then also.
Um,

476
00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:47.310
but none of them have any understanding of like,
of,
of what happened.

477
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:52.400
So I don't know.
I,
and I'm not like,
I,
I'm not trying to take credit.

478
00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:55.620
I should also say like,
well,
it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
Like it just

479
00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:01.510
changes possible.
It gets into their head that what they're doing,
it's,

480
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:06.360
this is not in any way the teachings of Christ.
Right.
I mean,

481
00:29:06.361 --> 00:29:09.770
like the thing is like some,
some of it is,
some of us.
