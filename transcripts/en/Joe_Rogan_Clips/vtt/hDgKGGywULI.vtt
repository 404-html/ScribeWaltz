1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.290
The joe rogan experience.
In a perfect world,

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:08.430
where would you look all this to end?
I want the Walters.
Sounds crazy.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.550
My dream is I'm going to free whales.
There's going to be a sanctuary.

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.890
I'm going to free marine lens whales.
I'm going to have a hand in this.

5
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:16.560
That's going to happen.
Number two,
do you really think that's going to happen?

6
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:20.220
You think they're going to enact legislation that makes them release those

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.980
animals?
I think so,
yes.
Really?
Yes.

8
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.450
What makes you so hopeful as two or three they rangelands tried to kill this

9
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:29.010
bill for years.

10
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:32.670
Now they've not been able to this time next week to set the sucker should go

11
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.840
that whale sanctuary sanctuary project.
They're going to build a whale sanctuary.

12
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.190
There's going to be a place for whales.

13
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.210
If it's in Canada and all the exportation laws are that marine land can't get

14
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:43.044
rid of their whales.

15
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.610
There will only be one place for whales if that business he likes to evolve or

16
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:49.140
if there's any type of ownership changes.

17
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.550
I see this being a big deal and to me how this sanctuary would work.
Well,

18
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:58.260
you'd have an environment where is a pen off in the ocean and you know it'd be,

19
00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:02.760
I mean various different pens for various different procedures if you will,

20
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.750
but the idea is that if they can't be wholly released,

21
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.520
then you've got a place where they have a sense assemblance of,
of,
of freedom,

22
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:15.240
if you will,
but it'll be in human care.
There'll be more of like for instance,

23
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.390
a viewing platform where people be able to view the whales versus,

24
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.820
and how big of an area we talking about massive.
Yeah.

25
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.810
I can't say the square footage.
I don't know because they,

26
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.140
nothing's finalized yet.
So we're still in the development.

27
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.600
Would they develop a bay or something?

28
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:30.900
Would they would want to ideally get a bay that has good water change over that,

29
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:32.820
you know that that works.
If you can find that,

30
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:35.910
and I mean the east coast is looking really good these days.

31
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.450
Is there a model that they've drawn up?

32
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.760
Not Co.
There's models.
Yeah,
no,
absolutely.
There's good friends.

33
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.630
We look at something like this and if you look up the whale sanctuary project,

34
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:46.980
I'm sure you'll find tons of different columns.

35
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.070
I just don't know how they're keeping the ORC is in those things.

36
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.690
If you put a fence up,
they're not going to go anywhere.

37
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.070
They wouldn't jump the fence.
They don't,
there's something about jumping out.

38
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.030
I mean,
when the,
when the wild captures happen,
what do we got here?

39
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.530
There's the whale sanctuary.

40
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.220
We're building a model sanctuary where to whales and dolphins can re re

41
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.360
habilitated and live permanently in their natural environment.
So it's a step.

42
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.670
So this is a step between this and then the,
the wild.
Yes.
No.

43
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:18.930
Are they going to free them and then release fish in there for them to eat?

44
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.090
I imagine there'll be all of that every which way.

45
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:24.450
It would be nice too that allow them to actually hunt and kill the fish,

46
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:26.070
which I'm sure that's what they want to do.

47
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.860
The fact that they can feel the natural rhythms of the sea.
I mean,

48
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:31.500
they're in tune with the senior and their environment.
The pools,

49
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:33.840
no place to what it says here.
Um,

50
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.330
for medium survive four years,
median survival time,
uh,

51
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.170
in years for wild caught orchids at a marine park for years,

52
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.850
1000,
100 square yards of space and a large display tank.

53
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:49.950
And a typical high end marine tank,

54
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.220
314,600 is the minimum number of square yards for the first whale sanctuary

55
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:58.980
project.
Seaside sanctuary.

56
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.830
So this is 314,000,

57
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:06.130
600 square yards.
So it would be a massive place.

58
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.010
Hundred and five is the number of captive orchids and Belugas in North America.

59
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.540
So that includes marine lance of marine land has half the Balugas in North

60
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:18.520
America.
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

61
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.210
And they fly under the radar because no one wants to talk about them.
Right?
24,

62
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:25.930
seven round the clock care care for the whales at the sanctuary.

63
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.540
That sounds beautiful.
Murraylands threatened to sue these people.

64
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.010
These people are fucking,
I am dude.

65
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.250
Me Buy more.
We need more than just you.

66
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:40.960
It seems like fuck man.
People listening.
Please get involved.

67
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.060
This is a a great step though.
I love this idea of this step,

68
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.721
you know,

69
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:51.130
like have something that's like a bridge between the captive and the wild.

70
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.630
Also,
it would allow their atrophied dorsal fins to,

71
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:58.390
to reinvigorate.
They can start diving deep again.
I mean,

72
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:02.050
you know how deep it necessarily,
but at least a little bit and get,

73
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.190
you could train these animals to physically take them for walks,
if you will.

74
00:04:05.191 --> 00:04:07.240
I guess you'd call him swims where you would be able to leave and having them

75
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:09.670
just follow a boat and go for some extra.
So you can totally,
I mean the,

76
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.593
it really the,

77
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.770
the things that this is going to present the opportunities for these animals is

78
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:17.140
brilliant and amazing.
And the board is comprised of all your,

79
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.490
all your wild animal,
brilliant scientist.
I mean,
this is the project.

80
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:22.540
This is the future.

81
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.590
Yeah.
