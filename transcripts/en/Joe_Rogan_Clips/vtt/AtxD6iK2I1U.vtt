1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.240
Did you hear that they might have uncovered a Pedo ring?

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.220
He might've uncovered a Pedo ring when he was doing this.
Oh,
Jen did?
No,

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.900
Sasha Baron Cohen.
Oh Wow.
Oh yeah.
Did you see it?

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.340
I read a headline that says that you're fine with the exact specifics of it
were,

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.120
but like they decided not to air it,
but it's like what dude?
You know what,

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.470
when you said that about Oj made me think I met Buzz Aldrin from the moon.
Yes.

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.170
And He,
and when I met him,

8
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.900
it didn't seem like he'd been to the moon.
Not Saying that Colin.
Yeah.

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.060
Hold on a second.
Uh,
sent cut.

10
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:37.920
Who is America interview to FBI over fears of Las Vegas pedophile route and not

11
00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:40.200
surprised.
Whoa.

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.680
Said the said the interview led him to believe there could be a pedophile ring

13
00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:48.900
in Las Vegas.
Holy Shit.

14
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.790
Could you imagine of a pedophile ring in Las Vegas was exposed by Sasha Baron

15
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:58.590
Cohen and a comedy movie and they find out it's real.
I wonder if this is all,

16
00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:02.150
this is a setup for some other type of film,
but let's look at it.
Okay.

17
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.750
There has to have been pedophile rings in the past.
Undeniable.
Right.

18
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.970
I would think if you go back,

19
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.100
you go back to like the 50s or the forties and the 30s there has to be something

20
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:17.610
like that easy back then.
Yeah.
They take orphans and they molest him.

21
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:21.210
All that Sandusky type shit that has been going on.
Yeah.

22
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.590
So how often has it been going on and what happens now to the same type of

23
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:28.380
people?
Like if that's no longer available for them,

24
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.930
is there some way they get it,

25
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:35.931
some super fucking super tightly watched circuit ring of people who still engage

26
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:42.840
in this activity and figured out a way to do it?
I hope not.
I hope not too.

27
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.160
Everybody hopes not,
but the idea that it's impossible.

28
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.780
The idea that it's impossible is unlikely.
Yeah.

29
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:53.370
There's probably a market for it,
sadly.

30
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.640
Well you think about it all the time when you think about other countries,
right?

31
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.520
Yeah.
They're doing it.
They're for sure.
Most of our guys,

32
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:02.070
it seems fly over these other countries and be dirty over there.

33
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.350
The idea of like going over there and there's a ring,
a pedophile ring.
Ooh,

34
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.040
that's scary dude.
Who wants to fuck some kid?

35
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.960
That's crazy.

36
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.840
They think it's mostly people who have been abused like that themselves.
Yeah,

37
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.763
it's mostly that.

38
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.510
That's one of the things that Kevin Spacey's brothers said about Kevin is that

39
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:29.490
Kevin is basically like their dad and their dad sexually abused them and now

40
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:33.180
Kevin is acting that out and there was a,
an interview.
His Dad,

41
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:34.590
his brother rather give us he,

42
00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:39.591
Kevin Spacey's brother and I never met Rod Stewart on the strongest acid

43
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:42.420
available.
Oh,
he's crazy looking.

44
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.040
This is weird looking guy with wacky hair and he wears funky glasses and weird

45
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:49.680
clothes.
Donnie,
what's his name?
I don't know what his name is,

46
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.670
but he looks like he's wearing a costume.
Donny space.
That's not it,
is it?
No,

47
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.410
but here it took a look at them.
Just look at this.
That's,
that's his brother.

48
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.180
God Dang Man.
It looks like Nice Guy.

49
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.410
Seemed like an English scientist and Rod Stewart.

50
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.340
I can't believe Kevin's when they got banged by the day.
I think they both did.

51
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.890
I think you saying they both did.
I can't believe I even just said that.

52
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:16.800
It's messed up.
Yeah,
it's sad,
man.
They said their dad was a monster.
Yeah.

53
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.290
Yeah.
Look at his dad like,
look,
look at this.
His brother,
how he dresses up.

54
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.200
Look at that crazy rod Stewart outfit.
Yeah,
I bet.

55
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:27.790
Like one chick or one dude fucked him because he thought it was rod Stewart and

56
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:31.040
it's like,
look,
I'm just going to ride this boat riding to the rocks,
right,

57
00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:35.140
Stuart.
Huh?
This is his outfit.
That's crazy.
Outfit.
That has a crazy,

58
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:38.110
crazy outfit.
He's got rings on every finger.

59
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.260
He's got a wallet chain across his Pecker.
Wow.
Those dicks keeping time brother.

60
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.530
Yeah.
Look at that shirt.

61
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.480
That fluffy shirt with the crazy ass neck accouterments.
Yeah.

62
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:51.190
If you're not trying to get fucked by somebody,

63
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:53.060
you shouldn't wear all this happened and,
but,

64
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.390
but think about how much effort it took to do all this.

65
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:59.140
And I'll go up to his teeth,
son.
Yeah,
son.

66
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:02.860
What's up with that mug at Scotland,
Bro?
Clean that shit up.
Is he from Scotland?

67
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.920
It's Kevin Spacey from Scotland.
I think they're from Britain.

68
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.570
I think they're from America.
Really?
Yeah.
Where was Kevin Spacey born?

69
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.820
Fuck,
if you'd know you're googling it.

70
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.350
Well you know for a year then you're the guy who's got the Google in front of

71
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:20.980
you.
But no,
what about this?

72
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.100
Do you think he would have been as talented but he didn't have this affliction?

73
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.300
Where does it say does this any worries from Orange,
New Jersey?
See there you go.

74
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:32.800
Perfect.
Dump and pop.
One of those talented men of our time.

75
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.250
People like in New Jersey who fuck you bro.
Man,
I was born there.

76
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.190
He is very talented but he's also very crazy and I think,
uh,

77
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.630
in his day you could get away with a lot if you're a movie star.
I think,

78
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.640
you know,
they just,
they ran those sets like,
oh yeah,
they were crazy.

79
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.490
Well they have that are Kelly thing now and in that have got his whole life,

80
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:57.760
he got to do whatever you wanted.
It seemed like that's a different animal.
Right?

81
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:02.020
Cause he's a musician.
But yeah,
it seems like he's the under age.

82
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.100
The underage thing with him is like Aaliyah married,
Aaliyah,

83
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.960
underage sex with her underage,

84
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.270
and it was till I remember we just grew up listening to his music.

85
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.950
It was these girls are coming out about him doing that to them when they're,

86
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.470
yeah,
but a lot of people new 1314,
they're saying 15,

87
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.400
but I can't believe more people aren't comes up.

88
00:05:19.401 --> 00:05:20.890
Let's say there was a video of it,

89
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.550
you know that more people aren't complicit in that.
It was unbelievable.

90
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.270
What about the people that are like,
well here's what's crazy.

91
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.950
Did the video is out of him peeing on people and then years later people are

92
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:36.970
still making music with them.
Yeah.
Wow.

93
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.460
That's crazy.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
That's crazy.

94
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.940
When you find out how many people were,
what was it?
Was it the breakfast club?

95
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.310
What show was it that they,
uh,

96
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.630
they started reading off a list of all the people that worked with our Kelly

97
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.800
post video.
So the video was out,
Lady Gaga,

98
00:05:56.801 --> 00:06:01.790
all these people and he like a giant number of people.

99
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.690
Do you think we'll ever be able to eradicate the,

100
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.800
the fact that people do that too,
like,
uh,

101
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.460
have like the pedophile or had that vibe for them first to sexual sexualized

102
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:11.630
children or young people.

103
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.870
Hopefully scientists will figure out a way to isolate that part of human

104
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:24.500
thinking someday.
Like hopefully there'll be something researchers,

105
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.790
doctors,
scientists,
psychologist,
whoever.
It is figured out a way to stop that.

106
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.080
But in the meantime,

107
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.070
what had has gotten is way more difficult for them to get away with it.
Right,

108
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.120
right.
And it's going to get more difficult still.
