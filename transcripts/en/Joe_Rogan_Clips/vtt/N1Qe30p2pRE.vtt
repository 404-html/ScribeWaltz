WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.870
And a high percentage of uh,

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.940
like predominantly female professors as well.

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.570
And their whole thing is social justice and it's like there when you know,

4
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.570
their lists or objectives as far as education,

5
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:19.740
like social justice is number one.
It's number one.

6
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.160
It's like the thing that they emphasize the most.
Well what's it going to be?

7
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:28.020
Architecture.
Well,
education.
Sure.
I guess.

8
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:32.500
But I think universities are there to promulgate an ideology,
right.

9
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.850
But they literally framed it as social justice and that does,

10
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:40.380
that term today is so fraught with peril.
I'll,
yeah,
it's the enemy.
Yeah.

11
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:43.470
It's such a goofy term like social justice.

12
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:48.280
Like it's so it's such a blanket term and so all encompassing and it,

13
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.420
you know,
you,

14
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.040
you hear it and you start thinking about people banging on Tucker Carlson's door

15
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.820
and saying,
we know where you sleep.
That's what I hear.
I mean,
well yeah,
no,

16
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.730
and I hear is like,
I was just talking about just a couple of minutes ago.

17
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.050
It means 90% of people have agreed the 10% who don't agree need to be shut down

18
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.310
because we're talking about social justice.
The,

19
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.660
there's no such thing as individual justice because that's subordinate.
Well,

20
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:10.520
I don't even know.
I mean,

21
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.090
what percentage of people would agree with banging on a guy's house?

22
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.220
Like knocking on his door and saying,
we know you're asleep.
I mean,
that is you.

23
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.640
This is us form of mental terrorism.
Like threatening him.

24
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:24.600
You're scaring him.

25
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.860
I don't think most people are capable of empathy by which they mean they can't

26
00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:30.210
put themselves in Tucker shoes.

27
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.650
So all they see is someone I hate had something bad happen to hit him good.

28
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.360
And they don't understand.

29
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:40.500
Like when these Republicans are saying that it's okay to torture terrorists,

30
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.180
right?
And the point I make is there's people right now,
uh,
uh,
Michael,

31
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:48.990
Ian Black or will tell you a tweet out every day the NRA is a terrorist

32
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:53.370
organization.
So what happens when the government defines you as a terrorist,

33
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.560
right?
You're going to,
and then you're gonna say,
well,
it never happened to me.

34
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.970
That's not how it works,
right?
That's the fear.
So you,
we,

35
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:01.170
if you're going to have principals,

36
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:03.030
you have to apply them to people that you hate.

37
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.070
And Tucker Carlson is hardly some Nazi,
right?
No,

38
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.260
it mean Tucker Carlson is if,

39
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.720
if you think that he has ideas that are questionable,

40
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.900
the solution is to present better ideas and to debate him and to go back and

41
00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:23.940
forth to them.
But Tucker Cross is not leading some hate mob.

42
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.720
He's not the centerpiece in Charlottesville pride for the extermination of the

43
00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:32.640
Jews.
Or He's not that radical.
No,
he's just a right wing guy.
Well,
what they,

44
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:36.000
what,
what critical theory allows them to do is to say,
well,

45
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:38.910
you can read between the lines and ascribing tent to the person,
right?

46
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.430
So if you read a book,
you can say,
well this is race because I can't see reason.

47
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.600
So they can easily say,
well,
when he says a,
B,
and c,
he means x,
Y,
and z.

48
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:49.260
So these are all dog whistles and you can impugn whatever motives do you want

49
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:52.590
onto a person.
And,
and,
and at that point you could do whatever you want.

50
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.160
And the thing is,
he's a dad.
So not only you have to be comfortable with,

51
00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:58.200
with fucking,
with Tucker Carlson's house,

52
00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:01.010
you gotta be careful with scaring as kids.
Yeah,
exactly.
And,

53
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.650
and I think the history of totalitarian show totalitarianism shows us they're

54
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:07.990
more than happy to sacrifice the kids to get their goal.

55
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.280
It just really disturbing to me because I think these idealistic kids who are

56
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:15.041
doing this,

57
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:20.041
they're mostly young people have a fundamental lack of understanding when it

58
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:22.720
comes to what violence is and what causes violence.

59
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.220
And this is intentional and how,
how close that scene was to violence.
Yes.

60
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.230
Cause you do that to the wrong guys door.

61
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.010
He's going to come out with a baseball bat or a gun and he's going to kill some

62
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:36.910
people or smash some people write it.
It absolutely can happen.

63
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.670
It's not likely to happen with a guy like Tucker Carlson.

64
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.850
But what if they decided to go after the wrong general?

65
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.410
I would if they decided to go after the,

66
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:46.660
I mean anything can happen in these situations.

67
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:50.980
And also those people were all going to get outed.
Once those people are outed,

68
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.010
the outrage that they're gonna experience is going to be an handleable.

69
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.270
Right.
It's going to be unmanageable.

70
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.880
The the amount of people that are furious at that group of 20 or what,

71
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.670
how many people was it?
I don't even know.
It was plenty.
I'm angry.

72
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.210
I mean I'm not going to do anything but I'm angry.
I think it was disgusting.
If,

73
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.530
if I'm angry,

74
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:16.180
how many really loosely held people,

75
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:19.420
people that are just like really barely keeping it together already,

76
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.690
but here's the scary,
it's not those 20 that are going to get the consequences.

77
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:24.220
It's going to be people who think like them,

78
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.650
who haven't done what they did and now it's going to be like,
oh,

79
00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:28.420
you agree with this?
Then it's,
I'm going to do it to you.

80
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.120
I think it's going to be them too though.
It's going to be both.
Yeah.

81
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:34.540
I think those people don't understand like people are going to find their names.

82
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.540
They're going to find where they live and there's going to be people that have

83
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:40.840
nothing to do with this,
not Tucker Carlson,
and it's not them,

84
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.720
and these people are going to seek them out and they're going to,

85
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.920
it's going to get ugly.

86
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.370
You can't just bang on people's doors like that and scare them.
Right.

87
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.970
Because people get furious.
Especially when there's not enough.

88
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.940
There's not enough evidence.
This is not a bad guy.

89
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.690
Tucker Carlson is not some evil demon.
You know,
like if you,

90
00:04:58.691 --> 00:05:01.180
if you looked at who he is and what he said,

91
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.150
if you pulled out the worst shit that he said and,

92
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.740
and taking it in comparison to the woman that we were talking about from MSNBC,

93
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:09.760
that's still in the air,
right?

94
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.850
Dwayne reed who lied about her blog being hacked and Twitter lied.

95
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:16.150
Yeah.

96
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.740
Just to try to cover up for the fact that she said some blatantly homophobic

97
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:23.320
things in the past and we called it and called in the FBI,

98
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.560
which is fucking insane.
That should be a federal crime.

99
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.680
You were moving resources from people that are already on very serious cases

100
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.080
that are already trying to solve real,
real crimes,
save people's lives,

101
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.300
save people's safety,

102
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.580
and you're deciding that your job at MSNBC is more important than that,

103
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.050
and she hasn't even fired.
