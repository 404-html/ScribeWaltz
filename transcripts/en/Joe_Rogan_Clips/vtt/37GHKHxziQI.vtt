Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.030
But I think the media is slowly but surely becoming irrelevant and that the real

3
00:00:08.311 --> 00:00:12.330
meat,
the real media is what's,
you know,
look,

4
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:16.650
the only reason why the news let's,
we don't even have to name an organization,

5
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:17.850
but in,
in quotes,

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.080
the news is the news is because they have a long history of disseminating

7
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.950
information,
right?
But people,
regular people are doing that.
Now.

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.490
A lot of people are doing that now through different websites and youtube

9
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:33.300
channels.
And I think that that's the future.
And it,
we don't have to be,

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.680
as long as you're honest and you have a,
a real objective point of view,

11
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.630
you don't have to be sanctioned by some gigantic corporation to get the fucking

12
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:44.220
truth.
Now.
No.
In fact,
you,

13
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:48.090
you're less likely to get the truth out because of your sponsors.
Because I mean,

14
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:49.980
MSNBC is owned by Ge,

15
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:54.010
MSNBC as the quote unquote liberal network and they're owned by like a company

16
00:00:54.011 --> 00:00:56.040
that like fucking could profit off of war.

17
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.050
Dave Ruben had a post that he did today to have go to Dave Rubin's Twitter page

18
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.880
about why people distrust the media and why the media has garbage today in their

19
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:07.890
coverage of this Kevin Spacey thing.

20
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.310
Because all of these different outlets were saying that Kevin Spacey came out as

21
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:18.930
gay.
That was the name,
the main headlines.
Kevin.
Yes.
Kevin Spacey came out as gay.

22
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:22.560
Kevin Spacey came out as gay.
This was like,
well,
let's have a push it up.

23
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.890
Pull it up.
Yeah,
that sounds like we should be applauding.
Well,
this is,

24
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.690
but this is,
it just shows you what it is.
Like,
look at this media.

25
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.520
Why scroll up.
Why doesn't the public trust us?
Because this,

26
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.230
I look at this actor Kevin Spacey Decides,
uh,
declares he lives as a gay man.

27
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.000
Kevin Spacey announced Sunday night that he will live as a gay man.
I mean,

28
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:49.530
look at all these different than New York Daily News.
Reuters,
the daily beast.

29
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.430
They're saying that he's gay,
but they're saying he's gay.

30
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.360
Because a kid came out where a man now came out and said,
Kevin tried to fuck.

31
00:01:58.361 --> 00:02:00.320
And when he was 14 she,

32
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.950
so this is like saying that he declares he lives life as a gay man.

33
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.190
God Damn it.
That's not the store.
No,
that sounds like a festive thing.

34
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:10.590
We should all be like congratulations to Kevin Spacey.

35
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.620
Not only that he said this in this statement where he was apologizing for this

36
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:17.470
thing.
So like this,

37
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.310
this is so crazy when also that's how they choose.

38
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.680
But they choose to frame it that way because someone coming out is going to get

39
00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:27.800
a lot of people paying attention.
Right.

40
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.200
Well and also I don't the the link to link pedophilia always to homosexuality is

41
00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:34.794
isn't true.

42
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.160
Like there are a lot of of people who would consider themselves a heterosexual,

43
00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:42.500
whether it was in the church or whatever who are raping kids cause it's,

44
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.210
it's a power thing and they're sick or pedophilia is just different.

45
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.020
Being attracted to kids is different than being attracted to like,
like men.

46
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:53.160
And this is like also really dangerous for to equate like uh,

47
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.260
trying to fuck a 14 year old with just like going down to west Hollywood to like

48
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.980
do some gay shit.
Well,
I,

49
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.020
he has admitted that he did it and he said he doesn't recall it at all.

50
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.040
But he did say that he had a problem with drinking and you know,

51
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.830
if he did do anything,
he was very sorry.

52
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.120
And we're talking about something that happened at least 30 years ago.
Right.

53
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.940
So here's also a problem and this is,

54
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:19.480
this needs to be addressed because we really don't know whether or not this

55
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:22.960
guy's memory is accurate because something 30 years ago,

56
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.010
the problem with being 14 years old,
his first of all,
14 years old,

57
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.180
you're so God damn confused.
I don't remember shit.
He don't remember shit.

58
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:35.740
You are a wash in hormones and confusion and insecurity.

59
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.603
And

60
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.910
<v 1>he might've had five years of my life too.</v>

61
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.983
<v 0>He,
yeah,</v>

62
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.310
he might've had some weird run in with Kevin Spacey that may or may not have

63
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:48.650
been sexually predatory.
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.
Right.

64
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.040
But two to decide that he's absolutely telling the truth and Kevin Spacey's

65
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.050
absolutely covering this up by coming out as gay to using that sort of diffuse

66
00:03:58.841 --> 00:03:59.420
the situation.

67
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.940
<v 1>This is sort of the,</v>

68
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.380
this is almost the opposite of when Twitter declares you guilty.

69
00:04:06.381 --> 00:04:09.230
This is like the news declaring you almost like innocent,
right?

70
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.350
Where I don't know what happened to letting,
uh,

71
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.700
courts decide and talk about people being accused and whatnot where Twitter can

72
00:04:18.711 --> 00:04:23.480
just like be like if,
if they say you're done,
like,
uh,
you had Jon Ronson on,

73
00:04:23.481 --> 00:04:26.700
right?
Yes.
Did he talk,
did he read that publicly shamed?
So good.
Yeah,

74
00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:29.120
it's really good.
And it's just like,
man,
these people's lives are done.

75
00:04:29.121 --> 00:04:32.330
And I was part of all that shit.
I,
I tweeted about fucking Justine sacco.
Yep.

76
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.290
Straight up.
I did.
And I read that book and it's like,
yeah,
you don't,

77
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.350
you don't think of that.
You know what I mean?

78
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.070
<v 0>It's a free shot.
I mean,
that's,
look,</v>

79
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.890
the worst example of that is people that are completely anonymous,
right?

80
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.560
You weren't completely anonymous,
which is why you face the blow back.

81
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.330
But there's a lot of people that had just have a Twitter egg and they,
I mean,

82
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:53.470
they're completely anonymous.

83
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:56.800
They have a bunch of random letters and numbers is a name and they fucking

84
00:04:56.801 --> 00:05:01.240
attacked people left and right.
Yeah.
It's a common thing on Twitter.
Yeah.
I mean,

85
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:05.590
we're seeing a new kind of interaction with human beings.
Yeah.

86
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.840
<v 2>Yeah.</v>
