Hello Freak bitches.
And this thing is the same way.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.740
If you got some food on the counter and it's four feet off the ground,

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.260
that fucking thing.
You leave the room for one second.
That food is gone.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.280
They're just feral.
Yeah.
It was funny,

5
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:17.550
like my puppy was like that when he was little.
It's like a,
I was,

6
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:18.890
I mean that's how puppies are and I,

7
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.670
but I forgot cause I haven't had a puppy in awhile and uh,
I was uh,

8
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.060
eating and I put some food on his plate and he saw it.
He's like,
oh,

9
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:30.270
I want some of that.
They jumped up,
put his feet on the table,

10
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:31.450
leaned in and tried to it,

11
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.220
tried to bite it and got a piece of meat in his mouth and I was like,
hey fucker,

12
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.790
you can't know.
Like I got to teach him this.
Yeah,
because they don't know.

13
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.020
They feel like,
well the food's right there.
I get the food.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There it is.

14
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:44.440
It's right there.
He,
our neighbors,

15
00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:46.990
we're having people over there were having a party and I was over there and they

16
00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:47.980
had a husky,

17
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:52.720
a fucking bad ass Alaskan Husky and this thing was,
you know,

18
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.010
beyond puppy.
It was big and they had meatball,
Swedish meatballs,

19
00:00:57.011 --> 00:01:00.670
like four platters of them were right out of the oven.
It's still fucking hot.

20
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.810
And they left the room and they came back and they were gone.
He ate all of them,

21
00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:08.830
all the Swedish meatballs hot.
He didn't give a fuck.

22
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.160
He's like,
here's my chance.
You have a full belly or have a,
you know,
or burn,

23
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.170
burn your tongue and have a full bag or not,
no food and is an Irish party.

24
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.440
This wasn't like there's Swedish meatballs and there is a sausage now Irish,

25
00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:26.870
this one fucking thing and now it's gone.
The Swedish speak was a dog.

26
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.180
Eat all the food.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dot.

27
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.210
It's a weird relationship that humans have with dogs is,
you know,

28
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:35.930
a lot of people have dogs to sleep in their beds.
They come with you places.

29
00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:40.820
They hop in the car and then then there's the assholes that have those emotional

30
00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:45.620
support dogs.
Yeah.
What is,
what's the jury out on that still?

31
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.610
It's a fucking ridiculous part of modern 21st century life that we allow that

32
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:56.540
stupid shit.
I was in a fucking restaurant,
like a really nice restaurant.

33
00:01:56.541 --> 00:02:01.390
This lady came in and she's a lady from real housewives.
She was one of those uh,

34
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.310
what's,
no,
not the show.
Desperate housewives.

35
00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:07.820
She's a famous actress and want to say her name.
Very pretty lady.

36
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.690
She hit the skids though.
But anyway,
she's bringing,

37
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.980
brings in this fucking dog and people are looking at it like what?

38
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.940
It's a dog,

39
00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:21.941
like a golden lab and a big dog and she brings his dog and it's just sitting

40
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:26.570
there eating and there's dogs on the floor where like you might drop a fry or

41
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:28.480
your fork and pick it up and wipe it off.

42
00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:32.090
And his dogs assholes just rubbing on the ground right there.
I mean,

43
00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:33.170
basically you have this,

44
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.990
this animal's Dick is like rubbing on the ground and rubbing on things and dirt

45
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:42.520
on its feet.
It's probably stepping in shit and had pled.

46
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.610
People have allergies to dogs.
Oh,
90% up there night.
100% yeah.

47
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:49.010
And it's somehow or another,

48
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.180
they can get a note from their doctor that says there are two fucking week to

49
00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:56.310
exist without this dog with them.
24 hours a day.
Yeah.

50
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.330
It's an emotional support dog.
This a lot of comics that have them.
Yeah,

51
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:03.820
but it's a like a loophole.
Luck.
Natasha has one,

52
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:06.100
but she like openly admits it's a loophole,

53
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.620
so she can't bring the dog everywhere.
She's got a doctor's note.
Yeah.

54
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.770
It says she's soft.
Yeah.

55
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.200
I think is what's her name's has to be allies.
Eliza's.

56
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.160
Does she have it set up?
Yeah.
Like,
sure.
That thing doesn't leave her side.
Yeah.

57
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.890
She'll make you watch it though.
When she goes on stage here.
Hold this Greg.
What?

58
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.890
Yeah,
I know.
And the people finger it.
I loved.

59
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.140
I don't know.
A lot of people do,
and I saw it.

60
00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:37.910
Here are the dog waits for her to go out.
It just takes a task near,

61
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.770
so it's running a sense he had presents.
Just literally runs backwards.

62
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.250
She's going to hear this to be so mad.
We're kidding.
Eli's uh,
we're kidding.

63
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.150
Don't call Elis and either get mad at that.

64
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>
