1
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.740
It's hard to tell from that picture cause he's an actual one 85 right there.

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.570
Very,
very deflated.

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.360
It's amazing the difference between some guys like when they weigh in like,
Yo,

4
00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:16.320
well when he weighs in at one 85,
he's still looks so perv ridiculous.

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.900
Uber jacked at one 85.

6
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:22.470
You can't believe he only weighs one 85 against them some scale then.

7
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.250
But then he fucking blew up.

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.690
I mean he just puts all that meat back on your boy,
your boy.

9
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.190
A Whitaker was like that mother fuckers.
Here's interviews.
Like I said,

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.690
it was magic.
He's like,
it's magic.
See that mango from that to that.
And he goes,

11
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.190
honestly,
find them before and he's aging and this time he was even harder.

12
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.630
He's like,
something's up their son.
Yeah.
Um,
here's the thing.

13
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.340
May Be,
but you know what else may be may be crazy.
Cuban genetics.

14
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.890
I think that shit would be crazy.
There's young genetics.

15
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.010
How much more impressive whether whatever it is on,
let's say is on something,

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.040
whether it could beat him twice.
Yeah.
There should not be a third fight.

17
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.990
I don't think this decision was just in the second fight.
Now you're crazy.

18
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:05.910
But I think there should have been 10 eights.
No,

19
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.000
I think the new rules I think should have been a draw of that.

20
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.100
I don't think you'll all won that fight if any.

21
00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:14.130
If you're going to give you all a ten eight then that's a draw draw.

22
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.260
I'm fine and I don't think they give draws out enough.

23
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.430
I will draw the finder because then they're forced to have that trust.

24
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.770
What I'm saying that I'm fine with.
I didn't think that a decision.

25
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.510
I thought like there's too many moments in the fight where yo well hurt Whitaker

26
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.980
like really hurt.

27
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.060
There was no moments in the fight where Whitaker really hurt you.

28
00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:35.910
Well like really hurt him.
Like had them in deep trouble.

29
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.350
There was one but that head kick,

30
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.940
the wobbling a little bit of [inaudible] on Thursday.
The head cake was when Dow,

31
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.900
I don't think that even fucking did much if wobble his legs a tad bit.

32
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:49.320
But if you go round by round,
watch that fight a bunch.
I think I have,

33
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:51.900
which was a good,
that was he landed with the foot,
right,

34
00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:56.100
like and hit in the face,
top of the head,
but also like you'll round by round.

35
00:01:56.101 --> 00:02:00.300
I just stylistically I had Whitaker winning three two.
All right.

36
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.480
Let's say I gave you out when he fucked him up that night.

37
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.910
There was a fourth of fifth in first was both rounds.
You had got in trouble.

38
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.030
I gave one to ten nine to you all and then if you give a ten eight it would

39
00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:12.720
still be a draw,
which I'm fine with,
which makes more sense to me,
but I,

40
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.230
it's just people have a hard time with decisions when the guy at the end of the

41
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:17.460
fight is fucking the guy up.

42
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.550
Now obviously this is coming from someone who's a professional commentator,

43
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.410
so I understand this is a ridiculous argument,

44
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.850
but the ridiculous argument is if we're going to judge what a fight is,

45
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.060
we all know if you're watching a fight fight,
right?

46
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.650
If you and I are in a fight and you're on top of me beating the shit out of me

47
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.960
in the last few seconds when the cops come in,
that doesn't matter if I,

48
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:44.220
if I've ran around this room and kicked your legs for the first two minutes and

49
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:47.100
then you've got on top of me and we're beating the fuck out of me for the last

50
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:50.070
20 seconds when the cops can talk in prison rules won the fight.

51
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.180
He won the fight in the fight,
but as a professional sport stamp.

52
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.610
But this is a professional sport that's kind of a fight.

53
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.840
It's not just a box that's the box.
And if I win the first eight rounds,
right,

54
00:03:00.841 --> 00:03:04.830
and you're whooping my ass,
nine 10 1112 areas,
first day,

55
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.960
what do we do there it is right?
It's a good no,
it's a real good point,
dude.

56
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.270
It's a real good point.
But the idea is to see that didn't hurt.

57
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.960
He was on wobbled.
He was already tired.
Dude,
look how wobbly he is already there.

58
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.170
How about the kicks by fucking Whitaker tickers?
So good dude.

59
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.950
And the fact that he fought that fight,
most of it with a fucking broken hand.

60
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.550
He's even with one's brown and being with one,
like the first fight.
Come on now.

61
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:31.090
He's phenomenal.
He through that hand to even went,
oh look,

62
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.400
he got in trouble for sure couple times.

63
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.370
I had one round of 10 eights that'd be a draw.
See this right here.

64
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.800
This is a ten eight man.
This is a ten eight again,

65
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:40.750
even if you give a ten eight it's still,
it should be a draw.

66
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:45.040
Then maybe he wouldn't win the fight.
He would draw.

67
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.210
Two guys are fighting.
It's a close round,
but one guy drops the route,
drops him.

68
00:03:49.211 --> 00:03:52.390
It has him hurt.
They're like everything up until that moment,
his close,

69
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.430
I think that's still a ten eight gs and toss and ten eight 10 eights.

70
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.790
It's gotta be the differences.
Someone almost got finished.

71
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.690
This is an almost got finished moment.
The legs go,
the person falls,

72
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:07.060
the guy gets on top,
guards pounded them to see,

73
00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:09.820
I don't have a problem with ten nine nine I think has to be a clear fucking

74
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.500
bully beat down for ten eight I think that should be a ten seven I think we

75
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:18.040
should make the shit make sense.
Game.
I've been fighting,
fighting 10 set.

76
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.930
You gotta stop,
Bro.
I really feel like this,
this scorecard,
this,

77
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:27.670
this 10 point must system is silly.
The whole thing is silly.
The judging,

78
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.180
but the silliness.
Yeah,
you're right.
We've been,
we've kicked that fucking whore.

79
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.910
The numbers.
Like why do we need 10 points?

80
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:35.950
Just because boxing always had 10 points there.

81
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.890
You don't want to use in their hands.
They're not even using their elbows.

82
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.620
You know?
Just think about all the different things.
Like how,

83
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.820
what Swarthmore is a jab worth more than an elbow.
Yeah.

84
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.890
What's worth more a guillotine choke that you get out of how much?

85
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.460
How many points do you get for that?
I've got to figure that out,
man.
