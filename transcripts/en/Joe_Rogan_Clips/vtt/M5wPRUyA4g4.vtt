1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.830
Yeah.
There was like a lead XC.
Yeah.
And then,

2
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:09.600
um,
you know,
and strike force,
those were two legit venues outside the UFC.

3
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:13.990
That really kind of,
because the UFC wasn't as big back then.
Right.

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.670
And then they,
they were pretty legit.
There were more men.
You could get it.

5
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:20.240
You didn't have to pay per view it.
Right.
You could actually just watch him,

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.380
which is what Bella has going for it too.

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.590
But now Bella Torres on that new thing does zone DAZN do you know what that is?

8
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.230
What they're doing is they're splitting,
it's like a streaming service.

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.750
They're splitting half the half the fights.
Uh,

10
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.480
Bella tore on paramount,
which is used to be spike paramount.

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.220
Half the fights on this DAZN network.

12
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.760
But what's crazy is the DAZN network just gave Canelo Alvarez $365 million.

13
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.230
They just gave him this giant deal because they had were fighters.

14
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.150
No Canelo just one.
You just beat triple g unconcerned about boxing.

15
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.920
You know what I'm saying?
I have blocks.
You know what?
I fully left it.

16
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.850
We went to your place once.
Your old house,
maybe you,

17
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.120
I don't know,
maybe a couple other people.

18
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.480
We were watching some pride stuff that you DVR,
right.

19
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.020
And it cut off the last fight cause it went long.
Oh that's right.

20
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:16.770
And then we watched boxing kickboxing.
And after watching two hours of MMA,

21
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.380
you see a guy get knocked down and they're just like,
go to work at a word.

22
00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:21.360
Let them get up.
You're like,
what the fuck is this?

23
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.460
So much hugging and fucking boxing socks.

24
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.120
It's great if you watch really good boxers and if you'd know you're going to go

25
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:34.260
see boxing Canelo Alvarez fight.
That happened a couple of weeks ago.

26
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:38.780
It was a really good fight.
It was a really good fight.
I thought triple G ma.

27
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.980
Well I thought it was a real close fight,

28
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:41.940
but if I was going to give it to someone,

29
00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:45.930
I think I would've given it to triple j but it was close enough where you can
go,

30
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:49.050
okay,
this isn't a robbery but good fight.

31
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.070
We need decisions but leg kicks and and and take downs.

32
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:56.520
And it just makes fighting more interest as I was just way too many fucking,

33
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.790
let's see what the judges said.
No one.
So nobody really one.

34
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.220
They just got just did better.
Yeah.
Beto Guy.
Right?
Rare.
I mean,
it happens,

35
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:09.840
but rarely it happens less.
Yeah.
The thing about Pacquiao,
Mayweather was like,

36
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.730
Amica kept fighting,
right.
So what have we decided?
Right,
right,
right.
Yeah.

37
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:17.310
After 12 rounds,
they could've gone 12 I like the early pride,

38
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.650
like the early UFC with like hoist.
It's like,
yeah,

39
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.560
you're gonna find me for 35 minutes.
Right.
And then we'll see.

40
00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:26.370
Eventually I'll fucking wear you down.
Yeah.
That's what Nate always says.

41
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:30.270
Like if this was war,
you'd be dead.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like I choked her out.

42
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:33.030
That means I would have kept choking you.
Yeah.
And then just put a fucking,

43
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.260
you know,
twisted your neck.
Yeah.
