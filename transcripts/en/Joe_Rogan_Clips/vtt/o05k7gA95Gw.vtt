WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
That shit crazy.
I actually say that on his album.

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.990
He just say I'm bat shit crazy or than Yay and Sarah Pailin.
Oh,
look at this.

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.130
Yeah,
that's a real thing.
Oh good Lord.
That's a real thing.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.160
So one side has a t shirt and then the other thing is sewn to the front,

5
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.080
but like it doesn't even,
it looks like it's hanging there.

6
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.740
It is just hanging there.
But it doesn't even look like you're wearing it.

7
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.580
It looks like it's so the point of your shirt,
oh,
what?

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.400
Hold on.
Go back to that price.

9
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.460
$1,300 one worse than the tee shirt.
Buy One right now.

10
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.750
Oh my God.
$1,300.
Wow for that.

11
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.470
Do you see Kanye jumped on a table at a university,

12
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.420
was talking about leaving Ilan Musk alone at dues.
Lost his mind,
man.

13
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.150
What's going on?
I don't know man.
You know,

14
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.640
there's a lot of people that speculate and that's all I would say.

15
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.060
This is from me.
Ever since that man's mother died,

16
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:01.070
he's been on a downward spiral,
like losing his shit.
Well,
uh,
you know,

17
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.410
I think he's suffering from some serious like no bullshit.

18
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.790
He did get into a serious car accident,
right?

19
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.110
Broke his jaw before the series a few years before.

20
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.810
That is not a joke.
No.
Like brain trauma and you listen,

21
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:19.320
I'm not a doctor or anything even remotely related to one,

22
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.900
but I've been around a lot of people who've been hit in the head a lot.

23
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.430
That shit's real like that.
That will change your brain chemistry.

24
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.820
It's 100% legit like getting hit in the head is no Bueno and car accidents will

25
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:36.300
fuck people up forever.
Some people,
some people are okay,
they get,
they recover.

26
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.291
Boy,

27
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:40.800
there was a lot of people that come back for some significant head trauma and

28
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:45.120
just they're scrambled man and he might be one of those and it also might be

29
00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:47.100
what I talked about in my last special triggered,

30
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.920
but you live with crazy bitches long enough to,
I remember something happens,

31
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.890
you were talking about the soul stealing suck.
You buy it.

32
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.650
It might be true to those,
an amazing routine.

33
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.930
I got to tell you while I was trying to figure out a way that I get away with

34
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:06.310
making fun of Bruce Jenner without being called transphobic,

35
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.710
I had to go a circuitous route.
It was brilliant.

36
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.870
Go along route two.
First Time I,
yeah,

37
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.690
I had to drag Kanye and that too because this dude,

38
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.230
every book in the mail that's gone into this circle and two,

39
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:25.640
we lost a mall.
It's spooky.
Yeah,
they are.

40
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.880
Them was like a world champion.
Yes.
Good pull up layer dude.

41
00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:32.730
And he just got cracked out Bush.
What happened to him?

42
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:36.060
Reggie Bush got wise and fucking failed.

43
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.310
He's got my old car.
He,
Reggie Bush has my 1970 Barracuda.

44
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.690
Is that right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

45
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:46.440
I sold it to this other dude and this other dude told it to Reggie and he drives

46
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:49.780
around that car.
It's a dope car and he's a dope car,
you know,

47
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.590
so he's got some taste.
You have any got wise,

48
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:55.710
weird things are going on over there,
man.
Smashed and bolted.

49
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.450
That's how you do it.
And he's,

50
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.160
he smashed before the fake ass came into the picture too.

51
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.970
That's another phenomenon.
I don't even understand diaper,

52
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:07.930
but it does is why I'd like a nice round,
but

53
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.080
here's my car.
There's a Reggie Bush driving it.
It was not my card says,
now

54
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.060
look at that Reggie.
Glorious Bastard.
You had her first.

55
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.760
Yeah,
I'm not a really good car.
Really good card.

56
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.240
Look at how to get rid of it.
Oh yeah,
that's the Ray j song.
Right?

57
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.800
You window right there you go.
Full Circle.

58
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.110
You wouldn't want to take second place to read.
You pushed to,

59
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:42.220
that guy is built like a brick shit house.
You know he was smashing that right.

60
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:46.090
Whatever he damage he did to that,
he probably was like a car accident.

61
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.710
Maybe all that fake ass shit came after him.
You get hit by that dude I read.

62
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:54.550
She used to wake up before him and get hot towels ready and put his toothpaste

63
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:58.410
on his toothbrush.
Smart.
Yeah.
Treat him like a king.
Hey,

64
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.370
probably just smashed it.
She's put all day.
Just delirious.

65
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.330
Just from all the orgasms.
Just walking around,
bumping into walls and shit.

66
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.510
There's a picture of him and her by the pool and you'd look at him when you go,

67
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.890
that guy must be just smashing that he's a super athlete.

68
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.730
I mean that guy is built like a fucking superhero.
All of them.

69
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.540
That's all they really date.
Yeah,
right.
For the most part.
Yeah.

70
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.830
Except Kanye.
Yeah.
She needed to settle down.

71
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.090
Catch a brain behind a a basketball player too.
Right,
right,
right layer.

72
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:36.280
Do the dude who was on the show all the time,

73
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.480
that guy was on the show all the time.
Crazy living.

74
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.990
I can't even see living your life like out there and fucking public.

75
00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:46.780
Just every fucking pity or business.
Oh,
that would be a nightmare to me.

76
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.160
Well it's also not interesting but yet edited so well that you,

77
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.290
you just go slack jaw and you just watch.

78
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.550
It's just the switch from one scene to another quick enough so that you keep

79
00:04:57.551 --> 00:05:00.250
watching it and when it's over nothing happened.
Nothing.
And you're like,

80
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:02.290
what the fuck did I do with my hour?

81
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.090
You gave it to them and they advertised like 18 and products that they got paid

82
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:10.390
for it.
And they made a fucking ass load of money.

83
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:13.590
When you find out how much that family has made,
you just go,
wait,
wait,
wait.
Why?

84
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.950
It's amazing.
Yeah.
I can't,

85
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:22.000
can't hate can hate you should make fun.
Make Fun all day.

86
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.940
Make Fun all days.
That's it.
That's our God given.

87
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:28.660
Right when you get that much money.
If I get that much money,

88
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.410
I can't even get mad.
No matter how much fun you make it with me.

89
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.780
No matter what I do,
I could be a saint.

90
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:38.440
You still can make fun of me cause I got that much money.
Nobody.

91
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.930
That's just the way it goes.
And you are,

92
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.870
I mean you want to talk about someone out there.

93
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.010
Those fucking people are out there.
They got everything out there.

94
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.090
They're living like performance art.

95
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.450
I like living in a giant glass house on a pedestal in the middle of the city.

96
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.040
We're almost,
that's where all that from though.
I was like,

97
00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:02.390
you know the fake ass as a nod.
You gotta just keep the spectacle alive almost.

98
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:06.890
You know what I mean?
If it's not a spectacle,
it's not interesting.

99
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.330
If it's not an absolute spectacle to the vision,
your,

100
00:06:12.331 --> 00:06:16.440
your brain will catch onto the,
my favorite word fuckery.
Yeah.
