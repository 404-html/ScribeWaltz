00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.990
Failing was the best thing that ever happened to me for,

2
00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:05.480
I think for everybody failed.

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.760
Not because some people get stuck at their failure and they become bitter and

4
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:12.710
they become envious.
They become hateful,
at least how to mock they.
They can.

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:13.411
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

6
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:18.411
But failure can be one of the best things that ever happened to failing and

7
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:20.760
having to learn to become a business person.

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.700
I'm very thankful for removed from the failure.

9
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:26.790
Now don't you think that about your rap career as well?
Like that's what I saw.

10
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.590
Oh,
from business perspective as well.
From [inaudible] at rat first,
not,
not,

11
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.380
I was a good rapper,
but outcast Tacoma and I records my,
my,

12
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.870
my first record went gold at a time where we read the record was going 10

13
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.810
million.
It was a fee.
It didn't work.
Right.
It didn't work for me.

14
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.920
So I had to go to Texas and people like chameleon,
Aaron Paul Wall,
um,

15
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.300
Bun B,
zero slim thug Trae to truth,
right?

16
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.430
People like flip and hump.
These people taught me how to press up my own cds,

17
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.450
put them in the marketplace,
sell them at profit,
reinvest themselves.

18
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.440
They taught me that and selling drugs,
you know,
in a drought.

19
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.520
They taught me to rudimentary fundamentals of business and when I met my wife,

20
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.020
I can remember date and two,
three,

21
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:14.140
four or five little hot chicks and her just mentally being,
you know,

22
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.230
my wife caught her,
right.
Right.
Freshman Year of college.

23
00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:20.610
But just mentally she was light years ahead of everyone because the grandmother

24
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:23.690
had raised her in that way.
Grandmother had a shot house.
Right.
You know,

25
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:26.110
I ran a sh or like a Chitlin circuit.
You Go,

26
00:01:26.111 --> 00:01:29.220
got to get a shot for $2 on Sundays because the south has,
you know,

27
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:32.850
it's a weird place we didn't use to sell how call on Sunday.
So my wife,

28
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:35.160
I recognize how to sharper mind and me for business.

29
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:38.730
What I had was good ideas for what would sale or what would be well in the

30
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.550
marketplace and what she had was a discipline to Oregon.

31
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.090
Have any failures in your business practice or jam?
At first few years,

32
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:45.811
I had a barber shop.

33
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:50.700
I wanted to kill every Barbara barbers are like independent rappers,
you know,

34
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:54.750
everyone wants to be more famous than they need to be.
An artist.

35
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.530
Barbers want to be famous.
Yeah.
Barbara's life via famous.
I mean there are local,

36
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.180
yeah,
the artists.
Absolutely.
And they should be,
you know what I mean?
But um,

37
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.660
with the essay,
it,
man,
it just frustrating,
you know,

38
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.580
when Barbara comes in one day like I want to wear a glitter Cape today.

39
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.880
The next part was coming and like,
yeah,
I want,
if I want to cut hair in the nude,

40
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:14.640
I don't want to use your shot to do it.
And you're like,
Bro,
it doesn't,

41
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.230
it doesn't work like that.
Like this is the right.

42
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.480
But I had to learn for us that the booth rent model,

43
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.960
like you pay in booth renting us not making any more profit that doesn't knit.

44
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:28.250
So we had to kind of say,
well,
what is super cuts do?
What does great clips too?

45
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.170
Oh,
you wanted it by commission and then you split.

46
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.020
That means they have to beat it.
And no way.

47
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.430
And that's how we kinda learned business.

48
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:39.960
When we got an offer from the hawks to put our place in the space of the arena

49
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:43.350
and we want to be a more arenas,
we started to understand,
okay,

50
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:47.700
this is how you do business business.
You know,
this is not just how you,

51
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.361
you know,

52
00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:52.080
make two to $4,000 extra a month and that's just some good income for your wife

53
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.140
to be able to enjoy it.
But this is how you start to say,
you know,

54
00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:56.640
more than the bright barbershop.

55
00:02:56.641 --> 00:02:59.860
This is a lifestyle and retail brand and we happened to Barbara.

56
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.400
But if you're a guy,
I don't like going to the beauty shops or beauty,
um,

57
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.290
stores to buy my brushes or by my combs or you know,

58
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:10.360
if you want to get a little gray out,
if your beard,
you know,

59
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:14.680
you don't want to be in the RAF section of your local Walmart or you're like,

60
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:16.240
hey,
where do I get the grade for my beer?

61
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:19.540
Cause I want to go get hot young chicks.
You know,
you want to go into a shop.

62
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:22.660
And so we develop products,
we have cool stuff.
You can just buy it right there.

63
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.350
And we've learning to be business people and hopefully I would like to become

64
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:27.490
the chick filet of barber shops.

65
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:31.030
I like for people to want to want to have us in their town and pay us a lot of

66
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:33.360
money to come.
Well it's a man's hangout too.

67
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.300
And then you can say anything you want and no one judges,
you can tall,

68
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.010
you can watch the Joe Rogan Talk Shit,
you know?
Yeah.

69
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.800
Barbershops are uniquely masculine.
They are like beauty shops are for girls.

70
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:46.990
Girls can go into a beauty shop and get their nails done and no,

71
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:49.840
there's not going to be any man there.
They can talk all kinds of crazy shit.

72
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.060
Yeah.
That's one of the reasons why they like it.
Yep.
And,

73
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.330
and the women that do come to barbershops are some of the best shit talkers.

74
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.680
So even they fit in.
