Proudest was like,

5
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.030
Rolex is always killing it.
This is never going to go and it never goes anywhere.

6
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.140
You got I up Rolex and you're a rapper.

Yeah.
Yeah,

7
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.580
Always but is classic.
But if you're like a Floyd Mayweather,

8
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:36.780
you gotta take it to a two level.
Tom Can Louie baton,

but where's the,

14
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.883
where's the,

15
00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.510

16
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:03.380

18
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:09.600
it's so preposterous starting from the beginning and play it.

19
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.940
He's so ridiculous.
He's got like 30 watches with it.

20
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:19.590
But you do it from the beginning.
What's that?
I can't start it over.

21
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.580
Okay,

Do you know the kind of security has to have you this,

22
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.280
but you know what?
You know what was crazy?

30 watches,

23
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.320
10 more days.

Jesus Christ.

24
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.620

25
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.830
If I want to bring up the one and only you're not bringing out the Washington

26
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:42.720

27
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.280
That's so preposterous.

28
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.070
$18 million on her wrist.
That's insane.
Plus the press play Jamie.
I said,

29
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.790

30
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.270
Hey today I'm gonna go fuck off $50,000 cause I ain't got shit else to do.

31
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.600
You mother fuckers moneymate Oh all motherfucking day.

32
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.910
The that's ridiculous.

33
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.390
Crazy million dollar watch 50 cent or is that an act?
It's a good question.

34
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.820
That's a real thing.
I think they're really mad at each other.
Yeah.
I don't think,

35
00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:16.590
it seems like the 50 cent and a lot of people get in and a little scraps.

36
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.540
Yeah.
I don't know.
Florida gets them scraps.
Well,
you know,
I mean,

37
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:24.180
when you act like that,
that's his,
this whole thing.
I hate you.

38
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.790
But the problem is like,
Adrian Broner tries to doing the same thing,

39
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:30.290
but he doesn't win.
So it's tough.
You know his,
his club is,

40
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.940
I think his slogans about billions.

41
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.380
He's ruined boner ab about billions stuff.
It's a tough sell.

42
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.230
Well,
if he was lighting everybody up on fire,
sorry,
little shit.

43
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.660
But Jamie's mixing it up.
Shit,
I DJ Jv.

44
00:02:48.661 --> 00:02:52.760
