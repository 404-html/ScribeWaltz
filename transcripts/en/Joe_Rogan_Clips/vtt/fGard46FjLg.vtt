1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
What is the attitude in Mexico?

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.340
A special amongst people who are studying the narco wars with all this,

3
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:12.480
uh,
build that wall stuff,
all this,
uh,
what's going on in America?

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.810
There's this,
this is very strange,
right?

5
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:19.620
Versus left polarization over here about whether or not this should be a wall

6
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:21.210
between the United States and Mexico.

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.640
<v 1>Sure.
I mean,
well,</v>

8
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:27.390
I mean the thing live Mexicans obviously very anti-Trump in Mexico.

9
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.530
It's innate farm and I try and be very unpopular from the very beginning when he

10
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:37.290
said,
I know they are rapists and murderers.
Yeah.
Someone's doing the raping.
Yeah.

11
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.440
How many,
he's kind of j nine.
If you look at surveys,
the,
the,

12
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:44.400
the level is very low.
This is there anybody like me,
Trump and Mexico is there,

13
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:48.690
like there's always contrarians,
ca.
I mean,
I've seen numbers like this,
you know,

14
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:53.040
people will say like 80% or something.
I think he's terrible.

15
00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:55.050
Sent means they must be at 20%.
I might have done,

16
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.540
I haven't met a Mexican who's been like pro Trump and I never have.

17
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.400
I met Salvador who was pro Trump one time and the,

18
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.910
he hit a guy being deported and he was like,
I know you'll get,
you know,
this guy,

19
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:12.660
Trump's going to turn out to be a great president.
So,
so I see that.
But you know,

20
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.280
Mexico's very,
very anti-Trump in terms of the wall.

21
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.650
I mean,
there's,
you know,
the terms of what,

22
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.113
<v 2>uh,</v>

23
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.650
<v 1>tempted the smugglers.</v>

24
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.660
Mom was talking to a smuggler in Nogales about this and he was describing he,

25
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.190
he'd smile.
He was from Nogales,
from a neighborhood called Buenos Aires,

26
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.530
which is right on the border with the United States.
He knows,
no,

27
00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:41.230
God is Sonora Nogales,
Arizona.
So in the goddess inorganic growth,

28
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.150
Arizona.
And he was from the neighborhood right on the border there.

29
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.790
And he described the,

30
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:52.580
he first took people over the border of the United States back in the 1980s when

31
00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:54.110
he was at school.
Is it high school?

32
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.500
And the reason was that that time is just an old fence.

33
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.140
And there was a hole in the fence.
They used to go through,

34
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.230
enter United States and go back into Mexico to send old wire fence.

35
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.750
And the first time he took people through people to rive from southern Mexico

36
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.300
saying,
how do we get to the US?
And he'd say,
Oh,
you know,
this way.

37
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.041
And they give them a tip.

38
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:16.810
He said the first time he got the equivalent of about 50 cents was what he made

39
00:02:16.811 --> 00:02:20.600
to take people to the United States 50 cents.
Nowadays,

40
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.200
the cost of going into the u s is $5,000.

41
00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:27.050
That's what you paid to go legally to the United States.
5,000 bucks.

42
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.731
So we were saying,
wow,

43
00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:32.090
look at that increase every time that the u s puts more security,

44
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.840
it means is more expensive.
When it's more expensive,

45
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:38.150
that means more money going to criminals,

46
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.670
which means there's now an industry doing it.

47
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:45.671
So now the cartels make a big percentage of that money of human smuggling into

48
00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:51.290
the u s um,
by luck in terms of the wall,
I mean the,
uh,

49
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.980
wait,
when Trump first came in,
he had the line that Mexico's going to pay for it.

50
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.090
Yeah.
And,
and then it,
this kind of line,
you know,
right.
The beginning,
he came,

51
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.690
you know,
he threatened Mexican president saying,
if you,

52
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:07.630
if you don't agree to pay for the wall and why are you going to come and meet
me?

53
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.820
And then it was like,
wow,

54
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:14.260
he's really gonna try to shake down in Mexico for like billions of dollars.

55
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:16.700
Is He really gonna try and do that?
Uh,

56
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.310
and that was kind of scary moment then I think from the point of view of Mexico,

57
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:22.460
when he first got to power lie,

58
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.050
he's going to do that and then he's going to deport 3 million and he's going to,

59
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:28.420
you know,
he's going to kill Nafta.

60
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.440
Actually those things haven't really come to pass.
Actually,

61
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:35.710
if you look over the last couple of years of Trump hasn't really hit Mexico very

62
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:36.544
hard.

63
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.780
So the concern was that he was going to take money that should be allocated to

64
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:41.740
other ways.

65
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:44.830
It's going to help Mexico and he was going to try to take that and use it to

66
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:48.750
build the wall.
I mean,
no one really knew when he first came and he's like,
oh,

67
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.800
Mexico's going to pay for this wall.
Where's the wall?

68
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:53.920
Just got 10 foot higher remembering that yeah,
it was light and his light in a,

69
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.940
how are you going to do that?
You're gonna,

70
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:58.000
you're gonna start threatening Mexican militarily and say,
give us money.
I mean,

71
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:00.580
it was kind of like,
uh,
like is it,
is it a shakedown?

72
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.750
Cause the shake down was kind of,

73
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:04.990
it was kind of a crazy diplomatic thing when he first got it.

74
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:08.320
So that was kind of scary for a moment,
for an a point of view of Mexico.

75
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.630
But I think after you look at the last couple of years,
yes,

76
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:14.230
I'm really hit Mexico with that navy.
He wants to build the wall.

77
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.710
And obviously there's a,
there's the big fast in terms of the spending here,

78
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.230
but if he wants to build it,
uh,
or Extendix,

79
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:26.680
there is warden sections of the border already.
If he wants to extend it,

80
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.990
you know,
it won't stop a lot of the hard drugs.
Uh,

81
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.090
I mean if you look at heroin,
cocaine,
crystal Meth,
high value drugs,

82
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.920
they normally go through the ports of entry,
right?
So shipping.
Yeah,

83
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.550
I mean they go oh,
or through the,
through the ports of entry through liker.

84
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:47.020
I mean you have a through in cars,
right?
Cars,
trucks.
I mean you,

85
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:51.070
you go through,
if you look at the Laredo,
Laredo,
Laredo,

86
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.700
one of the reasons that was a big fight in the war started there in Mexico.

87
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.290
Cause that's very valuable territory.

88
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.000
There's something like 8,000 trucks go over that border every day.

89
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.310
Now if you have 8,000 trucks,
how many of those can you search in a day?

90
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.730
And also the way they could hide this stuff in trucks,

91
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:13.630
they can hide drugs in like a metal.

92
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.950
They can put them in,
in,
in some kind of metal container.
Seal it up,

93
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.650
soldier it up,
put a bunch of stuff so it doesn't smell.
So somebody has to sell.

94
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:24.650
I'm going to open that with a blowtorch and researching.

95
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.540
I have after rip that vehicle apart to find the drugs,

96
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.280
they were putting them inside wheels.
Yay.
Yay.

97
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.410
And that's like inside ties and some stuff that's like,
I saw the,

98
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.540
that's like there's song,
there's a,

99
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:39.820
is it that's one of the older tricks from your,
like the 70,

100
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.180
there's a song that is uh,
one of the first narco corridos their drug ballots.
Um,

101
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.591
Eh,

102
00:05:44.591 --> 00:05:49.540
it was called contraband and trend treason for the 1970s.

103
00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:54.160
And that was about hiring,
uh,
hiding marijuana back in the nine tires back then.

104
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:56.950
But yeah,
man,
now the trap cars now like super sophisticated,

105
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.370
they have some weird trap cars.

106
00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:03.210
We have to do like a bunch of stuff like open the door,
move some staff to,

107
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.050
to actually to actually open finance drugs.

108
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.640
Others like some trick sort of door has to be active with.
Yeah,

109
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:14.030
I would imagine if there's a will,
there's a way.
And this is that much.
I mean,

110
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:17.270
I remember hearing that from,
I mean,
it's not a reliable source,

111
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:20.780
but from the soprano's they were talking about only 20% of all the shipping

112
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:24.290
containers they get brought into America gets searched.
Yeah.
Well that's,

113
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.270
that's crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah,
absolutely.
So,
so,
so to the,

114
00:06:27.271 --> 00:06:30.110
the hard drugs have learned a lot of time on through the,
the,

115
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.830
the ports of entry and,
and they had their,
they,

116
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.380
another classic trick they have is you get,
they allow some to get busted.

117
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.000
It's your allow one guy to get busted.
Um,
they set somebody up,

118
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.100
so they're taking some drugs through,
they get,

119
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:47.030
they get busted or the f entities on them and then meet me while more drugs are

120
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:51.430
going through.
And is this the United States border?
That's test,

121
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.400
that's catching this guy.
Yeah.
So they're not getting,

122
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.340
they're not getting tested in Mexico as they crossover,
right.

123
00:06:58.341 --> 00:07:00.380
It's only in the United States border.
Yeah.
Some,

124
00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:03.470
sometimes they might catch him in Mexico sometimes,

125
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:05.060
but the majority is gonna be the United States.

126
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.430
So the United States border patrol guys,
are they ever caught being corrupt?
Yeah,

127
00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:13.330
absolutely.
Yeah.
There's been cases of us,
uh,

128
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.640
border patrol and customs entry,

129
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:21.230
people who have been,
yeah.
Caught taking a bunch of money,
taking bribes,

130
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:24.590
allowing in our land,
certain cars through that course Sandvik was through.

131
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:25.070
So yeah.
