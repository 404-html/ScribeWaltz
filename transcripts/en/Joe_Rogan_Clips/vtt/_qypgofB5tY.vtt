WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.710
When you were here.
They used to say,

2
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.050
who was that?
Diana Ross.
Who's things all Paul Mccartney and wings mother Fucker,

3
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.620
Bruh.
That was from James Bond's too.
Oh,
that's right.

4
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.360
That's right.
Guns and roses.

5
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.870
I was one time where the fucking remake is so good.

6
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.570
That was you kind of what's in their own song

7
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.040
where he only,

8
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.020
we hear it has actually been on your podcast show.
No,

9
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:43.900
I definitely have him on man.
Wow.
I definitely have that going on.

10
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.600
I can't imagine.
Seems to have come back from the brink.
Yeah,
right.
Yeah.

11
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.080
Who knows what kind of ego happened and what all happened whenever they went

12
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:53.910
gimme some volume so I can hear it.

13
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:57.810
At least I want to hear him say that to be any posture where we go.
Here we go.

14
00:00:57.811 --> 00:01:01.130
Here we go.
Yeah,

15
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.530
look out.
So he was for years,
he went crazy.

16
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.970
Yeah.
Vanished was trying to make that one album forever.
Right.

17
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.390
Took many,
many years.
And everybody's like,
God damn an axl rose went crazy.

18
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.020
I need to see him.
He like Dan was a shame.
Guns and roses was so good.
So good.

19
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.100
And then slowly but surely he fucking came back.

20
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.940
Like really came back like he's fucking back like that dude tours with ACDC now.

21
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.390
Yeah.
I mean he crushes it.
I saw some videos of him on stage.

22
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:35.460
He's a fucking animal again.
He looks like a heart.

23
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:37.380
A little bit like one of the people from heart buddy.

24
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.220
But that's just age and time,
you know?
Oh,
I don't think it's agent time.

25
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.700
I think there's a lot of other ingredients could be shrunk down to throw some

26
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:47.830
shit on to that mix will solve what?
Shrimp and writers,

27
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.930
but just slash looks the same.
A slash looks the same,
but that's what I'm saying.

28
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.220
They're both the same age.

29
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.870
You started out together or close to the same age at least.
Dude,

30
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.350
how much fun must that be?
It I think it's too much fun.

31
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.580
This is my theory.

32
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.110
I think it's too much fun and I think they don't even have to write new shit so

33
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:10.020
because they don't have to write new shit and it's too much fun.

34
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.850
They're out there just fucking smashing every night.

35
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.000
Fucking smashing,
smashing shows,

36
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.060
smashing tour buses and hotel raking and just smashing each other pussy just

37
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:26.930
smashing.
They probably crazy.

38
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.820
You probably won't even notice if you fuck a dude if you're that famous break,

39
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.080
you notice.
I think you're wrong.
I begged to differ.
Oh he's got a teleprompter.

40
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.320
What about a fast dude?
Cause you know axl rose at a teleprompter.

41
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.050
But yes,
you want that.
If you're on all the drugs and all the junk.

42
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:44.580
Not only do I want a teleprompter,

43
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:46.950
I want it to be highlighted what I'm supposed to say.

44
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.750
I mean he's wearing hot pants.

45
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.010
He is so close.

46
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.830
He's very hot pants with a high cowboy boots with socks

47
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.210
and a mesh top and tidy.

48
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:05.650
Whities so what is it that makes somebody so famous that they get close to being

49
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:08.770
almost like a it bisexual?
What you think?

50
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.850
Did you keep bringing up all this gay stuff?
Tell me was your stepdad right?

51
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.680
No Bro.
I've never been gay man.
Never ever.
No.
Never.
Ever,
ever,

52
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.940
ever.
I mean maybe when I'm 60 or 70,
I'll bust out,
you know,

53
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.330
I'll come on somebody,
but I'm not doing anything now.
Gay.

54
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.790
I want a family and everything.
I think there are,

55
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:32.620
so for re with their expression right that they wear whatever the fuck they

56
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:32.980
want.

57
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.980
And I think that's a part of the culture of really huge musicians is that they

58
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:42.610
get very free with the looks.
There's sexuality,
like look at him with his,

59
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.710
with his ripped up pants.

60
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.540
Axl rose backward is a cutie pie or David Bowie.
David Bowie,

61
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:53.740
when he was in his androgynous state of Prince.
Uh,

62
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:58.510
I mean you can go on and on and on about men look fucking Mick Jagger.

63
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.740
Mick Jagger would swing his hips.
Yeah.
Puff his lips as well.

64
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:05.590
Elvis is will stay pretty straight manly thing.

65
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.340
Women's clothing and women's like,
you know,
stuff from like,

66
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.510
he wore stuff from like scarves and shows that what you're saying?
No.

67
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:16.720
What's that women's clothing store that's in every like little stories.
Secrets?

68
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.990
No,
it's for like kind of more,
you know,
Lane Bryant.
Oh,

69
00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:23.020
we're the big fat lady stuff.
Well,
I mean it's,
I mean what you're saying,

70
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.710
dude,
closed door for fat guys.
Big and tall.
They call it,
but that's like,

71
00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:32.760
some of them are.
It's called the j bond.
It's over there on Pico Boulevard.

72
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.310
He'd been there.
J Anthony always sells those suits over there on stage.

73
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.020
What's up?
Oh,
there he is.
Is that him now?
That's him.

74
00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:48.670
That could be the lady is Sheryl Swoopes.
No,
he's a,
he's a,

75
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.430
that's his sister.
Looks Weird like that.

76
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.360
It's like you went to spring break,
but that's axle from younger days,

77
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.010
so that's when he advantaged for awhile.
Right.
Oh,

78
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.910
but when he did that,
like he did a big concert in Brazil too,
right?
Yeah.

79
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.180
I remember listening to that and it's,

80
00:05:08.181 --> 00:05:11.760
his voice was kind of struggling a little bit because he has such a script,

81
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.020
such a scratchy voice,
you know,

82
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.200
you've got to think like that voice is probably very difficult to maintain,

83
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.280
but that primal fucking wow
dude,

84
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.390
that was the shit when I was,
that was like,

85
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.010
right when I was graduating high school.

86
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:29.770
I remember I worked out this shitty little gym and I'd be on the leg press

87
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:33.340
machine.
Listen to welcome Janette.
What kind of headphones did you have?

88
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.560
A whatever.
They had the big ones out.
I had a Walkman with a cassette.

89
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.870
I might've been a disc player.
Well,
okay,
that one's ridiculous.
That one makes,

90
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.920
Oh,
who is that recent?
Is that Holly Hunter?
That's him now.
Yeah.
No,

91
00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:52.780
it's not Holly hunter.
You sound a bit trite.
You know Holly Harris,
lead singer,

92
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.020
guns and roses.
Oh,
I love guns and roses.
Did you call him?

93
00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:57.830
My brother and I used to beat each other in our room.

94
00:05:57.831 --> 00:06:01.430
We'd fist fight in the yard to fucking guns and roses,
Bro.
AC DC.

95
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.590
It was a music and my childhood was good.
Was was GNR Alice in chains.

96
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.530
That's a weird look.
The,
the,

97
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.460
the thermal of the flannel shirt tied around the waist.

98
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.420
What's that look
right,

99
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.970
but that's a weird look like on purpose as a weird look.
I said,
Darlene Conner,

100
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.200
Hey,
I know I'm not going to wear this flannel shirt,

101
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:29.040
but I'm going to tie it around my waist.
But Hey,
it's not really a skirt,
right?

102
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.010
It's just like an accoutrement to my outfit of fake ripped pants.
Yeah,

103
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.230
right.
That's a weird look.
Isn't it?
A weird look.

104
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.100
Would you think you'd rather have like a little skirt or like be naked?

105
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:45.100
You think skirt.
I don't want people judging me really.
I'm looking at my tickets.

106
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.280
Make me self conscious.

107
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.100
But what have you had like a little dick hide or like a little thing that you

108
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:52.220
could still did looked at.
How big is your dick hide or

109
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.360
you can't get new escape?

110
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.390
Would you ever wear a fake Dick so that people thought your Dick was bigger?

111
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.580
If I did,
it would be not worrying around my waist.
Talking to the front.

112
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.140
I'd have it tucked in my sock

113
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.770
and it would be green.
Like a dark green.
Like people would know.

114
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:20.600
It's fake though.
Kale.
He'll be like,
oh,
that guy's is fake,

115
00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:24.130
bro.
Why you looking at my deck?

116
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.050
Fuck away from my desk.
