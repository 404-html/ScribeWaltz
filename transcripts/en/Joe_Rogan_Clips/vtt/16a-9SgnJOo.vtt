1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
So when you look at that,
isn't that,
isn't that true?

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.150
We are overpopulated in some ways though with our technology.

3
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:09.230
But let me just make this point where we've got to this I gotta pee so bad.
What?

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.370
Go Go pee pee and come back home.
Finish five more minutes.
Cause I want to,

5
00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:15.820
I want to get into the top.
You talk to Eddie,
talk some sense into him.

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.720
Tell him about Buzz Aldrin telling me about boy buzz Aldrin.
You know,

7
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:25.950
I'll tell you about buzz off.
He told me Christ,
I know.

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.900
Where are you going back.
Okay.
It's going to be Brown.

9
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.330
Cleveland browns.com.
I'm not allowed
both leaf.

10
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.240
Jamie,
Eddie,
how you doing?
I'm doing good.
So,
um,

11
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.720
what do you,
what do you think about the wide receiver
of the browns?

12
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.150
I don't think we can turn the talk to Brown said no,
unfortunately is okay.

13
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.390
Is there any conspiracy theory that you kind of are suspicious of?

14
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.500
There's gotta be at least one.
I definitely
like nine 11,

15
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.050
nine 11.
You think?
You know,
are you familiar with tower seven?
Yeah,

16
00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:08.280
I would say from almost every story,

17
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:10.930
even though the stuff we've talked about before in the past,
I,

18
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.930
I don't believe the official and quotes.
Okay,
so you know,

19
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:19.560
the tower seven was the third tower that went down.
You're aware of that,
right?

20
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.170
I look more when,
when that comes up,
all of the surrounding information about,

21
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.490
uh,
what,
what wasn't in the buildings,
not the actual event.

22
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.730
I know the event happened.
I'm not,
I'm not so curious about that.

23
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.380
Did you see the video of tower seven fiscal free fall speed?

24
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.450
That's gotta be a little suspicious,
right?
Red Flag got to come up at least,

25
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:44.940
right.
If you're trying to,
if you're really trying to get to the truth,

26
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:46.110
you're like,
wait a minute.

27
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.200
I would say this more suspicious that a third building fell.
It wasn't,

28
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.270
it wasn't even a hit.
Exactly.

29
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.690
That's what the whole story is with tower seven and not only was it not touched

30
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:56.160
by a plane,

31
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.360
it went down at free fall speed and it's caught on video like five different

32
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:02.580
angles.
Right?
There's five different names.

33
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.100
No one's saying that it's fake footage.
That's tower seven to 47 storey,

34
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.910
skyscraper fucking fallen at free fall speed.
Some people are saying,

35
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:16.460
I got hit with a direct energy weapon.
Some people are saying that it was uh,

36
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.060
brought down like a controlled demo and like in Vegas,

37
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:25.650
like one of those buildings,
you know.
But regardless of how it was brought down,

38
00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:27.870
you got to look at that video footage to go,

39
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:31.470
wait a minute and why is youtube telling you now I'm building seven footage

40
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.030
footage.
Why did it go [inaudible] ready?

41
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.080
I don't like 50 stations in 2001 and I'm sitting there,

42
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.000
that's actually,
I was on 120 stations.

43
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.930
I lost like 70% of her saying that it was an inside job.

44
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.430
I don't mean the firemen blow it up.
I'm watching Fox News,

45
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.810
CNN at my shoes and then I go get a pizza at four o'clock.

46
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.090
Well CBS radio back then and they go,

47
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:04.240
Solomon Brothers building seven is going to be brought down to controlled

48
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:05.500
demolition to say their buildings.

49
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.050
So I go back on air and announce building savins being brought down to see what

50
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:14.500
their buildings and for five,
five years,
everyone goes,
I'm crazy.

51
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.680
Then CNN and all of them archive it on the Internet and everyone's watching

52
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:24.250
Golding.
Seventh on
BBC,

53
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.090
ABC.
Let me ask CNN,
do you think happened with tower seven?

54
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.430
She and and ABC and CBS told me the government blow it up,
the government,

55
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.550
I mean you play the clips.
They go,
because all I get back,

56
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:40.450
we're blowing it up and the media,
he goes,
oh,
you mean the cops blow it up?
No,

57
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.150
the cops are told,
get back on the countdown.

58
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.170
I interviewed with comms like Jen explained to me.

59
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:52.171
Do you think that they had detonation set up already in the buildings next Joe,

60
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.780
which I used to always like try to follow it down.
What it means.
I don't know.

61
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.400
I've learned to go,
Hey,
I've got five different newscast when it happened.

62
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:03.640
And before in saying they blew it up,
I don't know what happened.

63
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.760
Is it possible that it collapsed because of those gigantic diesel fires?

64
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.430
Right.

65
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.240
And then the way hour one to two sevens is on building seven seven had a deer.

66
00:04:14.241 --> 00:04:18.850
I had diesel tanks in the basement caught fire and they said it was an inferno

67
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.610
and they said it cooked through the nose.
Hold on a second.
It's always,

68
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.960
but I want to ask you this cause I don't know.
Oh yeah.
Right.

69
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.930
But they said that what happened was,

70
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.750
this is whoever the fuck explained it,

71
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.810
that was making these youtube videos that the fire had burnt through the

72
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:38.800
internal structure of the building.

73
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:42.700
It's such a high temperature that all of these floors,

74
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:47.000
how lax they pancaked and then it came.
But it never happened before.
Since right.

75
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.170
Never hasn't happened before.
Since that's a fact.
Here's,

76
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:54.340
here's the thing about those showns 18 years ago would argue every point and
say,

77
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:58.470
I knew what happened.
Okay.
The Alex Jones 2019 is honest.
Well,
I'm glad you're,

78
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.930
and I'm going to say I've seen him saying they blow it up and nobody can

79
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:04.840
describe it.
I don't know,
Joe,
what happened?
Right.
Well,

80
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:08.790
when you look at it the way it falls,
it falls exactly.
Looking controlled.

81
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.430
Demolition.
Exactly.
So it falls from the top down.

82
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.210
But if you actually want false peak,
right.
But if you watch the full video,

83
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.400
the center of it collapses.

84
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.160
Like there's a full video where you're looking at the top of the building and

85
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:24.460
the center of it collapses far before the outside does.
That's how they take,

86
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:29.230
they take out the elevator central thing first.
So do light up the Tuesday.

87
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.610
Do they do this with,
do they have it all set in advance?

88
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.990
So they knew that nine 11 was going to come and tutor.

89
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.840
She answered my question and please don't know.

90
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.950
And what they do is they take like some clip of me from 20 years ago or 18 years

91
00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:46.860
ago going here's CBS News and they don't show it.
I mean I've got,
yes,

92
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.820
I've got easy possible that even though operation Northwoods happen,

93
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.540
Gulf of Tonkin was a conspiracy.

94
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.570
Is it possible that the internal fires in that building were so unbelievably hot

95
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.780
that it fucked up every floor and they really did pancake on top of each other

96
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.320
and then the exterior structure just collapsed?
Is that possible?

97
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:09.710
Because I'm not an engineer.
I've had the engineer's say it's not,

98
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.040
it's not possible at all.
And it,
here's the problem with,

99
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.890
they announced it fell on its own footprint 27 minutes before it dead on five

100
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:23.780
channels.
Damn baby.
She world.
Is that true baby?

101
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:28.740
She,
Shannon,
Shannon and CBS.
Joe,

102
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.250
I'm a,
I keep food.
I do too.

103
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.270
It was four o'clock I've been on ever since that morning on syndicated radio.

104
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.990
I drove down to the local pizza place at four o'clock got my page that was

105
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:43.991
eating it in the car and our CBS radio driving home and they shed little pseudo

106
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:48.650
live in mood or say whether our buildings too controlled demolition and the

107
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:52.130
Solomon brothers in building seven by the way,
we have these clubs now,

108
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.510
but no one archive stuff that,
so I go on there and I go,
yeah,

109
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:59.330
they just blow up a building.
Everybody started freaking out,

110
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.250
but here's the thing.
And then they blew it up.

111
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.580
How long does it take to set up explosives to the point where you could paint?

112
00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:07.850
It normally takes a week.
A week.
That was the next story.

113
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.530
But then I interviewed,

114
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.920
<v 1>yeah,</v>

115
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.610
<v 0>the head of emergency management for Newark.
Yeah.</v>

116
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.040
And the loose change people got him on and he says,
no,
I was there.

117
00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:24.920
They had bombs.
The CIA,
you know what was patient building?
Seven right?

118
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.690
Villa,
the CIA,
the FBI,
all it was it NSA as well.

119
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.490
See,
he always says,
oh,
I don't know.
He goes to his ass.

120
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.540
He's beyond.
No,
it's bullshit,
man.

121
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.950
Every fucking thing.
Just fucking say to yourself.
No.

122
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.420
Once you explain it to everybody.
Oh,
you're on there too.

123
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.080
It's like you did a better job than 40 fucking stories are fucking government.

124
00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:58.090
Right.
So there's 40 with a diesel tank and pre rigged explosives in case shit.

125
00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.410
Dude.
Man didn't believe.

126
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:05.300
And even though I heard CBS say they blow it up and even though I like to do is

127
00:08:05.381 --> 00:08:08.710
we'll go,
Joe says firefighters blow it up because the government,
same thing.

128
00:08:08.711 --> 00:08:10.750
Point you made is a good point.
Like I'm setting the government.
No,

129
00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:13.120
I don't mean my grandpa was in the army.

130
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.750
If it really did pancake from the,
from the fire.

131
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.580
What a shit design.
Yeah.
What a terrible design be so mad at that.

132
00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:24.880
Architects were the banks from underwriting laboratories is everyone.

133
00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:28.480
I went and looked at the blueprint and into New York and I'm not defending what

134
00:08:28.481 --> 00:08:31.510
you're saying because seven was built well,
it was looked at by lawsuits.

135
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.660
There were sued tower one and two though they were built with like bubblegum and

136
00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:41.380
like bandaids.
Really?
Oh,
all those buildings were already leaning.
Oh No.

137
00:08:41.381 --> 00:08:45.130
It was a big mob scam.
Yeah,
I know.
They already had.

138
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.100
They already had buckling in the wind.
Oh No.
Mathematicians Gash.

139
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.190
That was in like five years.
One building would collapse.
Oh fuck.

140
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.570
Oh my God.
There goes your argument each New York,

141
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.830
these buildings are built for shit and that's when he,
as you get older,
you know

142
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.720
some of them were built for shit.
Right?
For sure.
Right.
I don't,
yeah,

143
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.260
I mean especially back then when what is inside your back heel?
More tobacco.

144
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.430
I do have more tobacco,
but I'm just,
Kevin was a little bit more tobacco.
Yes,

145
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:17.881
for sure.

146
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:22.881
100% you know who Dr. Judy Wood is a no,

147
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.450
I do know she's,
she's got Dr. Judy Wood.
It's wrote a book called,

148
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.980
where did the towers go?
Yeah,
particle her story.
Her theory is,

149
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.220
this is just,
this is just some lady scientists lady.

150
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:39.710
She said based on the fact that there was this,

151
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:44.730
what she claims based on the video and the pictures that she has of,

152
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.650
uh,
where the towers collapsed.
She that her speaking for me,
sorry,

153
00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:53.420
she's saying that there was no rubble.
The book,
the name of the book is called,

154
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.510
where did the towers go?
She said that direct energy weapons,

155
00:09:57.511 --> 00:10:02.160
some kind of direct energy weapons justify the building's turn the buildings to

156
00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:06.450
dusk because there was no rubble.
A dude gave me a book on that.
Let me see,
man,

157
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:11.430
you can't read this.
He's like,
no,
no.
He's in America and this gives in La.

158
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:14.940
He told me,
uh,
they use Tesla technology.
I was like,
what?

159
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.990
He can say,
you're Rog,
ask that question.
You know what?
For me,

160
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:22.410
it doesn't matter if it was dust the fied or they buttering them up in Las
Vegas,

161
00:10:22.411 --> 00:10:26.040
style matters.
Here's those buildings,
in my opinion.
