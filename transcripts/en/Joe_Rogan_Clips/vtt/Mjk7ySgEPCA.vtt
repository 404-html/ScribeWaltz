WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.470
Well,
she was about to be an intern working at NASA and she was like,
here it is.

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.550
Everyone shut the fuck up.
I got accepted for a NASA internship and look,

3
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:11.520
he writes language,
she says suck my Dick and balls.

4
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:15.780
I'm working at NASA and he says that I'm on the National Space Council that

5
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:16.890
oversees NASA.

6
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.590
Oh dear.
Funny.
First of all,
that shit is funny.

7
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.850
Suck my dick and balls and it's a girl.
Second of all,

8
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:34.320
we didn't even go to the fucking moon.
The moon.

9
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:38.670
I saw you talking about that.
Yeah,
no I I,
well I could,

10
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.750
I could be convinced.
I was convinced that we didn't for a long time.

11
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.410
Now I'm convinced I have no fucking idea.
Yeah,
I don't really,
I it's,
I,

12
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.580
I don't think we went to the moon.
It makes you think off of base.

13
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.070
It's not rooted in science.
How much,

14
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.100
how much have you really paid attention to it?
Cause I went down the rabbit hole.

15
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.800
I go many,
many years ago.
I've kind of like,

16
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.580
it's always like the social kind of where there's smoke,

17
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:05.880
there's fire type pools of just like,
you know,

18
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:10.320
us being in a race in no country is coming second.
Uh,
you know,

19
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.340
other space programs not catching up to 19,
what,
69,

20
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.470
1969,
1972,
uh,
American technology.
Right.
You know what I mean?
Like,

21
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.150
uh,
uh,
every time we went was under the Nixon administration.
That's a good one.

22
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.500
Uh,
these types of little things that just make you go and I'll probably like it

23
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.370
did,
you know,
like a flat earth there,
but it was the conference.

24
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.090
You ever watched the press conference when they returned from the moon?
Uh,
no.

25
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.240
Wait,
what's the,

26
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.250
what's the clue in there or what's the suspicious thing?

27
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.540
They look super depressed.
They look super deceptive.

28
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.330
They look fidgety and,
uh,
they're,
they're,

29
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.510
they're talking weird and they're saying shit.
They refute later.

30
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.850
One of the things they said,
Michael Collins,
who's actually never,

31
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.570
he's supposed to be in,
he'd never landed on the surface of the moon.

32
00:01:57.571 --> 00:02:02.370
Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong did,
he stayed up in the orbiter.
And,
uh,

33
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.760
they were,
they were asking about stars and he said,
I'm no,

34
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:06.960
I don't recall seeing any stars.

35
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.490
And then years later he wrote in his book about how magnificent stars look.

36
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.200
There's a lot of that shit.
But the press,
we see that if you want,

37
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:18.360
and this doesn't mean anything,
I'm not a cop.

38
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.930
But if I was a cop and I was interviewing them,
I'd be like,

39
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:24.870
these motherfuckers are guilty.
Something is wrong here.

40
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.640
Like they seem like guilty people.
Then you could look,
you don't get say,

41
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:32.760
hey man,
they were probably psychologically distressed.

42
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.820
They were probably dealing with the,
the,

43
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.150
the pressure of having come back from the moon and all this fame that they had

44
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:41.610
never experienced their whole life.
They're not there.
Their astronauts,

45
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:42.480
they're scientists.

46
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.000
And now all of a sudden they're standing in front of all these people and

47
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:48.240
everyone's asking them questions and they feel super nervous.
But Nah,

48
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:51.860
these niggas was lying.
Maybe tell you everybody,
my favorite thing is when you,

49
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.500
when,
uh,
uh,
cause I'll say it very casually.

50
00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.340
If people become like,
you know,
patriots and rocket science,
this is what,

51
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:03.310
it's all you like how we went.
I'm like,
you don't know either.

52
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.620
We shit is bullshit because it wasn't you and it wasn't me.
Let's stop with that.

53
00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:12.621
So we probably lied about it and we live better than any other country on earth

54
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.740
and I'm proud of that.

55
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.580
<v 1>There's a lot of weird shit with the fit video footage.</v>

56
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.180
There's a lot of footage where it looks like they're on wires dangling from

57
00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:24.750
wires and then they bounced back up from their feet in this weird way,

58
00:03:24.751 --> 00:03:27.570
it looks at it being yanked up from the ground.
There's a,

59
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.230
there's a video where it looks like they're on trampolines is if you Google

60
00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:35.120
astronauts and trampolines,
I'm not even kidding because it just looks like that.

61
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.180
I actually put it up,

62
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.890
it's a video that I found Google astronauts on trampolines as a video on youtube

63
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.830
and you're,
you're watching them bounce around and you're like,
wait a minute,

64
00:03:43.831 --> 00:03:44.430
wait a minute.
Wait.

65
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.990
You guys are on the fucking moon and you're hiding behind the lunar module.

66
00:03:48.991 --> 00:03:51.930
Like you can't see their feet.
You can't see how they're doing this,

67
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.070
but it looks like either they're bouncing on something or they're being yanked

68
00:03:56.071 --> 00:03:56.820
up in the air,

69
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.440
or it's one six gravity and it's just has a weird effect on people.

70
00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:02.610
But look at this,
watch this.

71
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.820
Like how strange is this?
See,
look,

72
00:04:08.821 --> 00:04:13.020
you just lands but doesn't,
I mean,
even the way he's,

73
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.930
he's moving it.
It's like he's being dangled.

74
00:04:15.931 --> 00:04:20.050
It's very strange to see him bouncing around.
But that also could

75
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.220
<v 0>all this stuff.
We did it,
but we were like playing golf with bouncing around.</v>

76
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:26.640
Like the moon landing set was built by the people who made discovery zone,

77
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.530
<v 1>but it also could be slides.
He fell.
Boom.</v>

78
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.780
It just jumped up and fell.
That's so strange.
But it also could be,

79
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.190
this is just what your body does at one six earth's gravity.
You know,

80
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.210
there's a whole bunch of,

81
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.070
<v 0>you know it.
I'm excited to see,
uh,
this one's weird.</v>

82
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:47.710
Someone else going back to the moon and then if it matches,

83
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.310
<v 1>this is from a a movie.
Uh,
I forget what was the name of the movie was,</v>

84
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.690
but you could watch some of the go.

85
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.470
They show some special effects they use in movies,

86
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.300
but watch some of the weird shit go a little bit further ahead of this.
Yeah,

87
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.223
right there.

88
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.580
This is some of the weird stuff where you see these guys like fall down and then

89
00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:13.440
it looks like they just get yanked back up by wires.
It's very strange.

90
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.370
Yeah.
I mean,
but the press conferences,

91
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:17.830
<v 0>yeah.
It's uh,
it's the,</v>

92
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.870
it's the social aspect of it cause it's like I won't begin to know like how the

93
00:05:24.321 --> 00:05:27.860
flag is supposed to look in the waving and the shadows.

94
00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:30.950
And the thing that like a lot of people argue about I,

95
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.010
it's just the political and so it's like,

96
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.830
I kind of think I know when the government is lying about something,

97
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.440
you know what I mean?
Like the history is there.

98
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.110
<v 1>Watch this.
What's that going to stay?
I bag up,
watch this,</v>

99
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.570
watch how he gets up.
Like he'd gotten yanked up.

100
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.520
<v 0>Oh,
there's a</v>

101
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.160
<v 1>bunch of those.
There's a bunch of those.</v>

102
00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:53.710
It makes it look like they're on wire pulled back up their feet.
Very strange.

103
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.160
But again,
have you ever been in one,
six earth gravity?

104
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.170
<v 0>I haven't.
No.
No.
What that maybe,</v>

105
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.060
maybe it just looks fake because when you're in one,
six earth's gravity,

106
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.480
how movement do you think we never ever been like,
like,
uh,

107
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.453
my,
my,

108
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.540
my conspiracy belief is specific to thinking that of man has walked around on

109
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:24.830
the surface of the more specific to that crashing,
you know,
Luna,
whatever.

110
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:26.960
I that's all 100%.
Yeah,
of course.

111
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.650
It's specifically man moving out.
Yeah.

112
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.970
It specifically that.
And you don't think anybody has ever done this?

113
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.360
I don't think so.
No.
In life,
like everything.
I don't think,

114
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.270
I mean we're the only country that would have the press conference,
some clips,

115
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.050
weird clips from the press conference because the press conference trip you out

116
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.680
and see and see just like other,
you know,

117
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.470
countries who have the means to do it.

118
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:56.100
Like they're an intention about going play place in this place a mess.

119
00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:59.030
And go big screen.
Michael Collins.

120
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.960
Look how sad these guys look.

121
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.380
<v 2>So weird.
Watch.</v>

122
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:10.390
This was our pleasure to have dissipated in one great adventure.

123
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.360
It's an adventure that took place not just in the month of July,

124
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.410
but rather one that took place in the last decade.

125
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.270
We all hear and the people listening in today had the opportunity to share that

126
00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:35.960
adventure over.
It's developing an unfolding

127
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.740
in the past months and years.

128
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.890
It's our privilege today to share with you

129
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.390
some of the details of that final month of July.

130
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.113
That was

131
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.650
certainly the highlight for the three of us of that decade.

132
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.620
<v 0>They just went to the moon and they all looked like they just saw that data and</v>

133
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:10.460
make it part of it.
They all liked they lions.
Neil,

134
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:17.040
it looks so fake.
But again,
that could be extreme nerves.

135
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.250
It can be people that don't know how to handle being in front of press.

136
00:08:20.251 --> 00:08:23.460
It could be,
uh,
introverts that are forced on the camera.

137
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.060
It could be a lot of issues.
If you went to the moon and then you came back and,

138
00:08:27.061 --> 00:08:29.460
uh,
you were sitting in that press conference,
would you be at the light?

139
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.030
Like what would your,
what would your actions be?
Would you be like,
Yay.

140
00:08:33.031 --> 00:08:37.290
Or would you be like more like,
like it would be,
it would look like,
uh,

141
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.510
like,
like a lake was a press conference after they want you back.

142
00:08:42.511 --> 00:08:46.220
I have my hat on some champagne just pointing to reporters.

143
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.070
And why didn't they bring back like a rock or something?
Then the shore,

144
00:08:53.071 --> 00:08:56.730
they brought it back a lot.
It brought back many rocks,

145
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:59.980
but some of them turned out to be petrified wood.
They gave one of them too.

146
00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:04.770
It's a real mystery.
Yeah.
They gave a moon rock in a

147
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.580
<v 1>69 or 72.
Uh,</v>

148
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:11.030
there's the Prime Minister of Holland,
whoever it was,
whatever,

149
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:15.540
whoever the person who runs Holland and a years later they analyze it and it was

150
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:17.880
petrified wood.
It was not a moon rock.

151
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:23.110
<v 0>Well,
in fairness,
in fairness,</v>

152
00:09:23.111 --> 00:09:27.400
I do get the,
like by the time we got to Holland,

153
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:28.930
the gift basket is going to change.

154
00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:35.280
It was like when I'd given away the real moon rock to Holland like that.

155
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:39.460
Like you know England gets a real moon rock.
Yeah.

156
00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:43.480
France gets a little roller moon.
Right.
But they get a little,

157
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.020
they get a moon rock statutes skill.
Find some,

158
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.430
you got some dude's blocks.
Did you think about this Mars mission?
Look at it.

159
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.990
<v 1>That's all real.
Look.
Rovers are real.
It's all the,</v>

160
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.420
the technology is proven and legitimate and I don't think he'd ever fake

161
00:09:58.421 --> 00:10:02.480
anything today.
Like you could fake things in 1969 if they,

162
00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:06.340
I think if anything for sure what they did is it's been proven that they fake

163
00:10:06.341 --> 00:10:09.010
some footage for sure.
Some photographs,

164
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.780
my cord it over the original again,

165
00:10:13.781 --> 00:10:17.770
those little things like you recorded over the array.
Yeah.

166
00:10:17.771 --> 00:10:21.280
The original in a world where even the importance of syndication was no,

167
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.500
I think they also lost the telemetry data,

168
00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:28.530
which is like the binary hard ones and Zeros that show the distance between the

169
00:10:28.541 --> 00:10:32.230
earth and lunar module at every step of the trip.
They lost it.
Yeah.

170
00:10:32.231 --> 00:10:35.500
They lost that shit.
But you know,
then again,

171
00:10:35.501 --> 00:10:39.970
you gotta realize like people die and people responsible for storage and no

172
00:10:39.971 --> 00:10:43.720
one's paying attention and there's funding and the funding gets pulled.
And this,

173
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.410
this plausible reasons for some of the,

174
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.700
<v 0>I don't know.
I mean,</v>

175
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.760
there are episodes of blossom being guarded in a vault somewhere in Burbank,

176
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:58.440
episodes of blossom,
right?
You could get fucking money off of blossom.

177
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.680
You can't make any money off of these goddamn moon landing eclipse.
Look,

178
00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:04.230
there's some people that absolutely are convinced that we didn't go,

179
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:08.790
and I used to be one of them,
and I would love if they proved that it was fake.

180
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.330
It would make me more happy than anything else in the world.
You know what?
Uh,
oh,

181
00:11:12.331 --> 00:11:15.870
it makes me very happy to,
I the,
the thing that keeps me hone in on,

182
00:11:15.871 --> 00:11:20.670
and maybe we went is a tour it NASA wants and they were nice.
Oh,

183
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.830
that's probably it then.
That was nice.

184
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.750
But you gotta realize those aren't the same people.
You know,

185
00:11:24.751 --> 00:11:26.740
when people say like,
no,
but lies.
Okay.

186
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.910
But those were NASA from 1969 these are different humans.
Yeah.

187
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.050
We're talking about 48 fucking years ago.

188
00:11:34.051 --> 00:11:36.190
These are completely different human beings.

189
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.140
They stand on the backs of liars.
Yeah.

190
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.680
Well there was a stocking vitalist at NASA so we can let us ask questions if

191
00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:50.310
you're going to fucking lie.
What you say about the tour.

192
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.280
I'm like stopping by ms to NASA and allowing

193
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.840
<v 1>us to ask questions if you're going to lie.</v>

194
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.160
I don't think they think they're lying.
I don't think they're involved in,
if any,

195
00:12:00.161 --> 00:12:03.970
if there was a conspiracy like safety did fake the moon landing.
No one today.

196
00:12:03.971 --> 00:12:07.060
Who's alive was a part of that.
Yeah,
except Buzz Aldrin.

197
00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:10.330
He's the only one still alive.
But he,
he did somebody,

198
00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.600
he punched the dude in the face.
Punched some guy.
What did he said he barked.

199
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:17.650
See Bro partsy rural made a move.
I had dinner with them or with the guards.

200
00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.910
See Bro.
Yeah.
Yeah.

201
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.940
Dinner with him many years ago and back when I was a full blown a moon

202
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.970
nonbeliever and I know I'm contacted them,
got ahold of him,

203
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.620
took him to dinner and a bunch of questions like that.

204
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:37.360
You use your celebrity for good
cause of the test?
Good.
No.

205
00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:42.361
It was just like these real specific pockets of like people that you just want

206
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:45.440
to talk to is like,
yeah,
I want him to sniff them out through them.

207
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.740
You can see someone doing interviews,

208
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.550
you could see someone in an edited format and you kind of get a sense of who

209
00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:52.180
they are.

210
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.940
You don't really get a sense of who they are until you actually talk to them.

211
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:59.110
Like you and him sharing a plate of pasta.
What was his like what did he,

212
00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:03.550
did he give us,
give you anything and it's like gives context.

213
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:07.500
So like that moment or like just like why he did it.
Uh,

214
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.350
he was convinced.
He was absolutely convinced that it was a hoax and he,

215
00:13:11.351 --> 00:13:16.330
what he was convinced was that there was a space race between us and Russia and

216
00:13:16.331 --> 00:13:20.410
that it was,
uh,
it was essentially a militarized space race.

217
00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:24.170
And what they were trying to do is prove military superiority.
If you had the,

218
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.610
the rockets that could get you to the moon,
your technology was superior.

219
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:33.180
And the way he framed it is like the United States had control over what was

220
00:13:34.091 --> 00:13:38.080
aired.
Um,
they put it on television and no one foresaw the future.

221
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.280
No one foresaw that.

222
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.210
One day you would be looking at these clips on youtube and analyzing them and

223
00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.690
putting them in slow Mo.
They didn't even think that that was going to be a thing

224
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.830
that was where that works.
Yeah.

225
00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:54.130
And they were going to show it in black and white and they were going to have it

226
00:13:54.131 --> 00:13:58.970
three d projected so that you would projected on a screen and then people,
uh,

227
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:02.320
who were filming it would have to film the screen.

228
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:06.160
Like they didn't even get a live feed when it was airing on television.

229
00:14:06.161 --> 00:14:11.040
It was airing people filming the screen that it was being projected on some

230
00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.930
what,
what?
Yeah.
Yeah.
They broke it down.

231
00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:18.130
So it looked more and more a grainy and fake.

232
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:19.203
Like they,

233
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.480
if you were trying to do something that was not done to the technology of the

234
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:28.300
day,
they would possibly obscure some fraud.
They did it all those ways.

235
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:33.180
There's so many things that they did that you,
you would go in.

236
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.590
And when in terms of like conspiracies,

237
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.690
it's a conspiracy theorist wet dream.
Cause if it is a fake,

238
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.130
it's the biggest fake of all time.

239
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.250
And there's so many things that are squirrely about it.

240
00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.960
There's so many things it doesn't mean it's fake.
Yeah.

241
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.970
But there's so many things.
So has anybody to the moon?
No.

242
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.840
No one's been to the moon since 1969 to 1972.
Those are the only trips they did.

243
00:14:56.841 --> 00:14:58.820
Seven attempts.
Six of them successful.

244
00:14:58.821 --> 00:15:02.410
Apollo 13 was the one that wasn't successful.
That was that big movie.
Um,

245
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.840
they landed on the moon and then came back seven times,

246
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.830
262,000 miles away.
Now here's where it gets crazy.

247
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.990
Or S plus or minus depending on where the moon's out at the time.

248
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:17.340
What's crazy is 262,000 miles pretty far.
Um,

249
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:22.700
what's crazy is
no,
no,
no,
my bad.
I'm thinking about,

250
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:23.770
oh that's three zeroes

251
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.990
cause I was like what map?
Or you see

252
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.800
that no other human space mission where a human has been a part of it since then

253
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.710
has ever gone more than 400 miles from the earth's surface.

254
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:44.070
Is that where the space station,
all the space shuttle missions,
everything,

255
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.560
everything inside.
It was further than 400 well 400 miles.

256
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.680
So the guy you had dinner with did what?
For Buzz Aldrin to sock them.

257
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.110
He told Buzz Aldrin he was a liar.

258
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:58.010
He said you're a liar and a crook and buzz went black pitch

259
00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.600
popped him right in the jaw.
[inaudible] acid is a new one.

260
00:16:02.601 --> 00:16:06.100
Contact him after that.
I mean,
I would imagine,
I don't know.

261
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.020
I don't know what he's doing in the day.
Our have it all.

262
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:12.110
But I mean immediately after.
No,
no,
no.

263
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.990
The Guy Bart's Hebrew.
But I mean immediately after the punch.

264
00:16:14.991 --> 00:16:16.550
Is there any type of like,

265
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:21.350
I think he tried to press charges and the cops told them to go fuck off.

266
00:16:21.351 --> 00:16:24.640
I think it was one of those songs.
It was,
it wasn't the best punch either.

267
00:16:24.641 --> 00:16:28.970
I mean if you go to the hospital from that punch and buzz was like in his

268
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.180
eighties at the time,
but he tried,
he followed,

269
00:16:32.181 --> 00:16:33.860
he was harassed a lot of those guys.

270
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.460
He harassed a lot of the astronauts and tried to get him to swear on bibles.

271
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.000
He'd bring a Bible and say square house wearing this Bible that you want in the

272
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.870
moon.
Yeah,
I mean it was,
it was a lot of,

273
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.100
just a lot of weird shit.

274
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:50.780
There's a another one that's a 25th anniversary of the Apollo Moon missions.

275
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.690
He gives a speech at the White House in front of this group of uh,

276
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.660
honor roll students like some of the best students in the country in near arm.

277
00:16:59.661 --> 00:17:04.580
John gives us real weird fucking speech is like we have here amongst us.

278
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:09.770
You want to hear it?
If I find a,
which makes it weird,

279
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.160
when you'll see it,
you'll get it.
It's just real.

280
00:17:13.161 --> 00:17:15.920
It doesn't mean we didn't go to the moon.
It doesn't mean,
by the way,

281
00:17:15.921 --> 00:17:19.430
it's fucking weird.
It's really funny cause I presented as like,
yeah,

282
00:17:19.431 --> 00:17:23.970
I don't think we went and,
and I didn't even have half of what you're getting.

283
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.300
Oh,
I'll give you a way more.
There's a lot.
Watch this.

284
00:17:26.301 --> 00:17:31.220
You're going to watch this and held back tears as he spoke.
These brief cryptic,

285
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.610
this is from a funny thing happened on the way to the Moon Fartsy Bros movie,

286
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:38.330
but this is a real thing that happened today.
We had

287
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.790
a group of students,
it's best

288
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.740
to you.
We say we have only completed a beginning.

289
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.060
<v 3>We leave you much.
That is under,</v>

290
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.150
there are great ideas.

291
00:17:57.151 --> 00:18:02.151
Undiscovered breakthroughs available to those who can remove one of truths,

292
00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:06.600
protective layers,

293
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.820
<v 0>what he is the flock.
Okay,</v>

294
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:14.530
well two things that mean a little unfair to it is,

295
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.270
and you add that fucking walk music to anything.

296
00:18:17.271 --> 00:18:19.820
Everything sells incredibly creepy,
but it's true.

297
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:24.190
But it does sound like a one of true.
Trying to tell

298
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.040
you can't get more cryptic.
Yeah,

299
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.940
and you also can't get more exciting.

300
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.750
It sounds like she theorists and almost kind of sounds like he's like until the

301
00:18:35.751 --> 00:18:38.780
child who actually figures out how to go to the fucking moon,

302
00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.070
they're a great breakthroughs for those who can remove one of truce protective

303
00:18:43.071 --> 00:18:44.630
layers.
What would you,

304
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:49.870
what would you rather the the moon confession or the art Kelly Confession.

305
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:56.420
If you had to pick one r Kelly made a song.
Yeah,
I saw that tape.

306
00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.950
I need that moon confession.
Yeah,

307
00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:05.800
I need that movie art.
Kelly,
you,
I don't need that confession.
I'm good.

308
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.950
I know
now that that's up to the wall.

309
00:19:09.951 --> 00:19:13.280
Now think the law's going to have a piece of that,

310
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:16.940
you know are,
Kelly seems to be pretty tough lawn,

311
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.690
but the moon confession would be fascinating.
I would be,
I'd be excited to,

312
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.310
or like a moon,
like,
I don't know,

313
00:19:25.311 --> 00:19:29.510
just I guess it's not on them to prove that they went.
So I'm saying like,

314
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.150
you know,
just some type of like

315
00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.690
1969 it's a different world.
Nixon's president.
I'm like,

316
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.990
I don't know if they did lie.
I don't know.
Yeah.
I used to think I knew like,

317
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.510
do you not think I know,
I mean it's foolish.

318
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:48.140
I don't know Jack Shit about astrophysics,
but I know if there wasn't like,

319
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.210
you know,
if there's any precedent we would guess would be down,

320
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:57.330
it'd be Trump.
He did tell us about it.
Well,
no,
I'm saying,
well,

321
00:19:57.331 --> 00:20:02.331
I'm saying like I'm saying like Nixon just like it is a perfect storm of like,

322
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.750
oh yeah,
the time Nixon,
yeah.
Oh,

323
00:20:05.751 --> 00:20:09.330
he's the most deceptive president of all time except the current one.
Yeah.
Um,

324
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:14.210
yeah,
it's it,
it's very interesting.

325
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:14.661
I,

326
00:20:14.661 --> 00:20:19.661
I've shut down a lot of barbecues was talking about just bring it up now you

327
00:20:19.791 --> 00:20:23.570
have more information.
And by the way,
this is a fraction of the shit that I,
dude,

328
00:20:23.571 --> 00:20:28.170
I did research for a years.
I debated a,

329
00:20:28.171 --> 00:20:32.330
a scientist on Penn Jillette's radio show about it.
How did it go?

330
00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:34.003
Pretty good for me

331
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:38.130
even though I don't even agree with some of the shit that I said back.

332
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.380
Where does that argument end on just a agree to disagree?

333
00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.170
It was a time constraint.
I would do it far differently now.

334
00:20:45.171 --> 00:20:48.280
I think far differently now that I did that I would not take

335
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.550
<v 1>this.
I know we didn't do it approach,
uh,
because I don't know.</v>

336
00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:55.930
We didn't do it and that's the thing.
I,
I very casually go.

337
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.050
Yeah,
probably not.
Yeah.
But it just,
the,

338
00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:03.400
the things that don't add up to me don't add up in a way that just makes me go.

339
00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:06.880
Yeah.
Do you know about the van Allen radiation belts?
You know about all that?

340
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:12.370
I not enough to like there's a,
there's a belt of radiation,

341
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.520
like a doughnut shaped from just years of a,
no,
no,
no.

342
00:21:15.521 --> 00:21:18.880
It's just naturally surrounds the earth.
Oh,
you know what I'm thinking about?

343
00:21:18.881 --> 00:21:20.110
I'm thinking about the,
nevermind,

344
00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:24.640
I'm thinking about the belt of from years of like satellites and so there's that

345
00:21:24.641 --> 00:21:27.460
shit too,
but that there wasn't much of that in 1969.
Not near what it,

346
00:21:27.461 --> 00:21:28.294
what about it?

347
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:32.740
The van Allen radiation belts is intense ban of radiation for miles that,

348
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.380
that surrounds the earth that you would have to go through to get to the moon.

349
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.530
They apparently though there's a hole that you could go through in the top with

350
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.210
the radiation belt,
isn't there?

351
00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.230
But the idea is that there was no shielding to protect them from radiation.

352
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:51.760
They just weren't in this aluminum tin.
Can you,
or touch or lunar module,

353
00:21:51.761 --> 00:21:56.220
like they have a,
there was a science exhibit I went to once that had,
um,
a,

354
00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:00.070
a replica of the lunar module and you can put your hands on it and it's like,

355
00:22:00.071 --> 00:22:03.610
Whoa,
this thing is,
oh,
really?
Meda coke cans.
And it's like,

356
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.730
it's nothing so weird looking.

357
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:11.970
There's also like photographs that are fucking wanky lights that go at two

358
00:22:12.341 --> 00:22:16.300
different angles and they say,
well,
that's possible due to,
you know,
uh,

359
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.990
uneven terrain and,
you know,
things reflecting off of things,

360
00:22:19.991 --> 00:22:21.100
all these different variables.
