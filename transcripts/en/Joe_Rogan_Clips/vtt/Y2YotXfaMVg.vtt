Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.680
<v 1>Have you guys have been paying attention to all the shit storm that William</v>

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.940
Shatner,
he's been doing online.

4
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.150
William Shatner is is at war with social justice warriors on Twitter.

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.740
William Shatner is like shit posting online and getting these people mad at him

6
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.390
and they're mad and they're saying that your whole show star track was about

7
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:27.290
social justice and here you are mocking social justice warriors.

8
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.100
There was an article in Huffpost,
you know,
which is like the Super Liberal Rag,

9
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.990
like should William Shatner's like abhorrent behavior or something like that or

10
00:00:35.991 --> 00:00:40.650
race Heparin,
a racist star trek legacy like that.

11
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.100
Like literally as bad behavior online.

12
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.670
Find that article because it's so ridiculous.
But he's essentially,

13
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.230
I'm just fucking with people calling them snowflakes and shit and people going

14
00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:52.064
nuts

15
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.710
<v 0>but with how bad is he?
What is he saying?
Nothing that bad.</v>

16
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.420
They just want him to toe the line and they also want him to be like humble and

17
00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:05.500
grateful for being on Star Trek.
But he's like,
Hey folks,
it was just a TV show.

18
00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:07.630
Lighten the fuck up.
And they're like,

19
00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:11.710
it's just a TV show with social justice as his primary values and here you are.

20
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.790
We expect you to become so with that TV show,
not,
yeah,

21
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.230
he's Canadian too,
by the way.
Oh Shit.
Yeah.
No,
they're not foreign now.
He's wrong.

22
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.230
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.
Um,
but uh,

23
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.270
I don't know like what they're arguing about.
It's hard.

24
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.510
I can't scroll back far enough to find out what they want to argue.
Oh yeah,

25
00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:30.700
for sure.
I think he's awful.

26
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.400
I remember when you didn't know that William Shatner was so awful.

27
00:01:33.401 --> 00:01:37.150
Like I saw people tweet that like all these weird social justice warriors,

28
00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:41.090
women like,
relax,
why waste your time?
I got shit to do.

29
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.130
People 80 year old man living alone.
I get you think he's all,

30
00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:48.850
he's got all these models.
There isn't.
Yeah,
isn't he?

31
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.620
Isn't William Shatner baby says,
Hey,
I'll let you look.
This is what,

32
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.960
according to this article is what the fight was about,

33
00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:58.420
came from some show called Outlander.
Okay.
Hey,

34
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.590
<v 1>Outlander fans.
The actor calling them snowflakes and Social Justice Warriors,</v>

35
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.580
uh,

36
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.290
is intricate and fascinating in a way that only fandom beef involving and

37
00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:11.920
internationally famous cultural icon can be.
But to get the full picture,

38
00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:15.120
we have to take a trip back in time,
took Dah de Dah,
Dah,
Dah de Dah,

39
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.980
Dah Schachner who acquitted with this guy?

40
00:02:17.981 --> 00:02:22.180
Hugans Hugans h you assist the part here.
Okay.

41
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.970
Uh,
I believe the two stars of the show,
Sam Hugans,

42
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.040
Hewkin and Catriona valve should date and real life.

43
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.000
Huh?
There's a group of fans,
people that love the show,

44
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.430
that thing a shippers,

45
00:02:39.431 --> 00:02:42.640
they call themselves fans of a show who wants to see the two characters in a

46
00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:45.430
relationship.
They believe the two stars of the show,

47
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.230
Sam and Catriona should date in real life.

48
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.380
And it particularly hard line group of fandom Bolsheviks that believe that they

49
00:02:56.291 --> 00:02:58.090
already are dating in secret.

50
00:02:58.091 --> 00:03:02.560
And Schachner who's acquainted with one of the guys,
uh,
waded into the fray,

51
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.570
labeling those shippers,

52
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:08.170
those people as bullies and calling them out on Twitter.

53
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.800
It was a move that many fans also saw as its own kind of bullying with Shatner.

54
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.320
Trying to kick a group out of fandom for more nuanced a walkthrough.

55
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.920
There's an explanation.
Blah,
blah,
blah.
Fast forward.
Okay.

56
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:25.930
He gotten a fucking goofy war with

57
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.870
<v 0>trolls.
Yeah.
Here's some of the tweets and stuff.
Oh</v>

58
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.030
yeah.
Okay.

59
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.820
<v 1>Oh,
it's this weird.
So He's,
what does it,
hold it back up.</v>

60
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.710
Funny how an actress with an impressive resume is belittled by same feminists.

61
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.060
Who say that an 86 year old man tell him the truth is a massage.

62
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.560
<v 0>[inaudible] 86 I could believe that he's waiting.
Check.
No.
86 alright.</v>

63
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.730
Yeah,
I Google it.
Take guess.
How old do you think he is?

64
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.240
I bet that's right.
I say he's in his eighties that's great.
It's gotta be,

65
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.560
when you're that close to death,

66
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.710
do you really give a fuck enough to argue with people on Twitter about who's

67
00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:08.460
dating,
who?
That seems weird.
He says 86 wow,

68
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.440
this is pretty good for 86 but like,

69
00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:15.330
what is that like why are,

70
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.410
why are they going back and forth like that seems like such a waste of time.

71
00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:20.560
You're 86 and you want to,

72
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.070
how much time do you have when you're 86 if you're super lucky,
you got 10 years.

73
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.460
Sometimes old people like to argue.
It gives them strength and energy.

74
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.550
It's like vitamins.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Fucking fight.

75
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.300
You know the game?
Yeah.
Like a fucking sport.
Yeah.

76
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.560
[inaudible] I mean,
yeah,
they get tired.

77
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.150
They just need that adrenaline rush.
Need anger fueled,
fueled by anger.

78
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.300
Anger is an energy.
It's an adrenaline rush.
You just don't do.

79
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.360
You don't dive into the fray with dorks though.
