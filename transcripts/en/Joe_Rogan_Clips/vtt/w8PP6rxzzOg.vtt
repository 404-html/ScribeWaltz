00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.060
With you all,
your experience in the military and your,

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.120
your knowledge of what the real world in these combat environments is.

3
00:00:09.941 --> 00:00:11.890
Like what do you,

4
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.250
how do you feel when you hear people talk about defunding the military or

5
00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:22.930
decreasing the military or that we don't need it or that we shouldn't have the

6
00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:24.640
kind of budget that we have right now,

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.860
the people that don't understand the real threats that are out there and that if

8
00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:33.970
you do not have a well trained,
well funded,

9
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.320
experienced military that really understands these things,

10
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.710
you've got real danger at your door.
Yup.
Uh,

11
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.130
I'm glad that they live in a place where they have enough space to develop those

12
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:52.670
thoughts because they're not under pressure because the military is doing the

13
00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:56.660
job that they should be doing.
There are,
like I said,

14
00:00:56.661 --> 00:01:01.520
so many misconceptions about what the military does.
Uh,

15
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.750
what we do overseas,
how many countries we are in overseas,

16
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.120
how deep we are into some of these countries,

17
00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:12.890
how forecasted and how forward looking the military is looking for emerging

18
00:01:12.891 --> 00:01:17.891
threats as opposed to just responding and all of that creates space so people

19
00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:22.970
can exercise their right to voice their first amendment.
You know,
right.

20
00:01:22.971 --> 00:01:25.550
Of saying those things.
I don't,
does it frustrate you though,

21
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:28.070
that they don't have a real understanding?

22
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.670
I'm grateful that they live in a place where they don't have that great

23
00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:35.270
understanding because like I said,
they have the space to be confused.

24
00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:36.560
They're not pushed under a thumb.

25
00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:39.920
They're not being told you have to say this or it's going to be your fucking

26
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:44.360
head in the square.
Right.
It is frustrating for me at times,

27
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:49.160
but I balance that with that's,
that's what this country is supposed to be about.

28
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.970
You're supposed to be able to voice your descent.
Right.
And I,

29
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:56.960
and I believe that the system will correct in is it does correct for itself.

30
00:01:56.961 --> 00:02:00.860
There are people that believe that,
but I think the most,
the majority of people,

31
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.970
again,
silent majority versus extreme minority,

32
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:07.640
I think those people are in the extreme minority,
but they're very vocal.

33
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.000
I think most people are incredibly appreciative of what the military does.

34
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.650
But having said that,

35
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.010
if you've never served in the military and you've never been in a combat

36
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.430
occupation and then you've never applied that occupation for real,

37
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.080
there's going to be a gap and there's going to be a gap in understanding and

38
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.640
that's okay.
So it's frustrating.
Yes,
but I'm,

39
00:02:30.641 --> 00:02:34.400
I'm glad that it exists and I'm glad that they are not in this country,

40
00:02:34.401 --> 00:02:36.980
is not in a position where they are getting drafted and forced into that

41
00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:37.730
position.

42
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.840
I'm glad that it was me that did that and had to bear any weight or burden that

43
00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:44.420
came with that to allow them to have whatever pending they want.

44
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.850
That's a great perspective.
That's a very healthy way of looking at it.
Um,

45
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.830
and I probably think it's probably the only manageable way of looking at it.

46
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.890
I think you'd go crazy otherwise because the other way.
And then you,

47
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.020
what are you going to do?
Go to a rally and hold up another light.

48
00:02:57.021 --> 00:03:01.890
It's like what's right.
I mean I,
because initially I have to fight back the,

49
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.350
the initial anger,
but eventually it give me a little bit of time and the,

50
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:10.180
you know,
hopefully relatively sane head is going to prevail.
And I had,
you know,

51
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.860
again that night I got hurt.

52
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.440
It changed the way that I thought about things if I had never gotten hurt and
uh,

53
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.990
and the,

54
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.900
and I had never thought about my own mortality and I had never thought about

55
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.720
like I spent a lot of time thinking about whether or not what I did in the

56
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:23.080
military.

57
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.080
Has it had any impact 0.0001 I don't know if I would have thought about that if

58
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:32.560
all I had ever done was just doing the occupation that I did.

59
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:35.590
I needed that lifting of my head to have that perspective.
I did.

60
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.070
I don't think all people do,
but I needed that.
How long do,
oh,
sorry.

61
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.560
I was going to say,
I think that night in,
uh,

62
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.360
in some ways helps me have the perspective I have now with those people.

63
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.420
How,
how long is the average career of someone who's a seal?
Well,

64
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:53.111
if you want to retire,

65
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:56.410
you got to do 20 years in a wake up and they should change it to wake up,

66
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.160
wake up the next day.
You got to 20 years,
you have to do 20 years to the day.

67
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.450
So wake up the day after your 20th.
Uh,
but they need to change the term.
Also,

68
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:08.680
retirement pay in the military should be,
in my opinion,
at least replaced with,

69
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.820
uh,
money that.
