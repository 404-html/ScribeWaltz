WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.340
Right before I did my special,
my closing did I do on the show on the special,

2
00:00:03.341 --> 00:00:05.260
the closing bit.
I uh,

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.310
I was sat with you for a fucking hour in the back room cause I took it up in the

4
00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:13.690
main room following like Deleah and I just said,
here we go.
And I,

5
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.440
man,
that club can really let you know where the silence is.

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.910
And you go,
all right.
And then you're like,
oh,
I've been lazy.

7
00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:26.230
I've been performing the fans who will give you the benefit of the doubt and

8
00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:28.810
they want you to succeed.
But when you do a Netflix special,

9
00:00:28.811 --> 00:00:32.410
you need it to be to strangers need to like it.
That's the,

10
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.800
the old Louis quote that I used to hang my hat on,
they were like,

11
00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:39.130
why don't you work at UCB?
And he goes,
anyone can make them laugh.
He was like,

12
00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:40.900
I'm famous,
like get,
they've had go in.

13
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.430
Like that's like making your friends laugh.

14
00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:46.000
That's why this is why I do the road is the art form is to make strangers laugh.

15
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.370
And I was like,
yeah,
it is to make strangers laugh.
Yeah.
Well,
it's also,

16
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.100
you don't want a delusional perspective.

17
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.790
And one thing that does happen to some complex Stan hope was it was by it.
Like,

18
00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:00.910
he's like,
why would I go and do someone else's audience?
He goes,

19
00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:05.590
it took me 25 years to make my own audience.
I'm like,
okay,
I get it.

20
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.790
Yeah.
But I really feel like to develop material to really do it right,

21
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.370
you got to do it in front of just regular people,

22
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.110
people that aren't necessarily there to see you.

23
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.450
And the beautiful thing about the stores,

24
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:18.270
if there's 15 people in the lineup or 20 people in the lineup,
whatever it is,

25
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.450
how many of there see you?
10% 30% 20% like,
you know,

26
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.510
maybe they're there to see you and to Leah and also,
you know,

27
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:31.850
Tom and also Christina,
like it's,
they're just comedy fans do that.

28
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.520
Bert Kreischer fans.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That,
that's giant as giant.

29
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.830
Because those guys that like develop like that.
I've,

30
00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:42.390
I've seen a few people that develop an audience and that's all their audience

31
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.740
and there's,
they just get real complacent,
real lazy.

32
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.680
That's the um,
those,
it,
I mean I I've,

33
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.740
I said lightly because there's some internet comics meaning like youtube
comment,

34
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.800
people that do comedy now and some are good,

35
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.850
some are good and some are developing.
I don't know.

36
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.200
I wasn't saying that to be polite but like,
but that one guy,

37
00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:05.650
he got booed off stage and Montreal because he's been performing to fans.

38
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.930
Oh well here's the other thing about that guy.

39
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.880
That guy goes up on a show where there's all these other comedians on and then

40
00:02:12.881 --> 00:02:17.881
at the end of his sat says that comedy shouldn't be about about preaching.

41
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.570
It should be about making people laugh,
right?

42
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.290
It shouldn't be about ethics or morals,

43
00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:30.220
sexuality or race,
sexuality or race.
It should be about making people laugh.

44
00:02:30.221 --> 00:02:32.650
People pay to forget about that stuff.
Bitch,

45
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.940
you are on stage not making people laugh.

46
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.460
That is what you're doing.
You silly.

47
00:02:39.461 --> 00:02:42.610
Fuck it is one of the silliest things I've ever seen in my life.

48
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.980
It's like this is an,

49
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.180
he's essentially a beginning comic,
open,
open Mike.

50
00:02:49.181 --> 00:02:51.680
He's maybe been doing stand up three years.

51
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.620
So he does like videos and the videos are very popular and they're funny.
Yeah.

52
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:56.661
If you're from the south,

53
00:02:56.661 --> 00:03:00.820
they're really funny just unless someone's doing your shit,

54
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.680
unless they're stealing or stealing from somebody else,
just do your fucking act.

55
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.210
Unless something happened before you that's so agregious and ridiculous that you

56
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:13.540
feel like you have to address it when you go on stage because it's his sitting

57
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:16.390
in the room.
Yeah.
And to just try to do ever notice,
you know,

58
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:19.510
when you pick up your phone,
if you just try to do that and everybody's like,

59
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:21.490
what the fuck you not going to address,
which has happened.

60
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.740
Sometimes you have to address what just happened.

61
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.030
Like sometimes someone will go on before you and just eat so much shit that you

62
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:32.020
have to say something.
You have to say something you have to.

63
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.590
But what that guy did was ridiculous to tell someone what comedy is and what

64
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:41.450
isn't.
I'd said I had read an article about that.
This,
uh,

65
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.300
I'm assuming she's a gay woman,

66
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:47.290
wrote about like trashing Hannah Gatsby and going,
hey,

67
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.890
we're gay and we're doing standup comedy.
We're not,
we're not just preaching,

68
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.410
we're doing standup comedy,
talking about trauma and it's working.

69
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:54.460
You just don't see us.

70
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.520
So don't write us off and say comedy is dead because you don't see us.

71
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.160
I don't think Hannah Gadsby saying comedies dead.

72
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.470
I think journalists are saying comedies dead,

73
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:05.710
and I think we're all buying into it because these people were writing these

74
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:06.281
articles.

75
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:11.281
They're not even in comedy there just comedy fans or fans of her and what I

76
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:14.800
think she did,
and I'm only seeing part of it,
I saw the whole thing.

77
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.320
I'll tell you right now,
let me have one joke.
I like a lot,

78
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.880
but it's whatever she did is fine.
Yeah.
Thing.
It's her artwork.

79
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.840
This is what she's doing.
It's fine.
Like it's,
it's,
if people enjoy it,

80
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:30.160
that's great.
But the problem with comedy is the comedy is one category.

81
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.120
It's just comedy.
But comedy could be Cat Stevens,

82
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.560
it could be guns and roses.
It could be the Geto boys.
You know what I'm saying?

83
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.300
It's like when you go to see music,
there's a very distinct genres.
There's no,

84
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.910
there's just comedy.
Comedy has just comedy.

85
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.990
Like you could go see a folk singer and what they're doing on stage,

86
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:53.380
like really slow and quiet is music,

87
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.190
but then you go to see fucking led Zeppelin and you go,
okay,

88
00:04:57.191 --> 00:05:00.630
well that's music to how the fuck is that music too?
You know how,

89
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.380
how has the motley crew the same kind of thing as cat power?
How is that?

90
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:09.010
How are they,
how are they the same?
Well,
they are both music.

91
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.390
Just like we do comedy and she's doing a version of comedy.

92
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.770
Some of it is really funny and some of it is her just talking about stuff and

93
00:05:17.771 --> 00:05:22.060
like a very serious way.
That's fine.
Yeah,
that we're not against each other.

94
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:25.240
This is what's crazy.
Everybody is like,
you know,
this is deconstructing comedy.

95
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.690
Comedy is dead now.
Like what are you talking about?
That's crazy.

96
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.370
We know she's doing what she's doing.

97
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:33.880
If you enjoy it and that's what you want to see more of,
go see that.
Yeah,

98
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.230
that's what she does.
That's great.
She has a great joke about Unicorns that I,

99
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.670
I giggle about once a week and I'll tell her jokes.
It's not on Netflix.

100
00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:44.710
You can see that when I was growing up,

101
00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:48.100
I knew more facts about unicorns and I did lesbians.
She goes,

102
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.440
there are no facts about unicorns.
I was just like,

103
00:05:53.441 --> 00:05:57.470
that's a good fucking,
that's a good fucking joke.
That is good joke.
Yeah.

104
00:05:57.471 --> 00:05:59.900
I mean that's her experience,
right?
She's a lesbian.
It's hard.

105
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.190
It's hard out there for a pimp.
I get it.

106
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.500
It's fucking like where we are.

107
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.260
I think people create unnecessary and artificial adversaries.

108
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:13.480
I really do.

109
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.790
And I think this is one of the ones that's going on right now in comedy and I

110
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:20.510
see it all the time with this and the net thing,
it's like stop,
stop,

111
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.290
stop with the art.
I mean I,
I fall into it too.

112
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:27.430
I buy a new two and I read some of these articles like comedy's not dead.

113
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.450
The fuck are you talking about?
It doesn't make any sense.

114
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.520
You read the article and you start thinking,
she said it like the way that,

115
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.990
exactly.
You're like,
oh,
she's telling us I can't do comedy anymore.

116
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.080
She didn't say she just did something and someone interpreted it that way.

117
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.740
And if she says she can't do comedy anymore,
that's fine too.
Yeah.

118
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.350
She could just do like now she's famous,
right?

119
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:49.520
She could just do one woman specials or one person's specials or one entity

120
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:52.400
specials.
How we are framing it.
I wouldn't say it,
Joe,

121
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.060
can I say the gender would be even,
I would be like,
she does a thing.
