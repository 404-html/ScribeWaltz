1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.080
And my daughter does isn't demonstrating the same enthusiasm that her older

2
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:07.890
brother does.

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.510
And you try and you try to suss out like the nature nurture question cause I

4
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:17.010
feel like I'm doing the same inputs.
Right.
But I'm getting different results.

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.650
And it leads you to wonder,
um,
you know,
it's a very small sample size.

6
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.530
But when I talked to other parents,
like you know,

7
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:27.750
parents who are parenting right now,
young kids,

8
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.170
I just keep encountering other dads who are having the same experience.

9
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.340
And you,

10
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.340
it really leaves you to wander sort of like what sort of like cultural

11
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.190
influences are going on there where it's like the enthusiasm oftentimes among

12
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:50.310
young girls are not as high as the enthusiasm among boys.

13
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.650
<v 1>It's hard to unpack.
I don't know.
It's hard to unpack everything.
Yeah,
that's,</v>

14
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.890
that's my question is like sage,
what's,

15
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.730
how old your kids while the two I'm talking about are eight and five?
Yeah.
Man,

16
00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:05.180
I don't know how much culture plays a part.
I know.
I really think that it's,

17
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.710
and it's obviously in my small sample group and eight year old and a 10 year old

18
00:01:09.711 --> 00:01:13.100
for the youngest kids,
the a,
the eight year old fucking loves it.

19
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.640
They're both girls.
The 10 year old,
she's like,
whatever,
you know,

20
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.020
if I tried to wake her up,
take her fish and she'd be like,
leave me alone.
No.

21
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.230
Going back to sleep.

22
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.480
<v 0>I'm sure there are parents out there who,
you know,
I haven't met him yet.</v>

23
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.660
Maybe they're out there where they have like a boy and a girl and the girls into

24
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.360
fire it up and the boys not maybe I haven't.

25
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.380
<v 1>I guarantee you it's,
there's,</v>

26
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.010
Jamie and I were just talking about this yesterday because I was watching this

27
00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:38.530
video of these,
there's,

28
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.430
I want to try to put this in a respectful way.

29
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.043
<v 2>MMM.</v>

30
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.020
<v 1>I think there,
I'm sure you're aware of this.</v>

31
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.720
There's people that are in the hunting world,

32
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:55.721
the outdoor industry that I think are in it because it's a good avenue to get

33
00:01:56.781 --> 00:02:00.720
attention.
If you're like a hot chick.
Yeah.
If you're a hot check and you,

34
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:03.350
you know,
you wear pink and you,
you go out and shoot things,

35
00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:06.200
you'd take all these grip and grins with deer and like this,

36
00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:08.410
you're going to get a lot of likes.
Yeah.
Because it's

37
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.070
<v 0>Magine the,
the,
the male perspective on it.
Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.210
It's like here's the woman who has everything.

39
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.140
<v 1>Exactly.
And she likes to hunt.
Yeah.
She's hot and she likes to hunt.
And uh,</v>

40
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.080
there's quite a few of them.
And it's,
I was telling Jamie,

41
00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:27.050
it's a weird world because,
pardon me,

42
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.770
I don't want to be a sexist.
I don't want to look at these girls and I,
I don't,

43
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.390
I don't look at a guy who hunts and who wants to be a part of the outdoor

44
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:36.111
industry and go,
Oh,

45
00:02:36.111 --> 00:02:40.640
this guy is just doing this because he thinks this is his avenue for fame and

46
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:42.260
success.
I think,
well,

47
00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:46.850
here's a guy who really likes to hunt and he realizes there's people like Steve

48
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.730
Rinella and John Dudley out there and these famous hunters,
man,

49
00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:52.880
I want to be a famous hunter.
How do I do it?
You know,
how do I go?

50
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:56.120
Well I'm going to just start taking Instagram pictures and say a lot of the same

51
00:02:56.121 --> 00:03:00.250
shit that they say and sort of,
you know,
put myself into the cultural norm.

52
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.730
I don't think like that with girls.
Cause you're like,

53
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:07.390
you just want to have men like you.
Not all of them.

54
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.970
A lot of them I think are super legit.
A lot of them are said,

55
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.890
but there's unquestionably this added element in that world and it with it.

56
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.050
Let's be super generous and say it's only 10% of them,
but that 10% of my,

57
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.790
hmm.
I'm not smell a rat.
I'm not unaware of what you're talking about.

58
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.050
I'm sure you're not,
but I notice it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I even had like a,

59
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.490
<v 0>yeah,
I remember it was.</v>

60
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.970
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.770
<v 0>Yeah.
There's kind of like a,
yeah,
like a,
like a like,
like a sex pot kind of.
Yeah.</v>

62
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.020
Huntress scene,
you know?
Yeah.

63
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.440
<v 1>It's super made up.
Full war paint,
fake eyelashes.</v>

64
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.430
Hot as fuck.
Skin tight clothes out there,
shooting shit,

65
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.830
taking pictures.
Yeah.
It's weird.

66
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:53.850
And then you go to their Instagram page and it's like there's pictures of that

67
00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:56.610
and then there's a lot of pictures with their butt up in the air where they're

68
00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:59.450
doing some strange exercise getting ready for both of these and yeah,

69
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.340
accentuating there.
But like that's weird.
I don't do any of those exercises.

70
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.250
<v 0>I would really like to,
I don't know.
I would really like mine to,</v>

71
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.680
cause I'm going to continue leaning on my,
uh,

72
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.160
under continue leaning out my daughter,
uh,

73
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.980
cause I would really like her

74
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.860
<v 3>okay.</v>

75
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.870
<v 0>On keep leaning on her until I feel like she's in the,</v>

76
00:04:18.871 --> 00:04:22.410
at an age where she can legitimately say she doesn't want to go.
Right.

77
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.200
Because right now if I asked her every day,
hey,
you want to go to school,

78
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.240
she'd be having a real delinquency problem.
So you're like,
you know,

79
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.850
you really like,
yeah.
Uh,
you make kids do stuff.

80
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.680
I took her duck on a couple of weekends ago.

81
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.580
It was cold morning and we get out there and before it's even legal light,

82
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.510
she's like,
I felt terrible.
She's laying there crying Bauhaus,

83
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.423
colder feet are,

84
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.870
if my boy was doing that,

85
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.640
I would have a very different attitude about it.
Right.
Then when she's crying,

86
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.130
her crying cause she's cold,

87
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.140
like made me feel awful.
Right.
With my boy.
I've been like

88
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.620
suck it up.
But her,
I'm like,
oh man.
Yeah,
she's all cold now.

89
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.300
Yeah.
And then it makes it so you really,
there,

90
00:05:11.301 --> 00:05:13.800
there really is a difference.
Yeah.
There's that.
There's a,

91
00:05:13.801 --> 00:05:17.240
there's a difference there.
And it's not,
you know,

92
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.620
the people that buy a hunting license in this country,

93
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:24.450
90% of the people by hunting in a 90% are males.
Right?
Right.

94
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.230
So one in 10 licensed holders,
there's a woman,
but then there's,

95
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.810
there's more women than men in the,
you know,
slightly more men,

96
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.200
women than men in the country.
And there's a ton of ways of explaining it.

97
00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:37.200
We talked about earlier with neanderthals or maybe the neanderthals didn't have

98
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.940
these like divided roles,

99
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.250
but in all the hunter and hunter gatherer cultures is very normal to see a

100
00:05:44.251 --> 00:05:49.251
division of labor here and to have like the men were out hunting and women,

101
00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:52.200
we're not,
there's a bunch of explanations for that.

102
00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:56.170
Like people were tied to being home to care for small children and you know,

103
00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.050
couldn't afford risk.
Right.
Something to,
they vary.
There are,

104
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:04.520
there's some women that go out with the hunting parties,
you know,
if it is,

105
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.720
you know,
the minute you say no,
someone's going to point out to some right.

106
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.620
Variation.
But in your experience,
you've,

107
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:16.490
you've done several of these trips to these remote jungles.
Oh yeah.

108
00:06:16.491 --> 00:06:18.980
But that's just what,
that's such a small thing.
I mean,
you get,

109
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.870
rather than looking at personal experience,

110
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:24.690
just like from kind of exploring literature and reading about,
you know,

111
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.870
historic accounts and more people found out what people do,
uh,

112
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.220
it is very much the norm is very much the norm.

113
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.430
That hunting was patrilineal descent activity and all of these cultures you go

114
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:41.750
to,
you like the cult of the hunter is like a male sort of Colt,

115
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.150
but the factors that made it that way.
Okay.
That's sort of the,

116
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.540
you,
you have to assume it comes from some kind of practical factor,
right.

117
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.020
The factors that made it that way aren't there anymore.
Um,

118
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.340
and I said it's a difficult thing to unpack if it winds up being that if I have

119
00:06:58.341 --> 00:07:02.150
two boys and one girl for winds up being that,
uh,

120
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.360
both boys become avid hunters and fishermen and somehow my daughter does not,

121
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.750
I'll probably view it as some bit of a personal failure though I'll never know

122
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:17.960
what really was going on.
Like I said,
it's hard.
It's hard to like unloaded.

123
00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:19.670
I wish I could have 100 children,

124
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:22.460
like 50 girls and 50 boys and have a bigger samples.
