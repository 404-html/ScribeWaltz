1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.190
The joe rogan experience.
Cause I feel like Spotify just dominates the market.

2
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:05.701
Yeah.
But see,

3
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:08.700
apple music's on everyone's phone now and you just find it and use it.

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.750
It's so easy to use,
but you don't,
you don't use Spotify.
See.

5
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:15.480
But I think it's the,
the youngest generation loves Spotify.

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.340
Like they love soundcloud.
Soundcloud,
I mean was so big.
They loved it.
Yeah.

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.760
They sound cloud.
A lot of people were using the host podcasts.
Yeah,
totally.

8
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.710
But a lot of people think that it won't be around.
Oh,

9
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:27.780
I think that's the opposite.
Not only do I think,

10
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:30.810
not only is it for stuff like that,
that's homemade podcast stuff like DIY,

11
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.820
it's also set to surpass Spotify paid paid subscribers.
Right,
right.

12
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.090
Cause Spotify starts off for free.
Right,
right.
Interesting.
Um,

13
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.390
but like that's my thing is like,
uh,
you know,

14
00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:45.870
like that the future of soundcloud thing like that is because it's,
it's all,

15
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.280
everybody loves DIY shit.

16
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.490
Whether it's musicians or like all those musicians and artists now that are on

17
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:54.210
Spotify,
it's all people like making music in their fucking,
in their house.

18
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.100
Fucking youtube.
You know.
I mean,

19
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:59.400
how many youtube millionaires have been made from a lot.

20
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.050
So many weird shit.
Putting up videos,
talking.
I know some from that.

21
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:05.070
I know some from the beginning,

22
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:09.300
like I used to do a youtube sketch thing a long time ago and like caught fire a

23
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:13.080
little bit on a very small scale and the people that we kind of associated with

24
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.220
when it was starting to grow,

25
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.420
two or three of them now that I know have made so much money from them and they

26
00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:19.410
were just from the jump,

27
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.690
they were kind of like in right as the cusp was like beginning.

28
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:25.320
You know what happens with that dude who got in trouble with the suicide?

29
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.880
Is it Jager?
Logan Paul.
Which one is he?
Logan.
Paul Logan.
Paul.
He's,

30
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:30.900
he's banned.
They don't,

31
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.500
they demonetize his entire channel and I thought he's still making videos.
Right?

32
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.090
If he's not making any money,

33
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.320
they took all his ad money away because he electrocuted a dead rat.

34
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.790
No.
Yes.
He did a video yesterday at two and a half.
A million views.
So,

35
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.730
but he doesn't get paid.
No,

36
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.250
there were saying that it's his entire channel was demonetized unless he got

37
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:51.084
lawyers involved.

38
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.900
So then he could be just using his channel and then getting sponsored videos,

39
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.190
maybe money and selling merchant,
which is one of the big things to me,

40
00:01:59.191 --> 00:01:59.820
it's stunning.

41
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.030
Makes more unmerge probably then he doesn't from fucking youtube probably does

42
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.140
it.
To me it's stunning that there's not a competitor to Youtube.

43
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.220
Not a real competitor.
Yeah,
there's been tried.
They've tried.
It's crazy.

44
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.540
Vimeo is just not,
not happening.
Well it's a video hosting site,
but it's not,

45
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.670
it's not as user friendly.
Well,

46
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:21.370
it's also doesn't suggest things their algorithm that youtube is telling about

47
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.760
to having what's next on the right hand side.

48
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.540
It's like so attractive because there's always something there to click on Vimeo

49
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:29.820
does dot.
Isn't that they're not as sophisticated in that way.

50
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:33.110
They want to be the artistic,
uh,
you know,
co Coulter,

51
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.790
they want to cultivate like the sexy little artistic thing.
Youtube is like,

52
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:40.080
fuck it.
Here's everything we've,
you've ever wanted to see.
And ads for tampons.

53
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.150
We had,
um,
W W we're putting up every video on Vimeo as well as on Youtube.

54
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.900
But on youtube it will have over a million videos,
a million hits.

55
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.590
And then you go to Vimeo and the same video we'll have like,
what,
20,
30,000,

56
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.970
20,000.
Yeah,
that's,
I was gonna say,
cause there,
there's is so sick,

57
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.470
their viewer traffic is so much lower.
It's so much lower.

58
00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:01.660
The only time I've watched Vimeo is when someone sends me a Vimeo link.

59
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.580
And you've got to think that video link is being sent to whatever million people

60
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:08.080
I have on Twitter.
Totally.

61
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.050
I have like 2 million people in 2 million Russian bots.

62
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.640
I'm not sure which one.
They're all bought suits.
I don't,

63
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:18.550
I don't know how that works.
And even about some of them,
they say it's,

64
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:20.740
if you haven't used it to post,

65
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.010
but there's a lot of people that use Twitter and they don't post.
So like,

66
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:28.240
how do you know if someone's a Bot,
like there's some suspicion of their,
um,

67
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.180
their detection methods to decide who's high.

68
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.430
Always can tell when you look at their fucking profile,

69
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.410
the stuff they write is so funny.
Oh,
there's definitely some of those.

70
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.120
You know what,
I get a lot of those on Instagram.
Get a lot of those.
Really?
Yeah.

71
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:43.240
Yeah.
Weird.
Like fake comments,
you know,
like a,

72
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:46.510
I learned how to make $109 a week.
It's all over the place.

73
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.890
Those things are everywhere.

74
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>
