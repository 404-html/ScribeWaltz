1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.760
The joe rogan experience.
Um,
how much did you pay attention to Mckenna's theory?

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.700
Uh,
about,
uh,
the evolution of the human brain,

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.960
of the stoned ape theory that I looked at it.
Um,

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.270
but I,

5
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.960
I found I didn't find it persuasive and in fact if you press Terence Mckenna,

6
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:21.030
he didn't find an entirely persuasive,
it's a very,

7
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:23.670
it's an interesting speculation.
It's kind of a mind game.

8
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.370
I don't see how I can see how,
uh,

9
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.510
psychedelics would influence the mind and,
and,
and,

10
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.210
and create new ideas,

11
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:36.900
new memes and Mike contribute to language.

12
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.250
But how does it get into the genes?
That's what I,
I the genes,
the genes.

13
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:45.120
Cause he said it changed us at the genetic level.
I see.

14
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:49.350
Psychedelics is having had a profound effect at the level of cultural evolution

15
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.650
that there are lots of interesting innovations that people who had psychedelic

16
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:59.280
experience introduced to our culture.
We talked about religion earlier.

17
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:02.370
That could be one.
A,
I had a wonderful interview with Stewart brand,

18
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:05.280
the founder of the whole earth catalog and his insight.

19
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:10.281
He had this profound insight during a psychedelic trip on the roof of his house.

20
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:14.370
In North beach and he saw the curvature of the earth in a way he hadn't before.

21
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.140
And he said,
God,
if we could have a phone,

22
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.010
this is 1966 we had never seen a picture of the earth from space yet.

23
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.410
And he said,
if we had a picture of the earth from space,

24
00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:26.580
and we could see it as this round space ship,
that would change everything.

25
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:30.600
Because if you think of the earth is flat,
as most of us instinctively do,

26
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.510
it's endless.
There's endless resources.
Uh,

27
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:35.670
you don't have to worry about limits in any way.

28
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.920
But if we had that image and he realized,

29
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
I have to start a campaign to get NASA to turn the cameras around,

30
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:44.770
they're on their way to the moon.
Show us the earth from space.
And he said,
I,

31
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.690
I'm going to make a campaign.
I know.
And he's,
you know,
this is not an LSD.

32
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.003
I'll make a button.

33
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.360
Very important medium in 1966 I'll make a button and what should the button say?

34
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:56.730
It should be a little paranoid to get people's attention.

35
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.630
Why haven't they shown us an image of the earth from space.
Yeah.

36
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:02.310
That's what he would do.
And he started a campaign.

37
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:05.910
He started selling these buttons and the campaign got in the newspapers and it

38
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:07.470
goes viral as you know,

39
00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:12.471
as viral as you could get in 1966 and two years later and NASA produce that

40
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:16.740
image and he put it on the whole earth catalog and that image galvanize the

41
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:17.670
environmental movement.

42
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.770
So it's those kind of memes that psychedelics introduces into culture and that

43
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:26.260
changes culture,
that image changed culture.
Um,

44
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.010
and I think there are hundreds of them.
I mean,

45
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:32.580
Steve Jobs talked about his use of LSD is very important to his,
uh,

46
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.320
formative experience.
And in fact,

47
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:38.070
there's a whole tradition of computer engineers going back to the 50s using LSD

48
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:40.230
that I wrote about in the book.
So,

49
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:45.231
but I don't see how we were selected genetically because of the,

50
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:49.630
there was an advantage to the people who were taking a lot of psychedelics.
Um,

51
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.740
that's where he lives at me.
Maybe I'm misrepresenting it.

52
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.710
His theory is that it coincides with climate change and these uh,

53
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.400
lower hominids experiencing experimenting

54
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.840
<v 1>with different food sources.
So as the rain forest receded into grasslands,</v>

55
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.210
they started experimenting by flipping over cow patties and finding grubs and

56
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:12.730
perhaps even mushrooms that were growing on these cow patties.

57
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.330
And his theory was that there's a bunch of different benefits,

58
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:20.880
one low doses of silicide but have been shown to increased visual acuity which

59
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.990
make it the hunting dogs in certain cultures.
Yes.
Yeah.
Make you a better hunter,

60
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.450
make you more in tune with what you're doing,
um,
that it would make you more,

61
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.250
it would a central nervous system arousal including sexual arousal,

62
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.740
make you more horny,
which would make you productive,
appropriate more often.

63
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.570
And that the,

64
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.600
the very unusual effect that psilocybin has on the mind could have led to

65
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:46.540
language and could have also led to the expansion of neurons,

66
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.180
the Dutch language to me,
Brainard of cultural evolution.
Sure.
Yeah.

67
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.670
The doubling of the human brain size though,
was it?

68
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.750
The particular thing is that it coincided,
according to the Mckenna,

69
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.020
it's been there.
There's a lot of people that disagree with him,

70
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.470
but his brother makes a very compelling case for him.
His brother Dennis,

71
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:04.810
who is still alive and it's brilliant,
brilliant guy.

72
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.270
He talked about it on this podcast.

73
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:12.271
He talked about his take on the stone or a stoned ape theory scientifically,

74
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:14.530
why he believes it's really what happened,

75
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.690
but that it does coincide with the change in climate of these,
these,
you know,

76
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.500
eight black people trying out different things and that the doubling of the

77
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:26.470
human brain size over a period of 2 million years is like one of the greatest

78
00:04:26.471 --> 00:04:29.440
mysteries in the entire fossil record.
Their alternative theories,
I mean,

79
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:33.750
I wrote it all coincide.
Maybe cooking with fire.
Yes,

80
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.880
you can explain the increase in the brain size because you get more nutritional

81
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:40.320
value from cooked food,
the throwing arm,
the,
the,

82
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.050
the desire to hunt all these different animals and the calculating all these

83
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:47.210
different ways to do that.
And communication.
I think there's cooperation.

84
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.460
A bunch of coinciding fat and it may well be that,
that,
uh,

85
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.510
people were eating everything right?
Our ancestors,
it's amazing what they ate.

86
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.740
And,
uh,
and no doubt they ate psychedelic mushrooms and no doubt.
I mean,

87
00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:02.870
he also believed that language was a form of synesthesia.
You know,

88
00:05:02.871 --> 00:05:07.110
in the way that synesthesia you can smell a musical note or something like that,

89
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.800
that you're taking a sound,
a meaningless sound,
uh,
you know,
um,

90
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.581
and,

91
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:17.581
and you're attaching it to a concept that maybe that happened on a suicide been,

92
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.920
but at a bunch of ideas that never panned out.
He was,
he was,

93
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.000
he was in audibly creative person and yeah.
And,
uh,

94
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.320
and they're all,
you know,
really interesting to think about some of the,

95
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.910
I think you could probably discredit based on what we understand about genes and

96
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:36.520
evolution,
but others are just really provocative.

97
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.550
That's where his brother comes in.
This is brothers and sisters to scientists,

98
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:40.960
strict scientists and doesn't,

99
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.220
he doesn't tolerate any of the woo and straight and he's skeptical of some of

100
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.910
his brother's ideas to open.
Yeah.
I mean loved his brother,
but he was like,
oh,

101
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.490
how a lot of things that weren't really accurate,

102
00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:52.890
but also Terence Mckenna to would say,
well,
you know,

103
00:05:52.891 --> 00:05:57.320
I'm just putting these ideas out there.
The guy was a constant pot user.

104
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.260
He was constantly doing psychedelics and really good talker.

105
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.700
He would have a podcast now,
right?
Oh,
it would be amazing.
Yeah.
Yeah,
for sure.

106
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:09.480
I promote the shit out.
I would too.
Yeah.
I mean,
he was a fun guy to listen to.

107
00:06:09.481 --> 00:06:10.760
You talk and there's a,

108
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.350
there's a podcast called the psychedelic salon that my friend Lorenzo hosts that

109
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:20.351
has pretty much every Terence Mckenna lecture and speeches ever done available

110
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:21.710
for free.
You can download it.

111
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.170
And Lorenzo is taking these and digitally remastered them.

112
00:06:25.171 --> 00:06:27.800
So the sound is better and it's really awesome that,
that,

113
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:32.090
that he's got this resource.
But the idea that these,
uh,

114
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.930
lower hominids experienced ancient hominids experienced,

115
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.850
experimented rather with silicide,

116
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:42.851
but then this was what advanced culture or advanced language advanced their

117
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:46.010
understanding of each other.
It's a very,
very compelling idea.

118
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.940
<v 0>Yeah,
it is.
And I think,
I mean,
the way I think about drugs like second,</v>

119
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:54.160
Alex in evolution in the same way,
like in genetic evolution,

120
00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:58.720
radiation causes mutations and some of those mutations turned out to be really

121
00:06:58.721 --> 00:07:01.030
valuable.
You know,
purely by accident.

122
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:06.031
Some great new trait is introduced to the species and it increases fitness and

123
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.330
that person or that individual lives on in the cultural realm,

124
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.600
psychedelics are like radiation there mutagens they create change variation and

125
00:07:16.151 --> 00:07:20.230
that advanced is cultural evolution.
Um,
all that variation,

126
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.850
all those wild ideas,
99% of them are stupid and useless.

127
00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:29.310
I'll bet.
But that 1% can change the world.
Yeah,
absolutely.

128
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:33.930
<v 2>Okay.</v>
