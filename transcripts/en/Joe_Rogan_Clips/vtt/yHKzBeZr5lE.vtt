00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.300
Uh,
Tim Kennedy,
who was a guest of mine recently,

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.700
a friend of mine said something very profound.
He said,

3
00:00:06.701 --> 00:00:11.170
hard times make tough men.
Easy Times make weak men.

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.330
Yeah,
but hard men make easy times.
Eh,
you know,

5
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.040
Nice.
You think about it that way.
Hard,
hard times make tough men.

6
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.460
Tough men make easy times.
Easy Times make weak men.

7
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.810
Yeah.
It's like a

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.970
<v 1>grow cycle riding.
When people are always like,
kids today,</v>

9
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.830
these kids today don't know.

10
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.430
Well it's because they haven't gone through it now you can't.

11
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.760
You can't manufacture that for them.
My Grandmother,
this is a funny story on uh,

12
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.960
on nine 11,
I was a,
in New York,
it was at Newark.

13
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.170
You don't hear that a lot.
By the way.
This is a funny story.
Nine 11,

14
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.420
but I was at Newark.

15
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:56.421
I was flying out that day and we watched the second plane fly into the,

16
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.380
you saw the second one.
I saw it,
saw it on television at Newark.

17
00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:02.550
You look right across it.

18
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:06.210
You were looking at you actually literally across our 100%.

19
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.470
I was the first plane it hook was going through your mind when you saw it?
Well,

20
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:13.200
the first one hit on before we got there,

21
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:18.201
before I got there and I walked with a pilot down like through the airport and

22
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:22.170
he said,
yeah,
I think it was a Cessna,
you know,
just kind of crazy.
And I'm,

23
00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:24.720
so I'm down there and I'm,
I was at the,

24
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.960
at the desk and I said I was going to Chicago and I said to the woman working

25
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:35.240
the thing,
I said,
do you think we're going to fly out today?
Uh,
you know,

26
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.010
do you think we're going to actually get out?
And a guy yells,

27
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.500
here comes another one.
This man,

28
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:45.501
just like businessmen and we all turn and you could just see it streaking across

29
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.080
right into the small,
the public plane look small,
but you just

30
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.770
insane.
So I sit down,
I just sat,
we just,

31
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.940
and I was sitting with an artist,
I'm a middle aged man who was an artist and a,

32
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.770
and then we heard about the Pentagon as we were sitting there and he opened up

33
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:07.260
his little art case and it had all these razors in it,

34
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.710
like razor blades and stuff from his artwork.
Like,
you know,

35
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:14.280
he's a commercial artist and he's like,
this is all going to change.
She said,

36
00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:15.480
you know,
people are just,

37
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.590
they let me on the plane with this and we're just sitting there like just

38
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.170
freaked out,
like calm but freaked out.

39
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.730
And I was calling my wife who was in New York and I woke her up and we were

40
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:30.690
trying to,
you know,
talk and she was going to the thing.
And uh,

41
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:34.470
at one point that the artists I was sitting with just looked at me like in my

42
00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:37.380
eyes,
like we were trying to understand what was happening.
He said,

43
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.630
I think we should go home now.
I was like,
yeah,
yeah,
right.

44
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.210
Of course we should after sitting there for 20 minutes.

45
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.200
So I can't get back into New York.
I can't get back into the city.

46
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:51.960
Time's gone gone by.

47
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:56.430
And my man on a cat in a cab going up the parkway in New Jersey and there's just

48
00:02:56.431 --> 00:03:01.300
dust where the towers were.
And I'm like,
Holy Shit.
So I can't get in.

49
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:06.301
So I go to my Nana's house who lives in by giant stadium and uh,

50
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.540
cause she's the closest to the city.
I can't get into the city.
So this,
uh,

51
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.710
this driver takes,

52
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.870
it takes us over and I get to my Nana's house and she's so excited to see me

53
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.010
because her grandsons visiting and she lives alone.
Now.

54
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:25.630
My father grandfather had passed and I'm sitting in front of the TV and I'm
like,

55
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.830
Nana,
like at first I hugged her and I was like all weepy.
Like I was shaking,

56
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:32.350
you know,
I didn't know what was happening.
And she's like,
oh,

57
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:36.850
it's so nice to see you get in here.
It was that visit.
This is so great.
I'm like,

58
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.380
did you see what's happening?
She's like,
ah,
I know.
It's a crazy world.
And,
uh,

59
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.140
I sit in their little tiny living room,

60
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:47.130
den area and we have the TV on and uh,

61
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.460
she's trying to talk to me and I'm trying to watch the television and she,

62
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:56.010
this is the World War II mentality.
Uh,
I,
I'm like,
yeah man,

63
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.560
I'm kind of avoiding talking to her.
And she goes,
all right,
well look,

64
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:03.040
I have a bridge game,
a card game with my lady friends here.

65
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:05.500
Take half of my sandwich.
She reached her open,

66
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:08.920
her Tim Tinfoil gave me half of her tuna fish sandwich.
You eat this,

67
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:11.530
I'm going to go play cards with my friends and we'll have dinner after you'll be

68
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:15.640
okay.
And she,
and she walks out.
Wow.
But they were tough.

69
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:19.660
They dealt with so much.
I hadn't dealt with anything.
I'm freaking out,

70
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.180
not even freaking out.
She's like,
it's a crazy world.

71
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.780
And this was,
she wasn't like,
you know,
Alzheimer's.
She was just,
hey,
you know,

72
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:29.960
it is what,
it has

73
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.740
<v 0>lost a couple of buildings and a few thousand people.
There's half a sandwich.</v>

74
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:34.723
I'm going to go play.

75
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.480
<v 1>I'm going to play bridge.
We've got to keep moving.
Okay.
Tomorrow's another day,</v>

76
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.030
but that's how they live.
Both my grandmothers in that way,

77
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:42.790
just completely like plow ahead,
plow ahead.

78
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.540
Don't get caught up thinking about everything that's happening because there's

79
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:49.510
no sense in it.
We've done that before and you get nowhere,

80
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.270
so let's just keep going this way.
Yeah.
Wow.

81
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.680
<v 0>Having a war that affected people the way World War II did with the entire</v>

82
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:02.290
nature,
not just the entire nation was involved,

83
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:06.010
but the whole world was involved in this conflict to stop evil.
Yeah.

84
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.520
It was a different time.
You had an evil doer.
Yeah.
You had a real,

85
00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:12.730
I mean obviously isis is evil.

86
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.230
Obviously North Korea,
there's a lot of evil in the world.

87
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.450
It's not like this evil empire that's invading Europe and dropping bombs on

88
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:24.130
people.
It's not the same.

89
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:29.131
It's not no Nazis that believe in eugenics and wanted to create an area in race

90
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:30.271
<v 1>that was putting,</v>

91
00:05:30.271 --> 00:05:34.170
handling my hams and not stopping the spreading telling people were coming

92
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.620
<v 0>and they were the most sophisticated in terms of engineering and like,</v>

93
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.960
I mean they,
they to this day,
I mean,

94
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:45.940
where do you get all the fucking an engineer's in terms of uh,
like automobiles,

95
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.330
top end,
like Audi,
BMW,

96
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.110
there's those people were making shit for Nazis back then.
Yeah.

97
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.560
They were co opted by the regime.
Did you ever see like one of Hitler's cars?

98
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.950
There's a Audi from like 1930.

99
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.580
[inaudible] it was made for Hitler.
Yeah.

100
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.820
It's like they were designing engines,

101
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.520
planes and they were super sophisticated assistants.

102
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.800
Super advanced now and you'll have this real,
you had this real,
yeah.

103
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.930
Evil Focus.
Like it was like,
okay,

104
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.830
the world has got to come and go get this one guy.
I don't know.

105
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.461
I mean I wasn't there,

106
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:26.150
but it seems more black and white and the way the world is not sure.
I mean,

107
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:29.840
there was a thing called operation paperclip that happened,
um,

108
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.460
where after the war we scooped up all these Nazi scientists secretly,

109
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.240
and some of them were like legit,
like Wernher von Braun,

110
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:42.650
the guy who was in charge of NASA.
He was a Nazi rally.

111
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.820
100%.
The Simon Wiesenthal Center said that if he was alive today,

112
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:49.310
they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity.

113
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.180
And he was the head of NASA.
He was the head of NASA.
Geez.
Yeah.

114
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:54.720
They took monsters.
Wow.

115
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.030
And they brought those monsters over here and those monsters helped us make up

116
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.300
the Apollo rockets cheese.

117
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.010
And then some of the monsters went to the Soviet Union.

118
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.900
They took some of those monsters can hills.
Where I mean in,

119
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.340
there's no reason to whitewash that either.
Those were real monsters.

120
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.700
They hung the five slow as Jews every day in front of the,

121
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.760
of the rocket factory in Berlin where Wernher von Braun was making rockets for

122
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.990
the Nazis.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

123
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.720
They had these Jews that were slaves that worked as well.

124
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.530
I mean there's people that were alive today that have those tattoos in their

125
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:32.450
arms that talked about meeting him there and shaking hands and they,

126
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.870
they would hang the slowest workers.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

127
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.750
In the front of the factory and the skinny now keeps going to work.

128
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:44.540
It doesn't split.
It doesn't leave a country.
W what did you do?
And then,
um,

129
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.480
in Nazi Germany,
how the fuck did you get out?
You were a slave?
No,

130
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:53.750
not the choose talking about bearing the guys who are on Braun because we were

131
00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:55.600
working for the,
uh,
for the company.

132
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.000
Like to see the people being hung and still hang in there.
They were Nazis.

133
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.090
I mean he was a Nazi.
We're all in.
Yeah.
I mean,

134
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.200
whether or not he agreed with the ideology wholeheartedly.
I mean,

135
00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:07.430
I didn't have a conversation with him.

136
00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:11.580
I Dunno if he was doing for pragmatic purposes cause was frightened or whatever.

137
00:08:11.581 --> 00:08:16.040
Yeah.
But get a disguise.
Get out of there.
I don't think they could,
you know,

138
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.200
one of those glasses with the mustaches does that work?
Or you go to the airport,

139
00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:25.010
you get on a flight.
Come to
you,
take it off.
They're like,
oh,

140
00:08:25.011 --> 00:08:28.850
it's like with NASA guy.
Well,
this is like a socket.
There was a slow slide,

141
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:33.290
I'm sure into that.
I mean,
the,
the slot,
what wasn't that slow,

142
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:37.310
but from world war one or World War II was it escalated?

143
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:41.900
Yeah.
I think it just got to this point where they're like,
oh my God.

144
00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:42.740
Like what are we doing?

145
00:08:42.741 --> 00:08:46.520
When they started having concentration camps and killing all these Jews,

146
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.220
God terrifying.
And those,

147
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.550
so we took a lot of those guys brought him over here.
They worked for,

148
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.080
worked for the U S government.
