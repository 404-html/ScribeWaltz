00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.020
I don't know.
I wonder if the public versus the private punishment,

2
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:05.760
if that ever really works on Weirdos,

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.700
would it stop men from murdering?
I mean,
I don't know.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.250
I think people that do it get caught up and when they would call crimes of

5
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:18.810
passion,
right?
I don't like that.

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.070
I think they get caught up in this moment and they just can't help themselves

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.130
and they want to kill someone more than they want to be free.

8
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.180
They just want to kill this motherfucker.

9
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.050
He said the deal without law shit later.

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.400
Right now I've got a rock and that dude's got ahead.
I need to connect this rock.

11
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.840
That guy's fucking hood.

12
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.530
What's this last public hanging in Kentucky in 1936 she is like,

13
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:45.360
how many people showed up?
Whoa.

14
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.800
Humans like that stuff.
We love to see it.
They love it.

15
00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:52.240
Look at those guys climbing up on trees and shit in the background.

16
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.510
I'm going be that guy.
You gotta good look can't here.

17
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.820
There's one other one too is this is in France in 1939 said Guillotine on this

18
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.130
and you know what the guillotine that it wasn't a clean cut the first time and

19
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:10.540
they'd have to do it a few times.
Oh really?
Uh Huh.

20
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.760
Not always a good they had that.
You always hoped for a sharp blade.

21
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.660
Yeah.
That's the last public execution in France.
Yeah,

22
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.500
that's what it says.
What year was that?
1939 whoa.

23
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.960
39 whoa.
Is there a video of his as he was a German criminal?

24
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.610
I don't say shit.
Cut his head off.
Wow.
That's crazy.

25
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.130
Well,
don't really have the box in there to people's ago.
Joe Was your thing.
Yeah.

26
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.540
The United States is founded three people's ago.
That's true.

27
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.260
That's crazy.
That's what's hard to really understand.

28
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.730
How much cultural evolution has taken place just during our lifetime.

29
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.660
It's hard to imagine.
It's hard to imagine what,
what year were you born?

30
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.760
76 you could,

31
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:04.320
could you imagine if you had a time machine and you can go back to 1976 and just

32
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:07.470
wander around the streets and see what people were like,
oh my God,

33
00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:11.520
you guys are children.
He don't know shit.
You have no internet.
You barely read.

34
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.880
I know.
What'd he do?
Sorry,
what's that?

35
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.500
There's a video of that video,
but let's say it,
I'm going,

36
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.170
all these people gathered around gather round,

37
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.810
fixing to drop the hammer.
Oh,
here it is.
Oh,

38
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.190
they get them in there.
Get in there,
bitch.

39
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.830
The German ready,
and

40
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.040
we'll do that again.
Show that again.

41
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.310
Get them in there.
And

42
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.880
that is a crazy way to kill someone.
Yes.
Leave it to the French.

43
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.340
Well,
it's efficient.
I think that's why teen is,

44
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.320
this is what we do to machine we do not do is with our hands.

45
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.200
You see with the machine.
