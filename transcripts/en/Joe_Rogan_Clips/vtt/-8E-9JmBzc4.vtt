1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.790
I don't,
I don't know.
I,
I can agree with the general notion.
Yeah.

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.900
The ideology of if it's legal,
it's allowed.
Right.
Um,
and I would,

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.070
I would argue that,
you know,

4
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:10.440
what Jack is trying to do with Twitter or I won't say him personally,

5
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:12.840
but what Twitter is trying to do is what creates like a comfy,

6
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:16.080
padded neon room for the kids to hang out at another real world is harsh.

7
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.470
You know,
what they're trying to do.
And I don't want to speak for him,

8
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:22.500
but I think they're trying to engineer the conversation to be more polite and

9
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:26.430
civil says who exactly.
You know,
who's,
who's definition.
That's a good point.

10
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.640
And that's,
and that's,
that's I,
I see so many of these people who just,

11
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:32.670
they wield power and they're unaccountable.
Well,
it's also,

12
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:35.670
you don't recognize the consequences of telling people what they can and can't

13
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:38.340
do and that it's,
this is a very slippery slope.

14
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.840
You running up a greased hill and people don't like it.
They don't like it.
And,

15
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.670
well the,
the thing is like
when you see something,

16
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:51.210
like if,
if everything was just open,

17
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.660
what would the conversation would be like if there was no banning,

18
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.830
if there was nothing,

19
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.110
it was just everything was real free speech you would have,

20
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.230
I mean if there was,
if it was impossible,
let's put it this way,

21
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.670
it was impossible to ban someone from any social media platform,

22
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:10.950
whether it's youtube or Twitter or Instagram.

23
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.770
What would the conversations look like?

24
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.570
How much different would they be and would we maybe have a healthier way of

25
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:22.950
adjusting?
I think it would be worse,
worse because um,
I could,

26
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:27.920
I could be temporary or in the long run may be temporary,
but there,

27
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.840
I believe it's called the online inhibition effect.

28
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.500
Basically the opportunity to be anonymous online and the,
and the,

29
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.310
and the distance makes people,
they have no problem being their worst self.
Yeah.

30
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.850
And so I can understand what Twitter wants to do.
They say,
hey,

31
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:44.490
we need to figure out how we stopped people from being mean all the time.
Right.

32
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.353
Because Twitter is,

33
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.240
it's a hellscape of just mean people saying nothing would mean things.

34
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.140
But it's also again,
because they're anonymous and because it's possible.

35
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.240
But then look,

36
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.200
Alex Jones can can say a bunch of really awful things.
It's his right to do so.

37
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:02.250
Should it be bent?
He shouldn't.
If so it does.

38
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:04.640
Does Alex Jones?
Uh,
I'm not,

39
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.950
I don't want a directly accused him cause I don't watch his show.
But if,

40
00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:10.140
if he goes on Twitter and he said something that's deemed to be false shitty

41
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:12.810
band for that,
no.
If he,
if he challenges a journalist,

42
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.630
should it be banned for that?
No,
because let me tell you,

43
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.310
because he says things about me that aren't true and you shouldn't,

44
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.460
I don't think it should be right.
I think,

45
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.480
and he's saying the things about me and I don't think he should be better.

46
00:02:23.481 --> 00:02:27.720
I think Alex,
I think we should talk,
we should have a conversation.

47
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.930
I watched those videos.
Go ahead.
He's upset,

48
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.390
he's upset and I get it in certain ways.

49
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.000
I get it and he thinks I took a shot at him and I get it.

50
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.300
And I probably did and I shouldn't have.
So,
so here's,
here's the thing.

51
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.320
My point is I don't think you should be banned.
Right?
And it's,

52
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.980
he's doing it at me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
like I mentioned,

53
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:49.140
those people from occupy who lie about me all the time,

54
00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:50.610
they've posted the most ridiculous lies about me.

55
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:52.350
I still don't think it should be banned.
Right.
Does it?

56
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.370
The thing is if you band them and then someone opposes them,

57
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.520
but then someone opposes the people who opposed them and they want them banned

58
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.100
and then you have this fucking war back and forth.

59
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.400
And instead of fighting bad ideas or incorrect ideas with correct or good ideas,

60
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.050
now you just have people present.

61
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:13.210
Banhammer is left and right and you're just trying to figure out who the

62
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:13.751
majority is.

63
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:17.620
So you can side with the biggest group and you're trying to virtue signal and

64
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:20.020
you're trying to get something that supports your ideology,

65
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:22.320
whether it's right or left.
So,
so here's the thing with Jones though,

66
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.860
if the people on the left one to argue that he is making the platform worse and,

67
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:31.170
and horrible,
I understand that.
And I recognize,
well,
that's unfortunate,
right?

68
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.600
This is the real world.
And sometimes people say things you don't like,

69
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.590
but more importantly,
a lot of people argued that when he,
when he said,
you know,

70
00:03:37.591 --> 00:03:40.020
he said something about Sandy Hook,
which again,
I haven't seen the videos,

71
00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:43.050
but they've,
they see he's been sued.
They said that.
He said,

72
00:03:43.051 --> 00:03:47.340
I know it never happened.
So,
so what is fake news to be band?

73
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.130
While many people were saying,
yes,
Facebook needs to ban fake news.

74
00:03:50.131 --> 00:03:52.950
But think about what that means.
It means you're now allowed to be wrong.
Okay.

75
00:03:52.951 --> 00:03:55.980
Because fake news doesn't mean you did it on purpose.
More importantly,

76
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.780
you're not allowed to be stupid.
Well,

77
00:03:57.781 --> 00:04:00.360
here's another thing again in defense of Alex,

78
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.650
one thing that Alex did do is in the future after,

79
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:07.620
after he was done saying the things that he said about Sandy Hook,

80
00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:10.640
he then said it definitely happened.
So he,

81
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.930
so he corrected his course and there's no,

82
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.490
is there a path for redemption when you correct your course?
And if there's not,

83
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.130
what are we doing?
Cause we're not treating people like human beings.

84
00:04:20.131 --> 00:04:24.390
Then whether it's my low or whether it's anybody.
And,

85
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.420
uh,
I,
I'm sorry to cut you off,
but path to redemption is so fucking critical.
Yes.
