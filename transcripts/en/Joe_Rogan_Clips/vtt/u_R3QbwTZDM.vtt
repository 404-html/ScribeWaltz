00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.230
The joe rogan experience,
the,
the,

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.240
the history of the human race is so weird in terms of the rise and fall of these

3
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:13.130
civilizations and cultures that were always,
uh,

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.900
at least I am always looking at like what,
how long is this going to last?

5
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.310
Like how long has this one particular nation going to keep it together?

6
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.490
And if you look at how many different countries have been around that,

7
00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:28.750
just how many,
you know,
w a dominant culture is Rome for instance.

8
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.090
Like the just now it's just Italy.
It's just normal,
you know,

9
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:37.120
it's like a normal European country.
It used to be this conquering nation.

10
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.003
Like how,

11
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.020
how long can we kind of keep this thing up and what are your thoughts on the

12
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.290
future of,
of just even the idea of nations.

13
00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:50.570
It seems like our bout our boundaries and our borders,

14
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.990
the way we have a online,

15
00:00:52.991 --> 00:00:56.680
this ability to communicate with people all over the place,
everywhere.

16
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.920
It seems to me to lessen the necessary or the need rather for for borders and

17
00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:04.330
for,

18
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.330
for these walls that we're now literally and figuratively talking about putting

19
00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:10.594
up,

20
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.780
<v 1>you guys going to be a,
a kind of a balance.
It's,
I mean,</v>

21
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.300
an interesting thing about nation states now is that there,

22
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.700
there's this a sense of which they're treated as immortal.
Ah Ha.

23
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.120
That whereas as you mentioned for most of history,

24
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:28.560
they were conquering emperors and a nation.

25
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.620
Nations were wiped off the map and engulfed and conquered.
And you know,

26
00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:35.160
now you look at a map of the world and uh,

27
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.710
it's actually not that different from what it was 70 years ago.

28
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.230
I mean their colonies that achieved independence.

29
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.310
There's some big states like Soviet Union that brought fragmented,

30
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.630
but the borders in between the wrist,

31
00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:51.631
Soviet republics are now borders between nation states and no nation has gone

32
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:56.340
out of existence through conquest since this is 1945,
uh,

33
00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:59.880
at least record internationally recognized state by the,
by the UN.

34
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.120
So there's this norm,
even though the borders are often,
you know,

35
00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:06.450
crazy then they were arbitrary lines drawn a map.

36
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.910
But one of the reasons that,
um,
again,

37
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:12.600
this is counter intuitive that wars have gone down and deaths and wars have gone

38
00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:13.140
down,

39
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.880
is that borders are now treated as sacrosanct by the kind of international

40
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:22.560
community.
Not 100% of the time you had Russia,
uh,
annexing Crimea.

41
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.290
But those are exceptions.
But by and large,

42
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.130
unlike say in the past in the 19th century where the u s had a,

43
00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:32.750
an unpaid debt from Mexico.
So it conquered,
you know,

44
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.630
Texas and Colorado and kick in Nevada and California.

45
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.340
That doesn't happen anymore.

46
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.890
And so the borders are kind of been grandfathered in.

47
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:43.920
And that's one of the reasons why the,
uh,
the,
the,

48
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:47.550
the world has been more stable in terms of the,
uh,
the,
the map.
On the other hand,

49
00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:52.170
as you mentioned,
there's another sense in which we have this global community.

50
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:55.650
The trick transcends borders.
We have things like the European Union,

51
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.220
we have the United Nations,
we have a trade agreements like Nafta,

52
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.780
which tried to get simultaneously the grandfathered borders,

53
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.880
but this extra layer of cooperation that transcends the borders.

54
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.740
And we need the more and more despite the fact that our current president is

55
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.800
pushing back against the global community.
Uh,

56
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.060
but because there are problems that are global that my migration,
terrorism,

57
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.680
climate pollution,
rogue states,
and the fact that people,
even if they,

58
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.760
even if you grew up in France and you consider yourself a French citizen,

59
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.060
you want to be able to spend a summer in,
um,
you know,
in,

60
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:37.040
in Italy or in England or in Belgium,
if,

61
00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:41.020
if that's where there's a good job and there's a desire among people to be able

62
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:43.510
to move to wherever the opportunities are best.

63
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.340
So there's going to be some kind of compromise I think between keeping the,
the,

64
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.701
the,

65
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:52.570
the nation state borders just so you don't have constant wars of conquest and

66
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:53.560
border disputes,

67
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.640
but allowing the world and allowing the people of the world to take advantage of

68
00:03:57.641 --> 00:03:58.900
a true global community.

69
00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.561
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:02.860
I feel like that's one of the things that people were most upset about Brexit

71
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.880
was that this is a,
the,
even though they,

72
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.240
the people that were pro Brexit felt like this was in the interest of the UK and

73
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:16.090
the interest of England to be separate from all this because they were doing

74
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:20.290
better and because they didn't want all the negative possibilities from all

75
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:24.730
these other places coming into their environment.
But the,

76
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.890
what I think that people,

77
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.160
what they didn't like about it was the idea that this is a,
uh,

78
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.170
a regressive move and that the progressive move is that we would all move

79
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:37.930
towards,
uh,

80
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.960
this idea of a global community of this entire world being free and connected.

81
00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:47.530
And you know,
we've talked about,
um,

82
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.160
some of the problems that Paris has with a immigration.

83
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:53.620
We showed some of the videos of these,
uh,

84
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:57.310
these immigrants that had just littered all over the street and taking this

85
00:04:57.311 --> 00:05:00.760
place apart and we're looking at it going,
man,
that is a,
that is a real tragedy.

86
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.030
But what it represents is a bunch of people that really don't have anything.

87
00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:09.190
Like the real tragedy is that these people live like this.

88
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.740
And the real tragedy is not that they've done it to Paris,

89
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.430
the real tragedies that these people exist at all and that they moved to Paris

90
00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:18.880
looking for a better life and now they're stuck in this situation where you
know,

91
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:21.850
there's not a lot of sanitation and the garbage is all over the place.

92
00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:24.900
They're littering everywhere.
And it's,

93
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.390
I wonder if we ever will have a world where there isn't a place where you can go

94
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:36.550
and ship a factory and pay people a dollar an hour because they don't need a

95
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:41.350
dollar an hour because it's just like living in Los Angeles or just like living

96
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:42.460
in Phoenix.

97
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.340
Like you'd never be able to pay someone a dollar an hour because there's too

98
00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:49.600
much opportunity.
The world has caught up and surpassed it.

99
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.390
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean there's a number of,
of a really complicated issues that they,</v>

100
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.861
you know,

101
00:05:55.861 --> 00:05:59.760
mobility is in general a good thing and countries do well when they welcome any

102
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.670
immigrants,
but,
you know,
not,
not on the short term.
Yeah.
Not too many,
too fast.

103
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.680
Faster than they can be assimilated and integrated into the new country.
So it,

104
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:13.190
just opening the doors right.
Probably is not a good idea.

105
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:17.660
No country really does that,
but building the wall is a terrible idea to,

106
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.340
uh,
and of course the,
the,
the,
the best way to prevent,
uh,
you know,

107
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:23.330
massive amounts of,

108
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:28.331
of migration is to make life better in the countries of origin that is happening

109
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.510
slowly and unevenly.
But it's been noted that even United States in Mexico,

110
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:35.000
more people,
uh,
are going,
uh,

111
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.680
or the same number of people are doing the reverse migration from the u s back

112
00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:43.550
to Mexico now that the economy of Mexico is so much my own parents,
25 years.

113
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.320
Okay.
Yeah.
My parents live in Mexico.
Okay.
There you go.
Yeah.
Um,
and there is,

114
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.280
uh,
a,
um,
a hard to detect,

115
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:55.460
but there is a huge improvement in the standard of living in what used to be

116
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:59.720
called the third world,
the developing world where,
um,
the,

117
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.930
if you look at the cutoff for extreme poverty,
it's kind of defined,

118
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.070
defined somewhat arbitrarily is a dollar 90 per person per day,
kind of the bare,

119
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.570
bare,
bare minimum to feed,
feed your family.
Uh,

120
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.060
it's down now from a 50% a few decades ago to 10% now and the United Nations to

121
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:21.020
set the goal of bringing it to zero by the year 2030.
And what street?

122
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:25.310
What is causing that?
What's causing the change?
So a lot of it is,
um,

123
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.920
globalization that I'm,

124
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.630
even though that's kind of a villain in many people's eyes,
but when you have,
uh,

125
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.380
uh,
a huge global market than a,
and the introduction of,
of,
uh,

126
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.850
factories and industrialization in China,
in India and Bangladesh,

127
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.800
sometimes the conditions are grim.

128
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.370
But the conditions being a peasant in the rice patties was even grimmer.

129
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.220
And when,
when you have,
uh,
people integrated to the economy,

130
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.360
selling their products on a world stage,
uh,
they can get richer.

131
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.640
And so a lot also better policies.
We have governments that,
um,

132
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:04.330
are no longer a communist or like really heavy handed forms of socialism where

133
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:09.671
everything is defined by the bureaucrats and you need 50 licenses to do anything

134
00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:13.010
and you have a little bit more economic flexibility,
uh,

135
00:08:13.011 --> 00:08:14.960
that tends to make a country's richer.

136
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:20.670
It doesn't mean that you could do away with regulations on workplace safety and

137
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.720
a environment and as countries get richer,

138
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.920
they tend to be more protective of their workers and of the environment.
Right.

139
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.850
Uh,
and leaders that,
uh,

140
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.790
kind of think of their mandate as how do I get my country to be richer?

141
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.900
And the most dramatic case was China where,
uh,
you know,

142
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:42.910
Mao had these harebrained schemes of huge collective farms and people smelting

143
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:45.830
iron in their backyards and you know,

144
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.720
anything that occurred to him in the middle of the night,

145
00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:51.170
he would force on hundreds of millions of people and it costs these massive

146
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:55.200
famines.
Then Deng,
Deng Xiaoping took over and he said,

147
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.790
getting rich as good.
Uh,
and he said,
black cat,
white cat,

148
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.510
as long as it catches mice,
it's a good cat.
So much more pragmatic,

149
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.120
much more concerned with the welfare of their citizens.

150
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:11.040
When you have leaders who have that mindset,
then the,
their country can,

151
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.800
can get,
get wealthier and their citizens better off

152
00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.040
<v 0>now.
But are you concerned,
I mean,
I,</v>

153
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:23.310
I agree with you that it is probably is one of the reasons why these people are

154
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.820
experiencing this greater quality of life is because of globalization,

155
00:09:27.821 --> 00:09:29.260
because of these factors are moving in,

156
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.340
but they're living lives that are very different and maybe perhaps it's by our

157
00:09:33.341 --> 00:09:36.750
standards that their lives are better.
That may be if there,

158
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.180
if these indigenous people were living this sort of specific subsistence

159
00:09:40.181 --> 00:09:44.290
lifestyle,
that even though on paper they would be existing in extreme poverty,

160
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.910
but if they're perhaps like living in the jungle or somewhere along those lines

161
00:09:48.911 --> 00:09:52.900
where you have access to all these natural resources that even though they'd be

162
00:09:52.901 --> 00:09:55.590
living in extreme poverty,
they'd be living maybe,

163
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.550
perhaps even a better life by just eating the fish and eating the plants and

164
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.420
hunting and fishing and doing what they had normally done for thousands and

165
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.090
thousands of years rather than making a dollar an hour and a Nike factory.

166
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.280
<v 1>Right?
I mean,
it's certainly true that I've,
uh,</v>

167
00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.390
indigenous peoples who are living in,
uh,
um,

168
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:18.310
hunter and horticultural lifestyles that there are no real crimes in displacing

169
00:10:18.311 --> 00:10:23.020
them.
Often,
not so much by factories,
but by a miners and loggers.

170
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:27.860
But the,
the,
they're a very tiny fraction of the world's population.
You know,

171
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.740
tragically,
uh,
the vast majority of poor people or more are peasants,

172
00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:37.600
not,
uh,
not,
not Ho horticulturalists and right.
And you know,

173
00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:42.660
they're kind of agricultural laborers and for them just based on their own

174
00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:48.010
choices,
uh,
often the factory life is a,
is an improvement.
It's an improvement,

175
00:10:48.011 --> 00:10:51.880
not just because they're not,
uh,
kind of in the fields,

176
00:10:51.881 --> 00:10:53.620
knee deep in muck,

177
00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:58.750
pulling up seedlings and getting bitten by disease,
carrying a bugs.

178
00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.770
But,
um,
for women,
uh,

179
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.840
being able to move from a a village to a city often means liberation that they

180
00:11:07.031 --> 00:11:10.450
can start a business and their kids to school,
uh,

181
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.970
be out from under the thumbs of their husbands and the husband's family because

182
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.890
there's a kind of a can be a liberation just just as what our aunts,

183
00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:21.790
our ancestors did when they left the farms for,
for cities,
uh,
150 years ago.

184
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.590
So there's not to say there is an exploitation and a and cruelty,

185
00:11:26.591 --> 00:11:30.190
which ought to be opposed.
And in the case of native peoples,

186
00:11:30.191 --> 00:11:32.920
often criminal,
uh,
displacements,

187
00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.280
but on the whole globalization has led to this escape from grinding poverty for

188
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.980
literally hundreds of millions of people.

189
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.391
<v 0>So,</v>

190
00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:46.770
even when they move the factories into these places in charge or our pay them a

191
00:11:46.771 --> 00:11:47.970
dollar an hour rather,

192
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:52.560
it's still a dollar more an hour than they would have gotten if the factory had

193
00:11:52.561 --> 00:11:53.130
been there

194
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.280
<v 1>in,
in many cases.</v>

195
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.400
<v 2>That's true.
We just want to say there isn't exploitation.
But you know,</v>

196
00:11:57.401 --> 00:11:58.560
we look at our,
our answer,
you know,

197
00:11:58.561 --> 00:12:01.990
my grandparents worked in a clothing factory and uh,
when,
when the,

198
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:06.030
when they emigrated from Poland to Canada and,
uh,

199
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.740
it often is a route to upward mobility.
Yeah.
It's,

200
00:12:09.741 --> 00:12:11.350
it's hard for us to accept that.

201
00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:13.810
I don't even think about it that way because it was saying,
well,
why,

202
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.710
how come they don't have to pay these Mexican folks minimum wage just like they

203
00:12:17.711 --> 00:12:21.490
do in America?
Like,
well,
why don't they have the same sort of setup we do here?

204
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:25.830
It just seems cruel.
It doesn't impair,
no doubt there is cruelty.
But the,
the,

205
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.430
the relevant comparison is not so much,
uh,

206
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:33.100
the difference between working in a factory there and working in an office and,

207
00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:35.140
uh,
you know,
in Berkeley or,
or Manhattan.

208
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:40.130
It's the difference between working in a factory there and,
uh,

209
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:41.920
and,
and laboring in the fields there.

210
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:46.540
And the people were often given that choice.
They line up to the factory jobs.

211
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:51.570
Do you anticipate a time where there is no third world and there is no like a

212
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:57.310
massive economic disparity?
It's,
it's conceivable.
Um,
you know,
it's,
it's a,

213
00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.390
it's a,
it's a ways off,
but it's happened and huge parts of the world and mean.

214
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.280
We forget that places like South Korea now,
you know,
this rich,
uh,

215
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:11.290
upper middle class society,
uh,
not so long ago.
That was the third world.
I mean,

216
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:13.640
they were,
they were hungry.
They were,
uh,

217
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.250
the children died young.
Um,

218
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:22.120
lot of them living in squalor.
Uh,
and that was true in certainly in China.

219
00:13:22.121 --> 00:13:24.550
Lots of parts,
places,
parts of China now that are,

220
00:13:24.551 --> 00:13:29.500
are pretty much middle class that were a squalid not so long ago.
Uh,
Singapore.

221
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:34.700
Uh,
I have,
uh,
an anecdote in the book and enlightenment now of my,
um,
uh,

222
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:38.350
ex mother in law who grew up in Singapore and she remembers a childhood meal in

223
00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:43.240
which her family split one egg for ways.
I was back in the,

224
00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:47.440
uh,
in the 1940s.
And Singapore is now one of the world's richest countries.

225
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:52.510
So it can't happen.
It is happening.
The most remote,

226
00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:55.720
poorest parts of the world are going to be the hardest to bring up to middle

227
00:13:55.721 --> 00:13:59.980
class standards.
Like,
you know,
Congo,
like Haiti,
like Afghanistan,

228
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.630
but large parts of the world,

229
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:03.880
there has been a huge increase in the standard of living.

230
00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:07.400
Okay.
