WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:03.820
And,
uh,

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.820
when you're talking about this state sponsored Russian doping program,

3
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:09.911
I mean,

4
00:00:09.911 --> 00:00:14.080
do you have to really think in include corral and in that because he was just a

5
00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:17.950
massive,
massive part of it?
Yeah,
I'm sure.
I mean,
you know,

6
00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:22.360
when people have always speculated for for many years like fade or who is

7
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.500
arguably the greatest heavyweight of all time was a competing and pride,

8
00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:30.850
which was an openly dirty league when pride was opposite the UFC.

9
00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:33.310
The UFC had very rudimentary testing at the time.

10
00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:37.730
What they would essentially do is do urine testing at the way ends,
which uh,

11
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.810
Victor Conte famously said is just uh,
an intelligence.

12
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.450
<v 1>I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I got to meet him.
I got to know him pretty well through this.</v>

13
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.320
<v 0>Yeah.
At victory to the podcast a few years back and was talking about,</v>

14
00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:53.321
and this is pre Usada now the UFC has hired Usada and the Wicki and Jeff

15
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.370
Novitsky has done a fantastic job and unfortunately just caught John Jones who a

16
00:00:58.371 --> 00:01:01.250
one re won the title,
knocking out Daniel Cormier.
Yay.

17
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.610
They stripped him of his title and now call me is going to be the champion.

18
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:08.310
Again,
it's so fucking confusing and distorted because in a,

19
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.230
in mixed martial arts,
as opposed to even any other sport,
even wrestling,

20
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.790
wrestling,
your health is on the line,

21
00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:17.300
but nowhere near as much as it is in mixed martial arts.
So the cheating,

22
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:20.110
it's not a matter of a guy getting across the finish line faster than you.

23
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.390
It's a matter of a guy landing blows or a woman landing blows that they would

24
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:29.810
not have been able to land had they not been cheating.
And it gets very,

25
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:33.860
very tricky because you're talking essentially about not just illegal activity,

26
00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:38.270
not just cheating,
but potentially assault.
And what if someone dies?

27
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.100
Like what if someone is doping and it's proven that they're doping and the

28
00:01:43.101 --> 00:01:45.650
beating they give their opponent leads that opponent dying.

29
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.940
You can make a real argument that manslaughter charges at the very least should

30
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:51.800
be filed if not murder.

31
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.420
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean the,
it's certainly,
you know,
the implications are massive.</v>

32
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.300
You can certainly make that implication.
Yeah.
And you know,
in this story,

33
00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:03.134
even the,

34
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.410
the idea where you have thousands of athletes essentially waking up and going,

35
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:11.670
wait,
maybe I would've gone,

36
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.720
I would've gotten metal and had I got a metal,

37
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.100
what would be different in my life today?
We changed their whole world.

38
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:23.930
It's changed the whole world.
It's,
it's,
it's,
and,
and that is why,
you know,
this,

39
00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:28.931
this problem is so I think hard and difficult to combat because when you look at

40
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:33.620
what is at stake,
the economics at stake,
what,
you know,
the,
the,

41
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:36.320
the box of Wheaties essential is it that,
you know,

42
00:02:36.321 --> 00:02:40.170
going in and nobody remembers second place.
It doesn't mean anything.

43
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.990
Doesn't mean anything.
It's all one win or you don't.
Yeah,
you win or you lose.

44
00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:49.130
And if you win comes all the,
you know,
uh,

45
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.600
spoils.
And if you're not the winter,
you might as well almost never been there.

46
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.080
<v 0>Well,</v>

47
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.770
indifferent than the other athletic Devin endeavor because essentially it is

48
00:02:57.771 --> 00:03:00.250
their life but is not professional.

49
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.690
Which is a really weird thing because you have so much money involved in the

50
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:05.051
Olympics.

51
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:08.500
Billions and billions of dollars are going into the hands of people who don't

52
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:12.670
even fucking compete,
which is insane.
It's unlike any other athletic pursuit.

53
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.490
If you look at professional sports,
I mean,

54
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:19.060
whether it's the NBA or boxing or what have you,

55
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.950
the vast majority of the money goes to the athletes themselves right now,

56
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:28.360
not in the Olympics and the Olympics.
Fucking zero.
No,
it's just,

57
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.910
it's like college basketball.
Yeah.
It's insane.

58
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.380
<v 1>Purely an honor to be in the Olympics to go to the Olympics and the athletes</v>

59
00:03:39.061 --> 00:03:40.500
themselves,
you know,

60
00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:44.940
and this is why it's actually you're able to understand a state sponsored
system,

61
00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:48.270
which I think the American mentality is hard to understand because here we're

62
00:03:48.271 --> 00:03:53.271
looking at $205 million NBA contracts and sport is privatized and the athletes

63
00:03:55.471 --> 00:03:59.880
get paid.
And that even when you go to the Olympics as an American athlete,

64
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.550
you might be competing for America,

65
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.300
but America is not paying your way to the Olympics.

66
00:04:06.301 --> 00:04:07.920
You're not on the US payroll.

67
00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:12.921
Michael Phelps is not being paid by the U S government to go compete in the

68
00:04:12.931 --> 00:04:16.170
Olympics.
Right.
But in China,
in Russia,

69
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.520
in an any essentially,
you know,

70
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.080
post Communist,
communist,
any sort of country like that.

71
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.300
The athletes are employees of the government and they're essentially state

72
00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:30.871
employees,

73
00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:35.010
and their job is to go and compete for their country and they're being paid to

74
00:04:35.011 --> 00:04:35.844
do so.

75
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:42.990
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
