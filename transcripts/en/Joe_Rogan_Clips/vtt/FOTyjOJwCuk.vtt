1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.050
And links.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.280
There's a cycle where the snowshoe hares get to a very high number and the links

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.940
eat them all and then the links get to a very high number and they run out of

4
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:13.020
snowshoe hares and the lynx dropped down again and the snowshoe hares come back

5
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:17.990
up.
This is the natural cycle and you're saying the cycle is going to be like a

6
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.840
Conor McGregor run rounds.
You're Brooklyn's there's always some come.

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.850
There's always someone.
There's always someone who writes,

8
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.860
who is the biggest draw right now in the UFC for sure.

9
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.340
This isn't a sinus because second,
besides,
besides him,
George Saint Pierre,

10
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:34.050
if he wants to fight George St Paul,
especially just wimpy Connor Brock,

11
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:38.310
George,
those are your three cash.
Brock would not be Conor at this stage.

12
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.670
One,
two,
three.
Right.
But if the UFC was around,

13
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:49.230
I mean if we were at the stage where Brock was like say before he beat Frank
Mir,

14
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.330
like when,
when when he was the heavyweight champion,
when Brock was just smashed,

15
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.203
he was a,

16
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.760
he could sell what was like the highest pay per view with Brock and I think it

17
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:03.770
was like 2 million to third highest honor in Nate's first.
Yeah.
So it's,

18
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.780
it's in that level.
And the UFC wasn't as popular then,

19
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:09.440
I don't think as it is now.
But they,
they did the dub dub,

20
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.340
he had the WWII fan base crossover.

21
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:14.820
But what's interesting to a lot of people don't,
you know there's a reason why,

22
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.620
but the demand for Nate Diaz too,

23
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:20.240
cause remember he's part of the biggest paper you of all time with Conor

24
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.780
Mcgregor.
So Nate Diaz in that tier two,
you can go Connor Brock,
Rhonda,

25
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.050
Nate's four or five and eight.
It's number two,

26
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.330
UFC 100 Brock Lesnar versus Frank Mir.
1,600,000 bucks.

27
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.470
That's a lot.
It's only 50,000 different than Nate Diaz versus Conor Mcgregor,

28
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:41.910
which is number one.
That's pretty crazy.
Those numbers are crazy.
So,
um,

29
00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:46.340
and then Conor Mcgregor,
Nate Diaz,
Conor has one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
Misha Tate,

30
00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:47.970
and I need it is amazing.

31
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.620
What UFC 200 so you had Brock Lesnar Chicago.
Yeah.

32
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.340
Brock has a shitload.
Brock has one,
two,

33
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.390
three out of the top seven and there it comes in at number eight.

34
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.200
They're in their own.
They're on their own stratosphere.
Right?
Like people want,

35
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.070
you know,
they don't toss them in there.
Nate's right there.
Yes.
Number one.

36
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:11.800
Number three,
that Amanda Nunez,
Ronda Rousey got a million million one.

37
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.320
Nate Diaz.
That's arguably because he was fighting Conor McGregor.
Right?
Well,

38
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:19.730
and that's why it hasn't taken a fight because that's the,
the,

39
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.470
that trilogy is the biggest one.
The biggest that hasn't,
yeah,

40
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.140
I mean it is the biggest,
it's the biggest.
If con,
here's the thing,

41
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:32.250
if Connor comes back and decides to fight Khabib,
that's a fight.

42
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.320
It's going to be a gigantic,
enormous,
biggest paper view of all time.

43
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.140
I think that's the benefit.
They decided to do it in Russia.
Fucking insane.

44
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:41.700
And I'll be watching from here with you guys.

45
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.710
We're doing a companion for this for sure.
Russia,
huck on the road,

46
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.760
and that'll be our biggest companion ever by the data.

47
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.550
Data's pulled me aside like two,
we're going to do some big things in Russia.

48
00:02:50.551 --> 00:02:53.580
I'd really like you to come like could in that fuck outta here,
man.

49
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:58.260
I ain't going to Russia cut to me for around my face.
Eskimo.

50
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.890
So I it in Russia.
It's really amazing.
The problem is that trip,
that trip,

51
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.350
it's a long pass.
It's Cody here with you guys.

52
00:03:06.351 --> 00:03:09.670
I'd rather be here with you guys anyway.
It's more fun.
It can be.

53
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.940
I really like being their life.
Don't get me wrong.
I love it.
I love the job,

54
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:16.780
but I'm going to be honest.
It's more fun watching the fights with you guys.
Yeah,

55
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.100
for sure.
Of course.
Just not even close to friends.
He didn't even clap.

56
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.200
We can get wine.
Yeah,
having cheese and kidding me.

57
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.170
Piss some people off because he chewing on the microphone.
