1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.680
How dare you.
I'm care of a very comfortable underarmor running shoes on.

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.180
How are those new shoes the other day?
Um,
they're a little too tight for me.

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.200
Okay.
They live,
they bind my feet a tad bit.
When I got to the store,

4
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:16.770
I had to swap them out for a,
I had a pair of converse all stars.

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.870
What'd you might go to?
You got easy,
right?

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.970
Jamie gave me a pair of Yeezys about a year ago and he just talked to him.

7
00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:26.670
You just keeping them on ice.
Frozen dead socked dumb.
Is that what it's called?

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.480
That stock dead stock.
Dead stock.
Oh.
Do you know a dead naming is,

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.670
do you know what dead naming?
Is it a shoot?
No,

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.630
I know it's a new thing that's illegal on Twitter and this is something I wish I

11
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:39.870
knew I didn't know until after the podcast,

12
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:43.230
but dead naming is a,
it's banned.

13
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.530
So say if you decide tomorrow to become a woman and you're like,

14
00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:49.360
I'm not no longer Bryan,
I'm Bryan Ina.
I'm like,

15
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.300
I'd be like Brianna if you thought this through or worse.
Okay.
So I'd be like,

16
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.470
uh,
okay,
Brianna,
but you're still a man and then boom,
that's deadnaming.

17
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.650
You can't call someone something other than their preferred gender.

18
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.010
So like if that identify as a woman,
but their biologically male,

19
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.300
you're not allowed to say their biologically male.
Oh,

20
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.350
you're not allowed to call them a man because that's deadnaming.

21
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.470
You're not allowed to call them.
Like you couldn't call Caitlyn Jenner.

22
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:26.760
Bruce if you called her Bruce,
you'd be dead naming her.

23
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.500
But that's just like,
that's not illegal or I mean like

24
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.480
Twitter rule.
If it is a new poll,
please pull it up.
Okay.
I did not know this.

25
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.930
I did not know this.
It's been around for a while,
but I'm checking the Twitter.

26
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.340
That's kind of weird.
Dead Name.

27
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:44.130
He's been banned for a while or the term term has been around.

28
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:49.131
I just found out about the term maybe a couple weeks ago I'd heard the term for

29
00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:54.180
the first time somebody wrote deadnaming and I was like,
what?
What is that?

30
00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:55.940
And then I had to look it up.
Sorry Nicholas.

31
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:59.820
All the new rules we have to deal with fucking article.

32
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.650
There's an article that I was reading.
Go ahead.

33
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.150
I'm looking right at their terms of service.

34
00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:06.150
It's directly word for word in there.
Okay.
Where does it say that?

35
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.820
Okay.

36
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.940
Deadnaming of transgender individuals repeated or nonconsensual slurs or

37
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.800
epithets.

38
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.860
Racist and sexist tropes or other content that degrade someone.

39
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.390
Okay,
well hold on a second.
Like what does degrade someone?

40
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.770
So if you,
if you contact me and say,
hey bro,

41
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.310
you're fucking short.
You're not funny.
That's degrading.
Yeah.

42
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.100
Like is that not loud?
That's crazy.
You have to,

43
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.800
you have to have that be allowed.

44
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.040
We were hip targeting individuals with repeated slurs,

45
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:47.280
tropes or other content that it tends to dehumanize,
degrade,

46
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.520
or reinforce negative or harmful stereotypes about a protected category.

47
00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:55.380
See,
that's where it comes from.
Like white people are not protected.

48
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.160
This includes targeted mis-gendering or dead naming of transgender,

49
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.780
transgender individuals.
I love how they just went with the,

50
00:03:05.781 --> 00:03:10.090
this is a giant corporation and they just went with some new word that's only

51
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:11.350
been around for like a month.

52
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.260
How long has deadnaming been around for the urban dictionary?

53
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:17.340
I had it in there from 2014 oh really?
Never even heard that,

54
00:03:17.341 --> 00:03:21.300
but they're on the ball.
Tell you that by Urban's there's this day ahead.

55
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.570
Twitter still allows goats sees and,
and all the porn.

56
00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:28.940
You weren't as interesting to me.
Yeah.
Well porns consensual.
Yeah.
I love that.
Uh,

57
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.590
that's just hilarious.
I love that.
That's all.

58
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.920
I love the I t I did love the chaos of it all.

59
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.910
I love the fact that they're trying to solve it everything out.

60
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.960
I just think it's,
the whole thing is crazy.
It's so bizarre that

61
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.740
they're trying to,
in that sense with that like that's so vague.

62
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.900
Dehumanize or degrade.
Well,
every joke about someone,

63
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.580
every joke about Trump,

64
00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.470
every single joke about Trump that every single comedian and or commentator in

65
00:04:00.471 --> 00:04:04.130
or person makes is in some way degrading.

66
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.810
When you talk about how fucking stupid he was.

67
00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:08.000
Like Rob Reiner had a joke about him,

68
00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:12.410
called him a piece of shit or call them a piece of crap yesterday and said he

69
00:04:12.411 --> 00:04:16.050
couldn't believe how fucking dumb he is.
Trump talking about Hillary though.
She,

70
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.980
he's doing it to heal 100% hundred percent.
Hundred percent.

71
00:04:19.981 --> 00:04:24.270
So that's so vague.
That's so vague and dead naming is not a real word.

72
00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:27.460
So like how are they using fake words in this shit?

73
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.370
They're trying to say it is now.
It is a real,
real word.
Yeah,

74
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.031
man.

75
00:04:35.031 --> 00:04:39.620
I don't know if your name used to be Bruce and you change it to Kaitlin.

76
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.270
I can't say that.
That seems bananas.
Yeah,

77
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.780
that seems bananas.
So like if you're fucking with somebody,

78
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.190
say somebody became a woman and it's still an asshole.

79
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.720
You can't call him Mike,
you know?
Hey Mike,
look,
I sh,

80
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.480
I'm sure you're bitter about this whole changing your sex thing.

81
00:05:00.481 --> 00:05:03.900
You can't bring that up.
But uh,
you're still an annoying guy.

82
00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:06.210
You just don't every deck anymore by like,

83
00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:10.650
if someone says that they can't say that,
why can't they say that they shouldn't?

84
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.520
That's to me stupid.
Wow.
Well,
I'm not saying that that's hurtful,

85
00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:17.890
I guess to transgender people,
I guess.
And that's can can,

86
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.650
can be considered hate speech or hate whatever,
but own,
but

87
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.600
only when it comes to like gender,
right?
Like if you could,

88
00:05:27.601 --> 00:05:32.530
you could tell someone,
hey,
you're short and fat and stupid and they don't.

89
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:37.300
No one cares.
True.
Right.
You could say you a,

90
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.180
you're ugly as fuck.
Your nose is disgusting.

91
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

92
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.220
<v 0>What happens there?
Is that the same,
what is it the same thing?</v>

93
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.220
It might be if you do it repeatedly,
right?

94
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.910
If you just throw one out there,
probably,
okay.

95
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.900
Probably one time you could shit on someone's looks yet one.
But it's like,

96
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.440
like in deciding what you can and shit on someone for like what I'm saying is if

97
00:06:01.441 --> 00:06:04.400
someone's an asshole and they're like,
here's a perfect one.

98
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.190
That woman who used to be a man,

99
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.330
she's a transgender woman who was in a store screaming at this kid behind the

100
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:15.140
counter that it's ma'am,
it's ma'am,
this is the perfect example of that.

101
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.280
The guy was terrified.

102
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:20.120
She's fucking huge and she used to be a guy and clearly still looks like a guy

103
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.820
and she's saying it's fucking ma'am,

104
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.570
like knock some shit over.
She got violent in the store.
Yeah.

105
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.120
In that situation.

106
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.320
You telling me that it's not cool to say,

107
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.980
how about you settle the fuck down because you look like a guy,

108
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.040
you're acting like a violent guy and you used to be a guy.

109
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.210
Pardon me if I think you're still a fucking guy that's dead naming,

110
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.400
but that's a good thing to say in that particular instance.
So without nuance,

111
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.170
right,
without context,

112
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.680
it's saying you can't say anything to degrade someone.

113
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.650
Well clearly that would degrade that guy,
but if that guy was saying,

114
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.260
fuck that kid,
he did it on purpose on Twitter,

115
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.120
you're saying someone can't respond,
hey man,

116
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:05.630
I'm sure you're really upset that you got your Dick removed and these still look

117
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:09.020
like a guy,
but fuck you.
Like why can't someone say that?

118
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:12.500
Because that's people communicating how they feel about you being a dick.

119
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.770
Like if you start out being a dick and then they communicate about you being a

120
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:18.380
dick by being a dick as well,
are we banning this?

121
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.070
It's their pride is covering their butts.
There's pride night.
You know what?

122
00:07:21.071 --> 00:07:25.550
Like kind of like Jamie said,
it's dangerous in a lot of ways.

123
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.750
It's dangerous to control people's thoughts and behavior because who are you to

124
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:31.460
say and when does it end?
You know?

125
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.160
It just keeps going and going and going and going.
It gets,

126
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.740
it gets very slippery when you have one group that thinks it's right and they're

127
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.490
trying to control another group that thinks they're right.
Man,
that is a,

128
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:44.090
it's,

129
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.710
it seems so simple when you're just talking about dead naming transgender people

130
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:53.000
or not degrading people based on their looks or their ethnicity or their this or

131
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:53.883
that.

132
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.990
But what you're doing is you're trying to dictate how humans communicate with

133
00:07:56.991 --> 00:07:58.880
each other and people don't like it when you tell him what to do.
