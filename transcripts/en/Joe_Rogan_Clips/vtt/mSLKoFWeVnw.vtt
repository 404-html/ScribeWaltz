00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.740
I want to talk to you about the universal basic income.
What do you think about,

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.960
what do you think about artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence and

3
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:10.440
automation and the removal of all these jobs is a real concern that a lot of

4
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:12.810
people have.
And then the,

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.370
the way to mitigate it that's being bandied about is universal basic income.

6
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:20.100
That they would give you a certain amount of money.

7
00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:22.560
And I think the idea is that everyone would get it,

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.790
even wealthy people would get it.
And that would be the only way to make it fair.

9
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:28.710
But where the fuck is that money coming from?

10
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:31.670
And then what do you think about it?
I don't think it,
I,
I'm,

11
00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:34.230
I'm not an economist man.
Right.
You know,
but I don't,
I don't think it's feasible,

12
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:35.100
at least right now.

13
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.660
I do believe that on a technological level we will eventually reach like a star

14
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:43.740
Trek,
you know,
kind of future where it's not about communism.

15
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.590
It's just literally like we have w a scarcity is gone,

16
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.740
like they have replicators.
But when it comes to universal basic income,

17
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:51.840
people need to understand some basic economic principles.

18
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.900
If everybody gets $1,000 okay,

19
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.220
that's 300 million thousand dollars.
Right?
But it's not everybody.

20
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:03.780
It's everybody of working age,
right?
Yes.
So,
so let's,
let's,
let's do this.

21
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.280
I wondered,
I own,
uh,
I own a burger shop.
I need to hire someone to flip burgers.

22
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.670
So I say we pay 10 bucks an hour.
It's a,
it's not,
it's not a lot,

23
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:13.980
but we're a small business.
We can't really afford to pay more.
It's acceptable.

24
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:18.090
They say,
I get 1000 bucks a month.
Why would I,
why would I spend,
you know,
if,

25
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.010
if you know that,
not really.
Well,

26
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:23.220
the idea is that the thousand bucks a month that you get,
you get to keep,

27
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:27.170
and then the,
my time is worth more than 10 bucks an hour.
I don't care.
When I,

28
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.170
when I was 17,
18,
I worked for American Eagle Airlines.

29
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.290
I was lifting like 50,000 pounds per day and I was getting 10 bucks an hour.

30
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.040
You might have been jacked.
No,
I,
well,
I was,
I,

31
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:39.990
I've been skateboarding my whole life,
so I was certainly,
you know,
in shape.

32
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.940
But if you gave,
if you told me,
hey,

33
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.440
you know how you're making less than a thousand bucks a month working fulltime

34
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.350
after taxes,
how about we just give you 1000 bucks?

35
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:49.200
I Bet I'll be at the skate park.
Yeah,
I'll be,
I'll,
you know,

36
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:52.110
so there's some positives that people will pursue their passions,
but hold on.

37
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.050
How many people do you know want to be comedians and they're not funny?

38
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.720
Quite a few.
Quite a few.
And imagine if you said,

39
00:01:57.721 --> 00:01:59.610
we're going to subsidize your endeavor into a thing.

40
00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:02.970
You're not good at how many people are really good at copying and carpenters,

41
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:04.410
but they wished they'd be pro football players.

42
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.680
How many people are really good at being teachers,
but want to be a famous actor?

43
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.360
So what do you think would be some sort of an appropriate response to automation

44
00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:14.380
and artificial intelligence?

45
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.970
You can't just have millions and millions of people just have no words,
you know,

46
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.010
and that's,
that's a quagmire.
This,
this is why I,

47
00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:26.130
uh,
you know,
I've,
I've never been a pot smoker.
Uh,

48
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.250
I think I smoked like once in my life.
I want to try it now.
No.
Uh,

49
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.173
it's just not my thing,

50
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.240
but everyone always would think I was stoned because I would talk about this

51
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:34.950
kind of stuff with my friends while they were stoned.

52
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.680
The philosophical consequences of technological innovation,

53
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.480
it is not the postmaster's fault that he spent 30 years becoming the best of the

54
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:44.040
best in working at the post office.

55
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.940
That technology emerged that is going to displace him and make him put him in

56
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:50.400
the poor house.
Right when I was about 19 years old,

57
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:54.330
I was skateboarding in downtown Chicago and I saw an old black homeless man and

58
00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:57.450
I had some leftover food and I was like,
Hey,
what's up dude?
You want some food?

59
00:02:57.451 --> 00:03:01.030
And he was like,
aw,
thanks man.
And I was just like,
I got to know,

60
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:05.470
can I ask you a question?
How did you become homeless?
And he said,
uh,

61
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.320
you know what man?
He's like,
I think he was like 60 something.
He said,

62
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:13.150
I used to have a job.
Uh,
I worked all day.
Every day.
I had a family.
Uh,
eventually,

63
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.030
you know,
um,
my,
my,
uh,
didn't have kids.

64
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.050
My friends started to get old and move on.
I lost touch a lot of them,

65
00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:24.051
some of them died and one day I got told that my job wasn't needed anymore and

66
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:28.180
so I couldn't do anything.
Went on unemployment for a little bit,
but my,
you know,

67
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:30.460
the job I was good at,
it didn't exist.
Right.

68
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:33.670
I can't remember exactly what he said.
There's this 14 years ago,
but he was like,

69
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:36.700
so everywhere I went,
I said,
you know,
I'll do anything.
I'll do anything.

70
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.710
But even the,

71
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.540
the small jobs that pay a little bit to flip burgers weren't enough to cover my

72
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:42.400
rent.
After a few months,

73
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.520
I got evicted then because I didn't have a place to live.

74
00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:46.810
I couldn't go to the job.
I did have.

75
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.260
I started sleeping outside and I've been here ever since.
And I'm like,
that said,

76
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.400
you know,
and that's,
that's,
that's the sad reality.
What do you do?
I don't know.

77
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.700
The EOC hooks you up,
but that's the thing.
She goes too far.

78
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:59.550
But this is why I believe in,

79
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.320
in some kind of social policy and safety net social security,

80
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:05.350
something to help these people.
Well for sure.
You know,

81
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:07.060
if we have a real community,

82
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.460
you wouldn't help out the people that are in your community or twig.
Yes.

83
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.370
You know,
you know communism works really,

84
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:15.820
really well when you have like five people.
I try explaining to people,

85
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:18.400
they always make this political,
uh,
you know,
the political compass,

86
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.220
authoritarian libertarian left,
right?
And they,
they,

87
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:25.060
people like to claim that anarchists like the violent smashy ones and Antifa are

88
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:29.920
libertarian left.
And I'm like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Like the libertarian left quadrant,

89
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.390
our pot smoking hippies live on farms and arco communism makes a ton of sense.

90
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:37.210
When it's you and your buddies working together on a farm sharing

91
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:38.050
responsibilities,

92
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.340
it doesn't make sense for a community of 300 million people and you have to

93
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:47.110
trade extremely specific resources to make a computer happen.
Right.

94
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.350
At that point,
do you need to be able to quantify the value of specific objects?

95
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.430
And that's why communism doesn't work for massive,
massive scale.
But

96
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.830
I will say when,
uh,
artificial intelligence is a different conversation,
you know,

97
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:03.310
technological advancements,
advancement is going to result in like luddite riots.

98
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.850
And you know,
people,
you know,
the opioid crisis,
I could be wrong,

99
00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:10.540
I read that there was a connection between unemployment from these factories

100
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:14.740
getting shut down and depressed dudes popping pills.
There was a,
uh,

101
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.010
a masculinity report was published by Harry's,
the shaving company,

102
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.630
and they said the over the overwhelming majority of what contributes to a man's

103
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:25.510
happiness as gainful employment,
like,
like 80%.

104
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.910
So what happens when a factory shuts down?

105
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.180
You got a bunch of young dudes who want to do something.
They want to matter,

106
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.640
but they can't.
There's no,
there's nowhere to go anymore,

107
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:37.420
especially in a small town.
But I'll tell you what,
man,
percosets feel real good.

108
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.100
You know,
those drugs,
they feel fantastic,
but they'll kill you.
So that's,

109
00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:45.100
you know,
I think this contributes to the popularity of Bernie Sanders and Trump.

110
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.800
They talked about the working class.
I talked about these free trade agreements,

111
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:50.050
hurting people.
They talked about getting the factories back together.

112
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.310
And that means a lot to people who have been popping pills,
who are depressed,

113
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:56.950
who are sad and scared,
and it's a lot of people in this country.
