Hello Freak bitches.
So where do you go from here?

2
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.260
Besides suing the fuck out of Google?
Google.
Just give him some money to send of,

3
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:13.220
shut him out.
Do you want to go through what a lawsuit,

4
00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:14.490
like what if they came to you with a settlement?

5
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.740
Would you just take it and shut your mouth?

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.850
<v 1>I really want somehow for them to address it,
but uh,
I,</v>

7
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.823
I don't know how it is.

8
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.090
<v 0>Well,
even if they,
if you lose in court,
will they address it?</v>

9
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:28.310
They'll probably say,
you know,
all the,
we support the court,

10
00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:33.311
we disagree with the rulings and we still support gender equality and Blam Blam

11
00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:34.514
Blam blam

12
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.690
<v 1>yeah,
I mean,
I think part of it is that there's currently an asymmetry,</v>

13
00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:42.070
so maybe Google is acting in their best interest to act the way that they are

14
00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:44.320
because they think that,
you know,

15
00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:49.321
there's all these activists that are trying to attack Google that only if they

16
00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:50.810
don't fit this.
Sorry.

17
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.560
<v 0>Are there are a lot of activists that are attacking Google in that regard.</v>

18
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.570
<v 1>Yeah.
And you know,</v>

19
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.580
we even see that there's now a potential class action lawsuit against Google

20
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.400
about war,
uh,
gender pay disparity.

21
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.270
And so like they just are looking for anything.

22
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.400
And if we say that,
you know,
if there's only incentive coming from one side,

23
00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:15.490
then they're only going to push farther and farther to that side.

24
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.500
<v 0>And this gender pay disparity is just a involving similar jobs</v>

25
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.950
<v 1>yet.
So they claim that it's the same job,</v>

26
00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:28.240
although at least when Google was doing their own internal analysis,

27
00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:29.710
which they've been doing for years,

28
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.310
they show that there's no disparity once you control for preparing for

29
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.173
performance.

30
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.960
And so it's really unclear and

31
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.440
<v 0>but you control for performance performance tends to favor males.</v>

32
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.680
<v 1>Maybe I if,
if that's what they're showing that there is sound.
Sorry,</v>

33
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:51.400
gender disparity.
If you just look at aggregate.
Yeah,

34
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.490
<v 0>look at this one in 100 million chance alleged gender pay gap at Google is</v>

35
00:01:57.181 --> 00:02:00.930
random says class action lawyer.
Oh Jesus.

36
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.990
Class action lawyer says that in the articles written by a Czech fake news.

37
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.520
Fake News.
You're not going to get me.
You fucks.

38
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.031
<v 1>I didn't.</v>

39
00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:12.330
One thing is I don't think that they really have Google's internal data,

40
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:16.470
so there's no way for them to say whether or not it's based on the performance

41
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.360
<v 0>liquid there.
They're saying here,
you know,
um,
uh,</v>

42
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.650
notices seeking women currently or formerly employed at Google for possible

43
00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:30.760
inclusion in a planned class action lawsuit.
First of all,

44
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.740
people hear that and they're like,
we're going to get paid.
Well,
God says law,

45
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.780
right?
I mean that's just,

46
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.000
you're playing on human instincts when you seek out people that may have been

47
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:46.600
employed for a possible inclusion in a class action lawsuit.

48
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.300
That's not saying that they weren't wronged because I don't,
obviously,

49
00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:52.810
I don't know,
several dozen came forward in a matter of weeks.

50
00:02:52.811 --> 00:02:57.700
That's a pretty high level of dissatisfaction.
Says James Feinberg.
No,
it's not.

51
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.290
No.
There's thousands of people who've worked there and a couple does and came

52
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:04.750
forward.
That's not a high level of satisfaction.

53
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:07.810
How many people have been employed at Google that are no longer employed?

54
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.820
It's probably tens of thousands,
right?
Yeah.

55
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.550
There's 70,000 people working there.
And so for this guy to say,

56
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:20.350
that's a pretty high level of dissatisfaction when several dozen,

57
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.700
let's say three does and let's go crazy.
Let's say it's 40 people,

58
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:27.920
it's get nuts.
That's fucking nobody man yet.

59
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.410
Oh 70 women.
It's only because I heard from,
but wait a minute,

60
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:36.610
hurt from that.
Doesn't that you mean they might not even make sense?

61
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.640
That might not be a case for four people.

62
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.860
Four,
that's not a lot.
You fuck the class action.

63
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.600
I mean that's just,
this is,
this is a fucking ambulance chaser Chaser,
right?

64
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.640
I mean I'm not saying he's wrong,

65
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.800
I'm not saying there's not sexual discrimination,
but I'm saying like this is,

66
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.330
these articles are sneaky as fuck for people.

67
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:05.380
You got four people and I don't know how an individual would know whether or not

68
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.010
they're paid differently just based on their sex.
Right?

69
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:10.690
Because there's so many variables at play.

70
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.050
So you really have to look at the system as a whole because I mean there are

71
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:18.980
definitely some men that are paid less than the women too.

72
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.160
And I know for performance is like that.

73
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.200
The problem is when you control for performance,

74
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:27.040
if it turns out that men are being paid more than you have to figure out some

75
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:32.041
sort of way to justify that or you know like if men are being paid more when you

76
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:37.810
control for performance,
what is it that's causing the men to be paid more?

77
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:39.070
Why are they performing better?

78
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:41.650
Like is it the environment they feel more comfortable?

79
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.750
Is it lack of suppression that the women experience?
Like you said,

80
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.760
I guess when you look at the nationwide gender gap in pay where you know even

81
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:55.960
Obama has said 77 cents per dollar is too little,
but he's a silly person.

82
00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:57.160
Like I shouldn't have done that.

83
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.190
Like he knows like when Obama said that he knows that that's not being honest

84
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.570
because you're talking about completely different jobs,

85
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:07.120
different choices for people don't know.
Okay,

86
00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:08.770
let's just break that down real quick.
This,

87
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.100
this thing cause people repeated ad nauseum and it's just not true.

88
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.520
The gender pay gap of 77 cents to a dollar that a male makes is based on the

89
00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:21.640
choices that people make as far as like what they do for a living.

90
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.930
It's based on the amount of hours that they work.
Men tend to work longer hours,

91
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.650
women tend,
especially if they get pregnant,
all those things are factored in.

92
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.680
That's where you get 77 cents on average for the dollar that the male makes.

93
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.430
What it implies,

94
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:40.030
and this is where it's disingenuous because it two people working side by side

95
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.090
doing the same job and the males getting 77 more a dollar for the woman's 77

96
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.120
cents.
That's not what the gender pay gap actually means.

97
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.410
And if Google is actually,
if someone is saying,

98
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:56.980
if there's a lawsuit that's saying that a man and a woman are doing the exact

99
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.070
same job

100
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.960
<v 1>with the exact same performance and the woman is only getting 77 cents on the</v>

101
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:05.510
dollar,
then you got a real issue.
Right?
Yeah.

102
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.240
And so it's often are,
uh,
that,
you know,

103
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.780
there's different hours worked and it doesn't even have to be that,
you know,

104
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:18.050
they work twice as many or 30% more.

105
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.550
It's sometimes if you just work,
you know,

106
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.920
44 hours a week versus 34 hours or something,

107
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.320
then there's a huge pay disparity.
Yeah.

108
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.550
And that's irrespective of what gender you have.
It's just,
yeah,

109
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.490
especially at Google,
there was so much time that was just,
you know,

110
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:40.790
replying to email and doing some base level stuff,

111
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:44.810
going to meetings and then you only had a little bit that was actually creative

112
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:48.260
and providing value to the company.
Really.
Yeah.

113
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.730
So it's really inefficient that regard.
Right.
And you know,

114
00:06:51.731 --> 00:06:54.590
it's similar in a lot of companies too,
so,

115
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.240
and that creates some of this nonlinear,
uh,

116
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.930
benefits of working just a little more per week.

117
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.000
And we see this a lot in silicon valley where there's a lot of people right out

118
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:12.290
of college and they're willing to work a ton of time,
especially,
you know,

119
00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:16.400
you can essentially live at Google.
So I mean,
yeah,

120
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:20.390
there's free food everywhere.
There's showers,
there's a gym,
the beds.

121
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.560
There's nap pods.
Pods.
Yeah.
Wow.

122
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:34.680
<v 2>Okay.</v>
