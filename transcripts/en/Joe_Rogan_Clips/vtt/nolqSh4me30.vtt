00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.090
The joe rogan experience.
It's very bad.

2
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.990
<v 1>While we've been going on a Paul Ryan has announced that he's going to not seek</v>

3
00:00:07.991 --> 00:00:09.610
reelection.
Oh,
thank God.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.800
<v 0>Well,
he's retired.
Paul Ryan's probably sees the writing on the wall.</v>

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.850
What does that guy do currently?
He had some kind of realistic challenger,

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.940
a Democrat that has been really ramping up their campaign and he does not want

7
00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:26.270
to stick around to see how that's going to go.
Really does want to lose.

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.180
He doesn't want to get humiliated.
You know why?
That's what it is.

9
00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:31.620
He think or maybe he's just tired.
Illusion.
No Way.

10
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.410
Maybe needs to get paid for all those fucking bribes.
Like now it's time

11
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.270
<v 1>saw the day that the former speaker John Banger,</v>

12
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.900
I say it now on the board of a mate,
major marijuana.

13
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.510
<v 0>He went all pro legalization.
Shit.
Got To get that.</v>

14
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.290
How do you feel about this legalization situation?
I hate it.
I hate it.

15
00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:54.700
To lock people up.
Locked up.
They're getting high.
Lock him up,

16
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.730
but compared to prop two 15 compared to [inaudible] 17 to 18 what do you think

17
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.500
what in California about it?
Well,
the 30% sales tax,
which was inevitable,

18
00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:08.590
but this is what I like about that.
It's still reasonable.

19
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.520
You can get high on a very small amount of money for a long period of time.

20
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.160
That's true.
I don't think we should be calling and complaining about that too.

21
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:18.640
I think we could show that there's a real benefit to legalization that benefits

22
00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:21.370
communities,
benefit schools,
firemen,
police officer's,

23
00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:23.710
whoever can get that money and I think that's where the money should be

24
00:01:23.711 --> 00:01:27.040
allocated and I think you could get billions of dollars for the state just doing

25
00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:30.700
that and I think that is a real positive aspect of legalization.

26
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.640
That might be the one thing that's going to be the straw that breaks the camel's

27
00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:34.660
back across the country.

28
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.540
When people realize that you can make real money and that real money can be

29
00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:39.760
beneficial to things that communities need,

30
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.470
plus you starve out illegal drug selling illegal drug sellings what the real

31
00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:46.600
problem is always been when you make something illegal,

32
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:49.390
only criminals are going to sell it.
Then you have criminal mentality.

33
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.930
You have people that have guns and gangs and those are the people that were

34
00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:55.810
scared of not businesses.
Yeah.
If we were scared of businesses,

35
00:01:55.811 --> 00:01:58.900
we'd be trying to close liquor stores.
Nobody gives a shit about wineries.

36
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.020
You know we're not.
Those are drug stores.
A winery is a drug dealer.

37
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.030
They are they listening to you talking about about wine?
Yeah.

38
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.250
Just sell delicious trucks.
Yeah,
I mean,
and I'm for,
I'm 100% I love wine.

39
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.850
That's not my point.
My point is selling Dwan things should be legal.

40
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.040
Things should be legal.
And when marijuana is legal,

41
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:18.070
tax the fucking shit out of it and give that money back to the community.

42
00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:21.580
And everybody benefits people like you and I who are responsible,

43
00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:25.420
grown adults prepare taxes and are good people and we'd like to get high

44
00:02:25.421 --> 00:02:26.380
occasionally the,

45
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.880
we should be able to buy it with no worry about being locked in a fucking cage.

46
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.760
And that money should go to schools.
That money should go to fix the streets.

47
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.500
That money should go to cops and firemen.
That's what it should go to that.

48
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.200
And then we know where it's being allocated.
Yeah.
I have no idea.
No idea.

49
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.100
I would hope it's,
here it goes.
I'm joining the Board of Anchorage Holdings.

50
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.330
[inaudible] holdings acreage.
Sorry.
Because my thinking on cannabis has evolved.

51
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.890
That's my man got hi.
Yeah,
I was,

52
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.930
I was anti and then I got some of this good shit right here.

53
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.860
I'm convinced d scheduling the drug is needed so that we do research,

54
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.980
help our veterans and reverse the opioid epidemic ravaging our communities.

55
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.620
Yes,
I agree man.
I would add to that,
get high,

56
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.650
say wait so we can get hot.
Put everyone out of jail.
Is there,

57
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.380
is there evidence showing a weed reduces opioid use?
It is,
right.
Um,

58
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.380
well,
it really depends upon how it's used.

59
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.930
It can benefit some people with some kind of pain.

60
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.430
I don't think it's realistic to say that some people that are in horrible,

61
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:32.020
horrible pain would get the same reaction for,
I wanted to get for opiates.

62
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.000
People with like really bad burns,
for instance.
Are there 24,
seven addicted,

63
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.930
not for not medical reasons.
I'm talking about if you're become addicted to Ope,

64
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.790
uh,
you know,
oxies there's better drugs.
Yeah.

65
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.420
There's better drugs to get you off it.
Yeah.

66
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>
