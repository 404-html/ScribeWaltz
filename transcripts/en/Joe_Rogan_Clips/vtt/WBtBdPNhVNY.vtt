1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.181
Well,

2
00:00:00.181 --> 00:00:03.630
they say that's the secret to being a draw is appeal to women because they're

3
00:00:03.631 --> 00:00:06.930
the ones that decide what to do at night.
Yes.
Yeah.
Right.

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.200
Like there's not a whole lot of chicks begging to go to slayer.

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.790
Right.
And if they are,
take them.
That's it.
That's a good one.
Yeah.

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.660
They want to go see someone cute.

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.920
I bet there's probably a disproportionate number of chicks going to see aqua
man.

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.810
I bet.
If you allow,
yeah.

9
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.680
If you looked at the number of women that want to go see a superhero movie and

10
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:33.990
uh,
the number of women that want to go see aqua man.
Yeah.

11
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:37.440
It's off the charts and aqua man's favor.
Someone should do a study.

12
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.400
That's a handsome man.
Well,
he's his name.
Jason Mamoa.
He was Badass.

13
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.320
Game of Thrones.
He's a beast to super nice guy too.

14
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.210
I'm married a guy in a whole foods and nail sweetheart,
sorta telling you.

15
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.900
Oh sweetheart.
He is like,
you're so handsome.
It's confusing.

16
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.120
So call and beautiful women are feelings,
right?
Yeah.
Leave that guy.
Yeah.

17
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.740
Yeah.
My wife said it best.
She said he's everybody's type.

18
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.580
She's like,
you know some girls,
Brad Pitt's there type.

19
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.950
You know some girls it's uh,
you know,
fill in the blank.
Yeah.

20
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.980
Jimmy Fallon.
He's everybody's tight

21
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.050
and he's a giant and he's got awesome tattoos.
A fucking nice guy.

22
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:28.050
Fucking fuck.
Are those his real tattoos?
I don't believe so.

23
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.930
I think that's just for aqua man.
That's his tattoos for aqua man.

24
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:33.330
What are his real tattoos?
He's got a gang of real tattoos.

25
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.790
The forearm ones I think is is real tattoos.
Yeah.
Boy,

26
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:41.670
that takes some time and makeup because if he's doing a role where they don't

27
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:45.540
want that,
that's a lot of time covering that shit up every day.

28
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.740
I don't think they have to cover up shit with him.
Yeah,
it was just that,

29
00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:50.551
that beautiful face.

30
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:54.530
Get on screen that all those damp and panties do the talking.

31
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.730
See you again tomorrow,
man.
Whew.
Yeah.
Girls are going to that movie.

32
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.593
It's like a phrase.

33
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.210
It's like a porn theater in Times Square in the 70s for women's probably like

34
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.430
slipping their hands.

35
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:12.540
Then moisture in the air and yourself off all these little heaters.

36
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.460
Cheaters.
Your feet are stuck on the floor.
You think it's the popcorn butter?

37
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.420
Nope.
Nope,
nope.
Yeah.
Um,

38
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.240
how do we get on subject to him?
Aqua man,
girls,
any Clark.
Oh yeah.

39
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.880
Girls deciding what to go sit right there.
Girls would be,
they'd be like,
yeah,

40
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.470
let's go see aqua man.
He be like,
wait a minute.

41
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.680
Thought you hate superhero movies,
whatever you want to go.
Yeah.

42
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.820
She wants to stare at Jason Mamoa.
Right.

43
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.560
He is pretty beautiful.
We watched him on screen,
dammit.
Yeah.
Shit.

44
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.530
I can't hate her.
He thinks some women watch MMA for that reason.

45
00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:53.880
I think some guys are cute.
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.
Not only cute,

46
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:55.470
but savages.
Right.

47
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.380
I mean the number of women with a

48
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.500
sketchy childhoods that are attracted to MMA fighters can be off the charts.

49
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:09.340
Yeah.
I want to say that in a very polite way is polite as I could say.

50
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.900
I think even regular women,
I think like lawyers,

51
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:16.840
like buttoned down women see a cause.

52
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.300
They're around neutered men all day and you're around a guy like,

53
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.240
you know Luke Rockhold is no,
it might be better.

54
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:26.710
Look in the J's my Ma and he's a UFC middleweight champion.

55
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.150
Beautiful.
Six foot three,
six foot four,
somewhere in that range.

56
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.240
Planning features looks like a model handsome is,
fuck God.

57
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.560
I want to say give them hell yeah.
Ass Kicker.
That's not the best picture on Bro.

58
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:42.610
That's kind of gets,
that's after a fight scene before the beast.

59
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.860
But point is uh,
there's Garr on t go that one about what?

60
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:52.000
The blue shorts on.
What you see is a look at that handsome bastard.
Look at him.

61
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.390
He,

he's got a good build.
That's the kind of build my wife likes.

62
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:59.110
She doesn't like it too big.
She likes it like me and him slow down.

63
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.660
You and him are the same.
The fuck

64
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.760
I short.
Girls are watching that guy though.

69
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:26.290

The one right there.
Look at that.
I mean,

70
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:28.690
you don't think girls would be begging to have that inside of them.

71
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.840
If I was a woman,

72
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.930
if I was a heterosexual woman and I saw that guy and he was like,

73
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:38.350
would you like a drink?
I'd be like,
