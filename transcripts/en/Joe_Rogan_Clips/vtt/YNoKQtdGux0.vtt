Hello Freak bitches.
People saying like,
why does Mike Tyson,
he,
first of all,

2
00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:07.170
he's a fighter.
He's not a tennis player,

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.820
but Mike was a wild boy and to hang out with him,

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.690
you could understand like he was the biggest person on the planet and he had the

5
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:21.300
demons.
You know what I'm saying?
Everybody's fun too.
Cause it,

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.750
cause you see them in a club and he sees,
he sees some girls.
You mean hi.

7
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:28.920
How are you doing?
You like BMWs when girls do that,
what do you like?

8
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.830
You like BMW,
like cod.
You like BMWs and crazy.

9
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.240
He would take the girls out and go get a BMW.
I mean,
he was at crazy,

10
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.570
you know what I'm saying?
Just saying,
come on,
come on,
let's look at the beer.

11
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.840
And we open up the BMW dealership,
but he was wild.
But I say just like,

12
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:47.340
how are we saying off the here I'm going into my garage and there's two guys,

13
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.650
a little guy like this and a tall guy.
The little guy goes,
Yo Yo,

14
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.800
it's like this all the time,
be.
I said,
yeah,
who are you?
He says,
oh,

15
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.900
we didn't have to,
oh,
my name is Farrell.
I said,
yeah,
I'm going to hurt you.

16
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:00.720
That's how long ago this was.
Wow.
So he's like,
can I,
I said,

17
00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:02.770
just go in and have it,
have a great time.
Uh,

18
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.220
there was another guy standing on the wall,
green jacket,

19
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.840
like a green little jumpsuit.
Nobody's talking to him.

20
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.670
Guess who was who?
Jay Z.
Nobody knew.

21
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.600
I said,
what's up man?
He's just a great party.

22
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.730
So crazy.
But you know,
no one knows.
But,

23
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.450
and now the way I got into the music,
however,

24
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.740
is that all these different parties was going on and I would have like different

25
00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:35.010
musical people leave me music in my little studio that I built.

26
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.680
I went and got this great studio built in the back of my house.

27
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.560
And so one day comes,

28
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.490
this kid backpack on jaws busted.
Who is it?

29
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.380
Oh,
it's Kanye.
Oh,
his John's busted from my car accident,
right.

30
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.020
Kanya and walks in and I said,
who's that?
They said,
all,
they said,

31
00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:54.960
new my fucking Kanye man.
He bout to beat the shit.
I said,
what are you do?
Well,

32
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:57.600
he produces,
but he also wrapped.
I said,
well,
anybody come to my house?

33
00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:01.220
They got to perform.
So I said,
Yo man,
they say,
you know,
you rappers it,

34
00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.330
he wrapped the most incredible free.
I don't know if it was free,

35
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.700
it wasn't current.
I said,
I don't know why you aren't famous.

36
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.450
He did it with a broken jaw.
He had a little bro,
little jobs,
a little swollen.

37
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:10.380
I don't think it was broken,

38
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.640
but it was a little swollen cause it wasn't too long after that accident that he

39
00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:17.160
had.
Right.
And then he goes,
ah,
I,

40
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.170
I got a Song Dad,
dad,
you or you'll be cut on.

41
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.520
Ah,
I got the song.
I know you could kill it.
I was like me.

42
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.410
So goofy face.

43
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.150
If I read all the comments,
I'll never try another,
you know,

44
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.610
I got a movie that we just a shot for little or nothing called all star weekend.

45
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.250
And it,
the jokes are like all the way out there,
you know?
And,
and it's,

46
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.060
I got everybody in it,
you know,
and we're all taking,

47
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.890
we all play different characters.
Like I play a white racist,
white racist cop.

48
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.290
And how do you do that?
I'll show,
I'll show it to you.
I'll grab,

49
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.980
I'll grab the thing and show to you.
But it's a,
they,
uh,

50
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.860
Robert Downey jr plays a Mexican.
I called,
I said,
listen,

51
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:03.780
I need you to play a Mexican.
He says,
dude,
here's the deal.
Sure.
Fuck it.

52
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.740
Why not?
Fuck it.
Sure.
Of course.
Mexican,
whatever it back.
I had a,
um,

53
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.150
a bee tea party,
right?

54
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.560
3000 people at my house counted Jesus.

55
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.920
People at the gate,
you know,
trying to get in is,

56
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.530
and as I looked through the party,
there's Floyd Mayweather all time j box.

57
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.300
We'll start baby,
I'll talk to you.
You got to waste party.
I love you,

58
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:26.790
but you don't got to,

you know,

59
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.840
so there's Florida's Fed Joe,

60
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.050
this little Kim is on stage performing and I don't want to put everything out

61
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:38.320
there that he does.
He's super,
super competitive.

62
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.210
That's what's amazing.
But he also understands that,
yeah,
j Fox,

63
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:46.450
I understand what's going on.
Your autonomy.
They,

they want me to fall j Fox.

64
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:48.580
But that's what keeps me competitive.
That's what I,
you know,
all the time,

65
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.500
easily work,
light work.
So he will sit at my crib and speak for like hours.
