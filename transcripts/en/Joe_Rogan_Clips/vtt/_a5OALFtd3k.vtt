00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
Weird that I've never,

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.130
like I just recently found out all that shit that's happening in massage
parlors.

3
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:07.290
But like,
you know,
10 years ago I had no clue.

4
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:09.960
I would go buy a massage parlor and go,
oh,
that's my massages.

5
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.980
There's nothing bad going on here.
I wonder how many places like that are like,

6
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:16.620
like psychics,
what happens at psychics at four in the morning?

7
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:17.850
Why are they open at four in the morning?

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.540
Cause that where you get your ass beat out.
And I,

9
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.490
you don't learn about that until you're 70 or something.
Mm.
I don't think so.

10
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.950
Thanks.
Psychics are open late at night because hey,

11
00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:31.700
it's a scam and be when people were,
it's late at night,

12
00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:34.550
they're drunk and like maybe it's a girl was driving home.

13
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:37.910
The guy texted her and she does know,
should I text him back?

14
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.150
Why is he texted me so late?
That's kind of disrespectful.

15
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.100
I don't know if he's the one and she pulls into that psychic's office and she's

16
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:46.934
like,

17
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.370
I just need you to tell me about my future and the psychic cause like I sense

18
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.670
there's a problem and romantic interests.
My boyfriend.
Yes.
Yes.

19
00:00:57.671 --> 00:01:01.520
There's your stressed.
There's something deeply troubling you.

20
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.810
Your you're confused.
I am confused.
Yes.

21
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:10.010
You're confused.
You trying to,
the decisions hard to,

22
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.610
there's something coming up.
Something's happening.
Can you ask,

23
00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:16.730
can you come over to the house and fucking mail and Derek?
Yes.
That's it.

24
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.180
There's a thing that he's wanting you to do that you're not so sure if he's the

25
00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:22.970
one.
Is that it?
Yes.
Oh my God.

26
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.170
That's what I said when I was on the way over here and then when he said,

27
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.260
you're not sure if he's the one.
I'm like,
oh my fucking God.

28
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.490
Is it like written on my forehead?
How's it possible?
He knows.

29
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.590
He fucking knew about mark.

30
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.450
He knew about our relationship problems and he knew that I was on my way over

31
00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:44.240
there wondering whether or not he's the wine.

32
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.910
I don't think it's a while.
I don't think he's still,
well,

33
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.240
I think you're my favorite girl voice guy.
You know,
like

34
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.173
<v 1>serious.</v>

35
00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.750
You fucking asshole and your friends and all this bullshit with,

36
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:06.670
I'm trying to figure out how this fucking psychic knows.

37
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.000
You're not the one for me.
How does this,

38
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.130
<v 0>no,
how does she know?</v>

39
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.870
Friend of mine went to Morningside.
He knew my grandmother's Whoa.

40
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.580
Everything about my relationship,
my grandmother,
I go,
don't you know,

41
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.910
don't you know everything about your relationship with your grandmother?

42
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.110
What the fuck you want?

43
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.370
Do you want to pay people to tell you shit you already knew?
Hey,

44
00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:31.320
it's four o'clock it is four o'clock you're fucking nuts.
I'm wearing a watch.

45
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.420
Ah,
oh.
When it rains out,
you get wet.
Whoa,
this guy's crazy.

46
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.470
Tell me all the Shit I already knew.
It's crazy.
I bet.

47
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.690
I bet it's psychics are way better now nowadays because of technology and like

48
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.880
they probably have like little ear earpiece in some guy in the back.

49
00:02:45.881 --> 00:02:49.610
It's like looking at their license plate number online and finding out where

50
00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:53.150
they live.
You know like the,
and just feeding the person information.
I bet.

51
00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:54.320
Psychic sark killer.

52
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.850
Now I bet there's some probably they're like super high scammy level

53
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.890
because you want the repeat customer.
So if you're that accurate,

54
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.790
I bet there's a huge scam in that.
That is a crazy thing.
If you're driving,

55
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.300
like you're driving through Burbank or some shit every couple miles,

56
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:15.010
you see one of those psychic reader places,
five in the morning,
open,

57
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.520
big hill,
hand on the front,
like a hand job place.
But it's a psychic.

58
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.730
I went to one once when I was a in New York and I was going to these fucking

59
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:29.590
stupid auditions.
I did not want to act and I was going,
I was just,

60
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.090
it wasn't what I was interested in doing.
But like your agency would tell you,

61
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:36.610
well,
you know,
you really should look into this and you'd see what it was.

62
00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:40.210
It was like some role that I didn't,
not only was I not going to get it,

63
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:44.050
but I didn't want it.
Like this is like,
it's not even funny.

64
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:47.200
It's like super serious.
Yeah,
but you should do it.
So they just,
they know,

65
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.320
they know what you could do commercials that go in and read for commercials.

66
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:52.420
And I'd be like,
what the fuck am I doing?

67
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.440
So I left one of them and I was terrible at it too.
I was terrible auditioning.

68
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.810
And then I went to this,
um,

69
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.000
I went to the psychic and I'm like,
well,
fuck it.
Let's say it's only like,

70
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.790
I don't remember how much it was,
like five bucks,
10 bucks.
She's like,

71
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.690
you don't get along with your brothers.
I go,
I don't have any brothers shit.

72
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.660
I looked at her,
you don't know anything,

73
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.680
like looked in her eyes and she looked at me and I knew that she knew that.

74
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.570
I knew she was full of Shit,
stuff that I knew she was full of Shit.

75
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:29.470
I looked at her,
I don't have any brothers.
She was like,
Oh shit.
I got crazy.

76
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:32.260
She got gangster.
She took a swing.
She's like,

77
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:34.030
I'm sensitive brothers from this asshole.

78
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.290
Could a chip and a shutter shoulder brothers probably beat him up?
No,

79
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.290
it came from a bad audition.
You missed it,
lady.
It's weird,
Huh?
