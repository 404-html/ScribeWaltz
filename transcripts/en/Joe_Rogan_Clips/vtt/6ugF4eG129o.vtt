1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.180
Let me,
let me give this guy a trance because things are bad.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.620
The media is lying to me.
Wall Street's line to me.
And so,
you know,
Trump,

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.000
Trump won,
but unfortunately now Trump is part of the establishment.

4
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.290
Uh,
and now all of a sudden the fake economic numbers are legit.

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.450
Now every time there's an unemployment number out,

6
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.610
he tweets about how it's the lowest at separate pen.

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.870
So I think that when we get this next recession,

8
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:29.190
which is going to happen while Trump is president during,
during this first term,

9
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:32.660
which I think will be the only term,
but when all the people,

10
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.290
why do you think those two things?
Well,

11
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:37.980
because I think the economy is going to fall into a severe recession.

12
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.180
What makes you say that?
Well,
a,
you know,
it's,
we're overdue,
right?
I mean,

13
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:45.390
you don't normally have an expansion that lasts as long as this one.

14
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:46.020
I think that we're,

15
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.470
we're the second longest in history and if we go for another year,

16
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:50.670
it will be the longest expansion

17
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.940
<v 1>history.
2008 is when it started to turn around.</v>

18
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:58.941
And that was a nine kind of the end of 2009 years in exactly what does a usual

19
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:03.580
expansion and compression,
I don't know,
five,
six years.
So,
so this

20
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.020
<v 0>one is long,
but it also,</v>

21
00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:09.920
this one required more government stimulus than any other,
you know,

22
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:12.850
or recovery.
And I don't think we actually recovered.

23
00:01:12.851 --> 00:01:14.690
I think the government simply,
you know,

24
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.540
injected a bunch of cheap money into the economy and exacerbated the real

25
00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:20.590
problems.
But you know,

26
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:24.640
reflated the bubbles in the stock market and the housing market.
But you know,

27
00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:26.980
everybody talks about how the economy is doing so great,

28
00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:29.890
but it's really not much better than it was under Obama.

29
00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:30.910
If it's any better at all.

30
00:01:30.911 --> 00:01:35.800
And we've GDP growth for Trump's first year in office last year was 2.3%.

31
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.010
I mean,
nothing great.
First quarter was 2%.
Um,

32
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
this quarter might be a better than three,
maybe,
maybe not.
But I mean,

33
00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:43.930
I think it's going to be the second quarter.

34
00:01:43.931 --> 00:01:46.180
We'll probably be the best quarter of the year.

35
00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:48.280
Maybe we're probably going to go downhill.
But you know,

36
00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:52.570
last year was I think the,
the weakest year of job growth since 2011.

37
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.000
So people want to talk about how great everything is,

38
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.050
but it's more a function of people are hoping things are gonna turn around and

39
00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:01.720
there's a lot of optimism now,
but things are going to get better.

40
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.090
But I think that the people who are so optimistic,

41
00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:06.070
a lot of them are going to be disappointed because we're,

42
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.440
we're going to end up with is a weaker economy.

43
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.220
The only thing that's really strengthened and inflation inflation is going to

44
00:02:12.221 --> 00:02:12.521
pick up.

45
00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:16.420
So the cost of living is really going to be rising as the economy is falling

46
00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:19.440
into recession.
So we get stagflation,
uh,

47
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.230
which is probably the worst possible economic scenario.

48
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.710
And you know,
I think that the,
uh,

49
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.240
the left and even the Fed is going to be able to blame it on Trump because Trump

50
00:02:31.241 --> 00:02:32.370
has come in and,
you know,

51
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.040
claim credit for this great economy that he believes we have.

52
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.920
And he's claimed credit for the records in the stock market,

53
00:02:38.921 --> 00:02:42.220
but he's basically put his name on a bubble and when it pops,

54
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.940
you know it's going to be hard for him to try to blame the next recession on

55
00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:49.990
Obama when he's already said,
hey,
this is my economy.
I created it.

56
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.850
And so people are going to be disappointed and they're going to vote I think for

57
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.863
uh,

58
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.920
another person whose promises change and unfortunately that's going to come from

59
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:04.210
the left.
So you think this is going to happen within the next three years?
Well,

60
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:06.330
yeah.
I mean what is the bubble like?

61
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.340
What do you think is going to cause it to crash?
Commercial real estate?

62
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.290
Is it credit?
What is it?
Well,
I mean,

63
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:14.710
commercial real estate is expensive being it's in a bubble,
but that,
you know,

64
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:17.350
that's not going to cause it.
I mean air's going to come out of the bubble.

65
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:20.860
I think we would already be in a pretty severe recession.

66
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:24.820
Now had it not been for Trump winning had Hillary won.

67
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.810
I think we would already be there.
But I think that makes you say that,

68
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.260
well we got a lot of false optimism as a result of,
of Trump.

69
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:36.140
And we did get the tax cuts and the tax cuts.
You know,
just like you know,

70
00:03:36.141 --> 00:03:37.840
any kind of artificial drug,
you know,

71
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:42.010
you can inject yourself and get a little bit of a phony high.
Uh,

72
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.330
because remember the tax cuts were paid for with debt.

73
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.470
We didn't shrink government.
Right?
If you,
if you make government smaller,

74
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.251
that's great,

75
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:54.700
then you can cut taxes because now the government doesn't need as much money and

76
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:55.421
you can,
you know,

77
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:59.380
you can relieve the taxpayer of the burden of paying for it and that's great.

78
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.800
But if you just cut taxes but you don't cut government spending.

79
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.310
And of course what the Trump administration did was,
was even worse.

80
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.310
They increase government spending,
we increased welfare spending,

81
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:13.660
we increased warfare spending.
Uh,
and so spending is more,

82
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.360
but they reduced their tax revenues.

83
00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:19.710
So the deficits are just exploding out of control and those deficits are going

84
00:04:19.711 --> 00:04:23.560
to do more damage to the economy than the tax cuts were benefit.

85
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.680
Except you get the benefit first,
maybe for the first year,

86
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:29.500
and then you start to deal with the pain after that.

87
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:31.870
And so I think that's going to set in a,
you know,

88
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:33.490
long before the end of Trump's term.

89
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.350
So you think that this is what is causing the economy to be in a really,

90
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.520
at least a two to look like it's in a really healthy state right now.
Well,

91
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.180
some of the numbers,
right?
Some of the numbers look better.
Um,

92
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.100
but beneath the surface,
again,

93
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.790
it's not improving just like it just like it wasn't improving under Obama.

94
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:56.470
That's what laid the foundation for Trump's victory was because Obama and

95
00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:59.140
everybody kept talking about how great the recovery was.

96
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.920
But the average voter knew that that was all a bunch of nonsense because he

97
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:05.440
wasn't living in that reality.

98
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.510
So if you were the financial advisor to the president,
what would you tell him?

99
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.070
How would you,

100
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.360
what would you do to try to keep the economy moving in the same direction?

101
00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:19.150
Is it possible to ward off when you kind of a crash?
Right.

102
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:21.970
And we don't want to keep it moving in the same direction.
I mean,

103
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.120
it's in the same direction it was going in before Trump came in.

104
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:29.090
And that's towards the edge of a cliff.
I mean,
so what we do,
we need it is,

105
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.350
is it about face and Trump has not doing that.

106
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.830
I mean about face woods for the people that are listening to this that don't

107
00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:39.610
understand,
like they,
they're saying,
okay,
the economy supposed to be doing well,

108
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.020
a black unemployment is the lowest it's ever been on.
Unemployment is down.

109
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.400
All these jobs have been created.
Yeah.
Well remember again,

110
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.510
the unemployment rate is mainly down because so many people that are unemployed

111
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:56.370
are no longer counted as part of the statistics.
So you know that,

112
00:05:56.371 --> 00:06:00.260
that's if you look at the labor force participation rate near record low,

113
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:02.000
I mean certainly for men,
uh,

114
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:06.200
it's the lowest it's been in the history of the republic.
Um,
but,
and look at the,

115
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:07.730
you know,
workers to population.

116
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:12.290
So fewer and fewer people are actually working and more and more of the people

117
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:15.770
who aren't working are not included in the unemployment statistics.

118
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:18.020
So if you backed all those people in,
right,

119
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.890
able bodied people who don't have jobs but should be working,

120
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:23.720
then the unemployment rate is much,
much higher.

121
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.840
So that that doesn't really paint a good picture.
And then,
you know,

122
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:30.920
you look at the fact that so many Americans are unqualified,
right?

123
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:35.600
There's a lot of jobs out there that go on Phil because American workers aren't

124
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:38.500
qualified to fill those positions.
Because,
you know,
we,

125
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.510
we take a lot of our kids and we keep them in high school until they're 1819

126
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:48.020
years old.
Many of these kids should drop out of high school and learn a trade.

127
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.460
I mean,
a lot of people,
you know,
they don't have the aptitude for academics.

128
00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:54.380
There's no point in just being in high school.

129
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:57.440
A lot of times they're glorified daycare centers,

130
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.390
but they should be out learning trades.

131
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:03.650
And of course we make it harder for employers to train people on the job with

132
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:06.410
occupational licensing laws and minimum wage laws.

133
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.610
So we destroy a lot of the opportunities for younger kids to get skills.

134
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.040
And then the ones that we send the college,
they waste their time,
you know,

135
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.790
majoring in liberal arts.
So they spend four or five,

136
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:20.720
six years in college learning nothing of any real value in the market.

137
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.620
They accumulate a massive amount of debt in the process.
And so,
you know,

138
00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:28.070
we have a labor force that's highly educated and that they've got a bunch of

139
00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:31.370
degrees.
Maybe they didn't learn anything,
but they've got a piece of paper.

140
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.170
But then what they have is a lot of debt.

141
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.470
And so we don't have a lot of people qualified to do a lot of the things that

142
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:40.960
need to be done.
So what would you tell the president if you were,
if you,
he said,

143
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:44.090
look,
Peter Schiff,
uh,
I don't know shit about the economy.

144
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.140
You obviously do help me out.
How do you stop this bubble?
Well,

145
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.020
first of all,
you can't stop it.
You got to let it to fleet.

146
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.120
But the question is how does it deflate?

147
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:55.310
And then what do you propose as the solution?

148
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.780
See the problem that Trump already made was when he first got elected,

149
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.280
he should not have changed his perspective.
He shouldn't have said,
hey,

150
00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:07.040
everything is great right now.
He's planning on running.

151
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.600
His next campaign is keep America great.
Right?
When Trump ran for office,

152
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.230
he said America was an economic wasteland,
that it was a disaster.

153
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.120
He's been president for a little over a year.

154
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:20.180
All of a sudden it's the greatest economy in the history of the country,

155
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.490
which is not even close to being true.

156
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.010
But if he's going to try to run for reelection on,

157
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.700
I've already made America great and now we just want to keep it great.

158
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.260
That's not gonna resonate.

159
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.130
So what he should have done from day one is leveled with the American public.

160
00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:34.964
Again,

161
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.570
this is how bad the problem is and this is what it's going to take to solve it

162
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.140
because there's a lot of,
you know,
um,
pain,

163
00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:46.970
short term pain that we're going to need to go through in order to come to the

164
00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:47.540
other side.
