1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Four,
three,
two,
one.
Tj,
the,
Oh,

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.160
how are you brother?
I'm doing good man.
What is it like now?
What does this,
uh,

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.780
what did what,
first of all,
what was it like that night?
If for people don't know,

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.670
let me just give you the rundown just so you don't have to say it.
Cool.

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.420
You were involved in one of the most high profile flyweight fights ever eat the

6
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:24.080
bantamweight champion.
He dropped down to flyweight.

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.270
You went through this extensive training routine to get your body down to a

8
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:34.650
manageable weight where you can cut the last 10 pounds or so and make one 25 the

9
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:38.700
fight starts so Hutto lands a good shot early.
There's a lot,

10
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:43.500
a lot of action,
and the referee stopped the fight and I was,

11
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.980
I was shook by it.
Everybody that I was watching the fight with,
it was like,

12
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.180
what the fuck?
Then it was almost universal.

13
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:52.710
Like no one thought it was a good stop.
It,

14
00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:57.140
it's one of those stoppages where no one goes,
yeah,
as a good stop it.

15
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.750
Stop it.
No one,
everybody was like,
what the fuck?
You jumped off and you're like,

16
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:04.440
dude,
come on.
Come on man.
It's been rough man.
That's a rough one.

17
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:08.040
That won't rough one to swallow on on [inaudible].
Well reasons,
you know,
um,

18
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.090
like you say,
he landed in good shot.
Um,
the,
the,

19
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.480
everything's being overshadowed by this shot.
The landing behind my ear,
you know,

20
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.360
um,
I was over off balance that through a right hand.

21
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:20.550
I came in a little too aggressive.
That's the way I fight,
right?

22
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:23.100
He pushed me over,
I was off balance.
He threw a kick,

23
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:26.160
I blocked it and he went to throw a right hand and I tried to dip out of the
way.

24
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.140
And it's one of those shots that hits you behind the head,

25
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:32.340
like right behind the ear.
Not Illegal,
right?
Runner feet.
It's completely illegal.

26
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:34.400
But,
uh,
it was an unfortunate situation.

27
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.840
One of those punches just kind of takes your feet out from underneath you.

28
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.220
You're 100% there,
but your equilibrium's off,
you know?
And he jumps on me.
Um,

29
00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:44.310
I remember hearing the ref say Dillashaw show me something.
I told him I'm good.

30
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.070
And I remember talking to him before the fight in the back and he said,
like,

31
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:49.200
if I'm telling you that makes sure you're talking to me,
give me,

32
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:53.070
show me something,
you know,
but how are you talking?
I said it,
I said I'm good.

33
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.270
But in his,
you know,
from,
from his personal perspective,

34
00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:58.840
how does he expect you to talk?

35
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.910
You're blocking even said too in the back before the fight too.
Like,
you know,

36
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:05.970
give me a thumbs up or something if you're going to choke this or that,
you know.

37
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:09.600
So,
uh,
to be honest,
I think he was,
I didn't,
I didn't know who he was.

38
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:11.280
I think he's really inexperienced watching him.

39
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:14.700
Rafa's we'll do jumping around as soon as the commotion and it happened.

40
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:19.140
He was looking for a reason to stop it almost.
Um,
but you know,
I can't,

41
00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:22.650
I think it was amped up.
Yeah.
I mean,
it's a big fight fight for him to,
you know,

42
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:27.060
for him to get a high profile fight first time on ESPN plus.
Yes.
Big Deal.

43
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.560
A hundred percent a hundred percent.
So that's the,

44
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.760
I think that's the part that most bugs me more is that I was there.
Um,

45
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.490
but it was the shot that hit me behind the head.
Um,

46
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.890
and then obviously the controversial stoppage.
So it's,

47
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:41.340
it's a rough one to swallow.
You know,
it's,
it's definitely,
uh,
been bugging me,

48
00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:41.911
but,
uh,

49
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:45.210
I'm good at like keeping my mind off of things and staying busy and Modi back in

50
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:48.390
the gym,
um,
doing business things and uh,

51
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.600
trying to stay as busy as possible so I don't think about it and want to punch a

52
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:53.520
hole through a wall every time I walk by one.
Well,

53
00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:58.521
it's such a different fight because it was such an arduous task for you to get

54
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.420
down to flyweight I mean,
people are looking,
you look great right now.

55
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:04.390
Your face is full,
you look healthy.
But God damn,
dude,

56
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:08.350
I saw you the week of the fight on television and I was like,
look at his face.

57
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.300
Tweaker yeah,
you did.
You,
you looked like you were,
uh,
you know,
so who knows?

58
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:15.400
Said it best.
You look like an ultra marathon runner,

59
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:17.620
like some guy who runs long distances.

60
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.040
If I were to decide to lose all the way at the end,

61
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:22.260
I wouldn't have looked like that.
Right.

62
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.510
But I got my buddy down to five to 6% body fat,
you know,

63
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:28.330
so when I start losing anything towards the end,
it's going to come.

64
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:30.110
You're going to see it out of my face.
Right.
You know,

65
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.130
and I'm one of those guys that loses and gains weight out of my face.
You know,

66
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.610
after my fights we call myself fat Tyler.
Cause that's my,

67
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.770
my real name is Tyler and I go by Tj.

68
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:42.260
And so Justin Buchholz gave me that name back at Alpha male.
Like Tyler.

69
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.670
I'd always get puffy face,
watch my fights in my alter egos,
fat Tyler,

70
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.210
you know what I'm going out and eating and being an asshole spaghetti.
Yeah,

71
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.330
exactly.
Um,
but uh,
so when I,
when I decided to,
like if I,

72
00:03:54.331 --> 00:03:57.410
I did over 12 weeks,
so my body weight was down.
I mean my,

73
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.820
my body fat percentage is down a 5%.
That's crazy.

74
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:03.400
And so when you lose any more waterway or anything,

75
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:04.840
you're going to see it come under your face.

76
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:06.790
And because I was doing it for so long that,

77
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:11.380
what was it like being that low on you as far as your body fat goes?

78
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.860
What was your performance like physically?
How'd you feel?
I actually,

79
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:19.310
so I felt the best I've ever felt before I walked up before the fight really do

80
00:04:19.311 --> 00:04:19.520
that.

81
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.710
And that's another reason why I'm just so bitter about the thing is because I

82
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:26.020
didn't get a chance to show the work that I put in.

83
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.720
I didn't get a chance to show all the science behind Sam,

84
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.730
Kavita and what he did to my body.

85
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:33.880
I was stronger for this fight then it was my last Cody fight.

86
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.600
I walked out two pounds heavier for this fight than I did my last Cody fight.

87
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.740
What did you walk out too before I started warming up a weighed one 49 watts.

88
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.140
Yes.
And I felt great.
I didn't feel bloated and feel nothing.

89
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.300
You went from one 25 to one 49 yeah,
I was a glycogen battery.

90
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:52.120
I was ready to fucking go.
I couldn't get tired before the fight.

91
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:54.550
When I was warming up in the back.
I seriously like,

92
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.710
I've never felt better than this before a fight,

93
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.760
like my mood and my energy levels like me hit and miss with Dwayne in the back

94
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:03.230
warming up,
I was feeling smooth,
I was feeling good.

95
00:05:03.231 --> 00:05:07.210
I remember even walking out in the cage and everything felt too good almost too.

96
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:10.690
I remember looking over Duane smiling him,
I felt awesome.
Um,

97
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.510
and that's even more of an unfortunate situation that I didn't get to really

98
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.930
show that,
you know?
Well,
I mean,
hats off to Henry because he's a course.

99
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.940
I mean he,
he did catch you and he is one of the best.
He's a,

100
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.060
I mean there's that kind of caliber of athlete was what made this fight so

101
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:30.370
special.
You being bantamweight champion going down to flyweight.
Yep.

102
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.780
And I think the way you did it is probably the only way to really do it safely.

103
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.680
Yeah,
for sure.
I,
yeah,
I mean,
I guess you were safe because you were only,

104
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:42.491
you were like,
what,

105
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:46.540
one 35 ish the day before I made weight the night before the fight.

106
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.670
Why would we are not the night before a ins?
So I went to sleep,
um,

107
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.510
1.3 pounds over and I floated the,
actually took a shit the morning or Wayne's,

108
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:59.230
which is insane.
That never happens.
Like my body was still working.
Um,

109
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.090
I wanted to make the wait the night before because obviously I hadn't made one

110
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:02.720
25.

111
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.660
I didn't want it to wake up in the morning and see what my body was going to do

112
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:08.300
and if it was going to give me that extra water.
Um,
but I made,

113
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.960
I made weight super easy,
man.
Like you don't get me wrong.

114
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:14.960
The 12 weeks was a motherfucker.
It was hard.
It was a lot of work.

115
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.830
But though the actual weight cut was easy.
I had no hiccups,

116
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:21.710
nothing like Sam would tell me like what to go to bed at.

117
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:25.520
He knew what I was going to wake up at.
He tells me the water loading I'm doing.

118
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.480
Um,
the amount electrolytes I'm taking in the,
the,
the amount of food I'm eating.

119
00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:31.730
And so he knows exactly what my buddies and wake up and do.

120
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.340
He's been tracking it for two years now.

121
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.860
That guy sounds brilliant and really needed to talk to him,

122
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.910
watch videos of him talking about it and seeing the work and just what a,

123
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.940
what a unique individual he is.
I mean,

124
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:46.970
that's why I decided to move back down to southern California for him.
For him.

125
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.250
Yeah.
And then everything else kind of came along with it.

126
00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:51.620
My life is wonderful now.
The people that got around me,

127
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.830
I'm lucky that I have Duane Ludwig this willing to try it out and travel out and

128
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.400
train with me out there.
Um,

129
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.450
but I moved down to southern California because the Sam Cal Vidya and I came

130
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:02.530
down to two weeks with him and started noticing like,
damn,

131
00:07:02.531 --> 00:07:06.230
this guy knows his shit.
You know,
I didn't really uniquely,
no.

132
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.500
I mean there's a lot of people out there who know their shit,

133
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.690
but he seems like he's on some new level.
I mean,

134
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:15.190
he sent me graphs that I have on my phone of like the,
like he would,

135
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.950
he like to every week we knew exactly what my body weight wanted to be at.

136
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.130
He was telling me weights that I'd be at before I would even be there and my

137
00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:25.700
body would just do it,
you know.
Um,
so you didn't need a separate person.

138
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:28.790
So He's here.
This is what's unusual about this.
Normally,

139
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:31.060
if you would hire somebody,
you,

140
00:07:31.061 --> 00:07:34.070
you would hire like a George Lockhart or something like that,

141
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.770
Mike Dolce and then you would,

142
00:07:36.771 --> 00:07:40.100
you would hire them almost specifically just for the way cut and some nutrition

143
00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:44.810
advice.
He's training you physically as well.
He's telling me my low base,
like,

144
00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:48.500
so my long distance running when I,
or my fasted low bass,
he,
yeah,

145
00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:52.520
he does everything.
My strength conditioning,
my nutrition,
he,
they make my meals.

146
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.810
They do all my meal prep.
He's telling me like,

147
00:07:54.811 --> 00:07:58.370
w how much a low bay sending you do per week.
I,
either morning or night,

148
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.430
he's telling me when I should train.
Um,
it's,
uh,

149
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.490
everything is completely mapped out.
I don't,
there's no guesswork in it.

150
00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:06.170
There's nothing like he's telling me everything,

151
00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:08.210
like he's listening to my heart rate when I'm sleeping.

152
00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:12.210
The heart rate variability is,
he's telling me what supplements to take.
Um,

153
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:17.100
all of it,
you know,
like everything.
I seriously and,
and,
and I,

154
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.520
that's,

155
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.540
that's another reason why it's just so tough that this fight didn't get to like

156
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:23.900
really let me prove anything,
not only for myself and who I am,

157
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:25.730
but the work that this guy put in,
you know,

158
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:28.970
like I'm gonna sit here and Brag about him and tell him how bad ass he is.

159
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:31.550
But then people want to tell me like,
oh,
you were malnourished.

160
00:08:31.551 --> 00:08:33.920
You don't have a chin one 25,
it was a bad cup for you.

161
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:37.130
They're giving him crap all over the place.
And,
uh,

162
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.490
I've almost feel just as bad for him as I do for myself for how much work you

163
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:43.580
put into it,
how actually how great I felt before the fight.

164
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.050
And I didn't get a chance to show it.
Like I said,

165
00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:49.100
I walked out at one 49 glycogen battery ready to go.
Um,

166
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:54.010
I've really never felt better.
I know,
man,
it was insane.
Like I,

167
00:08:54.011 --> 00:08:58.230
I really believe like how my body absorbed everything,
you know?

168
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.940
So what do you walking around like now I'm in low 50.

169
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.390
I'm in low fifties right now,
but that's because I'm trying to be at low fifties.

170
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:11.280
My body instantly wanted to just store everything and I got up to like sixties,

171
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.730
low sixties,
and I was like,
Oh shit.
I said,
I started doing,
I started doing some,

172
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:18.600
uh,
hot yoga and going to where I just worked out with Sam yesterday.

173
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:21.870
I'm going to his house later after this.
And also,
um,

174
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.070
that's Kinda the only way my mind can stay at ease right now with everything

175
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:27.900
that's been going on is that I need to get back in the gym.

176
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.630
What was that night like after it was over?
I mean,

177
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:34.860
going back to your dressing room and going back to your hotel.
Um,
it was rough,

178
00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:39.090
man.
It was definitely a,
a mother fucker.
It,
it was,
it,

179
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.230
I was pissed.
You know,
everyone wants to call me like a sore loser.

180
00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:46.520
I've never said I wasn't a sore loser.
I fucking hate losing more than any of,

181
00:09:46.521 --> 00:09:46.921
I mean you,

182
00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:51.090
you show me a champion or a high level competitor that likes losing and I'll

183
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:54.180
call you a liar.
You know what I mean?
I think you're 100% correct.

184
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.420
And Jamie and I have talked about this many times when we were talking about the

185
00:09:58.421 --> 00:10:00.420
broad James or Michael Jordan,

186
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:05.180
those guys were infamous for being terrible loser.
I hate losing.
Yeah.

187
00:10:05.181 --> 00:10:05.610
I mean,

188
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:10.200
I just don't think you get to be that elite of the elite unless you're a fucking

189
00:10:10.201 --> 00:10:13.740
maniac.
Yeah.
I really think that,
I mean,
I think about it constantly.
You know,

190
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:17.130
I'm one of those OCD guys.
It's,
if I'm not in the gym,
I'm thinking about it.

191
00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:20.280
I'm just thinking about my training and sometimes I need to distract myself and

192
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:23.640
also I distract myself with other businesses or things I've got going on because

193
00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:27.210
I think about it too much.
Um,
and so,
especially when it's a controversial thing,

194
00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:30.420
when people are questioning things and it's going to piss you off even more.

195
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:33.000
I mean,
I hate losing,
so you're definitely gonna see us.

196
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:36.570
So at night was rough man.
I mean the ride back to the hotel and you know,

197
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.030
I didn't want to go out.
I didn't want really want to eat.

198
00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:40.800
I just wanted to hang out with my son,
you know,

199
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:45.330
like just get me away from fighting and let me think about my family.
So,

200
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.850
yeah.
So,
um,
where is everything at right now in terms of,

201
00:10:50.851 --> 00:10:54.800
have you talked to the UFC?
What was their take on everything?
Um,

202
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.140
Dana said it was a quick stoppage.
Yeah.
I mean,

203
00:10:58.141 --> 00:10:59.400
everyone's been saying it's quick stop.

204
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.950
Big John McCarthy Big John McCarthy is calling out the [inaudible] saying that

205
00:11:02.951 --> 00:11:04.560
he thought it was a quick stoppage.
We got,

206
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.400
I take any texting you on a couple of nights ago.
Same thing.
Yeah.
I mean,

207
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:12.480
so everyone,
everyone,
everyone thinks it,
you know,
and uh,
Dana was saying like,

208
00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:14.280
hey,
okay,
we'll figure it out.
And there's a couple of days,

209
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.400
or at least off of edge.
I'm obviously pissed about it.
Just know that nothing,

210
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:21.630
I want this to happen,
you know?
So,
um,
my manager,
Tiki,
he's been in talks with,

211
00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:24.240
we haven't really heard nothing yet on,
on the decision what's going to happen.

212
00:11:24.241 --> 00:11:26.730
I love Tiki.
He's the best.
He's a great guy.
He's,

213
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.970
he's a great manager because he's been in the fight game.
He's been around,

214
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:33.990
he's fine.
He's been here forever,
early UFC days.
Good dude too.

215
00:11:33.991 --> 00:11:37.470
He's just got such a great personality.
He's just a fun guy to be around.
Yeah.

216
00:11:37.471 --> 00:11:40.590
So He's been,
he's been awesome for my career.

217
00:11:40.591 --> 00:11:42.060
I've only been with them for a short while,
the time,

218
00:11:42.061 --> 00:11:46.380
but he's been awesome for me.
But,
uh,
he's been in talks with a hunter and Dana,

219
00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:49.740
and so we're,
I'm hoping to figure out something soon because I'm Ma,

220
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.010
I'll fight tomorrow,
you know,
like I'll fight him yet out whatever way he wants.

221
00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:57.310
I obviously would prefer 25 because I put in a lot of work and I want to show

222
00:11:57.311 --> 00:12:01.300
that I know what I'm doing and it wasn't a fluke or that this was a fluke,

223
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.140
that this wasn't something that,
um,
well,
here's the deal.

224
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:10.150
Even if the fight went longer,
any stopped you and he legitimately stopped.
Yeah.

225
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.750
Look,
he's Henry.
So who don't mean that that's,
that's a possibility.

226
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:16.960
This is the game.
100%.
This is what it is.
That's why me so great.

227
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.790
It is what can happen.
You know what I mean?

228
00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:22.000
Like you go out there like no matter if you're the huge favorite,

229
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.570
anything can happen.
What?
It just didn't get a chance to happen.

230
00:12:25.571 --> 00:12:27.670
That's what's unfortunate.
I mean,
he really did land.

231
00:12:27.671 --> 00:12:31.480
Some good shots are really what's coming on story.
But he came out ready.
Yeah,

232
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.560
he was.
Yeah.
He's a bad motherfucker.
And you are you,

233
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.100
which is why that fight was so interesting.
He had some shit to prove.

234
00:12:39.101 --> 00:12:43.020
He was there to save the flyweight division.
Yeah.
And look,
he did it.
No one,

235
00:12:43.021 --> 00:12:43.854
I mean,

236
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.260
until I had the balls enough to drop down and 225 there really wasn't any hype

237
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:50.080
on a flyweight fight.
Um,
the net there was,

238
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.850
and now there still is and he wants to save that.

239
00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:54.910
He wants to talk about saving the flyweight division.
Then let's do it.
Well,

240
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:58.570
I think he wants to go up,
of course.
And he's,
then he can be champ champ.

241
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:03.690
And I understand that when there was no champ champ or Connor came wrong,

242
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.750
Conor really changed the game in so many ways.
Yeah.
But I mean,

243
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.190
one of the ways he changed the game,
it was calling himself champ champ.

244
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:14.340
Now everybody is chap chat.
You know,
Ryan Baders,
champ,
champ.
You know,

245
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:14.890
I mean,

246
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.620
Amanda Nunez is champion as a way to market yourself and the name out there.

247
00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:22.970
It is a really big deal.
You know,
I'm at the term champ champ.
Oh yeah.
It's like,

248
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:27.360
that is a fucking Conor McGregor,
Conor McGregor term.
He's got some,
uh,

249
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.730
he's got some gold behind his touch.
Anything he touches turns into gold.

250
00:13:30.731 --> 00:13:31.720
I not lucky charm.
