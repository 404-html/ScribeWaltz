1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.470
I remember he wanted to play in the all star game and all the players were like,

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.633
Nah,
I'm good.

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.820
<v 1>It's going to be a slam dunk contest.
But
Jesus Christ.</v>

4
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.640
But what did,

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.880
what did fucking Damon Wayans you used to have a bit about Dennis Rodman

6
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.220
did was about Dennis Rodman spitting and magic Johnson's mouth to accelerate his

7
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.070
symptoms.
He's like,
if he wanted to try to get hardcore with them,

8
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.430
I forget.
I hope Damon's,
I'm a huge Damon Wayans fan,

9
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.660
so I hope I'm not butchering his bit.
Yeah,

10
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.630
but I think that was one.
I know that was his line.

11
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.460
I'll spit your mouth and accelerate your symptom.
Dude.

12
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.590
I'm Damon Wayans.
My opinion is like one of the most ignored.

13
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.543
Great.

14
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.890
<v 0>I agree.
100%.
I used to open form sometimes and uh,</v>

15
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.550
twice.
I remember him coming in on a Thursday night.
It was Thursday to Sunday.

16
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:06.930
Faneuil hall comedy connection.

17
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.940
Thursday night he comes in fucking yellow pads.

18
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.650
He goes up and just regurgitates a new hour and gets,
okay,

19
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:21.300
laugh for a new hour.
Friday night he comes back tighter,

20
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.710
tighter Sunday night.
It's like he would fucking destroy with a new hour.

21
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.360
It was crazy.

22
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.670
<v 1>He's really good,
man.
Yeah.
He would go,</v>

23
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.790
he would just go up at the comedy store and literally let whatever thought came

24
00:01:36.491 --> 00:01:41.140
into his head and he would take long sets and he would take that stuff and he

25
00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:45.520
would turn that stuff into killer closing bits.
Yeah.
But for whatever reason,

26
00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:50.230
I think he just got into doing sitcoms more.
Right.
It was like,
Eh,
fuck it.

27
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.220
Yeah.
You know?

28
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.180
<v 0>Yeah.
He's uh,
he's could,
that's an interesting family,
man.
They,
you know,</v>

29
00:01:56.181 --> 00:01:58.430
they grew up in the projects in Manhattan.
Dude.

30
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.000
<v 1>Talent in that family.
Keenan,
Damon,</v>

31
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.070
Marlin,
Sean went,
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
That's a lot of camps.

32
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.420
And,
and isn't Damon's son doing standup too now?
Yeah.

33
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.480
Dude at Damen junior.
Right.
What a crazy family.

34
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.160
That's a crazy,
you better be in show business and that family or you're doomed.

35
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.360
Yeah.
Let me think about that.
It's like,
right.

36
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.720
Like if you want to compete with your brothers,

37
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.050
Keenan and every way ans Daymond winds,
Kim Wayins,
Shawn Wayans,
my own wins.

38
00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:36.910
Damien Dante wanes.
Damian Wayans Jr.
That's all of them.

39
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.400
Yeah.
All of them in showbizness.
It's amazing.

40
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.233
<v 2>Yep.</v>

41
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.090
<v 1>Good luck in to the,
had a fucking great talk show how the EA,</v>

42
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.080
he was really,
he was really good as a talk show host.
Yeah.
He was so talented.

43
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:56.760
Fucking family man.
But for whatever reason,
Matt Damon did this one,

44
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.850
a HBO special and I think he called his last stand and uh,

45
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.010
it was really good man.
It was really good.
And the end of it,

46
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:08.130
he just throws the microphone down and says,
look,

47
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.510
this is the last time I'm doing standup.
No Shit.
Yeah.
Wow.

48
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.920
Just like it decided he was going to do movies.
That's it.

49
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.700
Last stand with a question mark.
Yeah.

50
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.980
He got,
um,
you know,
he just got into other stuff,
but I'm telling you,
man,

51
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.880
when he was like,
go up and above go that photo though.

52
00:03:28.881 --> 00:03:33.880
The one like that was the stage,
the baret wearing stage.
Dude,

53
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.790
I'm telling you,
people forgot.
He's one of the best,

54
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.800
one of the best ever do.
He would murder that one particular special.

55
00:03:42.801 --> 00:03:46.480
It's just murderous.
He had a lot of great sets.
Yup.

56
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.110
On television.
But just like real original too,

57
00:03:51.111 --> 00:03:53.690
like one of those guys where you'd watch them and you go,
God damn,

58
00:03:53.691 --> 00:03:56.970
why didn't I think of well,
and his voices were so fucking good.
You know,

59
00:03:56.971 --> 00:04:01.650
a lot of times people do their girlfriend voice and it's just,
it just sucks.

60
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.990
It just sounds like the guy raising his voice.

61
00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:07.260
There's no like female intonation to it or anything.

62
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.070
And his kids voices and his wife or a girlfriend.
Just fucking amazing.
Yeah,

63
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.640
yeah,
there.
Oh,
and then of course it's like Richard Pryor,
Richard Pryor.

64
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.050
So I mean he had so many characters in living color.
How about handyman?

65
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.320
You could never do that.
Yeah,
that's right.

66
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.480
You could never do that to a homeless guy too.

67
00:04:30.481 --> 00:04:33.930
That's another show in living color is another show that people forget.

68
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.860
They forget how good it was.
Yeah,
yeah.
There he is.
There's handyman.

69
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.460
They don't even show reruns of that show too,
that these are frail reruns.

70
00:04:41.461 --> 00:04:42.294
A handyman.

71
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.290
I remember what it was on TV,
man.
No one could stop saying,
homie,
don't play that.

72
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.770
Everybody would say that.
Everybody was like,
Homie,
don't play that.

73
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.410
Like every kid would say that it was homey.

74
00:04:58.411 --> 00:05:01.380
The clown homie don't play that people freak out.

75
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.840
People fucking forgot about homey the clown.
They should come back.

76
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.810
Netflix please throw some money.
No,
they turn the air.

77
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.390
They just tried to do it and it all fell apart.
What happened?

78
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.910
I know they had big money and uh,

79
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.250
I don't know if it was going to be the original cast.

80
00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:22.080
I might've been part of the original cast.

81
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.560
I bet would happen with Jennifer Lopez who want to be a fly girl.
Yeah,
right.

82
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.070
She's like,
no,
she should jump on that shit.
That would be cool.

83
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.430
She jumped back in.
Was a fly girl again.

84
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.430
I mean how much time would it take it not that much time.
She's there.

85
00:05:35.431 --> 00:05:39.770
She's there.
We should probably could dance in her sleep.
Yup.
Yup.
Damn.

86
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.700
I would love that to be a fire girl.

87
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.270
I don't know who else was a flag around any other famous ones did that show was

88
00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:52.710
so good.
I remember watching it.
I was playing pool in Yonkers,

89
00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:54.900
New York,
and I looked up at this,

90
00:05:54.901 --> 00:05:59.630
this TV set and it was a Jim Carrey doing the,
the,

91
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.370
the fire Marshall.
The fire Marshall Bill.
Yeah.

92
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.200
Cause like what the fuck is going on?
Yeah.
This guy's got a burnt up face.

93
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.500
That's Rosie Perez was the choreographer for the first four seasons.

94
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.810
Wow.
No Rosie present.
Giant boxing fan.
Oh yeah.
Giant boxing.

95
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.520
Huh.
Yeah.
Like people,
like she's like a boxing expert.
Not like an expert.

96
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:26.870
Like she could train fighters,
but like people ask her questions about boxing.

97
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.930
She's a real enthusiast.
That's a better term instead of an expert.
I mean,

98
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:34.640
maybe she is an expert,
I don't know.
But,
uh,
she is always around boxing.

99
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:35.181
I think it's so,

100
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:39.380
because you always think of her as having that cute voice and you know,

101
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:43.090
and all those comedies and to see her at like boxing matches are really getting

102
00:06:43.091 --> 00:06:48.020
into it.
It's like,
wow.
Yeah.
Cool.
Um,
and Jim Carrey,

103
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:52.550
I mean,
Jesus Christ,
he would do,
he would do the,
uh,
the,
uh,
convenience store,

104
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:56.810
a security guy,
and he was just so big and so big.

105
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.100
So different than like,

106
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:00.920
I mean you have to go back to Jerry Lewis to think about somebody doing physical

107
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:03.980
comedy that well,
yeah,
he was,
he was a 10,

108
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:09.250
like is his energy and everything was like the fucking ace Ventura movie.

109
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.340
Yeah.
Like that move was just all performance.
Yeah.
Like what is this one?

110
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.920
What is this Vera de Milo to that fucking show was so good.
Yeah.

111
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.210
People forgot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's fire Marshall Bill.
So I was in,

112
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.650
I was in this pool hall and I looked up,
I'm like,
what the fuck is that?

113
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.160
And they're like,
that's fire Marshall Bill.
That's,
that's what it is.

114
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:34.370
He came in like that.
I was like,
that is the creepy shit I've ever seen.

115
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.930
A can't believe they have a character like this.
It was so over the top.

116
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:44.080
Do you think Jim Carrey or maybe one of the Wayne's brothers has bought up the

117
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:48.980
rights for reruns because they don't want that
blowback?

118
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.780
Yeah,
no,
it's a different era.
You have to accept as a different era.

119
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.080
You just,
people were different.
Look,

120
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.170
people are changing and it's a really interesting,

121
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.780
obvious sign that things that were super acceptable.

122
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:04.940
And when was this in living color?

123
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:09.830
I want to say it was like 92 90 to 94 92 94 yeah.

124
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.860
So that the way you could do certain bits and what you get away with and put it

125
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.750
on television,
it was just different.
