1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.610
Right.
So I like,
well,
you know,
I want to get into this because this is a,

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.890
I think this is a fascinating thing with you personally that your diet,

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.750
um,
you're on this carnivore diet now.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.890
<v 1>Okay.
So I want to preface that with something.</v>

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.690
I am not a dietary expert so I'm now speaking as an uninformed citizens.

6
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.520
<v 0>Yes.</v>

7
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.510
Well this is anecdotal evidence from a human being that is dealt with autoimmune

8
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:28.040
issues their whole life.
Yes.
You have done this for how long now?

9
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.540
<v 1>I'd been on a pure carnivore diet for about two months and a pretty,
a very,</v>

10
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:37.230
very low carb greens only modified carnivore diet for

11
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.590
<v 0>bout a year.
So in the year</v>

12
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.980
<v 1>and,
and,
and,
and the low carb diet for two years.</v>

13
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.630
<v 0>From the time that I've known you,
I've known you for what,</v>

14
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:48.510
two and a half years now.
Something like that.
Yeah.
When I first met you,

15
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:51.750
you had much more weight on your body.
You look different.
Yeah.

16
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.370
And you were at back then you were eating like the standard diet,
right?

17
00:00:56.371 --> 00:01:00.720
Like normal people.
Yes.
Pasta,
bread,
chicken,
whatever.

18
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.580
Right.
You shifted over to only meet and Greens.

19
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:08.550
I saw you and I'm like,
did you look fantastic?
I'm like,
what are you doing?

20
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.360
And you're like,
I changed my diet.
I only meet and Greens,
and I was like,
wow,

21
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:14.940
that's fascinating.
Well,
I felt like,
okay,

22
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:17.940
what you're doing is cutting out refined sugars and all these different things

23
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:20.400
that are problematic,
a preservatives,

24
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:24.150
all the bullshit processed foods and you're having this extreme health benefit,

25
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:27.210
and I was like,
wow,
that's really excellent.
You're showing great discipline.

26
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.410
Then you decided to take it to another place and cut out the Greens.

27
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.290
What was the motivation for cutting out the green?

28
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.641
<v 1>Well,</v>

29
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:38.270
all of the motivation for this has been my experience with my daughter because

30
00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:41.540
she has an unbelievably serious autoimmune disease.
I just talked to her.

31
00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:45.410
This wasn't called,
well,
it's arthritis,
but it,
there's,

32
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.030
there's way more to it than that,

33
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.370
but the arthritis was the major set of symptoms.

34
00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:53.570
She had 40 affected joints and she had to have her hip replaced in her ankle,

35
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:55.610
replaced when she was 15 and 16.

36
00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:59.630
And so she basically hobbled around on two broken legs for two years in extreme

37
00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:03.680
agony.
And that was just a tiny fraction of the,
of the whole set of problems.

38
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.350
I just talked to her this morning.
She's in Chicago,

39
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.380
looks like she has to have her ankle replacement replaced.

40
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.930
So that's next on the horizon.
But uh,

41
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.120
but apart from that she is doing so well now.

42
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:18.650
It is absolutely beyond comprehension.
So she's,
she's,

43
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.950
she's very trim.
She had a baby,
but she's very trim.

44
00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:24.830
She's down to about 118 pounds.
She's about five foot six.

45
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.990
She's just glowing with health.
All of her autoimmune system symptoms are gone,

46
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.250
all of them.
And she was also seriously depressed,
like severely depressed,

47
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.840
way worse than you think.

48
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:39.650
She couldn't stay awake for more than about six hours without taking Ritalin.
Um,

49
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.460
and she was dying and I had a cousin,
my cousin's daughter,

50
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.650
she died when she was 30 from an associated autoimmune conditions.

51
00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:51.640
So there's a fair bit of this in our family.
It was bloody bleak.
I'll tell you.

52
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.530
And my wife always had a suspicion that this was dietary related.
You know,

53
00:02:56.531 --> 00:03:01.360
and I,
well we did notice that when Mckayla was young,

54
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:05.470
if she ate oranges or strawberries,
that she'd get a rash.

55
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.470
Like there were there were there.
And then when she developed arthritis,

56
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.500
if she ate oranges in particular,
that would definitely cause a flare.

57
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.840
It was the only thing we could see.
The problem is,

58
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:16.720
is that in order to identify a dietary component,

59
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:19.240
the response has to be pretty quick after you eat the thing.

60
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:21.880
Like if it's two days later,
how the hell are you gonna figure that out.

61
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.860
A lot of these responses appeared to be delayed for four days and last a month.

62
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.420
So good luck figuring that out.
Anyways,
mckayla noticed about three years ago,

63
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.190
no more than that now,
five years ago,

64
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.900
she was at Concordia University and and struggling with her with her illness and

65
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:39.880
all the associations associated problems,

66
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.800
she noticed that around exam time she was starting to develop real skin
problems.

67
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.080
And my cousin's daughter,

68
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:50.410
who I mentioned had really bad skin problems and wounds that wouldn't heal.

69
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:53.920
And that was partly part of the process that eventually killed her and she

70
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:56.710
thought,
oh,
it must be stress.
And then she thought,
wait a second,

71
00:03:56.711 --> 00:04:00.100
I really changed my diet when I'm studying.
All I do is eat bagels.

72
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:03.940
All I do is eat bread sandwiches.
She thought maybe it's the bread.

73
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.160
So she cut out gluten first and it had a remarkable effect,

74
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.120
like really remarkable effect.
And then she,

75
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.670
she went on a radical elimination diet all the way down to nothing but chicken

76
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:20.160
and Broccoli.
And then her symptoms started to drop off one by one like,
and,

77
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.170
and like one of the things that happened is she started to wake up in the

78
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180
morning,

79
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.810
she started to be able to stay awake all day when you're only staying awake for

80
00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:30.010
six hours with Rhydlin staying awake all day.
That's like having a life.

81
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.240
And so a whole bunch of things improved.
Their depression went away.

82
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.830
And I've had depression since I was 13 probably in very severe.

83
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.740
And I've treated it a variety of ways.
Some of them quite successfully,

84
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.970
but it's been a constant battle in my father had it and his father had it and

85
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.020
it's all just rife in my family and my wife has autoimmune problems.

86
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:54.970
And heard you say depression.
Define it.
Oh.
Oh,
uh,
how would you define it?

87
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.420
Because that's a war.
That's a blanket term.
Yeah.
Well imagine,

88
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.660
imagine that you wake up and that you remember that all your family was killed

89
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:03.670
in a horrible accident yesterday.
The,

90
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.850
you would feel that even if nothing's wrong.
Yes.
Yes.
Just,

91
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.280
just a worse than that because we like,
well,

92
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:11.500
one of the things Mckayla told me what she thought,
well,

93
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:12.730
what's it like to be depressed?

94
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.940
Who Imagine you have a dog and you really love the dog.
And then the dog dies.

95
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.310
And then about two,
three years ago,
our dog died and that was MCKAYLA's dog.

96
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.400
And she really liked that dog.
And she said that was bad,

97
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:27.730
but it's nowhere near as bad as being depressed.
And I asked her to,

98
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:31.870
at one point when she was about 15 or 16 I said,
look,
you've got a choice kid.

99
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.830
Here's the choice.
You can either have depression or arthritis,

100
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.650
which what I'll take the arthritis.

101
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.980
Well that was after she'd lost two joints,

102
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.220
so it was no joke.
It's no joke,
man.
It,
there isn't any,
no,

103
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:49.054
I wouldn't say that.

104
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.840
I wouldn't say there's nothing worse cause worse is a very deep hole,

105
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.080
but it's bad.
You know,
people prove you wrong,
right?
Oh yes.

106
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:59.960
Definitely works worse is a deep hole.
Anyways,
her depression went away.

107
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.840
All these symptoms went away and like radically.

108
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.530
So what changed her from chicken and Broccoli to carnivore?
Well,
she,
she,

109
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.720
she kept experimenting and she got very sensitive to all sorts of foods in the

110
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:12.800
aftermath of that too.

111
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.160
So this is why I wouldn't recommend that anybody does this casually because we

112
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:20.180
don't understand much about it.
But the upshot was that while she kept,
she kept,

113
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.920
she kept experimenting and she started to add things back and take them away.

114
00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:27.380
And sometimes when she added things,
the results were devastating.

115
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:30.740
She was like done for a month.
She eat the wrong thing done for a month.

116
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.530
All the symptoms came back.
The depression came back.

117
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.390
She thought that her whole dietary theory was wrong because it lasted so long,

118
00:06:37.391 --> 00:06:38.990
was so extreme and flick.

119
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:42.410
It took her two years to figure out that really what she could eat was beef and

120
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:44.900
greens and then she figured out that she could only eat beef.

121
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.250
So Greens themselves.
Well,
look,
so what happened happened.
Okay,

122
00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:51.500
so two years ago she said,
dad,

123
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:54.470
you have to try this diet because you have a lot of the same symptoms as me.

124
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.550
Now I didn't have arthritis,
but I had a lot of the other symptoms and I thought,

125
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.660
oh Christ,
okay mckayla,
I can try anything for a month.
She said,

126
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:04.700
try it for a month.
I thought,
okay,
whatever.

127
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:07.820
I can hang by my fingernails from the window sale for a month.
It's like,

128
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.660
it's just not that big a deal.
And so I,
I eliminated,

129
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.750
I went on really low carb diet.
Okay,
so this is what happened.

130
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.030
I had gastric reflux disorder and I was snoring quite a lot.

131
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.570
I stopped snoring the first week.
I thought,

132
00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:27.080
what the hell that's supposed to be associated with weight loss?

133
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:28.550
Because I had gained some weight.

134
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:30.950
I weighed about 212 pounds and I'm about six one and a half.

135
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:33.800
So that was my maximum weight stopped snoring,

136
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:37.400
which was a great relief to Tammy that just quit.
And that's a big deal,
right?

137
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.880
Cause if you snore,
you have sleep apnea and then you don't sleep right.

138
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.630
It's like not a good thing.
Okay.
Next I started waking up in the mornings.

139
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.180
I'd never been able to wake up in the mornings my whole life.

140
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.760
I always had to stumble to the shower and then maybe I could wake up,

141
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.460
took me an hour and I felt terrible.
And so all of a sudden I woke up,

142
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.130
it was like,
Whoa,
look at that.
I'm awake in the morning and I'm clear headed and,

143
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.310
and things aren't gloomy and horrible.
It's like,
well,
he's not weird.

144
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.750
Then I lost seven pounds the first month.
I thought seven pounds.

145
00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:06.650
That's a lot in a month.

146
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:09.830
And I'd already gone for a whole year on a sugar free diet and I didn't lose any

147
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:13.700
weight and I'd been exercising sugar free.
But did you cut out bread and no.
Nope.

148
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.670
It was just no desserts,
no sugar,
no.
And I thought that might do,

149
00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:20.630
it didn't make any difference at all.
Seven pounds.
Well then,

150
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.880
then I lost seven pounds in the next month.

151
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.150
Then I lost seven pounds the next month I lost seven pounds every month for

152
00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:28.160
seven months.
Like I'd throw away all my clothes.

153
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.060
I went back to the same weight that I was when I was 26 and my psoriasis

154
00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:35.930
disappeared and I had floaters in my right eye and they cleared up.

155
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.960
And then the last thing that went away from me,

156
00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:42.140
I was still having a bitch of a time with mood regulation and not suck because

157
00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:45.530
when I changed my diet,
I didn't respond to antidepressants properly anymore.

158
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.393
They weren't working.

159
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.910
And so although I was getting better physically on a variety of ways,

160
00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:51.990
like radical ways,
um,

161
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.170
I was really having a bitch of a time regulating my mood and I was having

162
00:08:55.171 --> 00:08:59.040
sporadic,
really negative reactions to food when I ate something I shouldn't.

163
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.520
So that took about a year and a half to clear up and I was still really anxious

164
00:09:02.521 --> 00:09:04.980
in the morning up to three months ago,
like horribly.

165
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:07.110
And then it would get better all day.
People said,
well,

166
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:09.450
you're under a lot of stress.
And I thought,
yeah,
yeah,

167
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:13.320
I've been under a lot of stress for like 10 years.
It's like it's a lot,
but it,

168
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.440
it wasn't any more stressful than helping my daughter deal with her illness.

169
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:20.180
That's for sure that,
no,
this is something different.
And she said to me,

170
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.890
quit eating Greens and I thought,
Oh really?
Jesus mckayla meeting cucumbers,

171
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.060
lettuce,
Broccoli and chicken and beef.
It's like,

172
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:34.470
I have to cut out the God Damn Greens.
He's like,
try it for a month.
Okay.

173
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.590
Within a week I was 25% less anxious in the morning within two weeks,

174
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:43.260
75% and I've been better every single day.

175
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.560
I'm better now probably than I've ever been in my life and I haven't been taking

176
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:49.980
antidepressants for a whole year,
so I don't know what.

177
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.390
And I weigh 162 pounds like I have.
No,
I'm,
I'm,

178
00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.050
and I've actually gained musculature.
I've been doing some working out,

179
00:09:58.051 --> 00:10:02.730
but not a lot.
And so I can sleep six hours a night.
No problem.

180
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:04.170
I wake up in the morning,
I'm awake.

181
00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:07.380
If I take a 15 minute nap that used to take me an hour to recover from,

182
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.300
that's gone.
Here's the coolest thing.

183
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.190
I've had gum disease since I was 25 as being serious enough to have,

184
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.760
I've had to have minor surgical intervention scraping and that sort of thing to

185
00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:22.110
keep it at bay.
It's gone.
I checked with my dentist before this last tour,

186
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.100
no inflammation.
And that's associated with heart disease by the way,

187
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.400
come inflammation and gingivitis.
It's a good risk factor for heart disease.

188
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:32.670
It means that the systemic inflammation is gone and it's not supposed to happen.

189
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.870
You're not supposed to recover from gingivitis.
And my gums are in perfect shape.

190
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.960
It's like,
what the hell?
So here's what happened.
I lost 50 pounds.
It's like,

191
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.590
that's a lot,
right?
I'm nowhere near as hungry as I used to be.

192
00:10:46.591 --> 00:10:48.540
My appetite's probably fallen by 70%.

193
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:53.280
I don't get blood sugar dysregulation problems.
Um,

194
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.090
I need way less sleep.
I get up in the morning and I'm fine.
I'm not anxious.

195
00:10:57.091 --> 00:11:01.530
I'm not depressed.
I don't have psoriasis.
Um,
my legs were numb on the sides.

196
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.480
That's gone.
Um,

197
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.340
I'm certainly intellectually at my best at the moment,

198
00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:12.090
which is a great relief.
Especially doing this tour.
Depression is gone.

199
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.620
I'm stronger,
I can swim better.
Um,

200
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.070
and my gum disease is gone.
It's like,
what the hell?
And you've done,

201
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.360
you've done no blood work,
so you don't know what your lipid lipid profile is or,

202
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.630
no,
I'll get that down again when they go back.
Take any vitamins.
Nope.
No.

203
00:11:30.631 --> 00:11:33.840
I eat beef and salt and water.
That's it.

204
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:38.370
And I never cheat ever.
Not even a little bit.
No,
not soda.

205
00:11:38.371 --> 00:11:42.930
No wine.
I drink club soda.
Well,
that's done.
It's still water.

206
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:47.400
Well,
you know,
when you're down to that level though,
it's not Joe.
There's,

207
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.580
there's this club soda,
which is really bubbly.
There's Perrier,

208
00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:53.910
which is sort of bubbly.
There's flatwater and there's hot water.
So

209
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:58.520
<v 0>those distinctions start to becoming blind.
It's crazy.
Well,</v>

210
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.480
we ate last night and I ate what you ate.
Uh,
just,
uh,

211
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.670
we both had that giant Tomahawk.
Yup.
I had wine though.
Yeah.
Um,

212
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.420
I'm curious about this.
I'm very curious and I think I might try it,

213
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.810
but I eat a lot of vegetables,
but I don't have any problems like health.

214
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.900
<v 1>Hey Man.
Like I'm not a disclaimer.
Number two,</v>

215
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:23.640
I am not recommending this to anyone.
However,
I have had,
however,

216
00:12:23.641 --> 00:12:28.080
I have had many,
many people come up to me on the tour and say,
look,

217
00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:31.980
I've been following your daughter's blog and I've lost like a hundred pounds.

218
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.950
I think what?
You lost a hundred pounds.
See,

219
00:12:34.951 --> 00:12:37.350
I lost a hundred pounds in six months.
I talked to a woman yesterday.

220
00:12:37.351 --> 00:12:41.460
She lost 15 pounds in one month.
She was 70.
It's like this is,

221
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.350
here's a question.
Why is everyone fat and stupid?

222
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.110
That's a question,
man.
Because it's new.
Is it?
Something's wrong.

223
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:52.741
Yes it is.

224
00:12:52.741 --> 00:12:57.480
It's new and it's not sedentary lifestyle that that hypothesis doesn't seem to

225
00:12:57.481 --> 00:13:00.930
hold water.
There's something wrong with the way we're eating.
And the,

226
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.260
what's wrong is that we're eating way too many carbohydrates,
I think,

227
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.360
<v 0>but no x eight shift.</v>

228
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.770
The elimination of most carbohydrates has made a big shift in my life.

229
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.800
And I do cheat occasionally with bread and occasionally with Pasta I will,

230
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.170
I will go off with ice cream and things along those lines.

231
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.520
But most of the time I'm just eating meat,

232
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:27.030
vegetables most of the time.
And then I'll have a cheat day,
like,
you know,

233
00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.400
once a week or something like that.
Especially if I go to dinner,

234
00:13:29.401 --> 00:13:32.910
I'll have a little pasta and it doesn't seem to mess me up too bad,

235
00:13:32.911 --> 00:13:37.530
but I do feel shitty after I do it.
It's like for simple mouth pleasure,

236
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.980
I'm allowing myself to feel tired afterwards.

237
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.510
<v 1>Yeah,
that's a big one,
man.
Yeah,
but like I,
yeah,
like,</v>

238
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.540
well really I can go on about six hours to sleep now and it's so interesting
too.

239
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.690
Like I can't believe I can wake up in the morning.
I've,

240
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:55.150
that's never happened to me in my whole life.
And when I was a kid,

241
00:13:55.151 --> 00:13:59.800
1312 I'd a bitch of a time waking up in the morning.
It was just brutal.

242
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.630
I just thought that's how it was.

243
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.600
<v 0>This is what I mean.
Again,
I'm not a nutritionist either.</v>

244
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.860
But what's fascinating to me is I haven't heard any negative stories about

245
00:14:08.861 --> 00:14:09.700
people doing this.

246
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.530
<v 1>Well,
I have a negative story.
Okay.</v>

247
00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:17.860
One of the things that both mckayla and I noticed was that when we restricted

248
00:14:18.171 --> 00:14:20.870
our diet and then ate something,
we weren't supposed to,

249
00:14:20.871 --> 00:14:24.950
the reaction to eating what we weren't supposed to was absolutely catastrophic.

250
00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.840
Would it show,
what did you switch to or what'd you eat rather?
Um,

251
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.240
well the worst response I think we're allergic to or allergic,

252
00:14:32.241 --> 00:14:33.140
whatever the hell this is.

253
00:14:33.141 --> 00:14:37.370
Having an inflammation inflammatory response to something called sulfites and we

254
00:14:37.371 --> 00:14:41.120
had some apple cider that had sulfites in it and that was really not good.

255
00:14:41.121 --> 00:14:44.480
Like I was done for a month.
That was the first time I talked to Sam Harris.

256
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:48.050
You were done for a month.
Oh yeah.
It took me out for a month.
It was awful.

257
00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:49.043
Really?

258
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.980
<v 0>So,
and what,
so this is right before whole</v>

259
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.380
<v 1>truth conversation with Sam Harris had got stuck in the mud during,</v>

260
00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.120
I think the day I talked to Sam was like the worst day of my life.

261
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:03.880
Not because of talking to Sam,
but it was just physical.
Oh Jesus,
I was so dead,

262
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:08.060
but I didn't want to not do it because cider,
like what was his all fights in it?

263
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.100
What was it doing to you?
Oh,
it,
it,

264
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:15.130
it produced an overwhelming sense of impending doom and I seriously mean

265
00:15:15.751 --> 00:15:16.380
overwhelming,

266
00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.170
like there's no way I could have lived like that if that would have lasted for,

267
00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:20.241
see,

268
00:15:20.241 --> 00:15:23.310
mckayla knew by that point that it would probably only last a month and I was

269
00:15:23.311 --> 00:15:28.311
like a month for month fucking cider or I didn't sleep that that month.

270
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.470
I didn't sleep for 25 days.
I didn't sleep at all.

271
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.260
I didn't sleep at all for 25 days.
How is that possible?

272
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.970
[inaudible] I'll tell you how it's possible.

273
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:40.970
You lay in bed frozen in something approximating terror for eight hours and then

274
00:15:41.491 --> 00:15:46.000
you get up.
Oh my God.
Oh yeah.
And not some fucking cider from sites.

275
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.260
What we thought.
Yeah.
I mean,
look again,

276
00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.790
I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Okay.
This is all a mystery to me.

277
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.720
The fact that my daughter was so sick.
See the one thing that I did know,

278
00:15:57.721 --> 00:16:00.420
because I scoured the literature on arthritis when she was a kid,

279
00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:04.530
the scientific literature and cause we are interested in the dietary connection

280
00:16:04.531 --> 00:16:07.800
and the only thing I could find that was reliable was that if people with

281
00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:11.340
arthritis fasted,
their symptoms reliably went away.

282
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.470
And that's actually well documented finding.

283
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.830
But then if they started to eat again and there were symptoms came back and I

284
00:16:17.831 --> 00:16:21.340
thought,
well what the hell does it not matter what they eat?

285
00:16:21.341 --> 00:16:25.530
They can't be reactive to everything.
It's like no,

286
00:16:25.531 --> 00:16:28.320
but they can be reactive to all,
most everything.

287
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.780
And the difference between everything in almost everything.

288
00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:34.500
That's a big difference.
And so mckayla seems to be,
maybe me too.

289
00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:38.610
And Tammy's on the same diet because she has autoimmune problems on her side of

290
00:16:38.611 --> 00:16:42.360
the family.
And so mckayla seemed to inherit all of them.
Your skin looks better.

291
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:47.370
Oh Jesus.
Joe,
I'm way better here.
Yeah,
yeah,
you,
you,
you look like more vibrant.

292
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.070
It's very strange.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.

293
00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.350
<v 0>Well,
my point is that you're saying that there is a,</v>

294
00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.460
there is problems with his die,

295
00:16:56.461 --> 00:16:59.160
but that doesn't seem to be a problem with the dyed seems a problem with

296
00:16:59.161 --> 00:17:01.470
deviating from the Diet that your body becomes accustomed.

297
00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.870
<v 1>Well,
one of the hypothesis that we've been pursuing,</v>

298
00:17:04.871 --> 00:17:07.600
and there's some justification for this in the scientific literature,

299
00:17:07.601 --> 00:17:12.130
is that the reason that you lay on layers of fat because the fat acts as a

300
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:14.950
buffer between you and the toxic things that you're eating.

301
00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.780
Because fat is actually an organ.

302
00:17:16.781 --> 00:17:20.620
It has functions other than merely the storage of,
of,
of calories.

303
00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.410
And maybe when you strip out that protective layer,

304
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.020
then you're more sensitive to what you shouldn't be eating.

305
00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.720
This is all speculative hypothesis,
right?

306
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.650
Or maybe you sensitize yourself by removing it from your constant diet.

307
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.580
I don't bloody well,
well,

308
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.121
<v 0>no.
Well,</v>

309
00:17:34.121 --> 00:17:37.060
I would think it would be much more likely that because you think about people

310
00:17:37.061 --> 00:17:39.850
who are alcoholics,
they develop a tolerance to alcohol.

311
00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:43.540
You get off of that and then you have a drink and your tolerances are shot and

312
00:17:43.541 --> 00:17:46.900
then you immediately have a,
an adverse reaction to the alcohol.

313
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.220
Same thing with marijuana.
When people do it all the time,

314
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.290
<v 1>you,
your body becomes tolerant.
Well,
I think,</v>

315
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:57.210
I think that the layering of fat on might be part of the tolerance mechanism.

316
00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.330
So it's not merely a matter of caloric intake,

317
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:03.090
it's a matter of of toxic caloric intake,

318
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.170
buffered by whatever it is that fat is doing as a Neuroendocrin Oregon.

319
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.580
But again,
like I said,
I said,
I'm out of my depth here,
but you know,
the whole,

320
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.560
everyone's out of their depth that God damn food pyramid was made by the

321
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.700
Department of Agriculture,
not the Department of Health.

322
00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:21.040
It wasn't predicated on any scientific studies whatsoever.
We shouldn't,

323
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.090
we shouldn't be eating massive quantities of corn syrup.
We eat,

324
00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.520
we eat way too many carbohydrates.

325
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.690
W MCKAYLA posted a paper the other day,
a doctor,

326
00:18:30.691 --> 00:18:34.920
a successfully treated type one diabetes with a carnivore diet type one,

327
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:40.440
not type two.
So that's bloody impressive.
Yeah,
it's,

328
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.130
it's very curious to me because what you're talking about,

329
00:18:44.131 --> 00:18:47.480
the one adverse reaction,
which is when you deviated from the Diet.
Yeah,

330
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:52.230
but I'm talking about is when I read people's accounts of trying this diet,

331
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.400
it's almost universally positive.
But again,
well,

332
00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.790
it's probably anecdote,
right?
I mean,
I'm not sure,

333
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:03.120
and it's the same with all these stories that I'm collecting as I'm touring and

334
00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.180
you know,
people,
lots of people have come up to me and said,
look,

335
00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:09.240
I lost 45 pounds in the last three months I think.

336
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:13.780
I think Wa it's shocking to me.
I think,
well,
do what you make of that and say,

337
00:19:13.781 --> 00:19:17.820
well,
I can't believe it.
Well,
who can all,
I couldn't believe it.
50 pounds.

338
00:19:17.821 --> 00:19:21.030
It's like,
first of all,
I didn't know I had 50 pounds to lose.
You know,

339
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.660
I thought it was maybe 20 pounds heavier than I should have been.

340
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:25.470
Should have been [inaudible] 85 something like that.

341
00:19:25.471 --> 00:19:30.120
I guess that's 25 to 30 pounds.
That was the maximum thought.
No,
no.

342
00:19:30.121 --> 00:19:33.630
I lost,
I met one 62 and I was at two 12 so what's that?

343
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:38.840
50 50 balance has a lot of weight.
Jesus,
I threw,

344
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:43.650
I draw all my clothes away.
I can't believe it.
When I saw you last night,

345
00:19:43.651 --> 00:19:48.540
I was like,
you're so slim.
Like you're,
your stomach is completely flat and,

346
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.160
and this is not a lean mean fighting machine man.
And you're not a,

347
00:19:52.161 --> 00:19:55.800
a an exercise fanatic.
It's not like you're starving yourself.

348
00:19:55.801 --> 00:19:57.580
It's not like you're going,
I'm not having fun.

349
00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:01.200
That's another thing I should say to people.
If you want to try a diet like this,

350
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:05.790
you eat enough meat and fat so you are not hungry.
Okay.
You can't get hungry.

351
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.430
You're not eating enough.
If you're hungry,
if you're hungry,

352
00:20:08.431 --> 00:20:10.980
you're going to cheat and it's going to drive you stark raving mad.

353
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.040
The other thing that was really cool is like,
I really liked sweets.

354
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:17.190
Like I've kind of lived on peanut butter sandwiches and chocolate milk.
Not,

355
00:20:17.191 --> 00:20:20.070
not really,
but that was my goal to food,
you know,

356
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.850
both of which were terrible for me.
Um,
but,
um,

357
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.640
after I stopped eating carbohydrates for a month,

358
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.640
the carbohydrate cravings went away.
You know,

359
00:20:29.641 --> 00:20:30.900
last night when we were out for dinner,

360
00:20:30.901 --> 00:20:34.700
somebody ordered bread pudding and I bloody love bread pudding with Carolyn and,

361
00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:37.710
and ice cream.
And so it was sitting there and I could smell it and I,
you know,

362
00:20:37.711 --> 00:20:42.711
I thought I could go all fantastic Mr. Fox on that bread pudding and just tear

363
00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:45.510
it down in about 15 seconds.
But it wasn't,

364
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.270
it wasn't as intense as a craving for a cigarette.
If you're an ex ex smoker,

365
00:20:49.271 --> 00:20:50.890
it was like pod be really nice to eat that.

366
00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:55.510
But like my appetite declined by about 75% and that's been permanent.

367
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.090
That's been so there's a perverse thing for you.

368
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.750
I eat way less and now I'm not as hungry.
Okay.

369
00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.810
Well how does that make sense?
Well you're not eating way less.

370
00:21:04.811 --> 00:21:09.190
You eating way less thing.
Cause you had a 30 ounce steak last night.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm,

371
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.740
I'm,
I'm doing my best not to be hungry,

372
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.590
although it didn't look like it was 30 no,
no,
no,
no.

373
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.940
This is a small 30 out of state.

374
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.750
Well I think it starts out 30 ounces before they cook.
It loses a considerable,

375
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:23.180
right.
Very Fatty.
Right.
But that's the other thing to you.

376
00:21:23.181 --> 00:21:26.150
You must have to get a lot of fat.
Yeah.

377
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.460
Well I eat fatty cuts of steak and mckayla is buying fat directly from the

378
00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.960
butcher store and we cook that up,

379
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:35.240
cut it into small pieces and fried up until it's crispy.
Wow.

380
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:39.370
It's actually quite delicious.
It's not bread pudding with ice cream,

381
00:21:39.371 --> 00:21:44.140
but it's a funny,
you mean Daniel?
It's so ridiculous.
I want your blood profile.

382
00:21:44.141 --> 00:21:47.470
I want to find out what's going on with you because one of the big myths,

383
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.460
misconceptions when it comes to cholesterol and saturated fat and food is that

384
00:21:51.461 --> 00:21:55.840
if you eat dietary cholesterol,
that it affects your blood cholesterol levels.

385
00:21:55.841 --> 00:21:59.160
It's not.
It's super common misconception.
Well,
those,

386
00:21:59.161 --> 00:22:02.440
so the thing about clinical studies with diet are virtually impossible to

387
00:22:02.441 --> 00:22:04.060
conduct because you just can't,

388
00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:09.070
you can't conduct a proper randomly distributed controlled experiment.

389
00:22:09.071 --> 00:22:09.671
It's too hard.

390
00:22:09.671 --> 00:22:13.090
So a lot of what we're trying to do is pull out information from correlations,

391
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:14.710
right?
He can't do it,

392
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:19.660
which is one of the real problems with correlating meet with cancer and
diabetes.

393
00:22:19.661 --> 00:22:22.510
And all these different diseases is because people are eating a bunch of shit

394
00:22:22.511 --> 00:22:25.430
with that.
Oh yeah.
And they have different lifestyle profile.

395
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:29.620
There's just endless numbers of confounding variables and you only need one

396
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.080
confounding variable that's,
that's relevant to screw up the study.
Right?

397
00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.890
You can't get that information with correlational studies.

398
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.170
We tried because it's impossible to do the studies,

399
00:22:38.171 --> 00:22:40.750
but how many people were incredulous?
We win.

400
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:45.760
How many people when they're hearing about this?
Oh everybody,
everybody,

401
00:22:45.761 --> 00:22:47.980
well you are not,
but you know,
you're interested in this sort of thing.

402
00:22:47.981 --> 00:22:51.370
But they should be incredulous.
Like when people make absurd claims,
it's like,
oh,

403
00:22:51.371 --> 00:22:54.430
well I had 50 health problems and I stopped eating everything but meat.

404
00:22:54.431 --> 00:22:59.140
And they went away.
It's like,
oh sure.
It's like,
yeah,
well it wasn't you dying.

405
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:03.790
So,
and I see the results and I know it's an anecdote.

406
00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.060
I bloody will understand that.
And I'm highly skeptical about all of this,

407
00:23:07.061 --> 00:23:08.230
but I'm telling you.

408
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.540
So that's why I'm telling you what happened to me and what happened to my

409
00:23:10.541 --> 00:23:12.850
daughter.
And also what happened to my wife,
because she's,

410
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.800
Tammy was always in good shape and she's exercised a lot and she reduced to the,

411
00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.070
to the,
uh,
pure carnivore died about a month ago.

412
00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:24.640
She lost like 12 pounds and she was already slim.

413
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.810
She's back to the same way she was when she was 21.
She's,

414
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:33.130
she's like 58,
you know,
and she doesn't look 58.

415
00:23:33.131 --> 00:23:36.550
I can tell you that.
So it's really fascinating.

416
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.230
It's really fascinating because I just,
I

417
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:43.390
as a person who studied diet for many years,

418
00:23:43.391 --> 00:23:45.980
I would assume that you need fido nutrients,

419
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.350
<v 0>I would assume.
Do you need vi vitamin supplement?</v>

420
00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.540
<v 1>Like vitamin C for example?
It turns out if you don't eat carbohydrates,</v>

421
00:23:51.541 --> 00:23:55.590
you don't need vitamin C.
Huh?
Who would have guessed that was at work?
I don't,

422
00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:58.200
I don't remember mckayla outline to paper.
For me,

423
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:03.330
vitamin C is necessary for carbohydrate metabolism,
but if you don't,
if again,

424
00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:08.340
remember everyone listening,
I am not an expert in this field.
Right.
So,
um,

425
00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:09.360
but,
but

426
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:14.100
<v 0>I want you to get your blood test it because I think,
yeah,
if be pretty funny.</v>

427
00:24:14.101 --> 00:24:16.470
If it was in good shape it would be,

428
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.620
and I'd like to find out what your nutrient levels are and where they're coming

429
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.370
from.
I mean,
what,
what,
how much nutrients are you getting?

430
00:24:22.371 --> 00:24:24.540
Getting a little cramping in my toes from time to time.

431
00:24:24.541 --> 00:24:28.410
So I'm not sure about potassium or magnesium.
That's a possibility.

432
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:34.080
Supplement.
It's very easy,
which is why I'm concerned about,
and also minerals,

433
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:34.710
you know,

434
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:37.920
in certain minerals you're getting from vegetables that you're probably not

435
00:24:37.921 --> 00:24:38.660
getting.

436
00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.680
<v 1>Yup.
Well this is all like,
look,
it seems that hard</v>

437
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.490
<v 0>supplement that stuff though.
Colloidal minerals,
you know,</v>

438
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:48.030
there's some mineral pills you can take plenty of.
Well there are people,

439
00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.280
there are people who basically lived on meat.

440
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:51.760
<v 1>Do you know the,
anyway,</v>

441
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.000
did the Messai basically dead and there there's some supplementation,

442
00:24:55.001 --> 00:24:58.820
but not a lot.
Yeah.
And apparently if you do a carnivore diet,

443
00:24:58.821 --> 00:25:01.940
you're supposed to eat more organ meat.
And I do some of that,
but not a lot.

444
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:06.180
But I can tell you like I'm right,
I'm in.
Well look,

445
00:25:06.181 --> 00:25:09.170
I wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't producing positive results.
It's like,

446
00:25:09.171 --> 00:25:13.620
it's not like it's fun.
I mean for awhile.
Well it makes you a social pariah.

447
00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:17.610
It's like let's invite the Peterson's over.
Oh yeah,
they don't eat anything.
Oh,

448
00:25:17.611 --> 00:25:20.670
we have other friends that's like,
well that's how it works.

449
00:25:20.671 --> 00:25:24.180
It's not malevolence right.
It's just if you're a pain,
no one invites you out.

450
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.820
So I'm a social pain in an ideological pain and now I'm a nutritional paints.

451
00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:32.700
Like I know friends.
How difficult is it when you're trying to get breakfast?

452
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.320
Like what do you do when you oil?
Lots of times when we were traveling,
we cook,

453
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.420
so we usually stay in places where you can cook,

454
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:45.220
but most places you can get a steak and so that's mostly what we do.

455
00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.500
I've been traveling in a motor home and so we've been cooking in the motor home

456
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:53.390
and so I carry beef jerky with me,
which we make.
Yup.

457
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:54.733
It's crazy.

458
00:25:55.250 --> 00:26:00.070
You make your own beef Jerky dehydrator and you just basically put salt on it

459
00:26:00.071 --> 00:26:02.600
and thrown the dehydrator.
So that works pretty well.

460
00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:06.860
You anticipate continuing this?
Well,

461
00:26:06.861 --> 00:26:10.850
I ever cod forever is a long time.
I'd like to be able to eat more things,

462
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.810
but I'm going to experiment with that very,
very,
very,
very,
very cautiously.

463
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.920
I'm going to add mushrooms next because maybe I could eat them.
Well,

464
00:26:18.921 --> 00:26:20.870
this is why I'm asking.
There's

465
00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.200
<v 0>positive benefits that a lot of people achieve.
Um,</v>

466
00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:28.380
and and experience when they switched to a Vegan Diet.
Right?
What things it is,

467
00:26:28.381 --> 00:26:33.381
is you get off of the standard American diet with lots of refined sugars and a

468
00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.780
lot of preservatives in bullshit and then you find positive benefits.

469
00:26:39.031 --> 00:26:41.040
Chris Kresser has gone into depth about this,

470
00:26:41.041 --> 00:26:44.520
but then over time to nutritional deficiencies

471
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.780
<v 1>in that start to wear on your health.
Yeah,</v>

472
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.160
and I'm wondering whether or not you're going to experience,

473
00:26:51.161 --> 00:26:54.510
it's certainly possible while it certainly,
eventually this diet will kill me.

474
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:59.160
No life will,
well,
you're right.
Biology will,

475
00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:04.220
unless science intervenes.
Might be that for some people have of a Vegan diet is,

476
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:08.130
or Vegan Diet.
Is it preferable to a standard American Diet?

477
00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:10.860
So for sure,
to a standard American diet,

478
00:27:10.861 --> 00:27:14.060
but also there's so much biological variability.
Yeah.
You know,

479
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:17.330
the things that bothers some people don't bother other people at all.
And that's,

480
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:20.310
that's something that we got to take into consideration.
Yeah.

481
00:27:20.311 --> 00:27:23.820
Well that's why I didn't want to universalize from my experience,
you know,
but,

482
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.940
but this is what's happened to me and this is what's happened to my wife and my

483
00:27:26.941 --> 00:27:31.320
daughter.
So,
and all of it's been,
well with mckayla lights,
it's miraculous.

484
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.200
I cannot believe it.
The last time I saw it made me cry.

485
00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:38.720
I've never seen her look like that.
She looks so good.
She's so healthy and over.

486
00:27:38.721 --> 00:27:40.830
Other joints are not experiencing any problems.

487
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:45.570
And she's taking no immunomodulators at all.
No medication,
none.

488
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.730
And she was on him for Jesus.
Yes.

489
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.360
More medication than you can shake a stick at methotrexate,
which is basically a,

490
00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.870
they use it to treat cancer.
It's,
uh,
it's,
uh,
what,
what is,

491
00:27:54.871 --> 00:27:57.480
what's the cancer treating drugs called?
Whatever.

492
00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:02.070
I don't remember at the moment she was on Enbrel,
which really,
really helped,
but,

493
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.880
but later open to bacterial infection.
So she always had pneumonia in the fall.

494
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:09.000
Um,
but enbril really helped.
Um,

495
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.670
and then heavy doses of antidepressants and Ritalin and Jesus.
It was,

496
00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:18.540
how long has she been on this carnivore diet?
Oh God,
she's only been eating meat.

497
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:23.400
It's gotta be least six to eight months now.
Wow.

498
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:27.150
And does she get blood work done?
Uh,
Yep.
And her blood work.

499
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:32.080
I won't comment on that.
I don't know the details of her blood work.
Um,

500
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.760
so I don't know if I answered that.
It's fascinating.
I'm curious.
I'm,
I'm,

501
00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.220
I'm considering trying it for awhile.
The problem is I,

502
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.800
I eat so much game meat and there's not a lot of fat.
Get some fat.

503
00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:47.430
That's the trick there.
Tried for a month,
see what happens.
You,
what the hell?

504
00:28:47.431 --> 00:28:52.170
A month,
you know,
just a month.
Yeah.
Now months.
Not Hard.
Yeah.

505
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:53.790
Interesting.
