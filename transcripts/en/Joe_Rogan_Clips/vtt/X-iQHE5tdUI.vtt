00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.350
What should someone do?
Um,
if they have a hard time sleeping,

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.340
like say if you're a person who has insomnia,
you have a hard time getting,

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.180
getting to bed,
you have a hard time staying asleep when you wake up,

4
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:14.730
you can't go back to bed.
There are there strategies?

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.561
<v 1>There are.</v>

6
00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:19.550
I mean I think for most people there are five things that you can do just out

7
00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:20.810
the gate to get better.

8
00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:24.140
Sleep regularity is probably the most important thing I can tell you.

9
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.690
Go to bed at the same time,
wake up at the same time,

10
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.100
no matter whether it's the weekend.
Weekday regularity is key.

11
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.960
We spoken about light,
for example,
when you in the last hour before bed,

12
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.590
tried to stay away from screens but also just switch off half the lights in the

13
00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:43.580
house.
You'd be surprised at how supper ethic that is.

14
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.090
It really starts to sort of make you feel a bit more drowsy.

15
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.020
They done some great studies where they would take people out into the Rockies,

16
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.260
no electric light,
no electricity whatsoever,

17
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.390
and they started to go to bed two hours earlier than the acclaimed natural

18
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.930
bedtime.
It wasn't just because they didn't have anything necessarily to do,

19
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.890
it was that their Melatonin was rising,
you know,
two hours earlier.

20
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.390
So keep it dark.
The third is probably keep it cool.

21
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.920
Your brain actually needs to drop its temperature by about two to three degrees

22
00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:17.600
Fahrenheit to initiate sleep.

23
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.070
And that's the reason that you will always find it easier to fall asleep in a

24
00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:26.840
room that's too cold than too hot.
I've seen people use cold pads.

25
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.320
Yes.
He knows he sleep on these cold pads.
What do you think of those?
Yeah,

26
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.040
I mean the evidence is pretty good that cooling the body actually works.

27
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:35.450
They've um,
you know,

28
00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:39.730
in the book I write about a series of studies where they had people in it,

29
00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:41.060
it's almost like a wet suit,

30
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.920
but it has all of these veins running through it and they could actually

31
00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:50.570
perfumers warm or cold water into any part of the body,

32
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:52.940
hands,
core of the body,
feet.

33
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.100
And so that you could exquisitely manipulate the temperature of any part of the

34
00:01:58.101 --> 00:01:58.934
body.

35
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.860
And what they found is that they could effectively cool the body down and it

36
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.980
instantaneously made people fall asleep faster and it gave them deeper,

37
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.260
deep,
non rem sleep,
that sort of restorative sleep for the body.

38
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.160
So you can even look at studies where people sleep semi naked and that also

39
00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:22.370
seems to improve their sleep and they get a little bit more deep sleep too.

40
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.010
So cold is better.

41
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.740
The paradox here though is that you need to warm your feet and your hands to

42
00:02:30.741 --> 00:02:35.741
kind of charm the blurred away from your core out to the surface and radiate

43
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:39.690
that heat.
So you should go to sleep with socks and gloves on.
Yeah.

44
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.410
Or better still have a hot bath.
Um,
evidence here to um,

45
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.200
that I discussed where people say,
you know,
I get out of a hot bath,

46
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.290
I feel nice and toasty and relaxed and that's why I fall asleep.

47
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.810
It's the opposite.
When you get into a bath,

48
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.490
you get vasodilation all,
you sort of get rosy cheeks,
red skin,

49
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.850
all of the blood rushes to the surface.

50
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:05.851
You get out of the bath and you have this massive thermal dump of heat that just

51
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:10.030
evacuated from the body,
your core body temperature plummets.

52
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.770
And that's why you sleep better.
So you can hack the system very easily.
Wow.

53
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.540
So your core body temperature plummets and that's what makes you sleep easier.

54
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.490
Yeah,
that sounds so counter intuitive,

55
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.770
but it makes sense and it makes sense it because that's how we were designed.

56
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:30.160
If you look at hunter gatherer tribes whose way of life has not changed for

57
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:32.440
thousands of years,
and you ask how do they sleep?

58
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.130
One of the things that seems to dictate the sleep is the rise and fall of

59
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:42.940
temperature.
Yeah.
Temperature is at it's lowest in the d Nydia of the night,

60
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:46.030
you know,
three or four in the morning.
And as that temperature,

61
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:47.920
that climate temperature starts to drop,

62
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.390
that's when they start to get drowsy as if temperature is just sort of signaling

63
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:56.910
to the brain.
Now it's time to sleep.
So light as well as temperature,

64
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.910
a two key triggers to help you get better sleep.
Um,

65
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.490
if you look at those tribes by the way,

66
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.340
and when they go to sleep and they wake up,
um,
you know,

67
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:09.070
they go to sleep probably about two hours after dusk,

68
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.720
sort of eight to nine in the evening,

69
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:14.110
wake up about half an hour or even an hour before dawn.

70
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.940
It's the rise in temperature rather than light that triggers their awakening.
Um,

71
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.160
but there's a reason,
you know,

72
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.060
have you ever thought about what the term midnight actually means?

73
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.130
Middle of the night.
And that's what it should be for all of us.

74
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.960
But in modernity,

75
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:36.310
we've been dislocated from our natural rhythms and now midnight has become the

76
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:39.070
time when we think I should check Facebook last time.
You know,

77
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:43.780
I should send my last email.
Yeah,
that wasn't,
that is not how we were,

78
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.910
you know,
designed to sleep.
And in fact,

79
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:48.970
we may also be designed to sleep by physically too.

80
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:50.470
If you look at those hunter gatherers,

81
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.590
they don't sleep one long bout of eight hours at night.

82
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.850
I've heard this recently that people that you should have two sleeps,

83
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.130
the idea of two sleeps.
Yeah.

84
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:02.440
It's actually a little different than the idea of to sleep,

85
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:07.441
so there was a time in sort of the Dickensian era where people would sleep for

86
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:10.990
the first half of the night,
may be sort of four hours or so.

87
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.590
Then they would wake up,
they would socialize,
they would eat,

88
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.980
they would make love,
and then they would go back and have a second sleep.

89
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.660
If you look at natural biological rhythms in the brain and the body,

90
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.090
that doesn't really seem to be how we were designed.

91
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.690
It certainly seems to be something that we did in society,

92
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.900
but I think it's more of a societal trend than it was a biological edict.

93
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.640
However,
we do seem to have to sleep periods the way that we were designed.

94
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.150
Those tribes will often sleep about six and a half hours,

95
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:46.480
seven hours of sleep at night and then especially in the summer they'll have

96
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:51.481
that Siesta like behavior in the afternoon and all of us have that sort of this

97
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:57.121
what's called the Post Prandial dip in alertness just means after lunch and if I

98
00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:00.140
measure your brain wave activity with electrodes,

99
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.440
I can see a drop in your physiological alertness somewhere between two to 4:00

100
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.950
PM in the afternoon.
But is that dependent on diet?
It's not.
People think it is,

101
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:12.050
you know,
especially after they've had a heavy lunch,

102
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.060
you can actually just have people fast instead of well fasting for long periods

103
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:18.680
of time actually makes your sleep much worse.

104
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.790
But you can have people abstain from lunch and you still get that drop.

105
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:25.910
So it's independent of food.
It's a genetically hardwired,

106
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:30.170
preprogrammed drop that suggests we should be sleeping by physically but does is

107
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:32.900
that dependent upon their standard diet because if,

108
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.470
if someone is on a carbohydrate,
carbohydrate rich diet,

109
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.610
a lot of times you do get that spike and then you crash,
crash.
What?

110
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:45.000
When people are on low carb and high fat diets,
they don't get that and they,

111
00:06:45.001 --> 00:06:48.530
they,
they tend to be more,
even with their energy through the day.
Yeah.
So yeah,

112
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:51.500
that sort of more constant release of energy can actually help you sort of

113
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:55.340
almost combat that low.
But the low exists no matter what exactly.

114
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:58.460
So even if you don't think it exists,
it's there.
It's still present.
Interesting.

115
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.240
So why did they do that and then the,
the dickens error,
why did they,

116
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.490
what is there a root cause of their double sleep thing?
We don't know.

117
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.170
I mean,
it's hard to sort of really go back knitting.
Yeah.

118
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.890
That was a trend that it was a movement did,

119
00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.650
they would just wake up and do things and yeah,

120
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.000
maybe it's because they didn't have TV,

121
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.190
they didn't know what to do with themselves.

122
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.440
It sounds like they did some pretty interesting things,
which are nice.
But yeah.
