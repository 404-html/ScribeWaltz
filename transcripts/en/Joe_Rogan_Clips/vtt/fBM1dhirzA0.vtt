1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.260
I got introduced to mushrooms.
Oh by outkast,

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.300
Dj swiff and that was a beautiful experience.

3
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:10.830
I introduced my wife to him because of that.
Yeah,
I can definitely see that.
Yeah.

4
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:14.180
There's something to them.
Yeah,
for sure.
There is me and l dude,

5
00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:17.950
me and now enjoy mushrooms while we make music.
Do you really?
Yeah.
Mushrooms,

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.760
wheat and whiskey and drink whiskey,

7
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:24.510
drink some Tequila or what do you call the others?
Tequila and mezcal is it?
Yeah.

8
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.340
Yeah,
he,
he drinks mass cal.
I drink whiskey and shrooms and week.
They usually,

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.160
we had drunk ants in here from yesterday.

10
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.120
Apparently Richard Rawlings brought this cinnamon Tequila and some of it had

11
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:39.450
spilled on the table and the answered found this is the young pop up everywhere.

12
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:42.480
Brushing them along.
Yeah.
They were everywhere.
They were drunk.

13
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.300
They were just drinking Tequila and it was just old giant line of,
I'm like,

14
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:48.660
they found the fucking bar in the middle of space and got added.
Yeah,

15
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:51.660
they found it and when we got here it was covered with the ants,
shrunk aunts.

16
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.150
My wife made me hang out at a bar all night last night with her and her friend.

17
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.430
They got shit faced drunk,
threw up in an Uber.

18
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.890
He's running through the hallway in their underwear back at the hotel.

19
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.860
That sounds like good night.
Yeah.
Growing up in the Uber,

20
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.760
like how many times does that happen in those poor bastards?
Yeah,
not forever.

21
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:12.090
I tipped the got damn near $100.
I was like,
when,
I'm sorry,

22
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.430
I apologize.
How much puke?
A large amount,
not Jay,

23
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.090
but enough to be aggravated because she had a bag.

24
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.740
So you know,
you think that the bad catches but it wasn't plastic,
you know,

25
00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:29.280
it's uh,
it,
it,
it gave a little leak.
If it's hard to get that smell out,

26
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:33.930
that puke smell,
it's cost about 150 bucks to get it together.
Puke,
smell out.

27
00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:35.850
Really that shit is in your body.

28
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:38.520
Like imagine if you could turn yourself inside out and smell

29
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.280
Pete's first far to the morning,
but puke smell.

30
00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:47.130
There's something and that's why I don't like Yoga.
Hot Yoga rather regular.

31
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:49.830
Y'All got,
I can endure.
What don't you like it?
Because High Yogurt,

32
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.210
no fart the inside of you by like,
like Yo man,
moms,

33
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:58.380
her farting,
you know,
straight up.
You got to hide your,
you ever did hot yoga,

34
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.160
you ever had a hot chick convince you to do that shit was like my wife's side so

35
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:05.250
she could talk me in the most dumb shit.
Right.
So,
oh yeah,

36
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:10.200
we're going to fucking hot yoga.
Yeah.
Hi Mobs,
tits answers.
Yo this shit.

37
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.690
You got to block for me to say and then it's like Ooh,

38
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.120
pitch to too far.
Yeah.
Like I know my wife are,

39
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.730
that's not my wife Fart.
And then you say fuck it.
You start farting.

40
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.830
Oh No,
no.
That shit is,
yeah.
Yeah.
So I don't,

41
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:29.980
I don't fuck with hot yoga.

42
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.990
I would rather just do regular yoga and then just saw none of that shit out.

43
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:36.600
Like you.
Um,
I like hot yoga.

44
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.920
You don't fart and tell the truth.
Okay.

45
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.600
But first thing in the morning,
respect.
No one farts stove.
Oh,

46
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:50.420
people far for sure.
Staple Fart if you go to the early classes.
Okay.
All right.

47
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.220
The pros.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a couple of different places that I go to,

48
00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:58.260
but I like going to the early class.
All right.

49
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.990
Do you get of the same day you hot yoga?
Sometimes.
Most of the time,
no.

50
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.830
Most of the time no double doors.
I have,
if I have an injury,

51
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.430
if I have something that's fucking with me,
but uh,
if I do that,

52
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:12.550
I almost consider it like a sauna because you get so God damn hot.

53
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:14.590
Like the room might only be 104 degrees,

54
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.790
but when you're working out hard doing yoga,
your body is poor and sweat.

55
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.230
You must be heated up as warm as you get in a sauna.

56
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.190
It feels the same way.

57
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.880
To me it feels like almost like I'm trying to work out in the sauna.
Gotcha.

58
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.900
This doing some study now at Harvard about it,

59
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.300
about a heat shock proteins and and hot yoga and you know how much inflammation

60
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.450
it reduces and how beneficial is to you.

61
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.440
I forget what scientists were involved in it,

62
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:43.030
but a bunch of people were talking about it the other day.

63
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.840
I know it definitely gets gas at your ass.
It definitely does.
Well,

64
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:48.510
if you have something that you shouldn't beat,

65
00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:51.220
and like you eat a hot dog with sauerkraut and a coke,

66
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.730
and then two hours later try to go to yoga class,
you're a criminal,

67
00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.230
you're a terrible person,
fucking Mofo.

68
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.440
And there's nowhere for that far to go either.
It's stuck in the hot dog,

69
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.900
and that's the thing is stays there.
That,

70
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.750
but if you get the real earthy chicks,
they burn sage,

71
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.080
and then that starts to suffocate you and you got to leave the real earthy

72
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:15.070
chicks.
Yeah.
