1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.860
How often have you encountered orchids?
I've never seen an Orca.
Really?
No,
no,
no.

2
00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:09.360
I mean not other than sea world's kidnapping of them.
Foxy world.
Yeah,

3
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:13.020
I'm with Ya.
I just don't understand.

4
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.010
I mean I,
I guess I understand cause I was a kid once and I went there,

5
00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:20.280
but I don't understand how a rational,

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.840
logical thinking adult could take their kids to see world after all the

7
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:29.310
information that's out there about,
about their social behaviors,

8
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.180
about how smart these animals are about how got into a lot of people.

9
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:34.750
Unfortunately.
I know.
Yeah,
I know.

10
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.930
I agree with you if you did get the information,

11
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:40.440
but a lot of people just don't know.
They think well they're,
they're fed,

12
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:44.670
they're healthy.
Bowls are nice.
Yeah,
they don't,
yeah.
I got in this battle with a,

13
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.000
and look,
I'm no scientist.
I debate people all the time,

14
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.070
but I'm no scientist obviously.
I just,

15
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.750
I think I have a pretty good heart and I feel bad for animals that are locked up

16
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:58.950
that need to travel a hundred miles a day in their social packs and they need to

17
00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:02.070
have interaction with other animals.
And they need a certain amount of space.

18
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:06.510
I mean,
imagine you think about solitary confinement for a prison.
New Guy,

19
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:08.100
a prisoner who's,
who's in,

20
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.550
who's in a room that's no wider than they are tall and maybe twice as twice as

21
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:17.820
long as they are tall,
you know,
and,
and there's no interaction with other people.

22
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:18.654
They go crazy.

23
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.260
Most people come out of prisons and jails worse than they went in because of

24
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:24.610
this kind of thing that happens to him.

25
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.980
But think of being in there for 30 years,
just wondering,
God,

26
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:32.760
is there another whale and the other side of that wall,
can I get some fish?

27
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.470
Can I mean go nuts?
And you see these videos that the trainer that was killed,

28
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.720
um,
and a trainer,
one trainer,

29
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.780
luckily the guy is a great free diver and he lived through a,

30
00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:44.460
basically an attack by an Orca.

31
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.910
And the thing knew he wanted to get over to that wall and he went,
Nope,

32
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.511
I'm not gonna.

33
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:51.540
I'm gonna play with you and I'm just going to keep pulling you down and pulling

34
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:55.740
you down.
And the guy was good enough free diver to be able to know,
okay,

35
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:58.530
I've got to conserve my energy.
I got to bring my heart rate down.

36
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.740
I'm going to have to have to hold my breath against my will when I don't know

37
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:06.180
what's going to happen.
A friend of mine used to work at marine land in Canada.

38
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.230
My friend Phil,
Phil Demars and he was an orchid trainer and you know,

39
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:12.690
and he's trying to get marine land closed down.

40
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.320
There's this big lawsuit with them and he's been involved in a lawsuit with them

41
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:17.670
for over five years now.

42
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.940
I was just hanging out with him in Toronto and he was a Walrus trainer and this

43
00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:24.990
is Walrus that he was taken care of.

44
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:29.100
It's the only one that's left there that survived and marine land is like slowly

45
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:32.970
going bankrupt.
The guy who was the original owners now quickly go bankrupt.

46
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.340
So it's so dark,
man.
The whole,
the whole business is so dark because you know,

47
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:41.760
a lot of them say,
oh,
we won't take any,
you know,

48
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.740
orcas are dolphins from captivity,

49
00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:48.630
but they'll get them from people that stole them in the wild and they,
they,

50
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:51.480
uh,
breed.
You know,
I think there's no more breeding a lot in America,

51
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.680
but they'll get them from someone that bred them in Canada or Russia rather or

52
00:02:55.681 --> 00:03:00.080
China or where some place where there's not as many rules.
You know,
John Lilly,

53
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.600
who was the guy who actually invented the isolation tank is a,

54
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.050
he was a pioneer and interspecies communication,
which is a,

55
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.810
it's a weird field.
He was a scientist.
That was also,

56
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:15.460
he took like extreme liberties with his scientific research,

57
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:18.130
took a lot of acid,
gave it acid to dolphins,

58
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.780
did a lot of Dolphin Research in the flotation tank,
did a lot of really,

59
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:23.890
really wacky shit.

60
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:28.690
But he believed that one day dolphins were going to have a seat in the United

61
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.691
Nations.

62
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:32.200
He believe we're going to be able to communicate with dolphins and that dolphins

63
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:34.930
were going to be recognized as water people.

64
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.140
He thought they were going to be literally the thought there was smartest human

65
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:41.290
beings.
Amazing.
If we could figure out how to communicate with them,

66
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:46.180
they would have the same rights as human beings.
Yeah,
and guy was a genius.

67
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.750
I mean just he and I,
I agree with them.

68
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:52.270
I think there's just a level of communication.

69
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.690
There's a way that they have of communicating that we don't understand,

70
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:59.860
but it's a super complex.
If their own dialects they have,
they,

71
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.250
they have this crazy social code.
I mean they,

72
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.710
they have something like incredibly dynamic about their,

73
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.720
their environment and their,
their,
their,
their,
you know,
their social groups.

74
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.990
To be,
to be able to speak a language,

75
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.820
you need to know like 150 words.
There was a dolphin that new like 700 words,

76
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.600
300 words,
I don't know,
hundreds like command standard human words.

77
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.010
You know how many dolphin warrants we know zero.
I'll fucking clue.

78
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.150
We have no idea.
We don't know what the fuck they're saying,

79
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:33.460
but they're so goddamn stupid.

80
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.330
Fucking stop giving me macro level.
They're like,
they don't know.

81
00:04:38.331 --> 00:04:40.120
We're making fun of them for hundreds of years.

82
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.280
I don't think they know what to do with them.
Well,

83
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.580
one of the things that Phil was working with was there's a group,

84
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:47.800
what was that group that where they're trying to,

85
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.280
they're going to create a boundary dri out in the ocean and slowly released

86
00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:56.900
these dolphins and orchestras out into this boundary and then you know,

87
00:04:56.901 --> 00:04:57.860
and keep feeding them.

88
00:04:57.861 --> 00:05:01.440
But then lowly released them out to the ocean per open ocean pens.
Yeah.

89
00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:03.510
They're talking about doing that possibly.

90
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.630
And that would be a way for people to actually experience it because it,

91
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.010
the idea is that you and I had a debate with his trainer.

92
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.300
I watched blackfish and it just freaked me out.
And of course it's,

93
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.340
there's probably a lot of confirmation bias.

94
00:05:17.341 --> 00:05:21.240
There's probably some information in there that is not totally unbiased.
Right.

95
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.120
Obviously they're trying to make a point.
But this one was,

96
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.440
she talked to all the different trainers and stuff.
I got in contact,

97
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.440
a guy got in contact with me that was a trainer and he said,
Kelly,

98
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.210
the whole movie is Bs.
Um,
I think,
I believe this guy was actually in the movie.

99
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.410
He's like,
it was all bs.

100
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.660
Orcas live longer in in captivity and indeed they do in the wild.
He told me that

101
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.300
orcas haven't been in captivity as long as they live yet,
so we don't know that.

102
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.440
So that's completely a lie.
It's,
he has no idea if that's true.

103
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.060
He said they're more healthy.

104
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:57.590
He told me all these things and I just finally went,
this guy's just full of I,

105
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.570
I dunno,
I,
I can't buy what he's telling me.
And he,
but he said,
I'm a trainer.

106
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:03.280
I've been a trainer for it.

107
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.650
I looked him up and bias because that's where he makes his living.
Exactly.

108
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:10.160
And I know some dolphin trainers and I actually went to sea world a few times in

109
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:10.830
Australia.

110
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.340
I used to know a few of the trainers back in the late nineties and I went there

111
00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:15.890
a few times when with the dolphins.
The first day I was there,

112
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.960
one of the things I asked him was like,
do they,

113
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.870
will these guys ever get set free and write down?

114
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:23.480
I could feel a little pull back,
you know,
like straight away.
I could feel like,

115
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.990
oh,
maybe.
And I felt that release my slaves.
Yeah.

116
00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:29.720
I felt a little uncomfortable with keep asking questions because it is their

117
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:31.190
livelihood and I had a respect for that.

118
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:35.030
And I know that all these trainers love these animals.
They really,
truly like,

119
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.800
probably love them more than they love the most people.
Um,

120
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.370
but that doesn't make it right.
Right.
