00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.610
The joe rogan experience.
It's just weird man.
It's just,
I'd never,

2
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:09.210
I've never seen us so divided and part of it has to do with Trump for sure.

3
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:14.211
There's like this reaction like that they feel like I'm really obligated to act.

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.970
People feel obligated to act and try to make things change,

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.640
which I think is ultimately good.
All this thing,

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.090
the all of what's going on right now does not concern me nearly as much as it

7
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:25.140
does a lot of other people.
Right.

8
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.920
Cause I feel like people are already reacting to it and already going,

9
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:33.690
what in the fuck you know?
And,
and the ship is already starting to write itself.

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.430
Well the Oscars was the lowest rated I think in the history of the Oscar heard

11
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:43.020
that.
But it's also 26 million people watched.
That's a lot of fucking people.

12
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.610
That's a lot.
Don't Shit on someone who got 26 million people.
I saw that.

13
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.890
They were afraid it,
it'd be people get very kind of like,
wow,

14
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.270
we're getting political here.
And when they looked at the numbers,

15
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:59.160
the numbers where they were comparing it to like 2013 there were down 5 million

16
00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:03.570
from 2013 I think it was.
Guess what wasn't around 2013 Netflix.
True.

17
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.900
There's a lot more shit to watch.
True.
What's it down from last year?

18
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.040
There's definitely people that are bored with Hollywood though.
Like enough.
Well,

19
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:14.280
they Hollywood's over Rachel.
I think Hollywood tends to be,

20
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.400
what bothers me about Hollywood is there virtuous virtue signaling.

21
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.210
Like they're going to set an example.
You fucking guys like you want to be liked.

22
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.120
Okay.
And you're as fickle as it gets.

23
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.480
They were the same people that were standing up and clapping for Roman Polanski.

24
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm sorry man.
Well,
some of them were,

25
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.510
some of them were really saying some ridiculous shit.
I mean like,
come on guys.

26
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.410
It's a long time ago and he's drugged and sodomized.
A 13 year old.

27
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.000
I think he fucked more than one too.
Yeah.
So guess what?

28
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.730
I can't have that guy.
You're not kidding.

29
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.830
They wanted to sign a petition to bring him back in the country.

30
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.250
I can't forgive that no stay in France.

31
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.750
Well they want to bring it back to the country to arrest them and they're really

32
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:58.050
trying hard to do that.
And there's people that resist that.

33
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.280
I think he's an amazing artist and you know,
artists are just different.

34
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:05.610
Be Consistent though,
you know you can system.
That's where I draw the line.

35
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.940
You can't drug kids fucking with the,
I mean Asia Argento who was one of the,

36
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.100
one of the people that came out against Harvey Weinstein,

37
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.620
she had been raped by him apparently.

38
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:16.830
And then she had a sexual relationship for 10 years afterwards,
which by the way,

39
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:17.790
people are like,
God,

40
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.730
I actually forgive that because people go back to the trauma,
right?

41
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.410
They want to relive it on their own terms.
But she signed the petition to for,

42
00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:26.520
for Roman Polanski to,
you know,

43
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.720
to be freed when he was put under arrest and I believe it was Switzerland.

44
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.160
Now that's not consistent.
I'm sorry man.
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:38.630
But if that guy is just as bad as yeah,
you can see the petition online.

46
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.380
What was her perspective?

47
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.070
She was somebody who thought Roman Polanski.

48
00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:48.330
Should not be prosecuted for something that happened a long time ago.

49
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:51.300
She signed that petition.
I would never sign that petition.

50
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.710
So there's a lot of disconnect.

51
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:55.350
So I have a big problem with that sort of disconnect.
That's a problem.

52
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:59.800
I don't know this woman,
I don't know her.
Um,
I believe her.

53
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.300
I believe what she says about Harvey Weinstein.
Uh,
and again,
I,
you know,

54
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:07.090
people are like,
well,
she went back to the scene of the crime.
That's very common,

55
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:12.091
but don't sign a petition and then now be this leading voice in this whole anti

56
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.630
harassment.
It's like,
I think it's very inconsistent.
I think you have to pay,

57
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.950
you have to at least answer to that.

58
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:21.160
Did she comment on once she saw there was a mia culpa there,

59
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:24.370
but it's very inconsistent in it and there's a lot of that out there.

60
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.890
There's a lot of that.
We should make sure that she definitely did that.

61
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.780
You'll see it.
Just see if you can Google the young dreamy will say,

62
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.120
it feels like something that,
you know,
I looked it up.
I actually looked it up.

63
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.630
I wanted to see who had signed that petition and I came across her name and I

64
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:41.320
was like,
Whoa,
that doesn't make any sense to me.
You know,

65
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.950
it just doesn't make any sense man.
I don't get it.

66
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.420
I don't know enough about what happened.

67
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.880
I know that he drugged in and saw the mas,
some younger girl.

68
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.000
She was 13 and her mom dropped her off I believe.
And it was,

69
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:01.450
why was she there?
Yeah,
it was the 70s men.

70
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.630
People would just free relationship every bit of 20 all that shit in here man.

71
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.570
But I believe he knew she was 13 and then he knew he was going to go away to

72
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:14.030
jail and he left the country,
Jesus Christ

73
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.540
and say,
and then apparently there's another woman that he had done that too.

74
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.430
So imagine being on the scene back then.

75
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.980
How weird that must have been like there,

76
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.700
there had been like think about Roman Polanski making movies and like what the

77
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:35.680
1970s right?
Yeah.
I mean God trying to tell.
It's only it.
Only days.
Yeah.
Amazing.

78
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.380
If they'd only been making movies for like a few decades.

79
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.650
It was a real new thing.
She's signed the petition,

80
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:43.500
but I found a tweet she just put,

81
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.360
she put out a couple of months ago where she said she regretted doing it.

82
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.850
Hard to regret it.
The signing the petition years ago,

83
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.110
she said a mistake of implants.
He's a filmmaker whose work I admire greatly,

84
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:56.110
but if I ever see him,
I'll spit in his face if he's lucky.
Yeah,

85
00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:57.640
but you signed the petition.

86
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.420
I already regretted signing the petition years ago already felt it was a
mistake.

87
00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:02.201
No excuses.

88
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:06.340
It was stupid with this indicates a proud in a behavior that if true and I

89
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:10.540
believe it to be true,
is beyond unforgivable.
Well,
I think,
I think you,

90
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:13.340
you got a good point though about you.

91
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.980
She made a mistake and there is something that happens to people that had been

92
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:20.200
violated.
Sometimes they blame themselves.

93
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.100
That's what I say sometimes to forgive that and there could be a little of that

94
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:26.290
in her decision making process too.
I can't,

95
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.820
I could be a little bit of wanting to be in with Hollywood.
You know,

96
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.640
that's not ethically or morally consistent.
No.

97
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.650
And she fucked up and she realized she fucked up.

98
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:39.660
But you're also coming after people now,
you know,
if we're gonna if we're,

99
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.380
we're going to end and a lot of these people you know deserve to become after.

100
00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:46.720
But you know we have to be consistent here.
Right.

101
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:50.170
But isn't she beacons being consistent by just saying that she fucked up,

102
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:51.400
she realized that she fucked out.

103
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:53.650
Well there are a lot of people are saying that once they get caught,

104
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.770
well that petition they type of petition doesn't mean Jack Shit.

105
00:05:56.771 --> 00:06:00.650
They ain't letting them,
he doesn't matter.
He's signed it.
And it was,
I was that,

106
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.290
I don't know anybody that would sign that and it like I would never sign that

107
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:06.290
petition.
That's all I'm trying to say.
Be Consistent if I'm,

108
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.560
so if the guy came to America and got arrested and went through the trial and

109
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:17.730
then got convicted,
how much time would you do?
I don't know.
I don't know.

110
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.030
It's interesting.
It's like,

111
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.150
would it be better karmically to go to jail for what he did come back,

112
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:30.800
go to jail and then no one.
Everyone would always know.

113
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.810
When you got out that you were convicted and you were punished for child

114
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:39.230
molestation,
like you did it and they got you.
Everyone would know.

115
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.880
Whereas now he's living in France and he has to deal with it floating over his

116
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:44.181
head.

117
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:49.181
Everyone who meets me knows that I drugged and raped a kid everywhere I go,

118
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.120
everyone knows I drugged and raped a kid and it just keeps playing out in his

119
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:58.490
head all day long.
Public shaming is powerful shit.
Well,

120
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.560
I mean that's the highest level.
This is drugging and raping a kid.

121
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.340
I'm a forgiving guy.
Can't forgive that one.
I can't like,

122
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:09.530
I'm a forgiving dude,
man.
I can't.

123
00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:12.230
I don't stay mad and I think it's good to be forgiving about things.

124
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.840
There are certain things that to me when you,

125
00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:18.890
and he's a great filmmaker and a great artist for me,
that kind of stuff.

126
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.490
It's very difficult,
man.
I'm just,
it's very difficult.

127
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:25.820
I had an argument with a bunch of older actors about this and they were all

128
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:28.610
saying it was a long time ago.
She looked up,
I mean I was like,

129
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.970
if it was your daughter and she was 13 how would you feel?

130
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.570
You just got to keep going back to that and well especially if you actually have

131
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:37.940
a daughter,
you actually have a daughter that's not,

132
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.890
you're not conceptualizing that your gut,
it actually locked into your brain.

133
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.330
You're actually thinking about your daughter and it becomes a different

134
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.190
completely different thing.
I remember thinking when I was young,
you know?
Yeah,

135
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:51.080
if someone did that to my daughter,
but that was like a,

136
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.830
before I had a kid who was like,
that was just a weird concept.

137
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:59.390
Didn't seem real.
But now you think about this 13 year old girl and you're like,

138
00:07:59.391 --> 00:08:01.580
Whoa,
but what a court would do and what a,

139
00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:06.080
what a trial would do is you might hear something like,

140
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.250
I don't know,
but you might hear,
I don't know.
She said,

141
00:08:10.251 --> 00:08:13.970
she said she was 20 when we talk about drugging,
hold on.

142
00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:17.450
She smoked a little weed that that guy gave her over there.
Let's be careful.

143
00:08:17.451 --> 00:08:18.170
Right.
And then,
yeah,

144
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.910
then you start hearing all the extenuating circumstances and maybe you would go,

145
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.110
you got to do the time,

146
00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:27.740
but at least I get how that happened because you thought it was something

147
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:31.820
different.
Right.
What was your intention?
What did you see?
But we don't know that.

148
00:08:31.821 --> 00:08:35.030
So what happens is we start,
and we're doing this too and I'm doing it.

149
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.860
I don't know.
I don't know all the details of the case.

150
00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:41.720
So all I'm saying is that he drugged and sodomized at 13 year old that everyone

151
00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:45.590
was drugged,
him included.
Well there's this what I'm saying.
So we all have to be,

152
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.600
we all have to be careful and I have to to,
cause I'm,

153
00:08:47.601 --> 00:08:50.150
I'm kind of breaking my own rule here.
I'm,

154
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:55.340
I'm drawing these very strong,
hard and fast,
uh,

155
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.650
like there's no context and what I'm saying,
right.

156
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.640
There's no nuance in what I'm saying.
If there's no context,
right.

157
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.230
And you gotta be careful cause everything has nuance and context in a way.

158
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:08.310
Otherwise,
otherwise,
otherwise you're taking me at just the words I'm saying.

159
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.170
So what I'm seeing from this,
this is like she's upset and you're upset.

160
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.560
Like she's upset,
she signed it and you're upset.
She signed it.
Yeah.

161
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:21.540
But that doesn't mean nearly as much to me.
Like people making a mistake,

162
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:26.160
like her making that mistake doesn't mean much to me.
It's just a mistake.

163
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.610
It doesn't give it,
I'm not going to,
I'm not saying there's no consequences.

164
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:31.920
No one got hurt because that mistake,
you know what I'm saying?

165
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.060
Like it was a mistake.
She fucked up,
but it didn't ultimately hurting anyone.

166
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.800
Like it doesn't,

167
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.550
I don't like the fact that someone would at least temporarily have that thought

168
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:44.790
in their mind.
Like that guy should be free.
Like leave him alone.

169
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.550
What's bygones be bygones?
Actually talking about something different.

170
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:48.420
What are you talking about?

171
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.330
So I'm talking about talking about Hollywood tends to do,

172
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:55.620
I was just using her as an example.
Hollywood tends to do that,
which is popular,

173
00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.840
that which is going to make them liked rather than something that's morally or

174
00:10:00.841 --> 00:10:04.710
ethically consistent shots.
What I mean,
right.
We've talked about this before,

175
00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:08.790
that it all comes down to the whole process of being chosen to do things or the

176
00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:11.190
being chosen to direct or chosen to act or chosen.

177
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.400
Everybody's constantly working to be chosen.

178
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.250
You're all trying to audition for things or trying to angle to get a certain

179
00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:20.550
role.
It's a constant process of like me,
like me,
like me.

180
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:25.230
And these are people that go into this job with his yearning,
desire to be loved.

181
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.380
And then on top of that they're playing this weird political game.
I mean,

182
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.270
acting is all political.
This,

183
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:35.290
I mean it doesn't make any sense that every other occupation except maybe tech

184
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.970
tax.
Probably like mostly mostly liberal,

185
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.230
but Hollywood's almost exclusively liberal.
And if you step out of those lines,

186
00:10:43.231 --> 00:10:45.660
nobody wants to work with you anymore.
Hollywood on the surface is liberal,

187
00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:50.220
but actually nobody who's conservative or whatever will speak out.
Right.

188
00:10:50.221 --> 00:10:53.820
Like Tim Allen lost his show because he's,
because he's conservative.

189
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.120
He's an old white guy.
What he expect.
Yeah.
Oh,
white guys.
Yeah,
that's it.

190
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.280
The golf probably a very real thing nowadays.
Hanging out with Dennis Miller.

191
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.920
Dennis Miller,
same thing.
He went fucking James boats.
James Woods,

192
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.100
Brad James Woods is arguing with people on Twitter.
Like James,

193
00:11:11.101 --> 00:11:13.890
you're seven years.
It's crazy.
I mean,
days you got left.
How many,

194
00:11:13.891 --> 00:11:17.670
how many moments in your life do you really have left?
You have a thousand.

195
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.480
Like what are you going to do?
You're going to waste 400 of them on Twitter.
Yeah.

196
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.220
That's not wise.
That's not a wisely,

197
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:26.610
he said he was blackballed for his conservative views.
Was He really?

198
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:31.380
I don't know.
Yeah,
I don't know.
I don't know man.
I don't need was I,
again,

199
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:37.140
I don't want to be,
um,
I don't know if I'm being helpful.
Right.

200
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.390
So,
well,
so you know,

201
00:11:39.391 --> 00:11:42.630
you call out certain people or you talking about the inconsistencies.

202
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.200
Most people are doing the best they can and trying to make the world a better

203
00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:47.580
place.
Right?
So are there,

204
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.850
I think most people would just look rolling downhill in a hamster wheel.

205
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.660
I makes,
I'm trying to figure out how to stop this fucking thing.
Yeah.

206
00:11:55.661 --> 00:11:58.210
Most people are just on full on momentum.

207
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.270
Most people are definitely not thinking about how to make the world a better

208
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:04.480
place.
Occasionally people think of that.
What they try to think is,

209
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:08.320
how do I get buy number one?
Yeah.
And then how do I get better?

210
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.170
How do I get ahead?
Number two,
those are the things they think of,

211
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:15.220
and occasionally what's going on?
What's,
stop it over there.
Yeah.
Fucking Trump,

212
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.700
and then they go back to work.
Yeah.
That's all you can do sometimes.
Yeah.

213
00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:19.990
Most people,
that's most people.

214
00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:29.710
<v 1>Okay.</v>
