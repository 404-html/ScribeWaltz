1
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.900
And it was a huge issue before you came along.

2
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.980
A huge issue in the sport and continues to be in other organizations,

3
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:12.180
particularly overseas.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.200
I mean there's just rampant speculation about companies that literally encourage

5
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:17.670
people to take steroids.

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.630
It was always the case with pride in Japan.

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.050
That was one of the big things about pride ends in anyway,

8
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:29.190
who fought for them many times came on the podcast and literally was saying in

9
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:33.510
the contract and like capital letters,
it says we will not test you for steroids.

10
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.600
Like they wanted everybody to take steroids.
They,

11
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.710
I had friends who went to fight over there.

12
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.620
They told them to take steroids and move up a weight class.

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.290
So it was always an issue in the sport that this was a dirty sport air quotes.

14
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:47.380
Right.
Yeah.
Um,

15
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.350
but since you've come along and since you guys started instituting this

16
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.350
incredibly strict testing,
we've seen some pretty radical changes.

17
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.500
We've seen some amazing fights and amazing performances and I don't think the

18
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:02.220
performance levels dropped.
In fact,
I think it escalated and elevated rather,

19
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:04.230
which is something that people were really concerned about.

20
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.970
But one thing that we did see is some people that you suspected of doing stuff,

21
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.120
their bodies radically changed.
It was really mean.

22
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.810
That became a meme pre Usada and post Usada.
I mean,

23
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:18.090
and there's some comedy memes out there because of it,

24
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:22.590
because people's bodies change so radically.
Yeah.
It's an interesting,
you know,

25
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.930
the last time I was on,
we talked about kind of the smell test,
you know,

26
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.940
looking at somebody and you know,

27
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.170
it's difficult to say definitively whether or not,
you know,

28
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:33.540
changes in bodies are due to that or not,
but you know,

29
00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:37.110
you can't help but look at some of these pictures before and after you saw it.

30
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.810
And I think that's the case.
That's something I always struggle with.

31
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:44.280
How do you judge the success of a program?
Um,
you know,

32
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.920
do you judge it on numbers of positive tests?

33
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:49.710
I don't think that's necessarily the case.
You know,
maybe,

34
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.430
maybe you're not catching everybody.
Maybe there's no one to catch.
Um,

35
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.450
do you judge it on before and after pictures?
I don't know.
I mean that,

36
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.980
that could be one factor.
I like to judge it a lot.
Anecdotally.

37
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.170
You know,
a big part of my job is getting out and building relationships with our

38
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:12.150
fighters,
with managers,
with coaches,
and just,
you know,

39
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:13.390
chewing on the rear and,
and,

40
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.020
and figuring out what they're seeing and what they're hearing.

41
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:21.021
And almost universally the feedback I get from them is this is making a big

42
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:23.220
difference.
Um,
you know,

43
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:27.210
one thing I brought with me today and really the coolest piece of date I think

44
00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:32.211
I've seen in any anti-doping program are some really objective measurable

45
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:36.910
statistics and the UFC anti-doping program.
You Soda,

46
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.600
so you saw it as the United States antidoping agency.

47
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.590
They're the official antidoping agency of the United States by an act of

48
00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:48.180
Congress.
They're in charge of all drug testing for us Olympic sports.

49
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:49.170
Uh,

50
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.170
back in 2015 we made the decision to outsource the administration of our program

51
00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.490
to Usada.
The primary reason being the independence factor.
Um,
you know,

52
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:03.610
when you look at all these other professional sports league,
some have,
you know,

53
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.600
better programs and others none really have any independence and the

54
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:08.860
administration,
that program.

55
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:13.720
And what that means is there's no way of telling whether or not,
um,
you know,

56
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:17.050
when an athlete is sanctioned is done for business reasons or done for

57
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:20.050
favoritism.
So in our program,
you know,

58
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:23.890
no one can say that any of the administration of our program has done for that

59
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.350
reason.
It's a truly independent authority.

60
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.820
So what you saw it did recently as they went back and they'd been in existence

61
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:34.030
since I think about 2001 on the US Olympic level.

62
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.950
They went back and took a look at every single doper I think for steroids.

63
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:43.480
Everyone was caught for steroids in the existence of the Usada program and took

64
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:48.250
a look at each of those athletes,
biological passports and biological markers.

65
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.700
And they looked at what was the most common factor for the doper versus you

66
00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:55.300
know,
the non doper.

67
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.870
And what they determined was what stood out the most was large variance in

68
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:03.760
testosterone excretion in the urine.

69
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.810
And we think about it from a common sense point of view that that Kinda makes

70
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:08.231
sense.

71
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:12.880
And that someone who's using steroids at that time presents a sample.

72
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.780
Their testosterone excretion is probably going to be on the higher end.

73
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.470
And if they were to catch a doper on an off cycle,

74
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.610
what happens when you get off steroids is your body suppresses production of

75
00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:25.391
testosterone.

76
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:29.410
So in that case you're going to see a very low excretion of testosterone.

77
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.260
So they looked at that and plotted it out and saw hey,

78
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:36.040
every dope or has a very large variance in testosterone excretion.

79
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.350
Then what they did is they took all the UFC samples and they plotted out by

80
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:46.030
quarter and actually brought a graph along with me.
And it's some really drastic,

81
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:50.680
I think,
visual evidence of the success and the impact of this program.

82
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.190
I don't know if you can throw that up,
take a look at it.

83
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.370
Um,
so what,
what year exactly did,
uh,

84
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.450
you sought a takeover?
Yeah.
So we can't,

85
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:06.100
you saw of came into play July of 2015 so if you saw it has been in existence

86
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:10.720
for two years.
So you see here,
um,
that first quarter,

87
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.140
quarter three of 2015,
a pretty decent variance there.
Um,

88
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.410
which means in any given test and athlete,
you know,

89
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:21.550
I was up on an average a little bit at 30.
I'm a little,
you know,

90
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:25.690
in the mid twenties.
And then look at,
as you plot out that graph,
uh,

91
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:30.100
that variance becomes smaller and smaller and smaller and more in the medium

92
00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:33.790
range as it gets out to,
you know,
a quarter three of 2017.

93
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.010
That's very interesting.
You don't,
you don't,
this is,

94
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.350
you don't usually see statistics.

95
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:43.351
This is the first I've been involved in anti-doping world since 2002 and I can

96
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.210
unequipped equivocally say that this is the strongest visual,
objective,

97
00:05:49.211 --> 00:05:52.390
measurable evidence of success of a program that I've ever seen.
Well,

98
00:05:52.391 --> 00:05:56.080
one of the things that's so fascinating about this,
and um,
this,

99
00:05:56.081 --> 00:06:00.470
this goes to this coast credit to the UFC 100% is that they decided to do

100
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:02.330
something about this.
They didn't have to,

101
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.430
it wasn't like someone coming after them because,
uh,
you know,

102
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:10.130
so many people had been caught and someone said,
hey,

103
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:13.880
we're going to put a program on you guys to make sure you're not doping.

104
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.510
Or the UFC said,
we've got to clean this up.
And there's,
there's only one way.

105
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.920
The one way is to go with the very best testing possible and the most rigorous,

106
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:26.240
the most check checkin everywhere you go,
we're going to give you random test,

107
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.420
six o'clock in the morning,
knock on your door,
like the whole,

108
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.980
the whole full gamut of tests and the results have been pretty amazing.

109
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:38.981
And that alones that speaks volumes when you see this size of the variance

110
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:42.650
between the,
uh,
the test when you guys first started versus now.
