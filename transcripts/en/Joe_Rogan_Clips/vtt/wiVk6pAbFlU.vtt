1
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.380
Is the idea that we don't need withered old prunes like Jeff sessions telling us

2
00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:13.880
what we can put in our bodies.
We don't need that.
That's true.
And,
and,
and,

3
00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:18.830
and that how many Jeff sessions are there and the power structure and then where

4
00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:20.360
it gets really fucking cool man.

5
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.600
Check out David Graber you should have him on the podcast.
My God,

6
00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:27.530
he's fucking brilliant.
He's an author and he,

7
00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:31.640
I'm a philosopher,
I guess you could say,
but uh,
um,

8
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.310
he is incredible.
And he wrote a book called,

9
00:00:34.311 --> 00:00:37.700
I think it's called the Utopia of rules that I've been reading,

10
00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:40.640
which is pretty fucking bad ass.
And uh,

11
00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:43.640
it's just sort of breaking down like the,
um,

12
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.480
the bureaucracy that we're in right now.
Bureaucracy,

13
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:50.450
all the fucking forms you got to fill out to do just about anything these days.

14
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.850
Like all these fucking forms,
this is insanity.
Right?
Right.

15
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.510
But then where it gets really interesting is right now,

16
00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.100
so like in like communists states,
the,

17
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.640
the,
the,
the corporations in the state are kind of the same thing.

18
00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:09.590
So there's these like Ministry of Labor.
The stores are all national stores.

19
00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:13.130
You know,
and so we think that that's not what's happening right now.

20
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.980
But actually because the people who are running,

21
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:20.330
a lot of the corporations used to be in government and the people who are in

22
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:22.610
government used to be running these big corporations.

23
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.470
One of the cool points he makes,

24
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.100
and also because the government is making the rules that the corporations are

25
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:32.120
working by it,
but the corporations are putting their own agents into the state.

26
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.060
He sang the,

27
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.060
actually the line between the state and private companies is really blurry right

28
00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:40.910
now.
They're kind of merging together together,

29
00:01:40.911 --> 00:01:43.850
but we like to pretend that they're separate.
For example,

30
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:47.780
what's happening right now with the fucking FCC trying to take away the internet

31
00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:48.860
with Verizon,

32
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.010
having one of their fucking a pig drones in a super position of power right now

33
00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:58.100
is trying to take away the freedom of the Internet.
The state can be like we,

34
00:01:58.101 --> 00:02:02.260
the corporations can blame it on clarify what you mean by that because they're

35
00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:05.050
not trying to take away the freedom in the end and they're trying to,

36
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.140
they're trying to get rid of net neutrality.
Exactly.
Yeah.

37
00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:13.141
So what would it just mean is that you will have to probably pay more to access

38
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.170
things that require more bandwidth?
It's going to be,
it's not.

39
00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:21.910
It's going to be what it is now where every website has open access it two

40
00:02:21.911 --> 00:02:24.850
versions,
right?
You get the capitalist version.
I think it's a good idea.

41
00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:27.340
And then you get the tech version,
which thinks is terrible idea.

42
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.890
I almost always go to it towards the tech versus you have to,

43
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.520
but that's the Anaconda.
You know the way an Anaconda kill somebody,

44
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.750
every time you exhale it squeezes in a little bit.
That's all I got right now.

45
00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:41.170
It's the squeeze in is okay.
This fucking Internet.

46
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.130
It sucks.
If you're somebody like Jeff,
she does now.

47
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.660
That's not where the money's coming from.

48
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.050
I think you misinterpreting the whole idea.
It's all just a business thing.

49
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.910
It's like being able to throttle the,
the data and being able to decide like,

50
00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:59.560
like if Netflix wants you on there,
if you want to have Netflix on network,

51
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.450
they wanna be able to work out some sort of a deal.

52
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:04.120
They don't want to treat Netflix like it's any other sort of streaming service

53
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:06.370
like you looking at the,
the,
the,
the,

54
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.490
their buzzers business transactions they're looking at in a business sense.

55
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.170
They're not saying the internet sucks.

56
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.080
No one is trying to like squeeze the Internet,
stop it.

57
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.050
What they're trying to do is make more money.
Well,
okay great.
They're trying,

58
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:19.120
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah,
I do here.
I do know what you're saying,

59
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:23.020
but I think it's a slippery slope and it's that the idea of the Internet being

60
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:25.270
treated like,
I dunno,
water,

61
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.920
the Internet being treated like just a thing that no corporation should have any

62
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:34.921
kind of say that that to me it has to stay like that because the moment some

63
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.460
corporation,
whoever it may be,
it gets to start deciding,
yeah,

64
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.200
you guys need to pay a little bit more.

65
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.760
And if we establish that corporations in the state aren't as separate as we like

66
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:48.760
to think,
then suddenly there's all kinds of back channels.

67
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.200
They're suddenly there becomes a new way to begin to filter out content and you

68
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:54.400
could say it's for money.

69
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.270
You start building financial walls around things and you start making things

70
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:02.500
vanished into the background because they aren't in some big conglomerate that's

71
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:07.270
paying off the corporations more or whatever.
You just mess up the whole thing,

72
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.750
which as far as I can tell,
it's doing great.
The Internet is great.

73
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.960
This fucking compound you're in right now,
you know,

74
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.960
a lot of it came from the Internet.
This thing we're doing right now,

75
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.180
it's the way the Internet's been working.
Oh Dude.

76
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:21.250
No one's a bigger proponent of the unit than I am.

77
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:23.740
I just think when we're talking about these issues,
you gotta be,

78
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.940
you gotta be really like objective,
precise,
what's trying to happen here.

79
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:30.790
They're not trying to silence dissent.
They're just trying to,

80
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.840
they're trying to make as much money as possible.
I mean,
this is a weird,

81
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:38.320
tricky time when it comes to information and we do have to be very careful

82
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:42.710
because it could wind up being like,
Hey,
you get your internet from Comcast will.

83
00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:45.850
Comcast is no longer allow,
you know,

84
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.670
Bubba the laugh after that has your podcast featured on it or you know,

85
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.450
some new streaming service.
It's yet to be discovered.

86
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.940
That will be in the future challenging youtube.

87
00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:56.920
So youtube gets together with Google,
you know,

88
00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.340
they're owned by Google and they get together with Verizon and they make it

89
00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:03.370
exclusive for the Verizon network.
If you want to get on youtube,

90
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:06.480
you have to be on the Verizon network.
I mean,
that's,
that's,

91
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.330
this is all inside the realm of possibility.

92
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:09.670
<v 1>The deeper level though,</v>

93
00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:14.080
anybody who thinks that government has not been totally captured by corporations

94
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.320
isn't paying attention.
I mean,
that's not news in this country.
I mean,

95
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.560
you come from Europe and this is one of the things,

96
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.780
the problems I have with anarchists and Libertarians.

97
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.280
I think they're very naive about what the world would look like if there were no

98
00:05:27.281 --> 00:05:32.260
government regulations.
Yeah,
I agree.
Every poison,
every river would be to poison,

99
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:36.760
to swim in it.
You know,
the air would be fucking cause corporations.

100
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.810
It makes sense for them to dump their shit as near to the factory as possible.

101
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.650
Yeah.
They don't give a fuck about birth defects and dead people that it doesn't

102
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:45.040
matter.
