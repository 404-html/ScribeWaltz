WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.130
Uh,
represented her in that case and that's,
that's how we met.
And so,

2
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:10.131
I mean I had Pam on and we've both worked a lot in deception detection and

3
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:13.950
interrogation techniques and stuff.
And so just,

4
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.530
and it came right at a time when,

5
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.840
you know Jesse Smollett is in the news about it.

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.890
Is he telling the truth or is he not telling the truth?

7
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:24.510
And in here we have this conversation.

8
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.910
<v 1>What did you think immediately when you heard that story?</v>

9
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.150
I was very suspicious when I heard this story.
Jamie and I,

10
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:32.910
we shut that once the cameras are off for Lego these off.

11
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.790
Fuck that guy that he's real,
that nobody does this.

12
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.490
It was just too much like a movie.
Yeah.

13
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.480
Cause a bad movie.
Yeah.
I mean

14
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.500
<v 0>it's nine below zero and two people are lying and white just in hopes that he</v>

15
00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:50.800
might come by.

16
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.230
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean,
uh,
so strange.
Yeah,</v>

17
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.900
<v 0>it was suspicious and you know,</v>

18
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:01.080
he's entitled to due process and he's going to get it.

19
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.830
<v 1>Yeah.
He's going to get it.
And now he's saying,
yes,
I'm a untreated drug problem.</v>

20
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.070
So he's trying to carve out some path to explain his bizarre behavior,

21
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.230
<v 0>but there are very,</v>

22
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.450
there are very specific lie behaviors that people

23
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.670
can't really control.
Like what kind of stuff?
Well,

24
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.000
for example,
when,

25
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.180
when people are really desperately trying to convince you they're telling the

26
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:33.414
truth,

27
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.890
they'll do a lot of times what are called convincing statements.

28
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.050
Um,
rather than just telling you what they did or didn't do,

29
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.780
they'll do convincing statements like,
you know

30
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.260
<v 1>me,
ah,</v>

31
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.050
<v 0>like somebody saying,
who's who?
Somebody stole the petty cash in the office.</v>

32
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.620
You know,
me,
I give more money.
I donate more money than was stolen yearly.

33
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.070
You guys know me.
I mean

34
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.390
I was employee of the week,
you know,

35
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.580
there this convincing you there's,
there's a nice guy and then

36
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.300
<v 1>what someone does if the wrongly accused,
no.</v>

37
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.880
What does someone do if they're wrongly accused,

38
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.720
<v 0>if the wrongly accused,</v>

39
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.550
they'll look you straight up in the eye and tell you I didn't do it.

40
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.660
And if you asked them,

41
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.760
what do you think should happen to somebody that did an innocent person will

42
00:02:24.761 --> 00:02:27.190
say,
I think they should be found.

43
00:02:27.191 --> 00:02:30.400
I think it should be held fully accountable to the extent of the law.

44
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.660
Somebody that's guilty,
we'll say,
well,
you know,
I don't know.
I mean,
people make

45
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.770
<v 1>mistakes.
I mean,
yeah.
You know,
you get,
yeah,</v>

46
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.220
you got to give a guy a second chance.

47
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Do you worry that in coaching that you're essentially coaching liars by telling

48
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:47.340
people this kind of stuff and someone who does steal the money,
you know,

49
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.200
would be able to kind of like,
Hey,
uh,
it's not for amateurs.

50
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.740
And,
uh,
and um,

51
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.513
<v 0>when you,</v>

52
00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.580
there were some things that you can tell people to watch for,

53
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.670
but one of the things you do if there's somebody that you suspect is you

54
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:10.690
increase their cognitive load during the interrogation and there's no way you

55
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:13.960
can prepare for that.
Oh,
do you do that?
Well,

56
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.180
um,
you plan a mind virus,
for example,

57
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:23.650
a mind virus.
I like it.
Yeah.
This is a very mason type shit.

58
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.040
Yeah.
I think when he did.
Um,

59
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.240
like if lesson,
some money's missing,

60
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.900
if I said to you,
um,

61
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.420
is there any reason somebody would have told me that they saw you near a cashbox

62
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.760
about the time it went missing?
Dumped down.
Okay.

63
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:48.910
Now people talk at 125 words a minute.

64
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.220
They think at 12 to 1400 words a minute.
Now,

65
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:57.460
if it takes you five,
five seconds to tell me no,

66
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.220
you took the money

67
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.490
because if you weren't miss right now,
if you didn't take it,

68
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.800
you know you didn't take it.

69
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.220
You don't need to run scenarios through your head to think who could have seen

70
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:14.960
me,
Ben.
I mean it was,

71
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.150
I didn't see anybody.
Nobody could have seen me,
what did it.

72
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.220
But if you didn't do it,

73
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.200
it doesn't take you one millisecond to say absolutely not.

74
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.470
Have you ever been wrong before?
When you see someone on television,
you go,

75
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:34.150
I think that guy's guilty and they're innocent or vice verse.
Oh sure.

76
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.170
Because if,
if you really want to know for sure,

77
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:42.640
if somebody is guilty or innocent,
you need to invest a lot of time.

78
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:47.230
You need to get a baseline on what they normally look like,
talk like,

79
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:51.760
feel like,
um,
and then,
and then knowing that baseline,

80
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:54.790
you didn't need to compare how they're behaving on TV.

81
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:58.990
So just walking by the screen and seeing it,
um,

82
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.670
you might see things that would ordinarily be lie behaviors that could just be

83
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:07.840
part of their personality.
So if you're going to really make a judgment,

84
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.040
uh,
you,
you got to put a lot of time in and figure it out.

85
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:17.041
And what you should do before you decide you're going to be a human lie detector

86
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.580
is do your homework and y'all tried to figure it out objectively before you

87
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:25.240
figure it out behaviorally.
I mean,
you ought to do your investigation.

88
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:29.140
Find out if somebody took the money and you know,

89
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.780
find out where they were and you know,

90
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:34.450
look for fingerprints and do this and do that.
I mean,

91
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:39.451
you ought to really objectively figure it out before you rely on these things.

92
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.360
And so unless you get a baseline and get one on one with them and spend a lot of

93
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:50.260
time,
then you can't be,

94
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.330
you can't be really certain that you know whether they're telling the truth or

95
00:05:55.331 --> 00:06:00.331
whether or not it would be if it was that easy and that some people are pretty

96
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:01.570
obvious.

97
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.811
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

98
00:06:01.811 --> 00:06:06.811
I heard a cop once say that when people are guilty they tend to plead and cry

99
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.270
and then when they're not guilty they tend to get angry.
Right.

100
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.220
<v 0>When they're accused,
people that are wrongly accused are generally,</v>

101
00:06:15.221 --> 00:06:17.530
I write from the beginning till the end.

102
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.710
I mean every case is different,

103
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.620
but if you're wrongly accused,

104
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.460
that person is going to be pissed off from the minute you accused him till the

105
00:06:27.461 --> 00:06:32.240
end because it's like they're self.
Raj is like,
I,

106
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.900
I didn't do this and you're saying I did screw you.

107
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.260
And they don't take a step back.
And when you,

108
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.250
you see people,
they,

109
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.010
they do these convincing statements and they're pleading for you to believe
them.

110
00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:52.150
And then an anytime somebody says now,

111
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.750
in all honesty,

112
00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.670
usually the next thing out of their mass ally,

113
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.280
like I said to Joe,
honestly,

114
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.560
as opposed to everything else you've been telling me,

115
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.060
why are we we bracketing this one out is honest.

116
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.720
Or if they invoke the Deity,
oh,

117
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.760
I swear to God,
God as my witness.

118
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.220
And you know,

119
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.250
I don't know whether I have not done what I said you need to do with Jesse

120
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.450
Smollett.
But I do know when he went to the set at Fox,

121
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.670
uh,
he said,
you all know me.

122
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.860
I swear to God I didn't do this.

123
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.230
And I mean there were like three or four of those kinds of statements in like

124
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:50.730
two or three sentences there.

125
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:54.090
<v 1>Well,
my favorite ones is on stage.
He called himself the gay Tupac.</v>

126
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.600
That's enough for me.
That's a little narcissistic.

127
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.050
It's a strange thing though.
Like there was another one today,

128
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.620
a guy lit his house on fire,
I think,

129
00:08:07.621 --> 00:08:11.430
a in Chicago and uh,
said,
uh,
he's a gay fella,

130
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.620
said it was a hate crime and they caught him.
So a lot of that going on,

131
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.130
you know,
a lot of fake crime.
Very strange.
The,

132
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.650
and then sometimes people accuse people of something and someone will say,

133
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.860
why would,
why would someone make something out?

134
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.580
Why would someone turned themselves into a victim?

135
00:08:29.581 --> 00:08:33.300
One think there's a lot of clout and being a victim,
especially today,

136
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.300
there's a lot of,
you get a lot of attention,
a lot of love.

137
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.360
I think there's a lot of false accusations and false attacks and there's a lot

138
00:08:41.671 --> 00:08:44.500
of real ones.
But man,
when the false ones Combo,

139
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.830
it just does a giant disservice to everybody.

140
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.021
<v 0>Well,</v>

141
00:08:47.021 --> 00:08:52.021
there's a fair amount of research as to why people do these hoaxes and

142
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.480
particularly hate crime hoaxes.
And one of the primary motivation,
of course,

143
00:08:57.481 --> 00:08:59.370
it's sympathy and attention and all that.

144
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.300
But one of the interesting reasons that I've read in research is that they

145
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:10.800
really feel like it's emblematic of how the system treats them overall.

146
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.240
This is just a dramatic example of it and least they feel like,
I'm treated this

147
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.790
<v 1>anyhow.
Ah,
so they're just,</v>

148
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:23.300
<v 0>yeah,
I'm discriminated against.
I suffer by us.
I'm put down.</v>

149
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.200
This is just a focused example of that.

150
00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:29.210
So I'm really not lying.

151
00:09:29.211 --> 00:09:33.350
I'm just role playing how I'm overall treated.
Oh Wow.

152
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.790
So they justified in their mind if they're just going to bring all this

153
00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:41.300
treatment into one example to bring it into focus.

154
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.020
And so while it's a phony deal,

155
00:09:45.021 --> 00:09:49.730
it really is truthful representation of what their life has really lacked.

156
00:09:49.731 --> 00:09:50.590
They justified

157
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:54.020
<v 1>that way.
Oh,
how weird.
You know,
that's,
yeah.</v>

158
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:58.570
That's a deep psychological shit,
you know?
That's,
uh,
that's stretching.

159
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:03.270
That's a weird one.
We like you ride it out like that.

160
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.630
Put it in your mind that way.
Yeah.
Wow.
It's,

161
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.800
it's strange too because it gives people this,
um,
this,

162
00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:14.500
it's just this giant public show to watch now,
you know?

163
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.910
And I hate that family.
What a talented young man.
I mean isn't,

164
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.590
I've the Times that I've seen,
I don't want to show a lot,

165
00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:27.591
but the times I've seen him on there singing and assuming it is his voice and

166
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:32.220
he's singing,
uh,
extremely talented young man,

167
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.070
I find a lot of talented people are fucking crazy.

168
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:36.851
<v 0>Well,
you know,</v>

169
00:10:36.851 --> 00:10:41.851
somebody said that somebody said that the really talented singers and actors

170
00:10:42.821 --> 00:10:45.150
were the weird kids from high school that were in drama.

171
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.900
<v 1>Oh,
for sure.
For sure.
No,
um,
various levels of crazy,</v>

172
00:10:50.901 --> 00:10:53.090
obviously not all deceptive,
but you know,

173
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.540
some of the most brilliant actors are just completely out of their mind and

174
00:10:56.541 --> 00:11:00.300
that's one of the reasons why they're so good at acting because they can look a,

175
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.200
my friend,
my friend Wayne Fetterman had a bit,

176
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.690
he did about it on stage and he's like,
guess what?

177
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.860
It's not fucking normal to be able to just cry.
Yeah.
He goes,

178
00:11:09.861 --> 00:11:14.060
you could just cry and pretend something's wrong and cries.
I,
that's crazy.

179
00:11:14.061 --> 00:11:19.061
These are crazy people and you really can't go to a certain place.

180
00:11:19.521 --> 00:11:23.230
You've,
you don't have a little of that in you.
My,

181
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.180
my dad used to always say when he's working with patients,

182
00:11:26.181 --> 00:11:29.930
you'd say something about that.
Oh boy,
I can't stand about me.

183
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.400
Cause you say you can't see it in them if you don't have a little evidence on

184
00:11:34.401 --> 00:11:38.390
you.
There's some truth there.
Oh,
there's a hundred percent truth and that,

185
00:11:38.391 --> 00:11:41.030
that is the thing that drives me the craziest about weak people.

186
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.710
I'm so terrified of seeing weakness and just,
just,

187
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.030
just,
just being pathetic.
I'm so terrified to seeing that in myself.

188
00:11:50.031 --> 00:11:52.370
I see it in other people and it just,
it smells.

189
00:11:52.371 --> 00:11:56.180
I smelled like a drug sniffing dog.
Like,
oh,
there it is.
Yeah.

190
00:11:56.181 --> 00:11:57.590
You smell desperation.
