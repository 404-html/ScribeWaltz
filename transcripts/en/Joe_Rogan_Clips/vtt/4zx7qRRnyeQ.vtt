00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.490
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.790
Cause you're saying that's the number one negative,
all this social stuff.
I mean,

3
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.780
I feel like the,
the most hilarious thing is that Kim Jong,

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.710
Ooh,
actually wants to talk to him.
I was like,
this guy is so crazy.
Maybe.

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.880
Maybe I'll just talk to them.
I mean like what do you want to do?
Nobody,

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.040
nobody else wanted to have meetings with that guy.
Right.

7
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.460
He's wanted to talk to a president for the longest time and the,

8
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.900
they were dark to hit,
right.

9
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:30.390
Because they don't want to give them that good photo opportunity.

10
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.450
At the very least.
That's hilarious.
They're worried about their Facebook page.

11
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.230
Would we witness that if they talked,
fuck yeah,

12
00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:40.530
we would witness it and Trump would tower over them.
It would be so creepy.

13
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.100
Trump's a big guy and you see what happens.
When,

14
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.400
have you ever seen pictures of him with,
um,
um,

15
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.360
Dez Robin?
Do you ever see pictures of Kim Jong Min?
I'm good dude.
Kim Jong,

16
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.320
Ooh,
uh,
is a huge basketball fan apparently and loves Dennis Rodman.

17
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.550
Dennis Rodman goes to North Korea parties,
right?
Right.
Dennis Rodman.

18
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.110
Like if Trump was smart,

19
00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:07.380
I know Trump hired Amarosa Trump should definitely hire Dennis Rodman.

20
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.460
Fucking 100%.
Like 100%.
Say Dennis Rodman.
Please.

21
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.780
Would you be my emissary?
I'll look at that.
We got big dance.
Rodman is,

22
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.940
that's a large fellow and he's not even big compared to like a really big guy.

23
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.560
Right?
Like Lebron.
What if he's pretty big?
What's his name?

24
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.930
King a King Jong.
What?
Kim Jong.
Ooh.

25
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.680
They still can't say get a picture of King Jong.
Kim Jong with Dennis Rodman.

26
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.690
What if you were like,
Eh,

27
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.940
you think it'd be bad if he went like foot high platforms?
They're the rd,

28
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:37.920
but he denied it.
Yeah,
he probably would.

29
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.250
And he had long pants trying to cover them while he's Korean.
Well,

30
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:45.690
he's North Korean.
Uh,
there's some Korean folks that are pretty big.

31
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.180
Um,
I remember,
um,
when I was a kid,
the kid who won the heavyweight,

32
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.230
a national title is named Jimmy Kim.
He was a big Korean kid,

33
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.920
big heavyweight kid.
It was really good.
Six foot five.

34
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.710
So I don't know how big Kim Jong Un is,

35
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.340
but I bet he looks tiny compared to Dennis Rodman two foot three.

36
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:07.920
I just looked it up on my phone.
Wow.
That was quick.

37
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.110
I think it would be a weird meeting,
but it might actually be okay.

38
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.333
It might be good.

39
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.570
This people gotta something's gotta break over there like what they're doing.

40
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:21.720
It's just insane the way they keep those people essentially hostage.

41
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.980
There's no food that people that have escaped if had horrible fucking parasites

42
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:29.570
in their body and like,
see,
I feel bad.
I,
I don't know.
Like,

43
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.540
so guys escaped and got shot at on the border.
Fascinating footage.

44
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.550
You're saying they keep them hostage.
Who are you talking about?

45
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:39.290
The people of North Korea,
they're essentially held hostage.
I mean they're,

46
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:42.510
they're the,
they're trapped by dear leader.
You know what they have to do?

47
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:44.310
Like if,
when,
when the dad died,

48
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.900
these people were all weeping in the street and they had a weep like outwardly,

49
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:53.040
loudly,
as long as they could do it.
And if you stopped weeping early,

50
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.850
you'd be punished.
And people who they felt weren't weeping enough.

51
00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:58.530
Got Six months in jail.

52
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.200
It's a crazy place and everyone turns on everyone,
everyone,
rats,

53
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:09.130
everyone else out on everything they do.
You're supposed to meet together.

54
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:10.030
You go in front of this,

55
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.300
these people and you rat each other out for all the different things you do.

56
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.870
Michael Mouse has a great book about it.
Is it called dear reader?

57
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.070
Is that the name of his book?
Dear leader or dear reader,

58
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.690
why do I feel it's dear reader?
He's a funny guy.
Michael Mouse.
But um,

59
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.670
North Korea.
Do you ever hear something you're like,

60
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:32.890
I should know that I should know it too.

61
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.770
That's one of the way you do things about this podcast is just being able to

62
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:38.710
talk to screen.
It is dear reader.
Yeah.
Um,

63
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.560
being able to talk to people on this podcast and you know,

64
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:46.561
get like a little quick three hour crash course and what the fuck's going on in

65
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:48.940
North Korea.
So Michael was a amazing for that.

66
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:53.170
And you know who else was Henry Rollins was Henry Rollins went over there as a

67
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:57.250
fucking a tourist and wandered around over there.
That guy's an animal.

68
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>
