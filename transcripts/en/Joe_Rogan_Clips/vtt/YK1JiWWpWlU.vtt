00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
When you do it with that wacky fade,

2
00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:04.320
the one face that you picked for the face swaps,

3
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.930
so perfect because it looks like he's out of control.

4
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.460
Then they say he's like crazy.
Jesus.
What's happening again?

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.210
Fucking amazing man for years up.
It's amazing.
Did you see that?

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.160
What's going on today?

7
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.610
Tom Arnold who hates Trump has a new show on vice or he's just running around

8
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:27.700
trying to find incriminating video and audio w on Trump.
Ooh,

9
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.580
that's all he's done.

10
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.500
The whole show is him on a quest to find incriminating and humiliating video and

11
00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:38.340
audio on Trump and he was with Michael Cohen today.
What?
Yes.

12
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.180
How could he,

13
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.710
Michael Cohen is apparently going to work with Tom Arnold on the show.

14
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.170
Who is he?
Is the FBI okay with that and I think they'd be like,
yeah,

15
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.790
they were together.
This photo,
I mean Tom Arnold could be just bullshitting.
Well,

16
00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:54.550
I'm tabling that.
Tivo,

17
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.690
Tivo and does anymore.
Why don't you just get off the VCR?

18
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.730
Do you know how to work the client now?

19
00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:03.310
I had things come out of my mouth where it shows my age.

20
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:07.370
What is this Jamie Twitter.
This is on Tom Arnold.

21
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:09.780
Did the Miss Universe tape.
There's another tape

22
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.950
talking about 16 year old girls in their underwear here.
Okay,

23
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.170
let's go celebrity apprentice Trump denies any involvement with,

24
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.400
don't worry Tom Arnold is on it and I'm Tom Arnold

25
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.210
<v 1>for the Trump tapes with Tom Arnold.</v>

26
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.800
<v 0>I mean,
no one's going to care no matter what.
What he uh,</v>

27
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.910
it's not going to have an effect probably,
but yeah.
Listen,
Fuck John Gotti.

28
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.300
Trump is a Teflon.
Don,
you see that movie?

29
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:47.430
They're saying they scam rotten tomatoes.

30
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:50.640
Would that move post to be the greatest movie of all time?

31
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.530
We'll get to zero and then Haiti from the audience and like 90%.

32
00:01:55.531 --> 00:02:00.531
Where was from their employees thinking that correction on the Michael.

33
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.770
How,
when was that taken correction?
Some sort of correction?
It did.

34
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.000
He didn't say me and him were teaming up to take down Donald Trump.

35
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.250
Michael has enough Trump on his plate.

36
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.070
I'm the crazy person who said me and Michael Cohen,

37
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.790
we're teaming up to take down Trump.
Of course.
I meant it.

38
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.200
Michael doesn't get paid by vice.
Okay.

39
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.140
Thank you Tom for correcting the record.
Okay,

40
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.940
thanks.
Thanks for clearing that up.
Damn.

41
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.220
That's what I feel like he was Tom Arnold.
I'd be nervous as fuck.
Why?

42
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.660
I don't want to get killed.
Oh,
now impossible.

43
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.950
Impossible.
You can't kill Tom Arnold would if Putin did it for a favor,

44
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.030
Putin might be able to do it.
Put some voices,
decides.

45
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.500
I don't like what you're doing with the Lakewood,
the IV.
None.

46
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.970
This is not that good.
The Russian accent.

47
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.740
Would you consider doing a Putin on your page?
Ooh,

48
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.250
I will.
Yes.
That's a good idea.
It's a great idea.
What?

49
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:06.670
These little lotion that is.
He's the Russian accent because he's good.

50
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.990
There's some bad just to listen to him talk a few times and you'd,
you'd get it.

51
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.910
I'm potent.
That's good.

52
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.470
And then how a bunch of like really harsh Russian prostitutes like water flying

53
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.120
all over the place.
Like [inaudible].
Yeah,

54
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.000
I see it next week.
Yeah,

55
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.170
I mean that's not a bad idea for a sketch.
Is there a pee tape or is that a,

56
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.610
is that a rumor or do we not know this?
I don't know.

57
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.190
I don't think it's supposed to be real.
I think it's supposed to be fake.

58
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.420
I it sounds fake.

59
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.920
It sounds like something someone would just make up like not even well planned

60
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:45.250
out.
