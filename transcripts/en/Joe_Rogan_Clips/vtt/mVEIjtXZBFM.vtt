00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.740
What do,
why website trace.
I don't want to stop this podcast,

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:05.910
but I gotta pee so bad.

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.990
I did two podcasts in a row so you can talk to Jamie for just two minutes.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.780
We can talk about
those.
Is that a pre roll?
Yeah.

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.690
Word we read back.
I just have to be so bad.

6
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.910
I ain't mad at you son.
You got a letter right there?

7
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.760
Yes.
No.
You know you la is like this.

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.090
Is this the Indycar Sativa?
There is some extra spice in there too.

9
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.870
There's a little extra like I think it's called butter butter.

10
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.830
That why that's like wax.
What?
Yeah,
it's a little bit it.

11
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:45.370
You can't really tell it to be honest with you.
That's how white boys sets up

12
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.250
the ear.
You'll be okay.
How many people still come up to you about the wire?

13
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.570
I know that obviously Chappelle show,

14
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:59.571
but the people that come up to me at why they identify by themselves as instant

15
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.300
intellects.
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?
Like people inhale,
they'll,
they'll,

16
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.500
it's almost like a cocky,

17
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:07.390
like I know you want Chappelle on a couple of other things,
but you know what,

18
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.370
I really love you from the wire.
That was a dope experience.

19
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.320
Did you ever watch HBO is the corner I started,
I started,
I think I got a,

20
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:20.500
I feel like it was six episodes and I watched,
I didn't watch all of it.

21
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.660
I was in that,
okay.
I played a heroin addict and that,
and um,

22
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.640
a lot of people don't know people that are fans.

23
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.900
If you were a fan of the why you definitely been a fan of the,

24
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.610
because so many of the actors came back to after I watched the wire I wanted

25
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:35.970
more and more content like that.
And so I went back and tried to watch it,

26
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.150
but I just,
I actually enjoyed rewatching the wire more.

27
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.950
I like to show it and I was supposed to,
my character was supposed to um,

28
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.450
build up more.
But uh,

29
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.630
the Baltimore Tourism Board was upset that every time someone goes shooting

30
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.860
bought,
somebody depict it as a,

31
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.530
a drug infested pretty much what it is.
So that's why he went from the,

32
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.880
if you notice the shift in the writing,
it went from the towers to the doc's,

33
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:04.540
like how to fry it.
We get to the dots.

34
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.660
That's cause they didn't just want to be in the hood like that.
But David Simon,

35
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.010
he was um,
he was like,
Yo,
I like to have,
you know what you did.

36
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:17.490
So they brought me back for the last,
for the last season.

37
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.880
I've tried to get Joe to watch it,
but it's,
it's like it's 10 years old now.

38
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:24.150
So it's hard to get back into an old show.
But it's so good.

39
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:27.180
So many people don't live that way and people are like,
they were like,

40
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.110
definitely why are fanatics,
and when they brought me back to last season,

41
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.820
I was nervous because HBO,

42
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:37.350
the last season of any show on HBO to writers get vindictive and they do nasty

43
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:40.980
shit to the characters.
Like to last season of Oz,
it was dudes getting raped.

44
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:44.670
An Aza wouldn't even on us.
They was like,
dude,
I'm on Nickelodeon.

45
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:47.940
I'm just trying to get to the bathroom man.
But they was right to me.

46
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:49.770
I didn't get raped the last season and it was fun.

47
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.650
I know I've got to settle down and choose it for a run.

48
00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.100
Yeah.
And it's still,
it's the,
you just got to watch it because it's,
it's so good.

49
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.330
His character comes up at,

50
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.810
at like the best time and he's not to spoiler alert it,

51
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:09.250
but like the follow the money starts with him.
And like that's a trend that goes,

52
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.210
you know,
that my role would have been like if they didn't switch to tone,

53
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:14.710
if they would've kept it in the towers.

54
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.160
My Shit was cause I was the connection between the streets and the politics.

55
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.910
I know I could've blown.
I carry it out.
And when I first got busted,

56
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:26.170
when I was in the room,
I was trying to,

57
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:29.680
I was going to rob the mansion and we'll tell you Dan,
she said,
what's your name?

58
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.360
I said,
my name is,
um,
uh,
data.
Uh,
my name is day day,

59
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:38.740
but they mostly call me Damien.
Right.
And then he said,

60
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.550
my name is Daniel.
And they mostly call me lieutenant.

61
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.790
And this have to had already said how old robbed the whole crib.

62
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:48.970
Cause I thought he was a driver with me and that character's should have been

63
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:53.410
off by then.
But so it was a good opportunity.
There was another cool platform.

64
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.230
It was dope.
I can honestly say whatever happens in my career.

65
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.300
I was on two shows.
They'll go down and television history,

66
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.100
the wires.
Yeah.
