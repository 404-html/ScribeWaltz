1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.340
I mean that's probably one of the things that made them sick.

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.300
What was your take on it?
I mean you probably already talked about,

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.230
so sorry if you did,
but uh,
with that whole Connor in New York thing,

4
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.270
<v 1>yeah,</v>

5
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.820
<v 0>pretty fucking crazy.
Um,</v>

6
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.850
there's a whole story behind it and the story behind it is that Artem low Bob,

7
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.210
who is one of 'em Connor stable mates had an issue with Khabib.

8
00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:27.494
Norma Madoff,

9
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.220
cause he said something in an interview that can be pulled out of fights.

10
00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:32.660
Then the Conners,
the real,

11
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.110
real fighter and then Khabib's a coward so it could be found him and kind of

12
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:41.380
smacked him a little,
said you call me a coward motherfucker.

13
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.180
Like that kind of shit.
And there's a video of him saying it to him,

14
00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:49.181
talking to him in Russian and Connor saw that video and flew from Ireland with a

15
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:55.010
bunch of fucking gangsters all the way to New York to crazy.
Yeah.

16
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.070
There might've been some substances involved.
Not good though.
No.

17
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.530
I mean he might,
he literally might wind up wind up in jail.

18
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.900
It's entirely possible that New York's going to prosecute him.

19
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.470
I mean that was like a salt.
He threw a dolly at a car.

20
00:01:09.471 --> 00:01:13.040
People get their eyes cut and their face cut glass shatter.
I,
yeah.

21
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.100
Yeah.
And luckily it wasn't,

22
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.040
I mean I don't want to say it's any better that men get cut,

23
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.260
but imagine if he did it to rose.
Nama.
Eunice,

24
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.290
she's beautiful little 24 year old girl who's a world champion would have,

25
00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:29.150
she got cut by the glass.
What if he ruined her career?

26
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.700
Like what if she never got to fight again with the glass?

27
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:36.310
Cut Her eye and we lost rose and that would have been the day of or day before a

28
00:01:36.311 --> 00:01:39.880
fight today.
Before fine.
She,
she thought about pulling out of the fight.

29
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.680
She was so distraught by the whole event that she thought really pulling out.

30
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.250
Yeah.
Cause she was on that bus.
Yeah.
Yeah,

31
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.220
yeah.
Definitely not going to get him.
I guess I don't know it,

32
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.420
but then in a way it does.
I know there's people who are talking about,

33
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.770
oh this is all coordinated planned like teams on your rent,
Preston.
Yeah.

34
00:01:59.771 --> 00:02:04.150
I mean you can definitely see how how it could be.
It's not,
it doesn't,

35
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.620
but I mean,
yeah,
it's just not,
but it's not going to,

36
00:02:08.621 --> 00:02:11.510
is it going to lower his draw?
Probably not know it's going to,

37
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.840
he's going to be even bigger than ever.
That's what I'm saying.

38
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.680
So when he actually does fight Khabib,
if those two do fight,

39
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.650
if let's say,
let's say they solve everything civilly,

40
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.380
meaning Connor pays everybody off paste.

41
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.440
Kassoff pays Ray Borg off pays up emotional duress to anyone who sues him.

42
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:37.470
That was on the bus pay some sort of a fine to the state in New York.

43
00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:41.440
That's pretty significant.
Gives up a few million dollars for sure.
Right Hook.

44
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.950
Then they put the fight together.

45
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.850
It's gotta be,
it's gotta be giant.
Maybe that would be the rule
guy.

46
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.780
Mcgregor was co come back.

47
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:56.781
Fight is already being mooted as what does that mean as the biggest record

48
00:02:57.151 --> 00:03:01.810
breaker in UFC history?
I've never seen that word.
Mooted have you ever seen it?

49
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.010
I think mean it's touted it,

50
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:07.250
but I've seen it either the biggest record breaker in UFC history.
Yeah,

51
00:03:07.251 --> 00:03:11.290
I will be if he fights Khabib.
Yeah.
Experts are predicting.

52
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:15.490
He'll be back in the octagon within a year.
Okay.
I'd say a year from now,

53
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.290
that's not like a much of a stretch.

54
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.770
That's a crazy prediction is six to 12 months,

55
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:25.150
so I just saw and maybe 81,000 seat stadium in Moscow.

56
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.360
That's what they're going to do potentially.
I mean,
it's not signed,
obviously,

57
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:30.180
but that's what this article is.
You know,
we're,

58
00:03:30.181 --> 00:03:33.520
we're going to be right here watching it right here,

59
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:36.460
watching that shit on that TV.
It's going to be awesome.

60
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.820
We're going to be an American on American soil,
drinking Budweiser,

61
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.100
drinking American beer,
maybe some Sam Adams something American.

62
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.050
I'm not going to Russia not going come to me and Russia because Russia.
