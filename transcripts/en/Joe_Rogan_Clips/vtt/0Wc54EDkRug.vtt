1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.040
Four three,
two,
one.

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.590
All right,
we'll live.
What's up man?
What's up dude?
What's hilarious folks?

3
00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:14.010
I have to tell you this.
I did a podcast earlier today and he said,
wow,

4
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:17.190
is your second for the day?
He goes,
impressive endurance.

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.030
Do you know how fucking ridiculous that is for you to say,

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.020
this is a guy who walked across Antarctica.
How many days did it take you?

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.640
54 days by yourself.

8
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:31.310
By myself checking the fucking frozen Tundra it,

9
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.350
that was an endurance feat of its own.
Yeah.
Just Bell.

10
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.320
That's a real endurance feed.
I'm just sitting down talking to people.
Oh my God.

11
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:41.520
You talked already for two hours.
How do you do it?
Two more hours.
Here we go.

12
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:45.420
Yeah.
Crazy.
Yup.
Yup.
To what the fuck were you doing?

13
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.050
Just just getting back.
Actually.
Still,
uh,

14
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.180
still practically have the snow on my shoes.
Yeah.
I got back about a month ago.

15
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:55.350
54 day journey.
First person in history to cross the entire continent.

16
00:00:55.351 --> 00:01:00.270
Solo unsupported.
So no resupplies throughout the thing.
No,
no aid,
no wind kites,

17
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:04.530
nothing.
Just me dragging a 375 pound sled across Antarctica.

18
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.010
I can't believe it only took you 54 days.
Yeah,

19
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.700
it's so big.
We can look at an article on a map,

20
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.480
like how long do you think it would take you to walk across America?
Well,

21
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.450
you got it.
So we usually look at Antarctica map.
This is hilarious.

22
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:20.580
I have show people a picture of Antarctica.
You're a smart guy.

23
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:21.090
You probably noticed,

24
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.720
but usually people see it on a map projection because then it gets flat.
Right?

25
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.920
It's actually circular.
Um,
so I went from the edge of the Ron I shelf to the,
uh,

26
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.230
via the south pole to the Ross ice shelf.
So basically kind of a diagonal across,

27
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:36.330
through the center and then back to the other ice shelf.

28
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.220
What do the flat earthers think about?
You're traversing this,
this area.

29
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.340
This is what you did.
This is how you,
there it is.
Exactly.
Yes.

30
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.010
We went to the center of the fucking earth basically.

31
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:50.190
There it is the top of the pole,
yet bottom of the earth,
you know,

32
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.950
standing down there holding everyone up on my shoulders.
Wow.

33
00:01:52.951 --> 00:01:56.220
So you were at the South Pole and then you trucked over to the,

34
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.900
to the ice shelf on the other side.

35
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.780
It's funny you say about the flat earthers though because all jokes aside,

36
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:04.150
I been getting a lot of trolling on my Instagram page from the flat earthers.

37
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.310
I've got guys go,
I'm like,
oh,
I was doing this speech the other day.

38
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.180
People are Super Nice.
Come up in the Q and a afterwards,

39
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:12.840
want to shake my head and take a picture,
whatever.

40
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.810
And this guy walks up and this real earnest look on his face and he's like,

41
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.370
so I really wanted to ask you how was the whole?
And I was like,
excuse me.

42
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.680
He was like,
he know the hole at the center and I was like,
give me a little more.

43
00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:27.810
He was like,
you know like when you got to the edge

44
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.350
and I was like,
Oh man,

45
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:35.000
like you're really asking this question right now like we are talking about,

46
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.680
because I didn't quite know where to go with it.
I was like,
yeah,

47
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.820
there was actually,

48
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.400
I at least I didn't see the edge and the curvature kept going in a minute is

49
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.470
such a strange thing to believe,
but people do that.

50
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.910
People think people are trolling about that and you know what,

51
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.920
it actually started out,
it's another four Chan thing,
you know?

52
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.870
Did you know that it's,

53
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:57.240
well I'm sure there was probably somebody believed it before that,

54
00:02:57.241 --> 00:03:00.310
but it started off people trolling on four and then eventually people just

55
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:04.270
started actually going,
hey,
it is flat.

56
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.180
And then they started believing it and videos,
youtube videos.

57
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.970
There's another youtube video of someone linked to me the other day and I

58
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:11.890
thought it had like,
I thought it had like a few hundred views.

59
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:13.120
We had 28,000 views.

60
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.690
There was always guys debating like Colin proof that there's not a wall.

61
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.780
The wall,
like there would be like game of Thrones at the edge of the world.

62
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:23.410
There's this whole conversation.
I bet there's another 28,000 people.

63
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:25.420
It's proved the call and never actually weren't,

64
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.770
oh he's a new world order shill.
We'll,
the other,

65
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:32.890
the other buddy wide was that we got up budge on the Instagram page.

66
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:34.840
I'm out there alone completely by myself,

67
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:36.310
but I wanted to share the whole story through my

68
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.250
<v 2>Graham to like share that journey with people,</v>

69
00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:42.120
inspire others to do whatever they want to do.
And it kept being like,
well,

70
00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:44.520
I mean he's not out there alone.
He's taking pictures.

71
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.330
It was like the film crew as like guys,

72
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.330
<v 1>have you never heard of a tripod?</v>

73
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.230
And if in a timer watch survivor man.

74
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.370
Exactly.
So it's so,
it's so funny.
Comments along those lines.
So your,

75
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.330
your sled was 300 and how many pounds?
375 pounds to start.

76
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.420
<v 2>Basically food and fuel was the main,
the main way.
So people,</v>

77
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:09.220
I called my project the impossible first.

78
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:11.860
That's sort of what I named the project because several

79
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.340
<v 1>people would try it right there.
So not only walking,</v>

80
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:18.610
you're dragging this big ass heavy sled.

81
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.050
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah.
And look dude,
people,
so people have tried this,
uh,
you know,</v>

82
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:26.500
going back a hundred years to sh Ernest Shackleton saying if it was possible.

83
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:27.670
And then the last few years,

84
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:30.020
some really experienced polar explorers have given it a shot.

85
00:04:30.021 --> 00:04:34.090
And one guy actually died less than a hundred miles from the finish line because

86
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:38.200
of lack of nutrition and some challenges with the weather and things like that.

87
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.920
Um,
but people called it,
you know,
people after that,
we're like,
it's impossible.

88
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:45.880
And the reason people thought it was impossible because you can't get
resupplies.

89
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:48.310
Meaning if you feel your sled with food and a certain amount,

90
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:49.930
you actually can't drag this led anymore.

91
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:53.710
So the whole math equation really was figuring out just how much food and fuel I

92
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:55.990
could put in the sled.
The fuel melts the water,

93
00:04:55.991 --> 00:05:00.520
so melts the ice into water essentially.
And that equaled the 375 pounds.

94
00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:03.550
And to be truth,
I could barely pull it on the first day.

95
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.580
Like I a one hour into getting dropped off.

96
00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:08.770
I'm dropped off completely alone out there in Antarctica.

97
00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:12.190
I planned this project for a year,
you know,
uh,
and uh,

98
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:16.000
I get dropped off and after about one hour pulling 375 pounds sled through the

99
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:19.060
snow,
it's minus 25 degrees out.
I'm crying,
I'm crying,

100
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:22.690
I'm literally crying and the tears in my goggles are starting to freeze.

101
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:24.840
And I'm like,
oh my God.
So I pick up my satellite phone,

102
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.020
I call home to my wife Jenna,

103
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:30.950
who also creates and plans all these projects with me.
And I'm like,
Babe,
uh,

104
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.120
I think we named the project the right thing.
The impossible first.
Yep.

105
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.210
It looks like it might be impossible to keep going.

106
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.880
So I'm one hour into a thousand mile journey.

107
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.940
Poetess led told everyone I'm going to do this and I'm already having those

108
00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:44.140
doubts pull up.
Uh,
you know,

109
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.080
fortunately I was able to get a little bit further that day and 54 days later

110
00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:50.920
and made it to the end.
How far did you get in the first day?
Well,

111
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:53.470
it's funny cause we show,
just show the map.
I actually,
you know,

112
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:54.430
it starts on the ice shelf,

113
00:05:54.431 --> 00:05:57.650
which is basically the frozen sea ice and there's an edge of that where the

114
00:05:57.651 --> 00:06:01.160
continent starts.
And so I have a way point on my gps that marks that.

115
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:04.280
So the plane that drops me off actually dropped me off on the ice shelf before

116
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:07.730
the continent starts.
And my first waypoint was kind of like the actual start.

117
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.440
And so one hour in,
I haven't even hit the real start.
So when she,

118
00:06:11.441 --> 00:06:12.800
when I call her on the phone,
she's like,

119
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.270
because she knows the route and she's like,

120
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:16.220
well how far are you from the first way point,

121
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.440
which is where the actual start isn't.
And I'm like,

122
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.060
it's 0.63 more miles.
She's like,

123
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.670
it's half a mile.
You have a thousand more to go.
Like get to the first way point,

124
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.380
you know?
And I was like,
okay,
okay.
So I,
you know,
rallied myself,

125
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:33.470
got to the first way point and then finally got in my tent that night and just

126
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:34.340
kind of took a deep breath.

127
00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:36.860
I think I was just overwhelmed by the magnitude of it.
I mean,

128
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:39.860
imagine being a speck in the middle of Antarctica alone,

129
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.600
these crazy temperatures,
you know,

130
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:44.900
all the excitement but fears of the journey ahead.
Um,

131
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.570
and 375 pounds on my back when the sleds,

132
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.200
when the snow's deep too loose snow makes 375 pounds,

133
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.910
even even heavier than if it's like light,
you know,
icier consolidated.
So yeah,

134
00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:57.860
it was a,
it was a rough start to say the least.

135
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.970
Did you do any sort of test run pulling the sled anywhere else?
Yeah,

136
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:05.320
so the training element of it was pretty cool.
So,
um,

137
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.140
I actually said a few other world records previous to this in the mountains and

138
00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:11.240
things we could talk about if you want.
But the,
uh,

139
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.430
the last year is I really committed to this project I decided is to obviously

140
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:18.920
start training specifically for this.
Um,

141
00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:22.430
I needed to put on about 20 pounds of muscle.
I'm usually six foot one 65.

142
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:22.971
Pretty Lean.

143
00:07:22.971 --> 00:07:25.910
I'd race triathlon professionally for a number of years and realized I needed to

144
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:28.880
be a bit bigger because I was going to lose so much weight.
Um,

145
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.540
and I found an amazing coach and Portland,
Oregon where I live.

146
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:35.030
This guy named Mike McCastle.
I don't know if you've ever heard of him,

147
00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:39.170
but I know you've had,
you've had David Goggins on your show.
I take it.
So,
um,

148
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.530
Mike actually surpassed David's pullup record.

149
00:07:42.531 --> 00:07:47.490
Mike did 5,804 pull ups in 20 hours.
Um,

150
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.460
I think Goggins at about 4,000,
which are both insane to me

151
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.300
<v 1>cause I can do like another thousand.</v>

152
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.780
And he was where Mike was wearing a 30 pound weight vest.
Yes.

153
00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.210
Just to add insult to injury,
uh,
Mike McCastle absolute absolute legend.

154
00:08:01.211 --> 00:08:02.360
So anyways,
a minute,
wait a minute.

155
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.810
5,000 fucking Chin ups with a weight vest on to that.

156
00:08:07.811 --> 00:08:11.890
Barely can do 10.
I'm right there with you at like at pull ups are not,

157
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.580
I've got some other physical strength but the pullup department is not,

158
00:08:15.581 --> 00:08:19.720
not my strong suit is fucking get this too.
Just cause I got to,

159
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.330
I got a big up by bad for a second.
That's his fourth road right here.

160
00:08:22.331 --> 00:08:25.210
Also pulled a f two 50 truck,

161
00:08:25.211 --> 00:08:29.860
20 miles across death valley in a harness.

162
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:33.150
So I'm trying to look for the best guy to teach me how to pull heavy Shang.

163
00:08:33.151 --> 00:08:35.920
My God,
you got the gun.
I found the guy was like,

164
00:08:35.921 --> 00:08:39.540
fuck this is the guy that out.

165
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.190
Does it just make you feel like such a pussy.

166
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:47.380
And the greatest thing about Mike,
you know,
big,
strong Jack Dude,

167
00:08:47.381 --> 00:08:50.990
but like super soft spoken.
She's like,
he's like,
yeah,
did this popes.

168
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:56.010
So it was cool.
Like,
so anyways,
I to fucked with that

169
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.240
<v 2>record so hard,</v>

170
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:02.640
he could die and like come back to life and live a whole nother life and no

171
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:05.220
one's ever going to do it.
Yeah.
So anyways,
my training,
he would,

172
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:09.540
he was the guy went to him train out of this gym in Portland,
uh,
where,

173
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:12.780
where he trains out of and he just,
he got me bigger,
he got me stronger.

174
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:15.900
But he also did all sorts of bad ass crazy stuff.
I mean,

175
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.750
this is a physical challenge,
but it's more of a mental challenge in anything.

176
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:21.570
So he had me,
you know,
my hands in ice buckets,

177
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:24.210
doing planks to get my heart rate jacked up and then he'd be like,

178
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:27.000
get out of the water.
Then I pulled my hands out of the ice buckets.

179
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:29.850
Do you know I'd be a seated squat against the wall,

180
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.240
but then he would hand me Legos and so my hands are frozen,

181
00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:35.750
my feet or an ice buckets now in a plank.
My heart rates,
you know,

182
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.520
one 90 and he's like,
put this Lego set together.

183
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:42.570
So the deck dexterity in my fingers,
the mental acuity to pull this all together,

184
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.310
there is this guy,
what a fucking savage discarded is.

185
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.240
He and he did that for veteran suicides.
Yeah,
exactly.
So he did,
he's got really,

186
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:53.220
really important missions behind all of his projects.

187
00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:55.260
He calls them 12 labors in over his life.

188
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:58.020
He's trying to set 12 route world records and various things.

189
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.780
People that are just,
they're just designed different.
Yeah.
Yeah.

190
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.030
So he's the man.
But like this crazy training he came up with,

191
00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:10.140
for me that was like the ice,
the water,
the mental acuity.

192
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:12.060
All of this was like,
he was like,
Yo,

193
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.820
you're going to be in Antarctica if your tent blows away,

194
00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:18.000
when you're pulling it up,
you're dead.
Like the stakes are that high,

195
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:22.320
50 60 mile per hour winds.
Absolutely crazy.
Um,

196
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.220
so do you ever have an issue like that where you thought the tent could blow

197
00:10:25.221 --> 00:10:28.860
away?
Um,
I think,
I don't know if you have it.
There's a clip on my Instagram.

198
00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:33.210
I posted a few days ago of me of me setting up the tent and the minus 80 degrees

199
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.070
out,
60 mile per hour winds.
It's pretty gnarly.

200
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.370
But yeah,
I mean there was one time when the 10 almost did blow away from me yet.

201
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.900
There's this one,
there's one other one.

202
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:47.340
This is me getting into 10 looking like an absolute disaster when I get help

203
00:10:47.341 --> 00:10:50.130
with audio.
But that's me.
That's me.

204
00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.830
<v 4>Whoa.
You're pulling ice.
I got caught on a massive storm.</v>

205
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.823
<v 3>I was just</v>

206
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.120
<v 4>so hard to get the tent up.</v>

207
00:11:05.121 --> 00:11:07.190
I didn't know if I was gonna be able to get it up or I was going to have to just

208
00:11:07.191 --> 00:11:10.740
keep walking that.
Now,

209
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.050
<v 3>hopefully these tent poles hold
man,</v>

210
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:20.680
that was really intense.

211
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:22.990
<v 2>How do you stay warm in that?
Uh,</v>

212
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:29.040
so it's average temperature is about minus 25 minus 30,
uh,
in Antarctica.

213
00:11:29.041 --> 00:11:31.110
But like I said,
when the wind jacks up,
uh,

214
00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:32.880
I don't know if there's the other cup of me setting up the tip,

215
00:11:32.881 --> 00:11:35.310
but if you get a chance to see that it's,
you know,

216
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.380
it's about Kimmy about minus 80 outside,

217
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.660
which it's hard to wrap your mind around that.

218
00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:43.020
But I've tried to put it in perspective by saying I could take a cup of boiling

219
00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:45.880
water and throw it in an air and immediately turns to ice.
Like that's,
that's,

220
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.420
that's the temperature would dealing with,
yeah.
This is me trying to,
uh,

221
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.530
keep the tent poles together.
Usually you have someone else to hold on to it,

222
00:11:52.531 --> 00:11:55.030
but I'm alone.
I'm completely alone out there.

223
00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:59.050
So this is me struggling with my tent,
just trying to keep it up.

224
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:00.910
I've got it tied down to my sled.

225
00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:04.570
They're just battling battling the winds and the state.
Like I said,

226
00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:06.640
the stakes are high.
If that blows away.
I don't have a spare tank.

227
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:11.040
I've got no extra weight in my sled to hold spare stuff.
So it's,
it's,

228
00:12:11.041 --> 00:12:14.920
it's do or die quite literally in a moment like that have a patch kit.

229
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.700
I had a couple of things repaired,
a sewing kit,
a patch kit,
stuff like that.

230
00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:21.720
But if the tent itself or the temples,
you know,
ripped apart

231
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.710
<v 1>pretty much done.</v>

232
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:28.711
And also you have to set up your tripod and film and then press stop and go back

233
00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:31.930
and send it.
How are you keeping these batteries juiced up?
No,
this is,

234
00:12:31.931 --> 00:12:34.780
this are the film crew man that was following me around that right of the

235
00:12:34.781 --> 00:12:37.330
plateau film group there near the Ice Wall.

236
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.100
<v 2>The uh,
no,
uh,</v>

237
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.400
it was basically I had to keep the batteries warm by keeping them right against

238
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:42.971
my skin.

239
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:45.970
So I'd keep the batteries right against my skin and my body weight would keep it

240
00:12:45.971 --> 00:12:47.890
warm.
And the second I wanted to take it out,

241
00:12:47.891 --> 00:12:51.920
I pulled out real quick hit play and then it would usually last a minute or

242
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:53.920
third enough to get a little clip or something like that.

243
00:12:53.921 --> 00:12:56.080
You couldn't just let it run,
but then it would completely freeze.

244
00:12:56.081 --> 00:12:57.560
Even a full battery would be,
you know,

245
00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:02.230
on zero battery by pretty quickly using solar panels to charge it.
Yeah.

246
00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:05.230
So one crazy cool thing about Antarctica,
that time of year,
years,

247
00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:07.870
it's 24 hours a day light.
And so the sun never sets.

248
00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:09.520
So even when I'm on my tent in the middle of the night,

249
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.260
I'm ask earplugs to kind of pretend like it's nighttime,

250
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.780
but 24 hours a day light.
So solar panels,
I'm keeping everything charged.

251
00:13:16.781 --> 00:13:18.550
Camera's phone,
batteries,
all that.

252
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.420
<v 1>And Are you traveling with or are you using gps?</v>

253
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.890
<v 2>Yeah,
so I have some way points,</v>

254
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.510
the gps way points that kind of led my path to the South Pole,
et cetera.

255
00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:29.950
But most actually using a compass.

256
00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:33.520
So I'd look at my gps maybe once every week or something like that.

257
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:37.550
Just cause the bearing,
the juice factor is actually just easier because,

258
00:13:37.551 --> 00:13:41.420
so I basically had like a harness on front of me that would have my gps or my,

259
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.640
my compass kind of off my chest more or less because some of the clips we saw

260
00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:48.700
the sun's out.
But actually more than half of the time the clouds would come in.

261
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:50.560
So it'd be just complete and utter whiteout.

262
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:52.690
I couldn't even see one step in front of me.

263
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.660
And so I'd actually have to just stare down at my compass,

264
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.870
keep it on this bearing.
And so imagine you can't see anything,

265
00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:02.110
can't see one step in front of you.
I'm pulling a 300 pound sled,

266
00:14:02.111 --> 00:14:03.760
1213 hours per day,

267
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.560
not listening to anything really complete dead silence and just staring at this

268
00:14:08.561 --> 00:14:10.240
compass bearing all day long.
So

269
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.350
<v 1>going crazy at all.</v>

270
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:19.590
<v 2>I mean,
the mental side of it was by far the most interesting side of it for me.</v>

271
00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.810
Um,
you know,
have a lifelong insurance athlete,

272
00:14:21.811 --> 00:14:23.960
but really kind of an exploration into the mind.

273
00:14:23.961 --> 00:14:26.130
It was what it was for me and why I was curious about it.

274
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.690
So spending all this time in silence.
I've done,
are you familiar with,
uh,

275
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.160
a vipassana meditation,
these tips?

276
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.180
So I've done a couple of these 10 days silent meditation retreats before this,

277
00:14:36.181 --> 00:14:40.520
which is 10 days,
no reading,
no writing,
no eye contact.
Um,

278
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:43.530
kind of dove in to that piece of it.
But 54 days,

279
00:14:43.531 --> 00:14:48.150
a load in Antarctica and complete silence was,
was next level of that.
For sure.
