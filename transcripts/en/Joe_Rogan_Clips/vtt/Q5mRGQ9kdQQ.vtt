Hello Freak bitches.
The NCAA is,
isn't this a whole nother conversation?
Those,

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.450
those crooks don't pay their employees.
But as far as the NFL,

3
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:13.590
you get compensated and you,
you know,
the risks for the most part,
you know,

4
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:18.360
the risks going into the NFL.
Like I chose to to,
to do this as it at a young age.

5
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.010
I'm glad you just said that those crooks don't pay their employees.

6
00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:25.420
Get out is a dark and dirty fucking business.
College sports.
I hate it.

7
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.810
I hate it and I don't have anything to do with it,
but I watched it.
I'm like,

8
00:00:28.811 --> 00:00:31.780
that's cool when you find out how much those fucking schools get from all those

9
00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:35.770
people in order to make sure that their team is successful because the Alma

10
00:00:35.771 --> 00:00:39.910
maters want to,
yeah,
we fucking won again and they get billions of dollars.

11
00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:40.960
There are fucking huge,

12
00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:45.870
huge business and the athletes don't get paid anything.
Nah,
man,

13
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.490
I,
I've,
I've told many,
many times I've told my side of that story,
man.
Uh,

14
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.990
I don't,
I'm not a fan of the NCA.
No,
I don't.
I'm not a fan of either.

15
00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:57.260
I think it's,
it's stealing.
I think they're stealing from those athletes.

16
00:00:57.261 --> 00:01:00.380
That's what,
that's what I mean.
If any ruining their careers,
most likely,

17
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.530
if you do four hard years of college football,

18
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:07.400
what are the odds you're gonna get out of that without a permanent injury?
I had,

19
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.130
I think three or four of my surgeries came from college.
Yeah.
It's,
it's,

20
00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:15.220
it's tough.
You're playing for free and you pay for,
and my buddy,
hey,

21
00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:18.080
you get an education.
And see that's the thing that kills me man.
When people say,

22
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.560
Hey,
yeah,
I like to say that.
I hate that.

23
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.480
So when I first went to school,
I wanted to study astronomy.

24
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.110
Like that was what I wanted to study.
So I went to my,
uh,

25
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.820
academic advisor and I was like,
okay,
this is what I want to do.

26
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.130
Like it took me like a year to figure out,
okay,
this is what I do.
I was,

27
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:34.140
I was in love with the stars and the kind of,
that's one of the,

28
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:37.090
I just wanted to know about it.
And as soon as I said it like,
Oh,

29
00:01:37.091 --> 00:01:39.280
you can't do that.
I was like,
why?
He's like,
because the,

30
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.810
those classes conflict with the practice schedules in the meeting schedules.

31
00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:43.770
And I was like,
well shit.

32
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.880
And so I had to wait another year in order to find what I wanted to do and ended

33
00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:52.650
up settling for a philosophy,
which was a cool major,
but it wasn't,
it didn't,

34
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.020
I felt like if I would've got influenced by by,
uh,
astronomy early on,

35
00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.490
then it would've changed.

36
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.220
My trajectory would have changed the way I thought about a lot or I'd arrive to

37
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:06.850
the conclusions that I met now a lot sooner.
Yeah.
The,
the whole,

38
00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:11.080
you're getting an education thing.
What are you getting a real education?

39
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.560
Hell No,
I know it was,
it's about,
it's about a month,

40
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.170
maybe a month or three weeks after the season before you go into spring ball,

41
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.100
which is like,
you're up at five in the morning,
lifting and running,
Yada,
Yada,

42
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:27.160
Yada.
Um,
but there was like a three,

43
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.150
three week period where they leave you alone and,

44
00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:30.620
and you're just like a regular student.

45
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.520
And I did not know what to do with my time.
Like,
I'm like,
how?
How are these,

46
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.490
how are these people not ace in that class?

47
00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:38.510
It's like I didn't understand like how,

48
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.880
I mean granted they were taking tougher courses,

49
00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:43.070
but it's just like you have so much time.

50
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.170
I didn't know what to do with my time because before,

51
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.740
whereas before I'm up early in the morning,
lifting weights,
running,

52
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.430
then go into class.
Then after class get a little lunch,
then go to another class.

53
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.151
Then you come back in,

54
00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:55.700
you're in meetings and after meetings you go to practice and after practice you

55
00:02:55.701 --> 00:02:59.770
can find some kind of energy to study.
Yeah,
we'll get,
give me a,
so like you,

56
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:03.790
what time of morning would you get up?
So when you're in school usually,

57
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:05.740
usually I had it,
some of the most of it.

58
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.940
Most of my classes were at eight o'clock classes,
so,

59
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.800
so 8:00 AM you're up now is up before that.
So,
so independent on a day.

60
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:15.390
So you have to get a workout in depending on everybody's,

61
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.110
every strength coach has a different protocol.

62
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:20.260
So you have to get lift at least three times a week,
three,

63
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.640
three to two to three times a week.

64
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.690
And so you either lift before class or before practice or after practice.

65
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:29.560
So you have to,
you have to find your time after practice has got to be hard,

66
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:31.630
right?
Yeah.
To your,
yeah.
Really.

67
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:33.910
Then you're just kind of going through the motions.
So,
but do you,

68
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.270
do you want to do it before practice because then you might be tired when you're

69
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:40.510
going to practice.
He might not perform up to the best of your abilities.
I,

70
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.080
I was not the best day.
I used to get in trouble a lot cause I was like dog,

71
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.990
there's no way you guys can expect me to do all of this shit.

72
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:50.430
I used to get in trouble for skipping weeks,
uh,

73
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.270
and I wasn't big on weight to anyway.
I'm like,
I was like,
I I didn't see like,

74
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.300
cause we had a lot of Olympic weight lifting.
That's kind of changing too.

75
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.730
We had a lot of like dead lifts and squats and shit like that.

76
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:02.320
And I was never a fan of that stuff.
I was like,

77
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:06.310
this is not a conducive to being successful.

78
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.820
What do you think is plateaus?
Plateaus?
Uh,
um,
like yoga,

79
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.170
yoga would real,
yeah.
If we had like a yoga,
I'd have been there every time.

80
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:17.730
Cause it's like you're,
you're getting loose.
You're any kind of,
um,

81
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.990
you're being limber is more important than being strong in my opinion.

82
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.540
Especially in my position and my position.
I mean there's some,

83
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.620
there's some positions like the and offensive lineman where you gotta you gotta

84
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:28.970
push.
Um,
but I,
I'm not one of those pieces.

85
00:04:28.971 --> 00:04:30.670
I wasn't one of those positions being a running back.

86
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.140
It's like dbs receivers like stay limber and stay hydrated.
We're good nutrition.

87
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.150
So for you it's more important to,

88
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.800
to be flexible and to be able to move your body and like very fluid ways.

89
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.110
So to be able to avoid take downs,
they will avoid somebody trying to tackle you.

90
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.070
You,
you,
you more pliable is better in my opinion.
Yeah.
That's interesting.

91
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.830
That's an interesting way of looking at it.
So you would,
uh,

92
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:56.230
they would force you to do certain amount of lifts.
Yeah.

93
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:58.900
You got to do certain amount of lifts and then you got to go to class and you

94
00:04:58.901 --> 00:04:59.680
got to stay up.

95
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.040
And then when you're doing these lifts are they supervised or you have to do

96
00:05:02.041 --> 00:05:05.350
when you're young coaches in there.
So that's another thing that bothered me too.

97
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.633
He's like,

98
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.330
I was like a rebel man cause it's like they would follow you around the weight

99
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:13.910
room.
Right.
Cause cause some guys liked to like,
you know,
uh,

100
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.500
try to try to jerk the system and I'm like this is what I want to do with my

101
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:21.130
life.
Like I'm not going to cheat myself.
Like stop following me around.
Yeah.

102
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:23.770
It was like a weird,
and then they have class checkers that follow you.

103
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:26.290
Make sure you go to class,
class check.
And it's just like Bro,

104
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:28.180
like I just feel like a little kid,
man.

105
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:31.440
I get out of my face and stuff like after awhile that just wore on me and like

106
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.430
the whole system more.
I mean and on top of that,
like I'm hungry and I don't,

107
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.600
you know what I'm saying?
You don't got to food.
I don't,

108
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.760
people don't get on me again.
People from Tennessee hate me bro.
It's weird.

109
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.350
But I'm from Tennessee.
Why?
As I went to,
I went there and for some reason,

110
00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:45.910
anytime I say anything about the NCA,

111
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.830
they think I'm talking about tenancy itself.
It's weird.
They're like,

112
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.420
fuck you man.
Like I still have people who like to this day,
matter of fact,

113
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.440
yesterday and my mentioned stuff about,
um,

114
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.960
like fumbles I had from like 10 years ago.

115
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.250
It's weird man.
People that awkward man.
Well,

116
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:06.320
people love to bring up things that you've done wrong,

117
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.940
but I was like 18 years old being love it and love it.
It's funny man.

118
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.350
It is funny.
What are you going to know?

119
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:15.380
So you would get up in the morning and you would have to figure out when you're,

120
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.260
so would you schedule your lifts in?
Well,
it's not,

121
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.810
it's not necessarily a schedule is more like a,
um,

122
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.280
whatever suits your schedule the best.
So if you have an eight o'clock class,

123
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.960
you'd get,
you have to go before class or whenever your break is during.

124
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.380
How many classes are you doing today?
Uh,
it's probably like two or three.

125
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.470
And what you supposed to keep a certain GPA?
Yeah.
2.5.

126
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.430
So you have to keep up to point.
What does that look?
A C average or something.

127
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.790
See,
yes,
he averages.
So you would,
you go to your class,

128
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.080
you do whatever you gotta do.
And then how many times a day are you practicing?

129
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.900
A once a day.
Once a day.
You have meetings,

130
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.900
meetings are like an hour 30 and the meetings are essential.

131
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:58.100
They're going over strategy and go,
yeah,
you get your playbook,
your game plan,
um,

132
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.010
watch film on the other team or yourself.

133
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.220
Is it hard to motivate yourself watching all that shit?
Yeah,

134
00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:07.190
after a while for me,
cause I,
I'm a,
quarterbacks are different.

135
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.860
They don't have to,
um,
exert as much physical energy as we do.

136
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.200
And they're,
they're more on a mental game.

137
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:19.340
So they have to know the defensive games that the defensive coordinators plan.

138
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.040
Right.
So what covers day and wider,

139
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.740
what the safeties or don't have to know all of that as a running back,

140
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.690
you kind of have to know.
But,
um,
not as much.

141
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.750
You kind of just have to know where their blitzes are coming from.
Oh boy.

142
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:33.970
You with the,
with the intricacy.
But uh,
after awhile I got it.

143
00:07:33.971 --> 00:07:36.770
I didn't need to watch how much film in order me to get my assignment then I saw

144
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.750
a lot of time.
I'm just sitting there wasting time.
I was like,

145
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:40.520
you guys felt like that too.
Yeah,

146
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:43.730
I would imagine you're sitting there watching some stupid plays.

147
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.330
I always told my coaches,
especially in the league,

148
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:51.380
like you could give me my game plan like Saturday before the game and I execute

149
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:58.700
like I didn't need,
I think a lot of what they do in the NFL just reinforcement.

150
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:02.630
It's just oh,
oh.
And it's repetition,
it's repetition.
And after a while,

151
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:04.310
especially if you're a veteran,
like you don't need,

152
00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:06.100
that's why Brett Farve like when he was um,

153
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:10.060
deciding on whether to come back or not,
he was like,
I,
I would love to,
but I,

154
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.040
all that other shit.
I don't like doing all that,
the meetings and that,

155
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.490
that's what kept him back here,
man.
It really is.
It gets old.

156
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.460
It gets a super old man and you don't if,

157
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:19.980
if you know what you're doing and you will,

158
00:08:19.981 --> 00:08:23.330
when you were a well versed in your crap,
you're on,

159
00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:26.420
you don't need half of that shit.
And this is terrible for the younger cast at,

160
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:29.060
of listening to this.
Yeah,
I need it,
man.
Well,

161
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.150
something about a guy like Brett Farve too,
with all that fucking gray hair,

162
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:35.570
old grizzled,
old veteran who a it bill still wanting to do it.

163
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.740
I hated to go crazy.
Right?
Go right.
It's just crazy.

164
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:41.570
They still wanted to do it.
I mean,

165
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.120
how many times does that guy been dinged as what I'm saying?
I don't,

166
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:49.460
don't get hit a lot though.
Like I get hit enough.
Yeah,

167
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:50.590
man.
You know Jim Mcmahon.

168
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:00.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>
