WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.930
But he does his camps it in Milwaukee when we go to Duke Roufus is,

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.120
what do you think about him fighting it loose man?

3
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.600
I like loose ma.
It's great fun.
I've always liked to smile.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.470
I like him as a fighter for sure.
Yeah.
I don't know him as a person,

5
00:00:14.471 --> 00:00:18.260
but as a fighter he's fucking terrifying.
Yeah.
He's,
he's super smart.
Yeah,

6
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.400
he's really good.
He's very versatile.
He can do everything.
Yeah.

7
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.440
So that's why I think it's more of a challenge than Colby.
Yeah.

8
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.470
Because most man brings more to the table strike striking power wise power.

9
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.380
And the,

10
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.970
the Colby thing though was in terms of like a marketing fight,

11
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.780
like I felt like that was a very good fight marketing wise.

12
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.090
I think they could've had that fight to stand alone.
Yeah.
You're not,

13
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.410
I don't wonder why they didn't do that.
They got I think,
but you know,

14
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.830
rather than,
it could have had that by standalone.

15
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.360
They didn't need John Jones and Anthony Smith.
I think Colby talks a lot of shit.

16
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.870
Other than that,
he doesn't just talk shit when the cameras are on.

17
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.400
I bet he talk shit all the time.

18
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.510
Like we had Kobe and camp sometimes.

19
00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:04.810
And like I remember when he first started fighting and we was always cordial,

20
00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:06.750
but now,
you know what I'm saying?
Like I don't even talk to him.
He,

21
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.260
he goes his way in a gym.
We pass each other just as awkward.

22
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.060
Yeah.
You know,
it's like he's talking about my homeboy,
right.
Tiring.

23
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.290
Danny's dog and I'm out.
Yeah.
You know,
and,

24
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.270
but you also know that he's gone to do that.

25
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.270
I knew it was going to get the fight.
I'll say this too.

26
00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:26.650
Like even though I know that I'm still like happy for him,
I'm happy.

27
00:01:26.651 --> 00:01:28.710
Did he was able to get to success.
He's gotten,

28
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.510
whether it was from talking or not,
he's still wanting to fights.

29
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.950
He's still beat dos Anjos yes.

30
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.690
Any beat those angels convincingly [inaudible] Josiah.
Yes.
So he's still one,

31
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.010
he talked a lot and I'm happy for him,
but if,
but I was just hoping that,

32
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.360
you know,
it's time to face the music.
Yeah.
You deserved his ass woman.
Well,

33
00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:49.800
I think the UFC offered him Ooh,
smart.

34
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.040
And I think he said No.
I see.

35
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.120
I think he said he wants to fight Tyron and they'll like,

36
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.220
you're not in any position to the side.

37
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.140
And even though they had promised him a shot at the title before,
Ben Her said,

38
00:02:02.141 --> 00:02:03.430
did you believe Dana white

39
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.960
ask you tweeted to him and he's to,
I love Ben.

40
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.410
He's the most ruthless when it comes to Twitter.
Yeah.

41
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.680
He's the most ruthless.

42
00:02:14.681 --> 00:02:18.980
He's so honest in a hilarious to check you check under your skirt,
man.

43
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.830
Ben,
I'll get ya.
Ah,
it's a great fight though.
Oops.
Monetize.

44
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.050
And I'm not mad at the fight.

45
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.710
I do kind of wish that Colby was getting a shot because I want to see that fight

46
00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:33.010
and I don't know if I will ever see that fight.
Tyron,
he's mad.

47
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.880
He doesn't like Colby.
Yeah,
he's,
he doesn't like them.
The three.
Yeah.

48
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.560
An angry Tyron is a scary human being.
Yeah.

49
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.460
He might be the fastest,
hardest hitting 170 pounds of that's ever lived.
Yeah.

50
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.090
Who the fuck is faster than Tyron?
Who the fuck hits harder?

51
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.590
You look at his fights with Wonderboy.

52
00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:54.100
Wonderboy recognizes one of the greatest strikers in the sport ever.

53
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.500
The only person who got hurt and those fights was Wonderboy.
The same with,

54
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:02.740
with Darren,
till Darren tills a motherfucker on the feet.

55
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.210
Tyrant shut that shit up quick.
Blam one big right hand drop.

56
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:10.420
Some beats the fuck out of him.
Chokes the shit out of him.
Well,
here's the thing,

57
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.020
man,
is it,
you know it's coming to Yup.

58
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.840
Like every like you just can't prepare for it.
Yeah.
It's so fast.
Yeah.

59
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.760
You know it's coming.
You're like,
here it comes.
Here it comes.
Oh,
there it is.

60
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.590
Well,
you got to engage.

61
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.160
And the thing about Tyron too is he's intelligent and patient.
Yeah.

62
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.650
And he'll just,
he'll just hang around on the outside.

63
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:28.880
He'll hang around the house.
Like,
come on.
Yeah.
No,
you want to do this?

64
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.600
Make a mistake.
Make a mistake.
A mistake.
The Wonderboy fights,

65
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.310
like people were saying,
all of these fights are boring.

66
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.590
You have to fight Wonderboy that way.
Yeah.
How else do you fight them?

67
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:40.720
There's not another way to fight him because it's like one under the way you're

68
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:44.350
going to lose.
Yeah.
This is the way to find them.
You have to fight that way.

69
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.910
If you don't fight that way,

70
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.060
you get fucked up if you fight the way you know fucking Jake Ellenberger yeah,

71
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.620
yeah.
You can wheel kicked in the head.
Yeah.
You fight the way.
Um,

72
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.990
Hendrick's fondom yeah.
Fuck you.
Fuck you fucked up.
Yeah.

73
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:01.510
You got to fight that way.
You've got to stay on the outside.

74
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.090
You can't give into those faints and he's going to hit you with them.

75
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:06.970
Little pity pats and tips and taps.
Cause he's,

76
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.380
he's trying to tag you and touch you for the big ones coming in.
Yeah.
And he's,

77
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:15.970
he's,
he's elusive and he's clever and he's a lot quicker than you think.

78
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.470
He also bends at the waist like a God damn.
Kobe Woo Woo.
Yeah.

79
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:24.130
He's very good at bending at the waist and then coming back with punches.

80
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.670
He's a dangerous fighter and Woodley fought him the perfect way and he did it

81
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:31.860
twice and people are like,
oh,
that's boring.
But that's Wonderboy.
That's what

82
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.420
be exciting.
And you get fucked up or you fight in a cautious,

83
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.400
intelligent way and the fans,
boo.
See,
I don't see Joe.

84
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.980
I got you all wrong.
How so?
I thought you hated Tyra.
Why would I hate talking?

85
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.960
I don't know.
You know what I'm saying?

86
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:51.010
Because like everybody kind of always had higher and thinks everybody hates
time.

87
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.280
Yeah.
Maybe we talk now.
We never told them listen to the shit.

88
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:56.230
I'm talking about time and it's all positive.

89
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.570
We've never actually talked about it,
but,
um,

90
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.890
but it just seems like everybody wants to jump on him no matter what.
No,
not me.

91
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.080
No.
I,
I think he's,
if he's not the greatest welterweight of all time,

92
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.250
he's in the running.
