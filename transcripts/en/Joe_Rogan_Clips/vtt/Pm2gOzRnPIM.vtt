00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.250
Hello Freak bitches.
It's like a joke that you do that fall short.

2
00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:09.520
Like here's a perfect example,
Bill Maher's joke.
Did you hear what he said?
Yeah,

3
00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:14.360
yeah,
yeah.
So if people haven't heard the senator from Nebraska,
who was it?

4
00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:19.361
A senator got damn fucking voice among the senator from Nebraska,

5
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:23.040
I believe.
Uh,
said you should come visit,

6
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:27.060
we could have you work in the fields and bill threw his hands up and go,
not me,

7
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:31.290
I'm a house nigger.
That's what he said.
And everybody was like,
what the fuck?

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.290
Like what makes you think you can say that?

9
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.090
And when he did a HBO released a statement,

10
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:42.810
they were pissed off and there was a fire Bill Maher,

11
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.890
Twitter Hashtag thing going on.
That one.
Don't you think to me,

12
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:50.160
isn't it a little more,
at least I understand the intent of his joke.
Yeah.

13
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:53.750
He was trying to be naughty.
Yeah.
He made a mistake.
Look,
Pete,
here's,

14
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.670
here's the thing.
He's working on a show.
Okay.

15
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.180
He's working on a very important show for HBO.

16
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.960
That is a very high profile show.
This is extreme amount of pressure,

17
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.350
extreme amount of demands.
There's a lot going on behind the scenes.

18
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.000
He's probably working very hard.

19
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.800
He's probably tired and he's in the middle of this interview and he's trying to

20
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:16.740
make something entertainment.
The guy gives him an opportunity,
right?

21
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.890
The guy says you could work in the fields and he's thinking work in the fields.

22
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.350
We're going to work with the hills.
Uh,
know who works in the fields.

23
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.560
Slaves work in the fields,
or who's the guy that's in the house?
Okay,

24
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:27.660
I'm going to say this.
And they just goes with it.

25
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.530
They try to be shocking because he's,
you know,
he tries to be that naughty,

26
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:33.810
edgy guy and it just was,

27
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.610
it was lame and it wasn't funny.
Yeah.
I get more patient when I watch,

28
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.410
when I see his shows,
he seems like he's,
when he makes a joke and they don't,

29
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.420
he gets mad when they don't fucking laugh.

30
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:49.380
That's the part that bothered me and he's a silly boy.
But when,
when he,

31
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.610
when he made a joke and it was lame,
he was just trying to be funny,

32
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.890
like he was trying to entertain people.
It's important to him.

33
00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:58.710
His show's important to him.
It's a very good show.

34
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.760
He works hard at it and most of the jokes are really funny and there's a lot of

35
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:06.780
edgy,
controversial jokes on Bill Maher's show that are really funny.

36
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.750
And he,
that's the line he pushes in.

37
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:13.920
Sometimes you cross that line and he crossed that line.
Is he racist?
Fuck No.

38
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.020
Is he a bad guy?
No idiot.
No fucking mistake.

39
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:19.920
He's a human being.

40
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.220
It wasn't like the n word slipped out talking derogatory about,
you know,

41
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.300
he was trying to an exact point about slavery.
He was just trying to be silly.

42
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.240
He was trying to be funny.
He was like,
he's not like being,
remember when dog,

43
00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:34.760
the bounty hunter got caught dropping a bunch of n bombs.
But people,
there's,

44
00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:39.160
there's a way.
Look,
there's no words that are forbidden and the idea that the,

45
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.010
that's that word exists in countless rap songs,

46
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.450
but you can't sing along to those rap songs and you're ransom.
Walmart.

47
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.840
It's ridiculous.
I think those rap songs are banned from Walmart too though.

48
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.530
You and I found out recently,
which is those,
um,

49
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.380
there's Walmart versions of all those items.
I didn't know that.
Oh,
well they,

50
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.450
they take out the cuss words.
Yes.
I fucking ordered a,

51
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.190
an iTunes once,
a copy of a,
one of the dead,
not dead presidents.

52
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.053
Um,

53
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.540
<v 1>who the fuck was it?</v>

54
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.150
<v 0>It's one of those like hardcore rap bands.
And uh,
as I was listening to it,</v>

55
00:03:17.151 --> 00:03:20.890
it was all this like backwards shit.
Yeah,
no,
like bleeped out or like,

56
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.740
it was like empty spots where there was the,

57
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.940
<v 1>I don't,
I,
I downloaded a m and m album and I'll,</v>

58
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.390
I heard all these backwards sounds.
I thought I was like,
you know,

59
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.870
there's the old sergeant pepper shit.

60
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.210
I guess they took it all the bad words and just play them backwards.

61
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.360
<v 0>Even worse.
I listened to one from gangstarr and they had alternative words,</v>

62
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.890
alternative words,
and I was like,
oh no,
you can't alternate words.
Not,

63
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:46.170
my thing is getting I out though.
Hip Hop guys.

64
00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:48.510
And why don't you just all those like Jay z or some big,
I go,
fuck this,

65
00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:50.760
we ain't doing this anymore.
I think they're not doing any more,

66
00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:53.550
but the reason why they do this for money,
there's so much money out there.

67
00:03:53.551 --> 00:03:56.880
I mean,
if they can get their shit played on radio and get the more,

68
00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.630
it's all about exposure.
I mean,
you know,
it's all about the,

69
00:03:59.631 --> 00:04:01.920
the most amount of people that you can reach with your stuff.

70
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.560
<v 1>Yeah.
Well I,
they asked me to do a clean version.
I said no,
good for you.
But my,</v>

71
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.790
my um,
my morals definitely cost is going to cost me a lot of fun.

72
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.230
<v 0>Okay.
Nah,
I don't think so.</v>

73
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.530
I think in the long run it'll save you money because it'll,

74
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.810
it'll elongate your career.

75
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.260
Cause if someone's a fan of yours and they're at a barbecue and someone pulls

76
00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:25.650
out the lame version,
like,
oh,
you got to hear this guy,
he's fucking hilarious.

77
00:04:25.651 --> 00:04:29.310
This guy's crazy.
And then it's like,
F you B itch.

78
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.850
Fub you broke my heart,
screw you girl.
Or you know,
whatever it is.

79
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.230
Well remember when cee Lo Green had that?
Forget you.
No,

80
00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:44.850
no,
no,
no,
no.
Soft.
Forget you.
It's fuck you.
And why the floods?
The song again.

81
00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:47.520
Why can't you say fuck you on the radio to the nineties?
I mean,
I know why,

82
00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:48.780
but yeah,
it's like,

83
00:04:48.781 --> 00:04:53.781
it's stupid because a long time ago people were dumb and they thought that the

84
00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:56.520
son was 17 miles away and they saw it.

85
00:04:56.521 --> 00:04:58.580
There was an old man living in the clouds that was,

86
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.360
had friends that used harps and that,
uh,
you gotta be careful with words.

87
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.890
You are clinging onto the,
I mean,
it's the same thing and like,

88
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.740
<v 1>you know,
TV and radio,
they're like,
there's still like,
but like,</v>

89
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.870
dude,
he's like,
there's a,
there's youtube.
Like,
you know,
we did it,
it,
we,
we,
we,

90
00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:18.230
we premiered another video from this record again.
We did the pornhub premiere,

91
00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:21.260
you know,
like,
fuck this,
let's reach the people fuck up.

92
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.050
<v 0>Yeah.
You premiered on porn hub,
which is hilarious.
How did that come about?</v>

93
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.910
<v 1>Um,
I reached,
I,
uh,
what happened was my,
my people were just kind of like,</v>

94
00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:32.760
you know,
like,
let's find a place to premier.
You know,

95
00:05:32.761 --> 00:05:35.130
they always do this thing where like you can premiere a video on like,

96
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.970
I don't know,
will it be an example like a v club or some shit,
you know,
and,

97
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.410
and we're rolling stone or something.
I go,

98
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:43.260
give me those numbers if you know it's like so and so gets 50,000 when I go,

99
00:05:43.261 --> 00:05:47.160
what about look up porn hub's numbers.
It was like 200 something million.

100
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.443
I think one of the,

101
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.900
I think we're rolling stone was something like the 8000th or something.

102
00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:55.370
Biggest website.
And I go check out what porn hub is in porn.

103
00:05:55.371 --> 00:05:59.000
I was like number 19 in the world.
And I go,
well I'll go,
I'll go,

104
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:02.010
let's just reach out to them and see if they'll premiere will be the first guy

105
00:06:02.011 --> 00:06:03.740
to premiere country music video on porn hub.

106
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.570
The problem is when people go to porn hub,

107
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.140
they're sweaty and nervous and they're just thinking about beaten off.

108
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.140
Well to get in the wrong mindset.
Well I think it,

109
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.580
I think after you beat off your,

110
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.130
you ready to fucking chill out and listen to some good country.
Yeah.

111
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.980
But you're also ready to hide what website you were watching.

112
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.710
I don't know about your browser in a race and your history.

113
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.990
It fucking worked man.
I mean I've seen,
I saw a lot of people,
you know,
like uh,

114
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.930
I don't know how many people I can tell you that came up to me like I first

115
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.580
heard about you because they don't want to admit it,
you know?

116
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.880
But the numbers show that people fucking,

117
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:38.270
so it was crazy cause we premiered it on pornhub and they were like,

118
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.810
it was almost like,
you know,
if you guys do this for me,
I'll show that you know,

119
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.670
it works and sell.
You can sell things besides fucking boner pills,
you know?

120
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.940
Right.
Well it's also,
it's one of the things that if you did it,

121
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.960
just knowing that you did it,
people would go there to check it out.
Like he's,

122
00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:57.950
he's premiere to shit on pornhub.
Exactly.
You go there to check it out.

123
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.300
And it's funny cause I,
if we put it up at like noon or something,
I was like,

124
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.540
I thought it was like hundreds of millions.
I think the views aren't that high.

125
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:06.374
And someone there was like,

126
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.870
wait til five o'clock when people get off work and stop beating off.
Yeah.

127
00:07:09.871 --> 00:07:12.890
It was like at five o'clock the numbers fucking just shot through the roof.

128
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.300
It's like once that fucking work bell rang,
it's like they were fucking,
yeah.

129
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.560
People get in trouble for beating off at work.
Right.
You can get fired.
Yeah.

130
00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:23.220
It's a bummer.
I wish there was like a section,

131
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.930
there is no country music section of porn hub.
Yeah.

132
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.870
You think there would be due to just be the Wheeler Walker section?
Yeah.

133
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.850
Right now I gotta figure out how to,
because I set up my own channel to,
um,

134
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.300
to promote that video and I've got to figure out how to turn it off.

135
00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:41.030
