1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.990
He could also fight at 85 I think Tyron has legitimate potential to be a three

2
00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:07.500
division champions.
He should start Isas stuck on rally and for that,

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.200
for that 65 pound weight class,
nobody listens to me anymore.

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:11.641
If they listened to me,

5
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:15.170
Melvin Manhoef would've been in the UFC back in 2002 yeah,

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.590
they listen to me sometimes.

7
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:20.160
I think they listened to me with Ben Aspirin online on record,

8
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.980
and I'm gonna say I'm a big reason why Ben asked her and gotten the UFC.

9
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.990
I brokered a meeting between him and Dana White.
Okay,
dude.
I put it together.

10
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.260
I called Dana.
I said,
look,
he's a good guy,
man.
He's talking shit.

11
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:34.740
But everybody talks shit like,
come on.
I'm like the guys undefeated.

12
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.340
And he's like,
uh.
He was like,
when Andy wants to go to sleep,
it takes Ben ask him

13
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.140
and I'm like,
it's fighting.
See,

14
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:47.630
the thing about fighting is it's not a matter of what is like the,

15
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.400
what's exciting to watch for a person like you?

16
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.730
A person like me who's like sitting down,
how is this going to play out?

17
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.360
What's gonna work?
What's gonna work?
What works?
Yeah,
I get that.
Yeah.

18
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.370
I want to see what works.
When,

19
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.480
when I see a guy like Ben asked and I want to see what works.
Wow.

20
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:07.500
He's a three to one favorite over Robbie Lawler.
Holy Shit.
That's crazy.

21
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.780
They just had another fight to this card.
Listen man,

22
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:14.160
you can't sleep on Robbie fucking law.
Well,

23
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.450
don't sleep on Robbie Lawler.
That's crazy.
That's crazy.

24
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:22.290
Three to one they didn't.
One is horrible.
Blue Robbie Lawler can wrestler.

25
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.580
Robbie Lawler has been shutting people's lights out since the fucking early two

26
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:30.360
thousands decent bet.
Then it's a fucking very good.
I would take,
I mean,

27
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:34.540
I would take the Robbie's all the,
it's,
it's actually three to one.
Yeah.

28
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.690
A hundred to make 300 if law,
it's t plus two 30 so you'd wait.
Oh,
oh,

29
00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:43.470
he's a three to one.
So you'd have to win the bet three to win one on aspirin,

30
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.500
correct?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'd take that bad.
It's a good bet.

31
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:51.390
But I'd like aspirins chances because I think that wrestling is just on another

32
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:54.840
level.
Yeah.
That's the fight.
Here's the fight,

33
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.770
one 65 Khabib,
Ben ass grin.

34
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.510
Whoo.
I guess bank,

35
00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:07.511
it makes 6500% he can make 6500% a hundred percent he wants to make 65 cause

36
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:09.990
he's good friends with Tyron and he's like,

37
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.620
I'll be the 65 pound champ tire and be the 70 or 75 whatever they decide to go

38
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:16.300
with.
That's,
that's the fight man.
Could be.

39
00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:19.200
Versus Ben Aspirin because I'm telling you man,
Ben Aspirin,

40
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.030
they just put his face on the,

41
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.000
on the camera the other day while he was in the crowd and the audience went

42
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:27.990
crazy.
He doesn't even fought in the UFC and they love him.
Yeah.

43
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.600
Fight real fight fans.
Know who that they know who he is now.

44
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.590
They know who he is now.
It's like he's been building momentum.
The hardcore fans.

45
00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:35.131
Absolutely.

46
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:39.690
You're excited that finally this undefeated phenol phenom of a wrestler is

47
00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:44.490
fighting in the UFC?
Yeah,
I would.
Yeah.
I would pay money to lodge him.

48
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.100
Fuck yeah,
for sure.
A lot of money.

49
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.770
I'll fly to Russia for that fight.
You think that's where they'd have it?
Fuck,

50
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:56.130
I don't know,
man.
I'm going to fly to Russia and commentate that fight.
Yeah.

51
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:58.260
And I'm going to,
as soon as I get to my hotel room,

52
00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.100
I'm going to have one of them things.
It checks for bugs.

53
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.310
Did you check for hidden cameras and

54
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.520
you got to rush him back.
What's that up like a Christmas tree?

55
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.200
It'll probably would write the whole house is a fucking bug.
Yeah,
man.

56
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:17.650
I think that's,
uh,
that's,
that's a fight that I'm very,
very excited about.
