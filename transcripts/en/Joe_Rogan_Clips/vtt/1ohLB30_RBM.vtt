WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.590
But for whatever reason,

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.070
that becomes more interesting because it's in our neighborhood.

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.670
Whereas if they find some distant star system and that it might have a planet

4
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:15.780
that's similar to Earth that doesn't seem as compelling for whatever weird

5
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:17.280
reason.
No.
Yeah,
I mean,

6
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:22.200
I think that the planets around Alpha Centauri,
Proxima Centauri,

7
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:26.210
which is the closest stars,
it seems like there are planets around those now.
And,

8
00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:30.090
and that,
that was interesting because we could conceive of go in there.
I mean,

9
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:32.190
there was this idea,
you're Stephen Hawking actually,

10
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:36.660
and some others before he died,
had this idea called breakthrough Starshot,

11
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.350
which is the idea to send a little probe out to at the center,

12
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.640
the Alpha Centauri System.
And it,
and it,
I think in their view,

13
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.160
Yuri Milner as well,
the,
the,
you know,

14
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:49.920
the entrepreneur wanting to do that and uh,

15
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.600
is I think he said something like a hundred years travel time or something with,

16
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.050
with,
uh,
with our current technology.
And they pointed out that,
you know,

17
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.210
we don't do that now.
We don't think a hundred years in the future.

18
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.760
But if you go back when people were building cathedrals,

19
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.500
people used to routinely start projects that would take a hundred years to bear

20
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.340
fruit.
And so we could imagine going there and that's,

21
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:14.610
that then becomes fascinating I think.
Cause then you've got a solar system,

22
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.900
another solar system that you could go and visit,
conceivably.

23
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.780
Conceivably.
Yeah.

24
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:25.530
I mean what kind of speed are we talking and how long would it take to get
there?

25
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.670
Well,
yeah,
I mean,
so it is,
I think the,

26
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.600
the idea was about a hundred years to get there.

27
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.690
So it's going four light years or so in a hundred years.
So whatever that,

28
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.820
so you would have to essentially do what they didn't like the Ridley Scott Alien

29
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.840
Film and put people into some sort of a,
Oh,
you're a robot probe.

30
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.840
It wouldn't be a crude pro wouldn't be possible for a crew.

31
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.680
Well it is,
but you don't have to freeze them.
Yeah.
That's always,
you know,

32
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:52.230
whenever you talk to engineers,
you had Ilan London years.
Yes.

33
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.380
Engineers always say,
you know,
physicists go,
well,
it's possible in principle.

34
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:59.450
So over to you,
you know,
you do it now,
there are no laws of physics.

35
00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:02.130
It tells me you can't do it.
So we just do it.
But you know,

36
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.410
that's a weird relationships on the physics.
Physicists and engineers.
Yeah,
yeah,

37
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.880
yeah.
But,
but yeah,
in principle you're right.

38
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.890
If you can send a little robots facial there,
you can send a accrued spaceship.

39
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.210
I am of the opinion as time goes on and augmented and virtual reality gets

40
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:23.601
better and better that it doesn't really totally make sense unless we're talking

41
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:28.080
about colonizing someplace to send biological life to another planet.

42
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.250
If we can send some probe that doesn't have to worry about the,
you know,

43
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:37.140
the biology being affected by radiation or by the speed of travel or even buy

44
00:02:37.141 --> 00:02:37.920
food,

45
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.920
we can send something out there and almost be there by virtue of,

46
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.180
you know,
goggles,
virtual reality goggles or something else.
Yeah.

47
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.350
You hear that in science at the moment.
Space Science,

48
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:55.680
we have this debate a lot actually because of course,
um,
space probes,

49
00:02:55.681 --> 00:03:00.681
like curiosity that some Mars at the moment that's really cheap compared to

50
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:01.990
sending people to Mars.

51
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.280
And so quite often the scientists who wants to find out about the world's,

52
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:09.550
we'll say,
well,
we should spend it on robots.
We shouldn't spend it on people.

53
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.050
I think crudes face expiration is in,
in some ways,

54
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.130
I mean it's clearly true at the moment that humans can do more than robots.

55
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.370
So we can explore the place better for now.
Yeah.

56
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.240
But I think it has to be,
it's about something else.

57
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.150
I mean it's about it and he's not only,

58
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.620
it's about living and working off the planet,

59
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.890
which I think is quite persuasive argument.
Actually.
We've,

60
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:38.650
we've already industrialized near Earth orbit,

61
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.410
so it's already a multibillion dollar industry now.

62
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:44.770
He communication satellites and weather satellites,
gps,
whatever you,

63
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.790
we're already up there.

64
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And so learning to live and work in space is I think a natural extension of our,

65
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.630
of our civilization.
Plus the fact that he taught.
So we,
Elon or Jeff basis,

66
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.230
they point out that the,

67
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.840
the amount of resources available just slightly above our heads is vast.

68
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.640
And so I remember I talked to Jeff Hayes,
US actually once,
and he,

69
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.880
he thinks really simply and he said,
you know,
for example,
in the asteroid belt,

70
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.070
there's enough metal,
I think to build a skyscraper psych.

71
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.640
What is it a something like 800 stories tall and cover the earth in it,
right?

72
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.950
If you want.
Now we don't want to dig that.

73
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.390
But his point was that the energy from the sun is all up there.

74
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:26.650
The results are up there.

75
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.390
So you could almost imagine trying to zone the earth residential at some point

76
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:35.200
in the future to protect the planets and do your heavy industry off the planet,

77
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.800
for example.
And these sound,
it sounds like science fiction,

78
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.100
except that now space x and blue origin,

79
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:43.960
those people have got reusable rockets.

80
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.340
So suddenly the economics become sensible.
So I think it,
I think,

81
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.590
I think expansion is good and I think we will expand and I think we will expand

82
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:57.370
outwards because there's not much room left on this planet to expand.

83
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.870
So I think we'll do so.
But he said that's a whole different idea.
It's,

84
00:05:00.871 --> 00:05:05.770
it's not about gathering scientific information,
it's about a frontier and,

85
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:10.390
and all the benefits that come from operating as a civilization on the frontier,

86
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.960
which we've,
I've lost on the earth because there is no frontier left.

87
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.550
And so I like that idea that March and when you talk about Mars,

88
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:23.030
especially with Elan need right,
that that's the only place you can go.
So there,

89
00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:26.710
there is no other planet we can go to other than miles that you can't go to

90
00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:29.290
[inaudible] Saturn,
you can't go to mercury or Venus.

91
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.620
So if we want to go somewhere and expand our civilization,

92
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:36.100
it has to be Mars and everything's there that you need.
So with that,

93
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:38.980
that's a different thing saying you want to find out stuff,
you're right.

94
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:42.010
If we just want to find out stuff,
then you send robots.

95
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.300
But as far as expanding actual civilization and bring it to another place,

96
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.270
one of the things that freaked me out as people get depressed about living in

97
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:53.650
Seattle,
I mean you,
you're going to live on Mars.
I wouldn't,

98
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.450
I agree with you.
It's not renders thing is it's like the,

99
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.820
it been like the western front.
Yes.
Difference here when people cross the states.

100
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.200
Yeah.

101
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.590
Incredibly dangerous thing to do that when people cross the stage they still got

102
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:10.550
to Wyoming and beautiful places and Colorado and yeah,

103
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.880
but it was hard.
Yeah.
I wouldn't want it to do it.
But once you got there,

104
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:16.160
there's a river and this trout in the river and the,

105
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.240
the metals are green and mean.
I,
I agree with you,
right?

106
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:23.780
I mean I'm not going to go to that.
So there are vineyards and hotels and things,

107
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:24.800
but however

108
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.270
it is true that there are people he liked the challenge.

109
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.650
And what is true about Mars,

110
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.280
it's interesting actually because we know something about the history of miles

111
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:34.461
now,

112
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:38.690
quite a lot about the history of Mars and it's certainly clear that there was

113
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:42.810
water almost certainly oceans and rivers.
So,

114
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.200
and that water is almost certainly still there.

115
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.060
So I would say certainly still down where they have found large quantities of

116
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:52.460
ice now,
right?
Yeah.
So there's certainly ice,

117
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.760
the May even be pockets of liquid water below the surface somewhere.

118
00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.680
So couple that with all the minerals and the resources that we know are there

119
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.480
and you have everything you need.

120
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.340
So that's the thing about Marcy's is quite nice relative to everywhere else

121
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:12.140
other than the earth.
You can't go to Venus,
you just melt.
It's what is it,

122
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.340
400 and something degrees and a 90 atmospheric pressure as I said,

123
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.430
so,
so,
so Mars is quite nice.
Um,
but I wouldn't go there.

124
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:25.820
I agree with you because it was not gravity of Mars in relationship to third it

125
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.370
says,
what is it about a third,
I think third event,
right?
Yeah.

126
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:32.110
Something like that.
So it would still have a significant like weakening effect.

127
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.450
Like if you went to Mars and then somehow or another in the future that they

128
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:38.360
were able to get back to earth.
Yeah.
Your body would have a,

129
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.210
a real problem with that,
right?
It would.
But there,
there is,

130
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.790
there is still grabbed me.
It's a bit more than a third.
I can't quite remember.

131
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:47.420
But it's something like that.
But yeah,
so you,
there's still gravity.

132
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.650
So there's gravity,

133
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.630
there's some protection from the that you'd probably want to live in the caves

134
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.680
actually or something like that.
Cause the,
there's no magnetic field there.

135
00:07:57.681 --> 00:08:00.530
So it's quite high radiation environment,
but not too bad.

136
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.510
I think it's further from the sun than we are.

137
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.640
It's not to the replaces our mouths.
There's a very deep critical Hallus,

138
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.420
which is a big impact basin.
And at the bottom,
the,

139
00:08:11.421 --> 00:08:14.450
it's so deep you could fit Everest in it.

140
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:18.860
So you put Mount Everest in the summit of Everest wouldn't reach the rim of the

141
00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:21.710
crater.
So it says something like,
I don't know what it is,

142
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:23.770
seven miles deep or some one six miles deep.

143
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.410
So you could go there and at the bottom the,

144
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.620
the atmospheric pressure is so high that you could just about have liquid water

145
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:35.360
on occasionally on the floor of that crater.
And it's quite warm.

146
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.300
Sometimes it can be 20 degrees.
Really?
Yeah,
that Celsius.
Um,

147
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.700
wow.
So,
so better than Keto right now.

148
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.530
Exactly the same as experiencing a serious coffee.
It's right.
Yeah.

149
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.640
So it can be warmer than Minnesota.
And,
uh,
so,

150
00:08:48.641 --> 00:08:53.200
so there are places where it's not horrendous on Mars.

151
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.080
Uh,
you know,
so the Martian is kind of really stick in that sense.
