WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.710
Mean it and I mean,
look at,
uh,
Gabby Giffords in Arizona.
I mean,
I,

2
00:00:03.711 --> 00:00:06.060
I'm don't believe in voting,
but she had this tweet about like a,

3
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:09.240
she went and voted and I couldn't think of a better pro voting argument that she

4
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:13.890
kind of was like,
look,
you know,
you don't believe in voting.
Voting.
Yeah.
Um,

5
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:16.770
what does that mean?
I don't believe in voting.
What do you mean?

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.510
I don't think I don't do it.
I don't,

7
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.980
I'd never wrote an article about it for the Guardian.
Uh,

8
00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:25.200
I just don't think it's legitimate voting democracy in Wa in any way.

9
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.440
Like the idea that I flick a switch and someone gets to talk to me for four

10
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:30.570
years,
talk for me for four years doesn't make any sense.

11
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.880
What do you think the alternative should be?
Freedom.

12
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.670
If I want to someone to speak for me,
I'll hire them.

13
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.860
And the idea that me and my neighbors have to be locked into some policy because

14
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:42.420
we're geographically close to each other.

15
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:45.420
His landline technology in a post cell phone world.

16
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.510
So how do you think things should be run PR you organize based on how,

17
00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:54.240
who you want to align with on any given,
uh,
contexts.

18
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:57.390
Like I'm aligned with Macy's when it comes to my clothes and I'm aligned with

19
00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:58.590
you when it comes to talking.

20
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.930
You don't have to have one guy speak for you for abortion and for,
uh,

21
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.990
the borders and for taxes.
I mean,
I don't believe in any of that stuff.

22
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:11.610
This is very old,
old model.
I agree that it's a very old model.

23
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:13.980
But the problem is we don't have any other one.

24
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.970
Sure we do because nine one or the other one,

25
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.760
99% of our interactions are voluntary and you come together with people as you

26
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:23.520
need to and then you go your separate ways and it's very,
very dynamic.

27
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.420
So this idea that you're stuck with this person because a lot of people like him

28
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:30.690
for four years and they speak for you,
it makes no sense to me.

29
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.950
It does not make sense,

30
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:36.060
but it's also we feel like we need some sort of a representation of us.

31
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.240
If you're going to have some sort of a summit with a guy like Putin,
sure.

32
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.270
Or someone Kim Jong Moon or whatever it is,
whoever it is,

33
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.910
someone needs to speak for us.
Sure.
Right,

34
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.740
and I mean in the sense that is a reaction,

35
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.640
but the point is I don't think vast majority of people in this country are not

36
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:52.560
have asked.
A lot of people say,
Trump's not my president.

37
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:55.350
He doesn't speak for me and they have a right to say that.

38
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.750
And the idea that just because someone was a contest,

39
00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:59.280
therefore he's the boss of me.

40
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.710
What do you think about voting when it comes to legitimate concerns?

41
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:06.030
Like raising the speed limit,
reducing taxes,
doing this,
doing that,

42
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:10.470
like fixing roads,
like certain things that we need to get done.

43
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.900
I don't,
I don't do it.

44
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.010
I mean that makes more sense to me because it's a direct representation,

45
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:19.590
but even that shouldn't be up to majority rule.
I mean,

46
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:23.610
people who understand the dynamics of speed limits and cars should have informed

47
00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:28.260
say rather than,
right.
But then there's influenced by the insurance companies,

48
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:32.490
and this is why low rates,
this is why things changed.
But she got lost.

49
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.880
But insurance companies are the ones who have the campaigns to force people to

50
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:38.040
vote one way or another.
It's going to be one,
right?

51
00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:41.790
One side's gonna have much more like,
like marijuana laws,
you know,
and all these,

52
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:44.910
the tobacco and alcohol companies trying to make sure that marijuana is not

53
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:46.770
legal.
Uh,
and all these,

54
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.680
this propaganda that you have because they don't want competitors when you

55
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:53.400
rather have people be high than drunk.
Like if dad's coming home from work,

56
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.370
I'd rather he had a joint than a six pack.
I mean,
and yet historically,

57
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.940
just because alcohol has been popular,
that's what's legal.
It makes no sense.
No,

58
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.190
that doesn't mean drunk driving versus driving stoned.

59
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.470
Having one guy's going to slow the other ones.

60
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:09.760
You know what one's going to probably paranoid too,
and checking on every mirror.

61
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.590
Checking
cool.
Drive slower,
slow down Cuba together,

62
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.520
writing the lines,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't,

63
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.670
I don't think that the system that we have now is great,

64
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.410
but to just not participate at all.
Well,
I do participate.
Obviously,

65
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:29.140
if I'm a public figure and I'm talking right,
he's participating.

66
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.310
So just discourse yet to some extent.
Yeah.
I mean,

67
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:36.070
I don't think the idea that you're flicking a switch means you're actually

68
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:38.500
making a difference.
I think eight,
you're doing something in secret.

69
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.500
Once every four years,
you're not actually participating.

70
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:43.060
That's something people like to tell themselves.

71
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:45.130
It's like getting a communion wafer.
