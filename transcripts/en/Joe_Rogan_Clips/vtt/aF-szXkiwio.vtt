00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.650
The tech guys are going to read your fucking mine.
Yeah,
you,

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.580
you shouldn't buy it because they don't update them very well by devices.
I mean,

3
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.130
why?
So?
Yeah,
I'm sure.
I mean,
okay.

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.460
I talk about something and I don't type it in.
I don't write a message.

5
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:17.820
I don't write an email and I'll see an ad.
So it's fine on us all the time.

6
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:20.070
That doesn't happen to you.
I,
it hasn't happened to me,

7
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:23.200
but it's happened to enough people that I believe you.
It's insane.
I believe.

8
00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:23.640
You know what?

9
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.180
No matter what really crazy talk to so many people that have had that happen.

10
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.330
Somebody sent me a tweet yesterday that said they were listening to a podcast

11
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.630
that we were doing.

12
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:37.620
We were talking about something and then that something appeared in their Google

13
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:40.950
ads and he's like,
I never looked up this.
I never,
and oh no.

14
00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:44.400
It wasn't a Google ad.
It was a youtube search.
It was a youtube suggested.

15
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.670
He's like my fucking computers listening.
Yup.
Don Pewter.

16
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.110
And what APP is doing this?

17
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:51.910
I mean I'm about to just go to a flip phone because I don't want to,
it's,

18
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:52.591
it's bullshit.

19
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:56.520
We know that youtube audio is being listened to because they're mining it to for

20
00:00:56.521 --> 00:01:01.050
ad ad stuff already.
It's not even real.
It's not a spy thing that's out there.

21
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:05.520
That's how they do it.
Right,
but is that if you're playing things?
Yeah,

22
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.880
so when we're playing,
so if he's playing a podcast on Youtube,

23
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:12.550
youtube listening to that and that's how they suggest it's just happening in
ads.

24
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.650
What I think might be happening with people are noticing now is not just that

25
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.130
it's happening within the software.
It's that your actual device,

26
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.400
the microphone is on and the Laptop camera is on.

27
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.000
So people will block the camera with tape.
They're not blocking the microphone.

28
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:28.680
Exactly.
How the hell do you block the microphone?

29
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:30.230
You don't even know where it is.
How do I,

30
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.890
could we have like some sort of tutorial about like how we can prevent all of

31
00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:37.770
our shit from being collected?
Like that whole,
the Facebook,

32
00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:38.880
Cambridge Analytica thing.

33
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.820
I feel like everyone missed the boat of what that story was.

34
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:43.170
You heard about that,
right?
The Cambridge Analytica,

35
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.870
they're data mining all your shit.
It's like,
yeah,
if you're on Facebook,

36
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:48.300
everything's being taken in data mind that's very obvious.

37
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.520
But what wasn't really investigated,

38
00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:54.060
I think channel four did this crazy investigation where they pretended like they

39
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:59.061
were a patron trying to hire Cambridge Analytica is and billionaire dude and

40
00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:02.760
they put them on camera.
It's all recorded.
The guys are basically like,

41
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.540
it's basically like a private intelligence from almost like a black water where

42
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:09.900
you can hire mercenaries to set up honeypots with prostitutes.

43
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.120
Takedown politicians would spy on them.

44
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:16.610
They set up shell companies with the mic six Massaad.
Um,

45
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.470
it's all just untraceable shit.
They just ghost out.

46
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:21.330
They said they can ghost in out of countries.

47
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.600
They literally said that they stage the entire Kenyan election.
They were like,

48
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:28.580
we staged the whole thing.
We wrote all the speeches.
Yeah.
Ken is gentleman.

49
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.440
This is,
this is backed by billionaire Robert Mercer.

50
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:35.580
The same guy who can behind channel four did a crazy investigation about it and

51
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:38.640
the,
and so that's why I'm just like,
why is everyone focusing on Facebook data?

52
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.020
This is like a crazy

53
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.500
stupid game that people play with is called flat farmland,

54
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.470
Farmville or something world farm.
Fuck.
What is that shit?

55
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.980
That was the thing,
Farmville.
Yeah,
that,
that's what people were talking about.
Oh,

56
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:57.010
you're going to have data
here like changing the government.

57
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.170
They're killing people and like the,
and Knights and the Breitbart people are,

58
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.810
how many other companies are there like this?
I always think,
yeah.

59
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:08.470
While we're all focused on Russian trolls,
14 Russian trolls in St Petersburg.

60
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.330
How many companies like Cambridge Analytica,
like blackwater?

61
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.250
Like all these things are operating around the world doing all this gotta be a

62
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:16.480
fuck load a lot.

63
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.210
There's gotta be a lot that we don't know of because it's only when something

64
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:23.120
fucks up or someone gets shot in the head and like,
yeah.
They're like,
well,

65
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.790
what is that?
Oh,
change the Kenyan elections.
Cool.
Like in,
we never heard of this.

66
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.410
People are talking about it.

67
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.290
There's got to be so many of those things that are just bubbling up in the

68
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.630
distance.
Disturbing men.
Disturbing.
