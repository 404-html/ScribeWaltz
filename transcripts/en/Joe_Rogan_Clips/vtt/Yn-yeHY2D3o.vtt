00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.910
The joe rogan experience.
You know there,

2
00:00:03.911 --> 00:00:07.330
there's a company that makes a rubber ring.
Yeah,
yeah.

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.270
Literally that's what I was talking about.
Yes.

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.060
I tried to put that shit on my wife.
It's pit my face.
Here's what's weird.

5
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.420
My Sharon was going to buy me that four just because I kept telling her like I'm

6
00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:21.490
worried about ripping this finger off.
Right.

7
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.180
Mainly because of my wedding ring is definitely too small.

8
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.640
So she was looking at some of those,

9
00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:32.641
a silicone rings and we were literally looking at it on her iPad in my kitchen.

10
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.680
I open Instagram and started looking,

11
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.690
it's like sponsored ad buy that ring company.

12
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.240
Uh,
isn't that what's weird?
It's very weird.

13
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:49.530
We were just talking about that.

14
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.850
We're just talking about that the other day that we stuff you and Jamie and

15
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:54.930
whoever was on the podcast,

16
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:59.931
we were talking about like having a conversation and if you have like Alexa or

17
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:05.130
if you have like certain things that like listen to you while you're talking

18
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:09.420
like maybe even possibly Siri and then all of a sudden you'll go to Google and

19
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:12.840
what you were talking about like slick trick broadheads or some shit like that

20
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.440
will show up in your Google ads.
You're like,
what in the fuck?

21
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.290
Maybe Siri.
Siri's a total fricking,
she is a peeping Tom.

22
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:26.760
He's in to face little Ho.
She,
I don't think she's too faced.
I think Shay Siri,

23
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.080
she doesn't have a single face.

24
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.930
You're a two faced bitch.
Oh,
you're not connected.
Is that a bad thing though?

25
00:01:34.931 --> 00:01:39.931
I know it's weird what I mean potentially you could view that as something like

26
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.360
I would probably want to buy that and now that it's here in an easier way for me

27
00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:47.560
to do it,
that is kind of good.
I'm just going to Amy devil's advocate.
If you say,

28
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.250
Oh my God,
I'm gonna die out here.
At that time,

29
00:01:51.251 --> 00:01:54.550
Siri can step in and say,
would you like me to call a helicopter?

30
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.160
But when you're looking at rubber rings for your wedding ring and then it shows

31
00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:04.630
up on your lap top.
Yeah.
At that point,
Jesus sellout this.

32
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.080
Let's get to the bottom of this.
Well,

33
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.250
it most certainly exists with Google because of,

34
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:15.780
I've looked at like,
what did it cheers.
I've looked at some.

35
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:20.340
You're milking it over there.
I'm all right.
Sadly,
I smoked pot though.
You didn't.

36
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.980
Oh,
you did a little sh.
Don't tell any sponsors.

37
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.210
I might've made that last part up.
This.

38
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.280
The problem is like you'll be looking at something super obscure like a,

39
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.080
like a Casio watch sound like Casio.
That's Casio.

40
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.220
<v 1>Yeah.
All right.</v>

41
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.450
<v 0>It has its good one.
I like this one.</v>

42
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:47.130
It's like a protech totally doesn't an accomplice in it totally doesn't look

43
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:51.860
like it.
It is a Casio look.
Manuel [inaudible] that shit.
Right ash,

44
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.700
but the eye,
but then all of a sudden they'll show you whatever you search for,

45
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.390
whatever it was,
whether it's surf boards,
fucking Hilda Berg tents.

46
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.200
There'll be for sale and you'll see like amazon.com ads for like what?

47
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.840
Like I was looking at Zeiss by knows the other day I read about it.

48
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.910
Yes,
actually,
yeah,
but then I read a review on them and I actually googled them,

49
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.000
but then like everywhere I went,
if I went online,

50
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.670
I would see a little Google ad for Zeiss by knows.
I'm like,

51
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:25.510
this is kind of creepy,
but that's different.
I think if you Google search it,

52
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.220
you're on the grid.
You are.

53
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.660
If you're on someone else's device in your home kitchen,

54
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.140
it's not like I was looking at it on mine.

55
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.430
I was on Sharon's Ipad then,
oh,

56
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:43.990
she was ordering me a ring on her iPad and we were talking about it.

57
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.020
Then I opened my Instagram up and here's the silicone rings as a sponsored

58
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.540
recommendation within my Instagram feed.

59
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.380
<v 2>Okay.</v>

60
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.190
<v 0>He's backing up.
You gotta back it up,
back it up.
Oh,
I want a drink of water.</v>

61
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.580
Go back to that.
Gmail is free for a reason.

62
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:09.250
These are all free services we're using and not paying for,

63
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:13.090
so you have to give up a little bit to get these cool things to give up your,

64
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.010
I get it.
Your privilege.
Here's my position,
my whole,

65
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.230
everything I think of is out there.

66
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.530
I'm a professional talker.
Every,

67
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.620
every the most fucked up ideas I've ever had have all been recorded.
