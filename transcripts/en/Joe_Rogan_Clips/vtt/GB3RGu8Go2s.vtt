00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.833
Hello

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.260
<v 1>bitches.
Now I want to switch gears a little bit.
That's not,</v>

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.240
it's not totally related,
but it is in somewhat in some ways headspace.

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.050
Um,

5
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.610
talking about mindsets and talking about like we've brought this up but really

6
00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:19.480
haven't delved into it much at all about meditation and about how much it's

7
00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:21.970
affected you and how it got you back on track.

8
00:00:21.971 --> 00:00:25.210
And I know that you're a big proponent of it and I am as well,

9
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.790
although I think I'd probably do it differently than you guys do,

10
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.730
<v 0>but I'd love to hear how,
how you do it by using an isolation tank.
Oh really?</v>

11
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:37.380
Like a sensory deprivation tank.
Yeah,
yeah.
I do a lot of yoga.
Those are,

12
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:38.610
those are two big ones for me.

13
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.350
<v 1>You know,
I think,
um,</v>

14
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.360
those alone have straightened out my brain in a great way of yoga in particular

15
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:50.100
yoga because it's,
um,
it's not yoga forces you to do it,
you know,

16
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:52.200
like if you,
you're either doing it or you're not doing it,

17
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.060
there's no room for distraction.
You know,
you're,

18
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.220
you're essentially forced to deal with what these poses require of you.

19
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.800
And I think that in,

20
00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:05.010
in doing so and having a singular focus of trying to,
uh,

21
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.580
maintain your balance and stretch and extend and do all these different things,

22
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:11.190
why you do it,
then concentrating almost entirely on your breath,

23
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:14.190
which is a big factor in yoga that it's uh,

24
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.540
it has remarkable brain scrubbing attributes.
Yeah,

25
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.430
<v 0>I would say,
and I don't know much before I say this,
let me just ask,</v>

26
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:25.410
what are you doing in the isolation tank?

27
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:28.140
Like what are you doing in your mind a lot?
Well,
you know,

28
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.170
do you use it for a bunch of different in a bunch of different ways?

29
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.010
I don't use it as much as I should honestly.
Um,
but I

30
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.140
<v 1>concentrate on and sometimes I go in there with uh,
uh,</v>

31
00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:42.080
an idea like all concentrate on material like that I'm working on or maybe

32
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:45.360
Jujitsu techniques and I'm having problems with or,
um,

33
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.680
some other things I'm dealing with,
you know,
any,
any sort of issues and a half.

34
00:01:48.681 --> 00:01:49.461
Sometimes I do that.

35
00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:52.730
Sometimes it just go in there and chill out and relax and breathe and

36
00:01:52.731 --> 00:01:56.650
concentrate.
There's a lot of physical things that happen inside the tank.
Um,

37
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.250
there's the amount of magnesium that's a in the water because it's Epsom salts.

38
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.920
It's really good for you physically.
It's very good for the muscles.

39
00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:07.700
It loosens you up and relax as you,
and that eliminates a lot of stress.

40
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.730
And that physical elimination of stress allows the brain to function with a just

41
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.420
less pressure and allows you to relax more and puts things in perspective
better.

42
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.501
And it also,

43
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:22.340
it gives you this a environment that's not available anywhere else in the
planet.

44
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.060
This wait list,
floating,
disconnected from your body environment where you're,

45
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.900
you don't hear anything,
you don't see anything,
you don't feel anything.

46
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:32.660
You feel like you're weightless,
you,
you,
you have this um,

47
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.640
sensation of flying because you're totally weightless,
weightless in the dark.

48
00:02:37.641 --> 00:02:40.100
You Open your eyes,
you don't see anything,
you close your eyes.

49
00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:42.630
It's exactly the same.
The water's the same temperatures,

50
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.710
your skin so you don't feel the water and you're floating.

51
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.700
<v 0>I'll say this hand on the share of this is going to let it go down.</v>

52
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.250
I actually don't have any questions about the,
the,

53
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.450
the benefits of being in an isolation tank even though I don't know too much

54
00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:59.350
about it.
And I also am a PR,
I think yoga great.

55
00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:00.850
Although I don't do much of it myself.

56
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.470
I I think though that there may actually be a difference between those two

57
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:08.660
activities and meditation because it is a kind of,

58
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.680
this is of Highfalutin term metacognition serve knowing what you know or knowing

59
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:19.050
that you're thinking,
uh,
that happens in the kind of mindfulness meditation,
uh,

60
00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:20.060
of which,
uh,

61
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.120
Sam and I are proponents proponents that I think is a different thing where

62
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:28.630
you're seeing,
and I'll just try to put this in English,

63
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.020
when you're meditating the way we do,
you're seeing how crazy you are.

64
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.250
You're seeing you're fucking nuts.

65
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.370
And that actually has a real value is systematic collision with the asshole in

66
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:42.820
your head has a real value because when the asshole offers you up a shitty

67
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:47.500
suggestion in the rest of your life,
which is basically it's job like,

68
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.861
oh yeah,

69
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:51.520
you should eat the 17th cookie or say the thing that's going to ruin the next 48

70
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:55.840
hours of your marriage or whatever.
You're better able to resist it.
So what?

71
00:03:55.841 --> 00:04:00.310
Like what do you do?
So I'm in the basic steps of mindfulness,
meditation,
artists,

72
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:02.110
it most people close their eyes.

73
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.620
You bring your full attention to the feeling of your breath,
just the,

74
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.820
you're not thinking about your breath,

75
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.270
you just feeling the raw data of the physical sensations.

76
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.950
And then the third step is the Biggie,
which is as soon as you try to do this,

77
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:16.230
your mind's going to go bonkers.

78
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.090
You're going to start thinking about what's for lunch,
doing eight a haircut,

79
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.440
where to gerbils run wild,
whatever,
blah,
blah,
blah.
You're just going to notice,

80
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.410
oh,
I'm,
I'm,
my mind is going crazy right now.

81
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.620
But that noticing is the key moment is in fact the victory.

82
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.700
It's interesting because this is when most people think they've failed that

83
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:34.091
because,
oh,

84
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:38.830
I can't meditate because I can't clear my mind is the biggest misconception

85
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:41.020
about meditation.
You do not need to clear your mind.

86
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:44.310
That's impossible unless you're enlightened or dead.
Uh,

87
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.830
the whole goal is just to notice when you've become distracted and start again.

88
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:51.910
You return your attention to your breath and you just do that a million times.

89
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.180
And every time you catch yourself wondering and go back to your breath,

90
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.820
it's a bicep curl for your brain.
It changes your brain.
And,
um,

91
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.190
that over time creates the kind of metacognition I was discussing before where

92
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:09.910
you see that you're a homo sapiens,
sapiens and other words,
Euro.
Uh,

93
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:11.740
that's how it were classified as a species.

94
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.900
We are the one who thinks and knows he or she thinks and that just that knowing

95
00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:21.370
that you have this voice in your head,
uh,
as Sam likes to joke,

96
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.070
he feels like when he thinks about the voice in his head,

97
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:26.950
he feels like he's been hijacked by the most boring person alive.

98
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.440
Just says the same shit over and over.
Um,
uh,
a joke that I,

99
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.760
I deal from him all the time.
Yeah.
Uh,
that,

100
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.870
that is enormously powerful because then you are not held hostage by this voice.

101
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.860
<v 1>A similar thing happens in the tank.
Um,
I do,
uh,</v>

102
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.730
do a form of meditation in the tank.

103
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:48.010
Sometimes when I go in there with or without an idea,

104
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.340
like if I'm not working on material or anything else where I just concentrating

105
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:53.680
on my breath in,
through the nose,
out through the mouth,

106
00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:55.510
and I just literally concentrate on the breath.

107
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:59.860
And the same thing happens to meditation.
We,
yeah,
we,
yeah.
It's,

108
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.740
it's not similar.
It's the exact same thing.
The differences in the tank.

109
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.980
After a while,
after about 20 minutes or so,

110
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:10.810
that breaks loose to psychedelic states.
Wow.
Hmm.

111
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.440
Have you ever combine the tank with psychedelics?
Altered state?
So yeah.
Yeah,

112
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.220
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Trip what?
LSD Or,
or mushrooms.
Mushrooms.

113
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:20.600
But the big one is edible pot.

114
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.860
Edible pod seems to be as strong as anything in there.
I've,

115
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.430
I eat enough pot where I'm convinced I'm gonna die and then I climb in there and

116
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.430
write every time.
I do it.
I go,
don't do that again cause I just get out.

117
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:32.300
So terrifying.

118
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.080
<v 0>What's your motivation when you're eating the pot and climbing into this?</v>

119
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.100
<v 1>Nice,
let's see what happens.
Okay.
Yeah.
Just be scared.
Be terrified because,
yeah,</v>

120
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:42.440
because nothing ever happens.
You never die,

121
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.120
but God damn you just convinced that the universe is imploding around you and

122
00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:49.880
that it is so it usually has the,

123
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.690
the character of fear being made part of it.

124
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.660
It's also not embracing the fear,

125
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.600
not letting the fear run rampant and just sort of relaxing and giving into the

126
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:01.310
vulnerability your,

127
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:05.150
the finite nature of your existence and just breathing and concentrating and

128
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:08.180
letting,
letting the dance take place because there's some,

129
00:07:08.181 --> 00:07:10.970
there's some sort of a weird,
one of the things that,

130
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.120
there's a big misconception about when it comes to edible pot,

131
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.840
is it edible pod is like smoking pot.
It's an entirely different process.

132
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.950
Physiologically your liver at the time course is very different to him.

133
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:24.440
You can stay stolen for three days.
Yeah,
you can.

134
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.580
You could fuck up and eat too many brownies and you'll be gone for a long time.

135
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.350
That sounds miserable.
It is.
But it's not because he gets something out of it.

136
00:07:33.351 --> 00:07:38.180
When it's over the,
the,
the process is excruciating.
But when you come out of it,

137
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:40.820
you just feel so happy.
I feel so happy.
It's,

138
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.180
<v 0>yeah.
It's like that joke about the dude.</v>

139
00:07:43.181 --> 00:07:45.580
He's banging his head up against the wall and somebody says,

140
00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:48.010
why are you doing that?
And he says,
because it feels so good when I stopped.

141
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.530
<v 1>Hm.
In a way,</v>

142
00:07:49.531 --> 00:07:52.050
but there's no physical damage banging your head up against the wall.

143
00:07:52.051 --> 00:07:53.480
You're gonna hurt yourself.
This is true.

144
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.600
<v 0>Uh,
yeah.
I don't know.</v>

145
00:07:55.601 --> 00:07:58.960
I think there seems like there might be easier ways to get to the same wisdom

146
00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.833
[inaudible]

147
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:00.650
<v 1>maybe.</v>

148
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.650
But I think there's also creativity that gets inspired by the edible pot.

149
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.870
Something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that your body produces.
It's,

150
00:08:10.871 --> 00:08:13.730
it's so different than most people when they eat pot,

151
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.000
they think they've been dosed.
Like anybody who's smoked pot before,

152
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:19.340
and then you give him a Brownie,
they think,
oh my God,
there's something in that.

153
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:24.170
And they're convinced because reality itself just seems like it just dissolves.

154
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.000
And especially inside the tank.

155
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.640
There's something about the tank environment that produces.

156
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.910
In the absence of any external stimuli,

157
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.940
your brain becomes sort of supercharged because what you're trying to do when

158
00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:40.190
you're just sitting down and concentrating and relaxing as you're trying to

159
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:41.510
focus on your thoughts,

160
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:45.020
but you're still aware of your body is still aware of your elbows touching this

161
00:08:45.021 --> 00:08:46.730
desk,
your butt touching the chair.

162
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:49.520
There's all these different factors that that are theirs,

163
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.640
stimuli that's coming into your,
your your senses.

164
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.920
Whereas in the tank there's none of that virtually.

165
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.430
It's almost completely eliminated.
There's some,
but you can,
you can,

166
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.420
you can phase that stuff out.
Like you could still feel the water a little bit.

167
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:05.130
If you think about it,
you could still,

168
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
sometimes you bump into the wall and you have to like center yourself and you

169
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:09.661
have to look,

170
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:14.661
relax again and make sure you're not moving so that you don't touch things which

171
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:16.740
can kind of dissolve the experience,

172
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.060
<v 2>their experiences.</v>

173
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.960
Meditation where you have that same experience where you lose your sense of the

174
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:26.040
body,
but that usually comes with more concentration.

175
00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:27.660
You have to be very concentrated on it.

176
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:32.400
<v 1>I feel like you would have that experience and it would be even more intense if</v>

177
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:35.310
you did the exact same thing that you do outside the tank in the tank.

178
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.280
I don't think you need any psychedelics and the tango.

179
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.370
It's one thing I tell people when they ask me,
should I get high before I do it?

180
00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:45.210
And like,
no,
just do it.
Just do it.
If you decide after a while,

181
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:46.590
if you'd done it three or four times and you're like,

182
00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:49.260
I wonder what it's like if I just take a little bit of a hit of pot and see

183
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.130
where it takes me.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
It's not gonna hurt you.

184
00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.620
You know?
If you're a type of person,
enjoys marijuana or whatever,

185
00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:01.020
but that the tank alone by itself,
just the absence of sensory input,

186
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.570
your brain goes to a very,
very different place.

187
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:07.770
And as long as you can relax and as long as you don't think too much about the

188
00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:10.920
fact that you're in the tank and just concentrate and Thailand your thoughts

189
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.350
entirely on your breath.
And again,

190
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:16.710
let all those crazy like where to hamsters live,
like all that shit.

191
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.080
Let let all that stuff run wild through your mouth.

192
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.910
But I feel like in the tank at least that gets to a certain spot.

193
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.130
Then it stops existing and then the psychedelic state techs over.

194
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.880
<v 2>Yeah,
well it depends on what the goal is.</v>

195
00:10:28.881 --> 00:10:33.881
I think there can be many different goals of meditation or in a quasi spiritual

196
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.770
practice and then they're not there.
They're distinct.

197
00:10:39.771 --> 00:10:44.771
So the center of the Bullseye for me is not suffering unnecessarily.

198
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:47.360
Right.

199
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.140
So and so one thing that that mindfulness gives you is,

200
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:53.840
so it's Patina,

201
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:58.040
it's compatible with every experience you can have.

202
00:10:58.041 --> 00:11:01.370
I mean there is nothing in your experience that isn't inappropriate object of

203
00:11:01.371 --> 00:11:02.330
meditation.
You just,

204
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.570
most people start with the breath because it's just a very convenient thing to

205
00:11:05.571 --> 00:11:09.620
start with.
But once you know how to do this particular practice,

206
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:11.001
you're just,

207
00:11:11.001 --> 00:11:16.001
your goal is to just be clearly aware of whatever your experience is in each

208
00:11:16.191 --> 00:11:19.520
moment.
So it's emotions arise,
thoughts arise,

209
00:11:19.521 --> 00:11:22.310
sounds come in your,
your,

210
00:11:22.311 --> 00:11:27.050
your attention is wide open to whatever your experience is.
So it's not like,

211
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.690
so nothing in principle is a distraction.
I mean that could be,

212
00:11:29.691 --> 00:11:33.260
you could be meditating right next to a construction site and the sound of of

213
00:11:33.261 --> 00:11:38.120
the hammers is just as good an object of meditation as the breath or anything

214
00:11:38.121 --> 00:11:42.410
else.
So there's nothing,
everything is included.
But the,
the,

215
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.900
the super power you're after,

216
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:50.260
which you actually can acquire through this practice is to realize that

217
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.310
virtually all of your,

218
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.520
of your psychological suffering and actually arguably virtually all of your,

219
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.450
your physical suffering.
I mean the,
or the,

220
00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.500
the difference between physical pain and suffering,

221
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.860
which I mean those two are not quite the same thing.
Um,

222
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.950
is a matter of being lost in thought.

223
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.650
It's a matter of thinking without knowing that you're thinking and what and what

224
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.300
mindfulness does.

225
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:21.301
And really any technique of meditation ultimately should do is teach you to

226
00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:26.440
break the spell of being lost in thought and to notice a thought as a thought.

227
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.140
I mean the,
the,

228
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.180
the huge difference is until you learn how to meditate or do something like

229
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:32.014
meditation,

230
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.500
you're just helplessly thinking every moment of your life you're having a

231
00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:38.560
conversation with yourself.
You're having content,

232
00:12:38.561 --> 00:12:43.561
whether it's imagistic or linguistic pour forth into consciousness every moment

233
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.380
and so incessantly that you don't even notice it.
It's just white noise.

234
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.160
And not only does it completely color your experience moment to moment.

235
00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:56.200
So like if you're,
if they're angry thoughts,
you're angry.

236
00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:59.020
If they're depressed thoughts or you're depressed or sad that you're sad.

237
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:04.150
So you become your thoughts,
but you also feel,
you feel,

238
00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:07.840
you feel identified,
you feel that you are the thinker of your thoughts.

239
00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:11.770
You feel like a self.
And it's a completely structured by this flow of,

240
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:13.390
of mentation every moment.

241
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.200
And it produces everything you do.

242
00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:19.900
It produces all of your intentions and your goals and your actions.

243
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.720
And he said this about me and now I'm going to say this.
I mean,
so it's like,

244
00:13:22.721 --> 00:13:27.190
it's everything coming out to you is born of of this the same process.

245
00:13:27.191 --> 00:13:32.191
And meditation is a way of recognizing that consciousness and that what you are

246
00:13:33.281 --> 00:13:34.170
subjectively as a,

247
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.410
this prior condition of just be awareness in which everything is showing up,

248
00:13:38.411 --> 00:13:43.411
sounds sensations and thoughts and thoughts can become just other objects of

249
00:13:44.531 --> 00:13:48.720
consciousness.
And,
um,
so I'm going to take a,

250
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.920
at a very basic,
uh,
uh,

251
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.210
example of the difference between pain and suffering.

252
00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:59.830
You can feel very strong physical pain,

253
00:13:59.831 --> 00:14:02.080
I mean unpleasant pain and

254
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.590
just be aware of it in that like the,

255
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.390
the sense that it's unbearable is virtually always untrue because you in that

256
00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:12.090
moment you've already born it,
right?
That may have,

257
00:14:12.091 --> 00:14:16.840
what did the feeling that something's unbearable is really the fear of having to

258
00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:19.630
experience it in the next moment in the future.
Right.

259
00:14:19.631 --> 00:14:22.900
Cause you're always like if,
if,
if some,
if someone drives a nail into your knee,

260
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.290
right?
You might,
well that's uh,
that sounds like it's unbearable,

261
00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:31.250
but every moment you are feeling it,
your bearing it,
right.
It's like,
it's,

262
00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.620
it's what you're,

263
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:35.560
what you're thinking about is the last moment and the next moment,

264
00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:36.960
and you're thinking about how much oil,
you know,

265
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.210
when am I going to get some relief?
And you know,

266
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.700
what's the cure and how badly is my knee injured?
And you know,
like you're,

267
00:14:42.701 --> 00:14:43.151
you're,
you're,

268
00:14:43.151 --> 00:14:47.230
you're worried about the future continuously and you're not noticing the

269
00:14:47.231 --> 00:14:51.830
automaticity of thought that is,
that is amplifying the,
the,

270
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.430
the,
the negative negativity of the experience in that moment.

271
00:14:55.431 --> 00:15:00.200
And we all know that you can have super intense sensation,

272
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:05.480
which is either either pleasant or unpleasant depending on the,

273
00:15:05.481 --> 00:15:08.450
on the conceptual frame you've put around it.
So for instance,
if,

274
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:13.540
if you had this massive sense of soreness in your shoulder,

275
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.280
that you would experience it very differently if it was a,

276
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.760
the result of you dead lifting more than you ever had in your life,

277
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:25.130
and you are proud of it,
right?
Um,

278
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:29.280
B probably cancer and you're waiting for your,
you know,
the,

279
00:15:29.281 --> 00:15:33.470
the biopsy results and,
and,
uh,
you know,
you're worried about,
you know,

280
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:37.580
this is the thing,
the thing that's gonna kill you.
Or you're getting raw food,

281
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:41.270
you know,
like some deep tissue massage and it hurts like hell,

282
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:44.480
but you actually totally understand the source of the pain that you know it's

283
00:15:44.481 --> 00:15:47.240
going to be gone the moment the guy pulls his elbow back,
right?

284
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.690
So it could be the exact same sensation,
each one of those,

285
00:15:50.691 --> 00:15:54.560
but the conceptual frame you have around it totally dictates the level of

286
00:15:54.561 --> 00:15:56.420
psychological suffering and or,

287
00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:59.300
or the conducted the total absence of psychological suffering.

288
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:05.330
Now we were talking before the podcast started about your apps and we were

289
00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:09.680
talking about the amount of different meditation exercises on the apps.

290
00:16:09.681 --> 00:16:12.500
Like what kind of different meditation exercises are there?

291
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:16.070
If you're talking about just concentrating on mindfulness and breathing,

292
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.450
<v 0>uh,
as it turns out,</v>

293
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:22.580
you can iterate off of that basic exercise in some to,

294
00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.970
to like,
uh,
infinity essentially.
Um,

295
00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.930
because you talk about not only,
well,

296
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.920
I don't want to get too ahead of myself,
but basically the,
the,

297
00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.680
the basic instructions are that we listed before.

298
00:16:37.681 --> 00:16:40.560
You're feeling your breath coming in and then when you get lost,
you start again.

299
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.840
But then you can add onto that.

300
00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.920
So one big thing to add on is something called mental noting.

301
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:51.840
So you're breathing in and out and you're feeling your breath and then you get

302
00:16:51.841 --> 00:16:55.320
distracted by huge wave of anger.
Generally speaking,

303
00:16:55.321 --> 00:16:59.220
when we get hit by a wave of anger,
we just inhabit the anger.
We become angry.

304
00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:02.520
There's no buffer between the stimulus and our response to it.

305
00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.700
But there's this little technique you can do of just making a little mental note

306
00:17:06.701 --> 00:17:11.100
of,
Oh,
that's anger and that kind of objectifies and the thing,

307
00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.580
it's a little bit like pressing the picture in picture button on your uh,

308
00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:15.443
rook control,

309
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.280
where the story that's taken up the whole frame can be seen with some uh,

310
00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.020
perspective.
Uh,

311
00:17:22.021 --> 00:17:25.590
so that's just one example of the little techniques that you can add onto the

312
00:17:25.591 --> 00:17:29.700
basic exercise.
And you can go for a long time.
So as we were discussing,

313
00:17:29.701 --> 00:17:32.160
Sam's bout to start his meditation APP,

314
00:17:32.161 --> 00:17:35.310
which is going to be called what Santam waking up.
And I have mine,

315
00:17:35.311 --> 00:17:36.780
which is called 10% happier.

316
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:41.290
Sam is going to be doing all the teaching on his APP.
And My,
on my absence,

317
00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:45.630
I'm not a teacher.
We,
we have experts coming in like Joseph Goldstein,

318
00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:48.930
who's again the friend of a friend of both Sam and I,

319
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.590
uh,
and you,

320
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:57.750
each teacher has their own emphasis and you then start talking about applied

321
00:17:57.751 --> 00:18:01.800
meditation.
So how do I use it when we're,
how do I use in my everyday life?

322
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.770
How do I use it?
If really what I want to do right now is,
um,

323
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.670
control my eating.
So meditation for example,

324
00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:12.660
we have a course on the APP that talks about using it to not overeat.
By the way,

325
00:18:12.661 --> 00:18:16.650
I'm terrible at this,
but you can use your ability,
your mindfulness,

326
00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:19.560
your ability to know what's happening in your head at any given moment without

327
00:18:19.561 --> 00:18:23.100
getting carried away by it,
to not overeat.
Notice,
Oh,

328
00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:26.760
I'm having this urge right now to eat as I did last night and an entire bag of

329
00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:31.590
malted,
uh,
uh,
chocolate in my hotel room.
Uh,
but I don't,

330
00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:36.190
I can ride that urge and not do the thing that I know is stupid.
Um,

331
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:36.841
so anyway,

332
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:41.460
that's just a little taste of how you can take meditation and bring it in kind

333
00:18:41.461 --> 00:18:42.900
of numerous directions.

334
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.120
<v 2>Do you guys feel competitive?
Both of apps?</v>

335
00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:51.610
<v 0>No,
his isn't even that mindset,
let's say.
Not yet.</v>

336
00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:56.090
When his comes out and completely cannibalize his mind then,
then yeah.

337
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.890
How happy is for me,
I actually 10% happier.

338
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:04.170
I'll be like negative 500%.
What's 10% of zero?
Yeah,

339
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.060
exactly.
No,
I actually think I'm of the view,
you know,

340
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.630
now that I've been in this meditation APP business for a little while,

341
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.870
I'm kind of,
I don't think it's Uber,

342
00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:18.000
I don't think the business model is that there's just one huge app everybody

343
00:19:18.001 --> 00:19:21.960
uses and maybe there's some distant,
you know,
second,
I actually think it's more,

344
00:19:21.961 --> 00:19:23.220
a little bit more like fast food.

345
00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.760
I think he's going to be a bunch of big players and uh,

346
00:19:26.761 --> 00:19:31.170
and you may switch back and forth.
Um,
do I think it's one need a nap?

347
00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.320
No,
no,
no,
you don't.
But

348
00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:33.601
<v 2>I mean,</v>

349
00:19:33.601 --> 00:19:38.601
the thing that's useful and it's really useful at any level of expertise in,

350
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.310
in meditation and they at least this kind of meditation,

351
00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:46.200
is it having someone guide you?
Yeah,
it's,
it's like a,
uh,

352
00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:49.950
a mindfulness alarm that's constantly going off or going off it,
you know,

353
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.340
periodically over the course of 10 minutes or 20 minutes or however long you're

354
00:19:53.341 --> 00:19:54.174
sitting,

355
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:59.210
and because distraction is just continually the problem and you either

356
00:20:00.061 --> 00:20:02.820
meditating or you're distracted,
you're,
you're either,
you're,
that you're,

357
00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:06.750
they're aware of what's happening at that moment or you're lost in thought.

358
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.420
And that's true throughout your life.
I mean,

359
00:20:09.421 --> 00:20:11.520
you're either hearing what I'm saying right now,

360
00:20:11.521 --> 00:20:14.430
or you're thinking about something else and you don't know it,
right?
Or you're,

361
00:20:14.431 --> 00:20:18.810
you're either reading the book you're intending to read or your mind is

362
00:20:18.811 --> 00:20:21.210
wandering.
You're going to have to read that paragraph again.
So this,

363
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:22.890
this failure to concentrate,

364
00:20:22.891 --> 00:20:26.130
this failure to be able to focus on what you're intending to focus on,

365
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:27.680
is it just this,

366
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.770
this universal problem of human consciousness?

367
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.800
And so meditation trains that and the other benefits follow.

368
00:20:38.161 --> 00:20:43.161
But the having a voice in your head reminding you that you're even attempting to

369
00:20:43.861 --> 00:20:47.840
be meditating is a very powerful,
yeah.

370
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.020
Even if you're,
even if it's your own voice.
I mean,

371
00:20:50.021 --> 00:20:54.430
even in when I'm listening to a meditation that I recorded,

372
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.300
just my own voice,
remember it reminded me that I'm,

373
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.100
that I'm supposed to be meditating.
Um,
it works like any other voice,
you know,

374
00:21:03.101 --> 00:21:06.100
and it's,
um,
so it's,
it's just,

375
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:10.710
it's a feedback system that you can't really provide for yourself.
Although you,

376
00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:15.160
obviously you can,
I mean,
you can meditate without an app and most people do.

377
00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.300
And I've spent very little time meditating with apps.

378
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.040
I just think they're very useful.

379
00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.270
<v 0>But you,
you know,
both of us started meditating.</v>

380
00:21:23.271 --> 00:21:24.710
You started meditating well before I did,

381
00:21:24.711 --> 00:21:28.250
but we both started pre the apps the morning around.
Um,

382
00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:33.590
uh,
so you can read,
you can read a book,
read a good book,

383
00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.140
and learn how to meditate out of the book,
um,

384
00:21:36.141 --> 00:21:40.190
and just basically remember the basic instructions and do it.
Uh,

385
00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.710
but he really is useful to have an APP,

386
00:21:42.711 --> 00:21:46.250
especially for some people because of one of the biggest problems in meditation

387
00:21:46.251 --> 00:21:48.860
is this persistent fear that you're not doing it right.

388
00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.940
And so to have a voice you trust in your ear,

389
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:54.680
just giving you,

390
00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:59.150
reminding you of the basic instructions which are so simple but very easy to

391
00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:03.410
forget,
it can be very useful.
I like the idea of

392
00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.680
<v 2>it being like bicep curls for your mind.
Yeah.
Hmm.</v>

393
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.040
<v 0>I mean,
you see,</v>

394
00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:13.320
you see it in the brain scans and Samuel correct me where I run a foul of

395
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:18.360
scientific accuracy here,
but this base,
this,

396
00:22:18.361 --> 00:22:22.900
this,
um,
simple act of sitting,
trying,

397
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:26.070
trying to focus on one thing at a time.
And then when you get distracted,

398
00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:31.370
knowing you're distracted and returning to your breath is changing your brain.

399
00:22:31.561 --> 00:22:35.860
When you do that,
you're boosting a,
the muscles,
the,

400
00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:40.740
and then obviously the muscles.
When I'm using it as a light loosely,

401
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.160
you're boosting your focus muscle.
And in many cases,

402
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.760
whether there was a study in 2010,
I think it was done at Harvard,
uh,

403
00:22:47.761 --> 00:22:50.910
that took people who had never meditated before and they scanned their brains

404
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.340
and then they had them do eight weeks of a,
I think,

405
00:22:53.341 --> 00:22:55.500
a half hour a day of meditation.
At the end of the eight weeks,

406
00:22:55.501 --> 00:22:56.610
they scanned their brains again.

407
00:22:56.611 --> 00:22:59.730
What they found was in the area of the brain associated with self awareness,

408
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.020
the gray matter grew,
and in the area of the brain associated with stress,

409
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.140
the gray matter shrink.
That to me is pretty compelling.

410
00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:16.580
<v 3>Okay.</v>
