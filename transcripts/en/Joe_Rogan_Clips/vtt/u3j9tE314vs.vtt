1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.040
You know,
when,
when I,
when I,
well,
I've seen this in,

2
00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:06.930
in debates that I've had publicly where people,
you know,

3
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:11.310
talk about prejudice and I've pointed out to them that they have prejudicial

4
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:14.220
attitudes with regards to their sexual preferences because they don't just sleep

5
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:18.450
with anyone who asks them.
Right?
So it's like,
well,
how's that not a prejudice?

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.580
Well of course it's a prejudice.

7
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.260
Well then the question is under what circumstances are prejudice is justifiable.

8
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.680
And that's a conversation we don't like to have because we believe that there

9
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:33.540
are no circumstances whatsoever under which prejudices is our,
our,
uh,
acceptable.

10
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.240
There's a big difference between prejudice and discrimination.

11
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:38.730
I think those two get conflated.
Yes,

12
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:43.690
there is a big difference between prejudice and discrimination and all hopefully

13
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.430
discrimination has to do with,
uh,

14
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.110
setting your standards in relationship to the task at hand,
right?
That,

15
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.500
that's what you'd hope for.
That that's the appropriate form of discrimination.

16
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.400
That's like intelligence.
Sure.
Everything.
It,

17
00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:02.970
everything isn't the same about everything all the time.
So you discriminate,

18
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:06.690
you rank order things and you need to rank order them even to pursue things that

19
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:07.524
are valuable.

20
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.160
This is one of the problems with the people who are so anti hierarchy,
like the,

21
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.670
like the radical leftists.
While there shouldn't be hierarchies,
it's like,
okay,

22
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:19.671
then why do something that that argument is so foolhardy that it's,

23
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.300
it's difficult to take seriously,
but you do have to engage in it.

24
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.160
And I think when you engage in it,
it's really fascinating to watch,
uh,

25
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.640
because there's,

26
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.120
it's like you're playing a game of chess with someone who only has a couple of

27
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:36.210
pieces.
They have this strong move that they do,

28
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:38.340
but you've got all these other pieces and you're like,
well,

29
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.240
let's just keep this game going until this comes this a logical conclusion,

30
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:45.240
which is checkmate.
There's,
there's hierarchies all throughout nature.

31
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.640
It doesn't mean people should,
should suppress people.

32
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.320
It doesn't mean people shouldn't have rights.

33
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.010
It doesn't mean people should enforce themselves or forced themselves on other

34
00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:55.920
folks.
That's not what it means.
It also doesn't mean that the hierarchy's,

35
00:01:55.921 --> 00:02:00.450
especially if they're human hierarchies good,
well or,
or,
or that they're only,

36
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.940
that's right.

37
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.530
Not that they're good necessarily or that they're predicated going power.

38
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.040
Like one of the most pathological elements of the postmodern types,

39
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:12.810
especially people like Fuko is their insistence that all hierarchical structures

40
00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:15.900
are predicated on power and that there's nothing other than power.

41
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:18.120
And that's completely preposterous.
I mean,

42
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.530
I use examples of plumbers in my lectures more recently because it's rather

43
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.550
comical.
It's like,
well,
on what basis do you hire a plumber?

44
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:29.970
So imagine that there's a hierarchy of plumbers ranging from very successful to

45
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:34.620
very unsuccessful.
Okay.
And you say,
well,
what makes plumbers successful?
Well,

46
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.170
the power,
a theory would,

47
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.000
would imply that there are roving bands of mafioso seal plumbers who like come

48
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:45.840
pounding on your door at three in the morning and tell you that if you don't get

49
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:49.470
their particular posy to fix your pipes leaking or not,

50
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:52.680
that they're going to come and burn down your house.
Of course,
that's completely,

51
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.750
it's completely absurd.
When you go to hire someone like a plumber,

52
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.280
while the first thing you want know his reputation,

53
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:03.700
can they actually fix a pipe because you actually want your pipe fixed and then

54
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:05.650
you want to know,
well,
do they deal with you fairly?

55
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:09.340
And part of what's tangled up in that in all likelihood is do they deal with

56
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:12.160
their employees fairly because that's going to make their business function

57
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:15.040
properly.
And so the hierarchy of plumbers,

58
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:19.030
which is part of the patriarchal tyranny is almost entirely predicated on

59
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:24.031
competence and almost every enterprise in the west is like that.

60
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.030
Cause I keep wondering,
well where the hell is this patriarchal tyranny?

61
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.260
Like is it massage therapists?
Is it nurses?

62
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:36.760
Like most nurses are female.
If you get females organized into a hierarchy,

63
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.130
which you do in nursing,
is that all of a sudden,

64
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.060
is that part of the patriarchal tyranny or is it the fact that no,

65
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:45.460
all those people are women?
Does that mean it's no longer,

66
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.370
while it's still a hierarchy,
is it no longer a tyranny?

67
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.020
Is it no longer patriarchal?

68
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.200
Like is it patriarchal only because there's men in it or is it patriarchal

69
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:56.710
because it's a hierarchy?
All of this stuff is so incoherent that it just,

70
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.340
all you have to do is think about it [inaudible] and that hasn't been done to

71
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:02.880
any great degree and it just dissolves in your hands.

72
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.760
That's what I'm saying is that if you're entering into a job straight out of

73
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:10.950
college,
you leave university and now you're entering into,
you know,
the,

74
00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:13.370
your first year in the workplace.
It's,

75
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.980
it's just a natural fact of life that there's going to be people that are

76
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:21.460
further ahead in this race than you.
Yeah.
Cause they're better at what they do.

77
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:24.130
Some of there because more experienced,
more education.

78
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:28.720
Some of them are more crooked and sneakers as well because the,
but it's the,

79
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.740
it's the agreeing everyone agreeing that this is a game.
Yeah.

80
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:34.540
This is some sort of a competition.
Yes.

81
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.640
And you're going to have hierarchies and competitions.

82
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:39.130
You're going to have people who when you're going to have people who do better.

83
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.180
Yes.
No matter what the type.
So that's the fundamental issue.
As soon as you,

84
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.550
so we could look at it this way.
As soon as you,

85
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.070
let's assume people have problems,

86
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.520
everybody can agree on that and then we could assume that people would like

87
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:55.150
solutions to those problems.
So we could agree on that.
Then we could say,

88
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:59.140
well then if you implement a solution socially,
so with other people,

89
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.250
then you're going to cooperate and compete in relationship to the solution and

90
00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:06.700
that's instantly going to produce a hierarchy because no matter what the problem

91
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:09.520
is,
some people are going to be better at solving it than others.

92
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.050
And then if you have any sense,

93
00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:14.350
you put the people who are good at solving it at the forefront because then they

94
00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:17.590
solve it faster and cheaper and better,
and then everybody benefits.

95
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.570
But then you get a hierarchy,
right?

96
00:05:19.571 --> 00:05:24.571
The people who solve those problems get financial incentive to stall solve those

97
00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:25.630
problems.
Yes,
and they do.

98
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.470
And they do that because the rest of us are greedy and desperate.
It's like,

99
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.191
you know,

100
00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:34.360
we want the people who are good at solving the problems to keep solving them.

101
00:05:34.361 --> 00:05:37.420
And so what we're trying to do is to reward them so that they'll keep doing it

102
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:42.040
even if it's difficult to give them some status extraordinarily,
if if necessary.

103
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.110
When you look at the people that are the head of giant industry,
the,

104
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:48.130
the CEOs of super successful companies,

105
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.440
they're the ones who have the giant yachts and the big houses.

106
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:53.860
And this is the incentive for people to try to get to that position.

107
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.800
And the idea that there's no incentive and that there should be no incentive,

108
00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:59.540
but yet you're still gonna have all this innovation is ridiculous.

109
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:01.970
It's not how it works.
It's not how human beings work.

110
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.700
If human beings are going to work really hard,

111
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.560
there has to be some sort of a reward and it can't be an equal.

112
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.340
And then then what you could say like,
so okay,

113
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:14.720
so the right that that would be roughly speaking a conservative position and

114
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:17.930
then you can take a left wing position that's reasonable and you can say,
yes,

115
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.640
there are hierarchies,

116
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:24.590
but we have to stay awake because they can degenerate into power hungry

117
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:27.660
tyrannize so that it's no longer competence.
It's,

118
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.450
it's political machination and game playing and tyranny that that produced the

119
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.830
positional positional differentiation.
So we got to stay awake to that.

120
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.880
And so we got to criticize the hierarchies.
Not the fact of hierarchy,

121
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:42.920
but the structure of hierarchy.
So they stay honest.

122
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.550
And then we also have to be careful because when you do set up a hierarchy,

123
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.370
then a lot of people collect at the bottom.

124
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.360
That's the necessary consequence of a few people collecting at the top.

125
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.240
And so then you have to be concerned about those people at the bottom.

126
00:06:56.241 --> 00:07:00.080
And so there's a variety of things that you would do to express that concern is

127
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:03.410
one,
you might want to have a lot of hierarchies so that people have different

128
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:07.580
talents,
could play different games and a complex societies pretty good at that.

129
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.270
But you're still gonna have people who stack up at the bottom of all
hierarchies,

130
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:11.420
right?

131
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.080
And those are going to be people who are sick mentally and physically and maybe

132
00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:17.300
people who are cognitively impaired or you know,

133
00:07:17.301 --> 00:07:21.080
or have experienced some kind of catastrophe in their life.
And then you,

134
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:26.120
you want to set up your system so that those people don't suffer unduly.

135
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.900
Partly because that's bad in party,
cause that destabilizes your whole society.

136
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.951
And so you could say,

137
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:35.951
well that's the left's place is to speak for the speak on behalf of the unjustly

138
00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:42.251
dispossessed and the rights position is to stabilize and maintain functional

139
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:45.130
hierarchies and encourage competition,

140
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.940
encourage competition that's of benefit to the whole and to the individuals

141
00:07:49.941 --> 00:07:50.840
within the competition.

142
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.460
And then the political dialogue is a continual discussion between the left and

143
00:07:55.461 --> 00:07:56.680
the right saying,
well you know,

144
00:07:56.681 --> 00:08:00.230
at this hierarchy is getting a little too steep and a little too rigid and,
and,

145
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.030
and,
and well,
and that's,

146
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:06.830
for me that's also the fundamental reason for the necessity of free speech.

147
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.610
It's because that's the only way to discuss this.
It is the only,

148
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:13.190
it's the only way of working it out and it is the case you need,

149
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.250
you're going to produce hierarchies if you're going to pursue things of value,

150
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:16.491
social,

151
00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:20.510
are you going to pre produce hierarchies and they're necessary and has also,

152
00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:23.810
I have a giant issue with the concept that these things are mutually exclusive,

153
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:26.960
that you can't have competition and also have a,

154
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:31.190
a good social environment.
I think that's preposterous idea.
I mean,

155
00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:35.150
one of the things I really like about the psychologist,
Sean Piaget,

156
00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:38.090
who's who I would say the world's foremost expert on games,

157
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:43.010
is that he did a very careful analysis of say,
competitive games.

158
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.570
Okay,
so let's take hockey or soccer.
It doesn't matter.
Same example.
You say,

159
00:08:47.571 --> 00:08:51.680
well cause people now they have kids play these games and don't keep score.

160
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.710
Which of course the kids keep score because they're not stupid like the adults.

161
00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:58.590
But you know,
while we can't have it be competitive,
okay,
so let's take it apart.

162
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:02.940
It's like,
well his hockey,
a competitive game or a cooperative game.
Okay,
well,

163
00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:07.770
so first of all,
everyone's trying to do the same thing.
Stats cooperative.

164
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:10.620
It's not like half the people are playing chess and another,
you know,

165
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:13.760
a third of them brought a basket ball and two of them are boxing in a coat.

166
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.350
Well sometimes they do in hockey,
boxing in a corner,

167
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:20.340
but everyone's trying to do the same thing.
So that's cooperative.
Okay.

168
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.170
Everyone plays their position.
That's cooperative.
They all follow the same rules.

169
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:29.550
That's cooperative,
right?
So,
so there's competition,

170
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.170
but it's nested inside a fundamental structure of cooperation.

171
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:39.120
And the cooperation is the cooperation is the basis of the game itself.

172
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:43.020
Let's all arbitrarily agree that it's important to put this black disk in the

173
00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:43.620
net,

174
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.880
which is to get your aim right and then let's cooperate within our teams to do

175
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:50.310
that because we're going to pass and we're going to,

176
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.280
we're going to pass to each other and we're also going to work so that each of

177
00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:54.180
us is a good player,

178
00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:58.410
but so that we all work for the betterment of our team because we want to win

179
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:01.860
games across multiple games.
So that's also cooperative.

180
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.340
And then you want to interact with your,
your enemies,

181
00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:09.930
let's say the other team in a way that's indicative of good sportsman ship so

182
00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:11.490
that the entire league can flourish.

183
00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:16.050
And to think of that as competitive is absolutely.
It's so,
um,

184
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:21.240
I,
there's no other way of describing it than stupid.
That's what it is.

185
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:24.930
It's a,
it's a,
it's an ignorant unit,
dimensional analysis.

186
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.070
It's put forward by someone who's reflexively opposed to anything that smacks of

187
00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:31.650
competition and who isn't thinking it through at all.

188
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.181
<v 1>They,</v>

189
00:10:32.181 --> 00:10:35.710
they're denying the benefits of competition and the fact that they reaped those

190
00:10:35.711 --> 00:10:38.950
very benefits of competition by enjoying the products that are created

191
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:43.390
<v 0>by these corporations.
Yes,
very hypocritical and well,
that's for sure.</v>

192
00:10:43.391 --> 00:10:46.750
That's called a performative contradiction.
It's like,
well,
I'd like to,

193
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.620
I like to complain about left wing issues on my iPhone.
Right,
exactly.
You know,

194
00:10:50.621 --> 00:10:53.150
it's like,
well,
yeah,
fair enough.
But you know,

195
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.780
you should have a little gratitude for the fact that you've got your iPhone to

196
00:10:55.781 --> 00:10:58.660
complain about and those and those organizations,

197
00:10:58.661 --> 00:11:03.310
so those corporations are unbelievably competitive and then they fall apart

198
00:11:03.311 --> 00:11:06.700
almost instantly when that competition starts start stops being a,

199
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:10.720
an issue because then there's no constraint on the behavior of the behavior of

200
00:11:10.721 --> 00:11:13.900
the system.
So yes.

201
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.440
And that you know that the issue with men,
I think with young men,

202
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.440
and this is one of the things I've been trying to address is that if your

203
00:11:20.441 --> 00:11:24.820
fundamental presupposition is that our culture is a patriarchal tyranny,

204
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:29.170
which is an appalling presupposition along with the idea that the best way of

205
00:11:29.171 --> 00:11:31.750
looking at history is that it,
it was the oppression,

206
00:11:31.751 --> 00:11:34.000
the continual oppression of women by men,

207
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:38.050
which is also something that I regard as Oud.
Absolutely reprehensible doctrine.

208
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.780
Then,
okay,
so it's a patriarchal tyranny,

209
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:44.050
<v 1>but that in their defense that did exist,</v>

210
00:11:44.051 --> 00:11:46.150
there has been continual oppression of women.

211
00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.610
It's just not the only thing that's happened.
Well,

212
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.980
there's been women that have been revered.

213
00:11:50.981 --> 00:11:52.840
There's been women that have been celebrated.

214
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.400
There's been women that have accomplished

215
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.350
<v 0>great things,
but there's been a lot of oppression.</v>

216
00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:00.220
So if they concentrate primarily on that oppression and that's their main point

217
00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:02.590
of study and that's the thing they want to talk about all the time.

218
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:06.790
They kind of have a point in the fact that if you're looking at all the events

219
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:07.720
that have ever taken place,

220
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.810
there's a significant number of them that have been women being oppressed.

221
00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:11.860
That's a real thing.

222
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:15.910
I don't know if there's more women who've been oppressed than men who've been

223
00:12:15.911 --> 00:12:19.570
oppressed for a very good point.
So I would say that the entire history of,

224
00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.890
I mean you look at it this way,

225
00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:25.891
is that we oppress ourselves personally with our own malevolence and stupidity.

226
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.640
And then we're all oppressed by the kind of the crushing hand of the social

227
00:12:30.641 --> 00:12:34.120
world.
That molds us in one way and not in another.
And then of course,

228
00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:37.840
nature is doing her best all the time to give birth to us,

229
00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:41.890
but also to kill us and take us out.
And so there's this endless,

230
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.550
like there's this endless,
what would you call it?

231
00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:49.680
Vulnerability that characterizes our existence psychologically and socially and

232
00:12:49.681 --> 00:12:52.420
naturally.
And,
and I would say 150 years ago,

233
00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:54.640
that was even more intense than it was now.
You know,

234
00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:58.060
because the typical person in the west lived on less than a dollar a day before

235
00:12:58.061 --> 00:13:03.061
1895 and so the way I think that we should view the history of the world is that

236
00:13:03.821 --> 00:13:08.020
men and women labored under virtually impossible conditions for the entire bulk

237
00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:09.070
of human evolution.

238
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:13.120
And they did their best to cooperate and to compete,

239
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:17.380
but to cooperate so that they had some modicum,

240
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:21.970
some possibility of a modicum of security and satisfaction,

241
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.880
and that that's the right framework.
And then within that,

242
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:28.220
of course there's power games that are played by people who are corrupt.
Yeah.

243
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.470
Within that as horrible events taking place.
But there's a,

244
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:36.040
there's a massive amount of hypocritical thinking when you are criticizing the

245
00:13:36.041 --> 00:13:40.420
actions of so many people in and talking about how many people are complicit in

246
00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:43.840
these things while you're carrying around a phone that's made by someone who

247
00:13:43.841 --> 00:13:48.370
gets a dollar a day.
I was talking to a journalist in Slovenia,
uh,

248
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.550
who was a lefty and not a very sophisticated one.

249
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:55.210
And she was talking about the 1% and I said,
well,

250
00:13:55.211 --> 00:13:59.080
you know that if you make more than $32,000 a year that you're part of the 1%

251
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.500
she said,
well,
what do you mean?
I said,
well,
that's the worldwide statistic.

252
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.030
It's like,
so you're part of the 1% well,
she didn't.
First of all,
she said,
well,

253
00:14:07.031 --> 00:14:09.580
I don't believe that statistic.
And I thought,
well that's fine.

254
00:14:09.581 --> 00:14:13.870
You go look it up yourself.
But what was so interesting was that for her,

255
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.690
that characterization,

256
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.840
w the 1% victimizers was only relevant within the confines of her national

257
00:14:21.971 --> 00:14:24.760
border.
Right?
Soon as I said,
well no,

258
00:14:24.761 --> 00:14:27.760
it's all you have to do is expand that out a little bit and you're the problem

259
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:31.570
and not the solution then that was,
that was completely untenable for her.

260
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.900
She couldn't include herself in the population of victimizers.

261
00:14:34.901 --> 00:14:38.500
Even though you know she lives in a Western country and she's a well paid

262
00:14:38.501 --> 00:14:41.890
journalist and she's lived a very privileged life,
so to speak,

263
00:14:41.891 --> 00:14:45.900
by historical standards to someone living in the Congo or,
or,

264
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.920
or anybody living anywhere in the entire history of the human race up until,

265
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.500
right.
Yeah,
for sure.
If you make $34,000 today,

266
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:58.520
you absolutely are in the top 1% of everybody who's ever lived while of course,

267
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.210
of course.
Yes,
he is definitely,
especially given what you can buy with it.

268
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.840
The only reason to deny that is because it doesn't fit what you've come into.

269
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:09.650
The argument with.
It doesn't,
it doesn't fit your pre the the,
the,

270
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:14.130
the priest predisposed notion that you have the,

271
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.730
your idea that you're,
it's so rigid.

272
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:21.290
This idea that you are not one of the ones that it's the same.
That's right.

273
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:26.320
That's carrying that iPhone with that laptop and all these different things that

274
00:15:26.391 --> 00:15:29.660
you enjoy that are created by these corporations that you,

275
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.730
you support them financially,

276
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.010
but yet they're the ones that are destroying this earth.

277
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.950
These are the ones that you're rallying against these,

278
00:15:36.951 --> 00:15:39.020
the ones that you hate against.
Yeah.
Well,
the victim,

279
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:42.560
victimizer narrative only works if you assume that you're a victim.
Right?

280
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.900
And as soon as you assume that you're a victimizer,

281
00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:46.170
well then it's not so much fun.

282
00:15:46.171 --> 00:15:50.930
And one of the things I wrote the forward for the new version of,

283
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.960
of soldier Knutson's Gulag archipelago,
the abridged version,

284
00:15:53.961 --> 00:15:55.310
it came out November 1st.
