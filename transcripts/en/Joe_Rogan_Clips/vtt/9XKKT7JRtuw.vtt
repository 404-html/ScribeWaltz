1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
I mean,
you don't play MMA,
you know,
it's your life.
It's interesting too that Ali,

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.130
you know,
I always liked to watch that fight with um,

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.940
Jerry quarry because it was after three years off.
Yeah,
man.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.570
And you see his body looks different.
Yeah.
It just looks softer.

5
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.450
And if you see Ali versus like Cleveland Williams,

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.870
and then you see Ali three years later,
after all that time off,

7
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:24.420
he just doesn't look the same.
He was never really the same.
He wasn't.

8
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.490
When you think about why he did it,

9
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.520
imagine having the constitution to give away the prime of your fight in Korea

10
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.050
did not do that.

11
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.350
It's very special as they wanted them to fight in the Vietnam War.
It's like,

12
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:40.200
this is a bullshit bullshit.
None of them ever call it.
He said,

13
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:42.510
none of them ever called me the n word.
You know what I mean?

14
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.980
And I'm not going over there to do that.
They took three as prime,
yet,
you know,

15
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:48.750
you've got that window as a fighter man.

16
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:52.890
It's like four to six years and he and half of it was taken.

17
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.810
It's kind of amazing too that they did that and then they gave it back to him.

18
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.090
They let him fight again.
W I don't know.
What was the circumstances?

19
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:02.700
Like how did they reinstate his boxing?
I actually don't remember.

20
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.270
I don't know either.
But I remember when he fought Frazier,
I was like,
man,

21
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:08.790
I would've loved to see this fight three years ago.
Yeah,
man.

22
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.270
Cause he's just was a different guy by then,
was way too flat footed.

23
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:17.220
It just was a different guy.
Yeah.
I like,
well the Joe because Joe,

24
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.380
Joe and I really hated each other for real.
For Real.
Yeah.
Cause he was,
you know,

25
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:25.330
I leave with saying horrible,
horrible shit show.

26
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.310
He's trying to fuck with his head and that's how I do it.

27
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.660
He was the original shit.
Talk them.
And Man,
when you think about it,

28
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:35.190
it's like you see Conor and you're like that sadly.
Oh yeah.
You know what I mean?

29
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:39.080
For sure.
You know a lot of it like ric flair.
It's like I lay in red flag,

30
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.450
you know?
Yeah.
This is a little bit of both of them.
They're too,
well,

31
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:44.810
you remember when Henry Cooper knocked down Ali?

32
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.490
That was like the biggest thing in the UK.
I heard him bad and then and uh,

33
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.120
Angelo Dundee cut the gloves.
Yeah.
I mean if it wasn't for that move,

34
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.520
Ali could have lost by stoppage and absolutely.
Very easily.
Absolutely.

35
00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:03.330
I'll fucking craft graphite right on the fucking button and sat down.

36
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.990
He was on Queer Street.
Oh,
100%.
Yeah.
He had a house on Queer Street.

37
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.910
He was picking up the mail.
Here it is right here.
Boom.
Oops.

38
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.170
That again.
Punch that again.

39
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.240
I mean that is a fucking picture.
Perfect lefthand.
I mean,

40
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:21.750
look at him right on the button.
He is staggering back to his corner.

41
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:25.080
And it happened luckily for him at the very end of the round.

42
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.130
And I leave back then.
Right.
This was Cassius clay,
correct.

43
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.880
So this is before he fought.
What's it before he fought Sonny Liston?

44
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.210
I want to say it was.
It was,
yeah.

45
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.850
Ooh Man.
Who knows.
They cheated him know.
Yeah,
they did.

46
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.030
They cheated him.
It's different world.
Oh,
we gotta change gloves.

47
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.060
They give him a long ass time.
Oh,
we've got an undo.
These laces.
Cut this.

48
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.890
Cut this tape.
Brilliant though.
Yeah.
Wow.
Hey Angelo.
Dundee.
He wasn't a newcomer.

49
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.570
No,
it was not.
He knew what the fuck he was doing.
He was great man.
Yeah.

50
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.860
My favorite stoppage of all Ali's fights is Cleveland.

51
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:04.861
Big Cat Williams because he hit him with these just welterweight combinations.

52
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.020
Is anything being he did it pop up,
pop up?
Yeah.

53
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.660
I mean he was throwing it really.

54
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.670
I never saw anyone throw combinations heavyweight like that before.

55
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.890
Like Ray Robinson and the fluidity to fight up.
This was a,

56
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.760
it was one of my all time favorite cause Williams was a scary fucking dude too.

57
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.460
He was a big puncher and Ali was just light on his feet.

58
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.060
No one does that anymore.
Yeah.
And William just kept pressing forward,

59
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.810
pressing forward.
We'll leave.
Williams was a big puncher,
man.
He could crack.

60
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.080
He just couldn't find Ali and Ali was so loose in front of them.
We look at that.

61
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.280
[inaudible] had beautiful,

62
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.160
he's a shelf and on boom,
check,
left hook,
move around.
And then once,

63
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.410
once he started tuning them up,

64
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.790
the jab to the body and then back up top is beautiful man.
Oh Man.
Yeah,

65
00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:59.050
this is art.
This is art,
right?

66
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:02.620
It's hard because there was never a heavyweight that moved like this.

67
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:07.240
People have to realize this just didn't exist,
man.
And rarely does exist.

68
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.390
The only guy who moves even remotely like this today is Tyson fury.

69
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.980
Tyson fury can move.
He can,
you motherfucker can't dance.
He can,

70
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.680
he dances and he's six foot.
What?
Nine or eight or something should say,

71
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.110
I think he's huge.

72
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.190
He gets clipped a little too much for me and he definitely gets tagged.
Yeah,

73
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.270
he got,
he got tagged by God.
Steve Cunningham from Philly and dropped.

74
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.600
That's the cruiserweight cause even crate,

75
00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:36.250
I'm like always chin might not be all there.
Well you know what?

76
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:39.760
Cunningham's a shorter guy and sometimes for those really tall fighters it's

77
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:41.140
very difficult to punch down.

78
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.110
That's how Mike was getting over because he was in the chest and he was real.

79
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.660
I mean that head movement and the,
and the,
and the peekaboo that,
you know,

80
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:51.580
the custom model developed,
pulled up,

81
00:04:51.581 --> 00:04:54.580
put the end of that fight up so I could see the,
the,

82
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.250
the combinations that led to the stoppage.

83
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.350
See one once he had Williamson trouble go big screen.
I mean even their BombBomb.

84
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:03.760
Bombbomb.
Yeah.

85
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.860
Like once Williamson's face had been jabbed off and Joe,
the craziest thing,

86
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:09.431
a beautiful,

87
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:13.360
the craziest thing about him is everyone historically it has to sit down on

88
00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:17.500
their punches to get leverage on them.
And he did it.
He's dancing and yeah,

89
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:21.550
I'm on my BombBomb and well he wasn't trying to knock you out with every punch.

90
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:25.710
He was just cracking you pat,
Pat,
pat,
and where you're getting peppered,

91
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.530
that's fucking tough to deal with Ralph.
The deal,

92
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:32.170
it's frustrating because you're in your head.
You're like,

93
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:33.970
if I touched this motherfucker,
I'm gonna hurt them,

94
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:35.950
but you can't touch him and you just keep getting peppered.

95
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.850
Actually your legs start wobbling a little bit of fight.
Willie pep.
Yeah.

96
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:42.820
You know,
he was like,
he had the,
you know,

97
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.980
the foot work of Willie Pepin and a heavyweight I'm fucking heard of.

98
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.700
That's another guy that people forgot about.

99
00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:51.270
Willie pep was one of the rare guys that one around without throwing.

100
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.510
Throwing a punch.
Yes.
Yes.
What the fuck,
man.
Unbelievable.

101
00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.260
And a Daigo.
Yes,
indeed.
We had a lot of good ones back in the day.

102
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.970
Maybe not so much now Joseph.
Well,
we had a run.
We had lamato.

103
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.890
We Graziano well,
the community got established.
That's the problem.

104
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:14.360
People started doing well.
Exactly.
It gets off to exactly,
exactly.

105
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:19.300
The last guy we had was our total Gadi really rapping.
Yeah.
To really rapping,

106
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.330
you know?
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
that's how it goes though,
right?

107
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:25.630
The early immigrants,
the ones that get shit on,

108
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.450
they're the ones who come up strong.
They're tough fighters.
And then,
you know,

109
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:34.451
now it's Cubans and Russians and cause because you come from that rock,

110
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.300
that rush and amateur program,
like there's no fucking joke.
