00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.190
Little,
we've relaxed.
How did you ever do any fine?

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.540
I did kickboxing and how many tournaments I was,
uh,

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.760
I was pretty good at taekwondo.

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.790
I won a bunch of state championships and won a few national tournaments and you

5
00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:17.250
know,
you wanted to get physical in another human being and do this stuff,

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.860
you know,
you can't be in right frame of mind and want to do this stuff.

7
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.030
Got To realize that I was this stuff and not in the right frame of mind and half

8
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.890
dealing with fear drives you insane.
Deal with that.
Drives people insane.

9
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.060
I was insane during my career.
Yes.
Madly and stain from fear.
Yeah.

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.180
Obviously I never went through anything like the level that you went through,

11
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:40.410
but for these full contact taekwondo fights,
I was always scared and uh,

12
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.800
but I was scared before that I was bullied.
I moved around a lot.

13
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.630
I was a little kid,
I was never very big.

14
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.580
And we moved from New Jersey to San Francisco when I was seven,

15
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:53.700
from San Francisco to Florida when I was 11,

16
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:56.730
Florida to Boston when I was 14 or 13.

17
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.930
So it's just always moving to new schools,
always deal with new kids.

18
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:04.410
And I wasn't big and I didn't know how to fight and I got picked on and I didn't

19
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:07.320
like it.
So I said,
I wanna,
I wanna figure out how to fight.

20
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.710
And so I started getting into martial arts and I just became obsessed with it.

21
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:14.150
I did it every day I start teaching.
I was teaching at Boston University.

22
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:18.210
I was teaching a taekwondo course when I was 19 I was competing from the time I

23
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.950
was 15 I just threw myself into it.

24
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:22.740
It's all I did every day I worked at the school.
I was there every day.

25
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.860
I had the keys.
I closed up,
I opened up where I am because of you,

26
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.650
because you hearing about you when you were running in the morning,

27
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.080
when you knew that everybody else was asleep,
that gave you an edge.

28
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.570
I go there in the middle of the night and open up and work out.

29
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.480
I just wanted to just have an edge,
you know,

30
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:37.890
and I've listened to what you said and I said,

31
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:40.410
that's a great way to have an edge.
I became obsessed with it,

32
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.120
but there was no future in it.

33
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:46.890
And then what happened was I went from taekwondo to kickboxing and when I

34
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:50.070
started kickboxing,
I started getting fucked up.

35
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.620
Do's are beating the shit out of me because I was realizing like,

36
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:55.500
I can't keep people at the same distance anymore cause I didn't know how to use

37
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:59.340
my hands properly.
I knew how to throw some punches a little bit from taekwondo,

38
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:02.550
but it's not nearly as sophisticated as boxing or kickboxing.

39
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.940
And so then I started kickboxing training and then I started realizing like,

40
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.070
there's no future in this.
Like,
what am I doing?

41
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:10.510
I'm just getting my brains beat in,
you know,
and um,

42
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.420
hard sparring to the spark was rough.
It was Boston style.

43
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.890
Put the gloves on,
beat the shit out of each other,
figure it out as you go along.

44
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.940
Ain't going shit
out as you go along.
So a lot of headaches and you know,

45
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.960
but it was,
um,
it was hard for me to,
to shut that,

46
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.650
that part of me off the part of me that just wanted to conquer the part of me

47
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.200
just wanting to win all the time to figure out a way to be more intense,

48
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.030
more driven,
more focused.
But when I did stop fighting,
it was a huge relief.

49
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.770
Like the relief part was worth the extra anxiety that I got.

50
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.290
It was worth it just for the relief of not,

51
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.020
not thinking about fighting all the time,

52
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.830
not thinking about when's the next tournament,
when's the next event?

53
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.720
When's the next thing I'm doing?
It was just down in FPT.
Wait,
well,
for you,

54
00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:00.150
it had to be way crazier because not only is it the weight,

55
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.040
it's the heavyweight championship of the world.

56
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.710
I always wanted to make my mentor happy.
Yeah.
