1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.470
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.220
<v 1>It's not about being a pure tin.
It's not about being anti porn.</v>

3
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.000
It's nothing wrong with the lusting after a woman's tits and a woman's ass.

4
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:11.320
There's nothing wrong with that.

5
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.320
And there's nothing wrong with a woman wanting to be fucked by a man.

6
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.140
Those are normal things.
They're sublet.
Okay.

7
00:00:17.141 --> 00:00:21.910
And don't let people hijack that movement and try to use it for puritanism.

8
00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:25.060
Cause this is what a lot of people are doing.
Shit,
piss fuck on Cock sucker,

9
00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:28.610
motherfucker and tits.
I'm triggered.
I hope you're triggered to,

10
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.300
<v 0>yeah,
I mean,
absolutely.
I mean,
I think that what,</v>

11
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.910
what we're dealing with is an exposure of sexual assault,

12
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.860
exposure of a sexual harassment,
sexual assault,
particularly in the workplace.

13
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.551
You know,

14
00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:45.210
and this is a giant issue for people that have to work alongside men and women.

15
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:48.960
And they develop these little communities inside these little boxes that we call

16
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:51.990
offices.
And things get really fucking weird.
And if you have a boss,

17
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:52.860
it's a piece of shit.

18
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.770
And he's constantly harassing the women that worked there and it becomes a

19
00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:58.720
living hell with them.
This stress they're going through.
I mean,
it is a crime.

20
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.920
You're doing something to those people that work there.
You're,
you're,
you're,

21
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.010
you're putting this pressure on them.
You're fucking up their life.

22
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.170
Could you imagine doing,
can you eat?

23
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.980
The last thing I would ever want to do was imposed myself sexually and a woman

24
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:15.300
who didn't want it.
Right?
While you're a healthy person,
like some people,

25
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:17.970
it's just about getting to the end goal.

26
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.070
<v 1>Well,
we've all been drunk,
right?</v>

27
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.350
We've all been on a date or a woman didn't want to have sex and we did and we

28
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.360
pushed the issue.
But,

29
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.033
<v 2>uh,</v>

30
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.340
<v 1>you know,
I,
I just can't imagine,
like,
I just never days k,
I don't get that.</v>

31
00:01:33.341 --> 00:01:36.640
She doesn't like you.
Oh,
I'm going to make her go feel uncomfortable.
Like,

32
00:01:36.641 --> 00:01:38.800
what the fuck do you get out of that?
That's just weird.

33
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.630
<v 0>Well,
there's people that hate the opposite sex.
I mean,</v>

34
00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:44.270
and I say the opposite sex.
I don't mean just men who hate women.

35
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:45.290
There's women who hate man.

36
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:50.291
There's people who have associated the opposite sex with rejection and pain and

37
00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:54.410
frustration all of their life.
You look at a guy like Harvey Weinstein,

38
00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:58.790
that is an ugly fat guy,
right?
There's no women who are lusting after him.

39
00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:03.020
It was his power and his money that got him into a position where he could get

40
00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:07.340
some pussy and then having power over all these actresses and then hearing

41
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.270
whether it's Ooma Thurman or whatever,
you know,

42
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:13.130
famous actress Salma Hayek,

43
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.870
all these superstars who are fighting this guy off in hotel rooms.
I mean,

44
00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:20.270
it's fucking crazy,
man.
He is a maniac,

45
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.450
but he's a disgusting guy who has no shot at getting someone to appreciate him

46
00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:29.570
physically.
They might like his personality,

47
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:33.740
but for someone to be physically attracted to him as almost impossible,
right?

48
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.350
I mean,
he's eaten himself into this disgusting shape.

49
00:02:36.351 --> 00:02:38.000
Unless you have a fetish or whatever.
Yeah,

50
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:40.550
you might just end up getting fucked by job of the hut,

51
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:45.200
just big fat guy with pockmarked skin shooting loads all over you.

52
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.700
There's no way it makes any sense.

53
00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:49.830
But if you're just going to put you in Ocean's 11 you got to do what you gotta

54
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.650
do.
Well,
you know,

55
00:02:54.651 --> 00:02:56.230
Matt Damon,
what did,

56
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.350
what did Matt Damon say that they were trying to get him out of that new oceans

57
00:02:59.351 --> 00:02:59.820
movie?

58
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.031
<v 1>Well,</v>

59
00:03:00.031 --> 00:03:03.030
it didn't he say something about there's a key to continuum or something that,

60
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.400
that everything is Harvey Weinstein.
Wasn't that it

61
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.690
<v 0>don't remember the exact quote,</v>

62
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:12.691
but it was something along the lines of we have to make a differentiation

63
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:17.530
between sexual assault and,
and men hitting on women.

64
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.640
What's really interesting is seeing how they're acting,
uh,
about this in France,

65
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:24.030
in Europe,
a lot of women,
especially older actress.

66
00:03:24.031 --> 00:03:26.330
Did you see stuff that you see that's wild.

67
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.590
I want men to be men and in France,

68
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.340
I mean that they're just France part home.
Uh,
they're just different over there.

69
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:35.890
This,
there,
they have a different attitude.
The same as Brazil.

70
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.660
My friend Tiago a from Brazil told me once,
he's like,
man,
he goes,

71
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:43.540
if you're in Brazil,
and he goes,
if you're with a girl,
you don't try to fuck her.

72
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:45.400
She's like,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

73
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.680
Like you're not even trying to fuck me.
Like,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

74
00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:50.260
Still get mad at you like,

75
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.770
like they appreciate like in Brazil is a very aggressive,

76
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.810
I have sexually aggressive place.

77
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.670
<v 1>I,
I have had,
uh,</v>

78
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.570
I'll never forget I was working in comedy club and there was a girl there who

79
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:03.870
was beautiful and um,

80
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.980
she flirted with me and uh,
well I,

81
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.120
I didn't know if she was flirting with me cause I was just,

82
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.660
she was just beautiful and she talked to me.
So I'm like,
oh right.
And so,

83
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:15.270
but I wasn't going to make a move at her because I'm,

84
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.030
I'm considering every comedian who comes in,

85
00:04:17.031 --> 00:04:20.190
this club makes a move on this girl cause she's the prettiest girl around.
Right.

86
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.720
So I didn't do anything cause I want to be that guy.

87
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.840
And then I never forget by the end of the week,

88
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.500
it was the last night and she's like,
Hey,
there's a party at my house tonight.

89
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.130
Are you going to come?
And I was like,
oh sure.
Right.
So I went to their whatever,

90
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.850
cut to,
I'm leaving and she goes,

91
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:39.160
are you fucking kidding me?
And I go,
what?
She goes,

92
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:41.890
I threw a party just to get you to my apartment and you're going to leave.

93
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.990
And I was like,
Oh really?
You want to?
And so we had sex.
Damn.

94
00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:48.840
She had a beat you over the head with it.
Yeah.
So that's,

95
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.530
so there was a woman who was,

96
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:54.750
but you didn't want to be the guide that was super aggressive against a girl,

97
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.850
a girl that was like,
Hey,
I just like you.
Yeah.

98
00:04:56.851 --> 00:04:59.410
It was just fun guy to hang out with.
Does everything have to be sex?

99
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.510
And I know every guy in the world hit on her.

100
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.020
<v 0>You know what I honestly,
I mean,
I don't want to say this because</v>

101
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.410
it's almost like in this day and age,

102
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.110
you got to get to know someone forever before you fuck them.
I mean,

103
00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:10.980
literally forever.

104
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.220
<v 1>You got trying to fuck my wife the first night we went out.
Good.
Good for you.</v>

105
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.780
And she wouldn't,
uh,
which is probably worked out cause we're still together.

106
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.370
And uh,
but I kept,
I did it in a charming way.
Right,
right.

107
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.300
I would say,
honey,
I,

108
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.300
<v 0>let me ask you this.
Why did you try to fuck her on the first night?</v>

109
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:30.220
But it took you five nights for the waitress

110
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.920
<v 1>because I didn't want to be that guy at the car.</v>

111
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.020
Cause I think cause it's a work environment.
Yeah.

112
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.870
So you're the opposite of a sexual harasser?
I guess so.

113
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.740
I guess now that I look at it that way,
yeah.
Not that I did it.
You're sensitive.

114
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.830
Not that you weren't attracted to her,
you just didn't want to be a dick.
Yeah.

115
00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:46.750
I didn't want to have that reputation of that guy.

116
00:05:46.751 --> 00:05:49.150
And plus there's plenty of women in the audience.

117
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.670
I know there's plenty of women.
Right.
So,
uh,
what I would tell her,

118
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:58.810
I remember the first night we were together,
I was like,
Hey,
um,
I know,
uh,

119
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.680
I know you're going to say you want me to go home,

120
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:02.450
but you're going to worry that I'm too tired to drive.

121
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:04.640
And then I might get in an accident.
So you don't have to say that.

122
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.480
I'll just stay.
That's hilarious.
She's like,
no,
it's okay.
I go,

123
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:11.300
it's nice of you to say that you're strong,
you're brave.

124
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.580
And I know you're going to worry.
So I'm just staying.

125
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.990
I think I did end up staying,
but we didn't have sex.
Right.

126
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.160
And I like probably two more times,
two more times like that.

127
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.330
But also it's,

128
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.560
you don't really know someone's personality for a long time.

129
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.630
I mean that's part of the problem.

130
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.250
The problem is people have physical needs and they get attracted to each other.

131
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:32.540
And the next thing you know,
look,

132
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.530
there's been many times in my life where I wound up having sex with somebody who

133
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:40.220
turned out to be crazy.
And then you know,
you're one,
two dates in you like,

134
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:43.400
guess she seems cool and next thing you know you're hanging out in a week or two

135
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:45.620
later and she does something completely fucking insane.

136
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.340
And then the crazy just starts leaking out of her pores and you're like,
oh,

137
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.350
well now what have I done?

138
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.610
I've been tangled myself with some person who knows where I live and expects me

139
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:59.180
to call them every day and we're going to get together and I have to figure out

140
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:00.410
a way to back out of this.

141
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.380
