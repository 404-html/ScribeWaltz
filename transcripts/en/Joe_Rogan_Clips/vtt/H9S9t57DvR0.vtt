1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.120
I did General Hospital and let me tell you something,

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.810
if I would've gotten off a plane and on General Hospital,

3
00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:10.500
I would've gotten fired.
Thank God.

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.740
I was P at 12 and 13 years and I knew my way around the set it.

5
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.770
You know when you book a soapbox but nobody talks to you.
You do know that.
Yeah.

6
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.860
Like you walk into seep ABC over there and oh God street.

7
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:26.694
You walk in,

8
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.590
they will get your id and then go go to room 27 you go to your office,

9
00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:35.700
you fucking your suits.
That when I saw the lady comes in and she goes,

10
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:37.050
how you doing?
My name is Mildred.

11
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.940
Watch the TV and look for your numbers to come up.

12
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.910
So you sit down and you write your numbers.

13
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:49.911
I'm in the scene 27 chapter eight and you sit there with wardrobe on,

14
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.710
but you would,

15
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.740
I would go there at eight o'clock and I'd be in my car and a quarter at a time.

16
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.870
Really?
How many soap operas?
General Hospital.
Three episodes.

17
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.790
I find that

18
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.530
three episodes and general hospital's amazing.

19
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.570
I played a recovering fucking preacher who had been in prison and I came out and

20
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:15.870
now I was a fucking marriage thing,
bro.
When they called me,

21
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.930
they called me and they're like,
we're interested in you sending a real.

22
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.670
And I'm like,
wait,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
So Benjamin Bratt,

23
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.510
those good looking dudes.
They started on general hospital and you want me,

24
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.110
I generalize.
Fuck.
Are you fucking crazy?
I sent them a real,

25
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.760
I swear to God.
My agent's like,
they really want your real Joey.

26
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.640
What do you want me to do,
man?
Go send it to.
What do you want me to do?

27
00:01:37.641 --> 00:01:39.960
It never going to hire me,
bro.
They called right back.

28
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.510
Come on down for three days.
Wow.
You walk in there,
Joe Rogan,

29
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:50.070

You're 10 minutes away.

31
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.340
You put whatever wardrobe they give your on.
They have cue cards for you.

32
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.530
Uh,
they have a year under a fucking under the cameras.
It's a three camera shoot.

33
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.390
You go out that says,

34
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.340

Very nice to meet you.
Okay,

35
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.880
Boom,

boom,
boom.
Let's say you fuck up your line.

36
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.980
They don't give a fuck like I'm you start from all are now starting from that

37
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:27.810
line.
Bop,
Bop,

bop,
bop,
bop,
bop,
cut.
Moving ahead in Austin,

38
00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:31.530
they switch you out,
blah blah blah.
They put makeup on you and they're like,

39
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.620
you're not in the scene.
Just sit over here for five minutes bro.

40
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.500
Five minutes they come right back to you.
All right,
you're ready.

41
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.490
You're in the same three and you're like,
what the fuck does that pop?
Pop,

42
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:44.850
pop,
pop,
pop by Bob,
your wrap.
Thank you for coming down.

43
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.700
Nobody talks to you and nobody does nothing.

44
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.000
So it's not a,
they're just trying to get it out quick.
They don't hold Jan.

45
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:57.420
It's eight to five.
Wow.
Being on a soap opera,

46
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.330
it's probably the easiest.
Like have you landed on General Hospital?

47
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.440
You can be on general hospital,
but there he is.
That dude's but on ever 30 years,

48
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.520
you know you could be on there.
People been on it for a long time.

49
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.680
It's eight to five in your hospital.
Is that Luke and Laura?
I was.

50
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.250
That was Luke and Laura.
Right.
Remember Luke and Laura do that?
It was one.

51
00:03:19.251 --> 00:03:20.370
I got it to happen.

52
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.660
There was a thing that happened in and soap operas and it happened while I was a

53
00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:24.380
kid.

54
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.380
Luke and Laura transcended general hospital and became a thing all throughout

55
00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:32.510
the world.
These people,
well,
yeah,

56
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.280
these people didn't make sense because the dude's hair was weird and it was a

57
00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:40.730
strange cup.
All the scene with dog.
They were weird.
Yeah,

58
00:03:40.731 --> 00:03:43.100
I did the scene with him.
She was a little too hot for him.

59
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.390
It didn't make a whole lot of sense,
but it worked for whatever reason,

60
00:03:47.391 --> 00:03:51.110
it caught fire culturally and became a big thing and I think I was in high

61
00:03:51.111 --> 00:03:54.920
school at the time.
Their wedding,
it was in 1983 okay.
Yeah,

62
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.290
so I was in high school while I was in high school.

63
00:03:57.291 --> 00:04:00.950
This was all going down and everybody paid attention to Luke and Laura.

64
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.280
It was like the general hospital thing took over the country.

65
00:04:04.281 --> 00:04:07.670
It was like in the cover of people magazine and Shit.
It was everywhere.

66
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.990
It was just one weird relationship on a soap opera for some reason.

67
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.630
Just became this gigantic phenomenon that everybody was watching.
I mean,

68
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.680
I was watching it.
I would like I said,
30 million viewers.
Crazy.

69
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.480
What was,
what was the show with the good look of singer?

70
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.680
I wish that she was Jessie's girl.
Oh,
Rick Springfield.
General Hospital.

71
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.670
Same Shit.
And I watched that,
but it wasn't even him.
See if him,

72
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.610
if he was with Laura,
I watched that before.

73
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.910
He's a handsome son of a bitch that Rick Springfield,
you know,

74
00:04:37.911 --> 00:04:39.080
and he was a double threat.

75
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.580
He was on general hospital and he was a bad ass singer.
That Jessie's girl,

76
00:04:43.581 --> 00:04:47.540
that song,
if you're at fucking like wild wings and Jessie's girl comes on,

77
00:04:47.541 --> 00:04:49.350
you're getting silent getting of it.

78
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.550
Jesse is,
he's still out there hitting it.
Still touring.

79
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.800
You still tour?
I think he was at the Canyon Club in a Gora

80
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.470
is out there.
That dude was a,
when I was in high school,

81
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.110
that dude was on top of the fucking food chain.

82
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.330
Every girl at a poster hill on the wall.
He's in Lake Tahoe next month,
February.

83
00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:13.140
Good for him.

84
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.140
It's crazy that whatever soap opera was on from 12 to one was a big time soap

85
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:23.700
opera and there was a bar in New York and there was a bar in New Jersey and my

86
00:05:23.701 --> 00:05:28.701
neighborhood that if you walked in there from 12 to one and you said a word,

87
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.700
somebody would tell you to shut the fuck up and it was 98% men and they would

88
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:39.210
serve lunch and it was the one I would go to was the midtown lounge,

89
00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:40.410
but there was another one.

90
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:44.910
So there was a lunchtime soap opera that men left Ed jobs,

91
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.770
full construction guys and they would sit down and watch this soap opera on two

92
00:05:49.771 --> 00:05:52.950
TVs like it was a Yankee game.
What the fuck?

93
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.990
And then they will go back to work.

94
00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.170
No strange is that,
how strange is that?
That was a thing.

95
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:03.150
It was like one point and I still remember,

96
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.190
you know if you dated a girl and she stayed in on Wednesdays to watch dynasty

97
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:11.420
bitch,
you stayed in on dynasty night.
If that's what it meant to go to get them.

98
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.440
Nikki cookie.
Dot.
Makes sense for like today it's translatable.
You know,

99
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:18.020
Sunday night game of Thrones is on or whenever night it's on.

100
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.320
It's like people do get together and they watch it live as it goes on.

101
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:23.000
That makes sense.
What doesn't make sense?

102
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:28.001
Is that the market for those kinds of soap operas was it,

103
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.030
it was appealing to men and high school kids.
Like we were all watching it.

104
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.540
Who shot jr Bro.
That's Dallas.
But that's a no,
no,
no,
I understand.

105
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.560
Now we're talking to then not only were they sucking you in the daytime in those

106
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.100
days,
this was all the eighties were talking about the eighties correct.
Okay.

107
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.870
What the fuck was going on at night?
All right.
You had Dallas and you had,

108
00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:56.150
what was the one on ABC?
Uh,

109
00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.370
with Alexis Carrington Dynasty and the guy is Steve.

110
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.220
That was bad as a bad ass shit.
That girl right now,

111
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.530
the check who played the princess on that,

112
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:11.190
that was supposed to be Alexis's daughter and she was having an affair with

113
00:07:11.441 --> 00:07:14.200
Dexter Dexter.
She's the one right now.

114
00:07:14.201 --> 00:07:18.400
That's going through that thing with her daughter and the sex ring up in

115
00:07:18.401 --> 00:07:23.400
Connecticut.
There was like a sex ring,
Novo or whatever.
Like a,
she's a princess.

116
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.660
Real life unconscious.
Yes.

117
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.110
She's the one that's going through all that with the daughter.

118
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.630
I remember her being on dynasty has a hot hot,

119
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.300
and she was Alexis,
his daughter,

120
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.980
but Dexter Dexter was Alexis Alexis's husband.
She had some Dex,

121
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.650
Dex,
Dexter.
I've been a real name is that,
look at that cast.

122
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.080
Joan Collins.
She's still hot back then.
She's the original mouth,
right?
Yeah,

123
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.590
for sure.
