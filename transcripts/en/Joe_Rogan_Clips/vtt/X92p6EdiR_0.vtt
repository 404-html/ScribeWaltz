00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.660
Now,
is apple willing to share that with you?
I mean,
when you,

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:06.680
when you're talking about biometrics,
fingerprints or face,

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.750
<v 1>no,
not the,
not the data.</v>

4
00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:12.920
It's just the operating system verifies that there's an individual as an

5
00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:17.180
individual and it's unlocking,
you know,
like,
like,
um,
you know,
when,

6
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.470
when you use the,
um,
our,
our cash app uses us,
right?
So squares,
cash app,

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.890
um,
when you want to make a transfer to someone,

8
00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:27.890
when you want to send someone money or when you want to buy Bitcoin,

9
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.310
we turn on face id and you verify that you are you and you are the owner of the

10
00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:37.310
phone and then it goes,
we don't get images of your face.

11
00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:41.020
We don't see who you are.
Oh,
that's what you want me to think.
I know

12
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.250
that's how locked down by the operating system and that's what it should be.

13
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.520
Right?
Sure.
Um,
what,

14
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.540
has there ever been any consideration to not allowing people to post
anonymously?

15
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.200
Well,
let's see.
Well,

16
00:00:57.201 --> 00:00:59.810
I like what you said earlier about journalists and whistle blowers.

17
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.830
That is political.

18
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.780
So look at a look at platforms that have a real names policy look at Facebook,

19
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.280
right?
Or the problems that need different.

20
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.990
I don't know cause I don't go there but for I understand there's a lot of,

21
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.110
still a lot of arguing there.
It's the same at a political argument,

22
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.020
the same vectors,
same patterns.

23
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.140
It's like older in general it seems.

24
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.920
I also am not really hanging out there but it seems a little bit older.

25
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.520
It's a lot of grammys looking at pictures of their kids,
grandkids and stuff.

26
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.400
And that's what it was made for it,
it's connecting,

27
00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:33.110
it's connecting with the people that you know and,

28
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:35.240
and that to me is the biggest difference for Twitter.

29
00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:36.590
It's connecting with the people you don't know.

30
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.840
When you find interesting and like it's around,

31
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.950
it's around topics and stuff that you find a,
that you want to learn more about.

32
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.060
<v 0>When you saw Zuckerberg testifying and in realizing like how this platform is</v>

33
00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:50.520
being used and what are the dangers of this.

34
00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:54.660
And then you see these senators that really don't know what the fuck the

35
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:59.661
technology is or it's w w it really highlights how we're entering into this.

36
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.210
Really.
Yeah.
Well not just a gap,

37
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.100
a gap in the critical understanding of how these things work and what they are

38
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.420
in in terms of like how these really important politicians who are the ones who

39
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:19.071
are making these decisions as to whether or not someone has violated laws or

40
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:21.810
whether or not something should be curbed or regulated.

41
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.240
They don't really even understand what they're talking about.

42
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.970
<v 1>No,
I mean there's,
there's a few people do because they're not,</v>

43
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.800
they're not using it directly.

44
00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:34.060
They're not using in the way that people are using it every single day and don't

45
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.480
have the same experience that people have every single day.
And you know,
in,

46
00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:43.481
in terms of regulatory and our regulators and our governments,

47
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.230
I,
you know,
we,

48
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.940
I think the conversation is often about how regulators will come in and start

49
00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:50.930
writing rules and,

50
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.740
and setting expectations for how companies or services might behave.

51
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:59.060
But there's a role for the company to educate and there's a role for the company

52
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.560
to educate on like what technology makes possible,

53
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:07.060
whether it be positive and also some of the negatives that that become possible

54
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:11.230
as well.
So I think we have a role to,
to help educate and to,

55
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:15.970
and to help make sure that we're,
you know,
really we're,
we're,

56
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:19.780
we're pushing towards what I think the job of regular regulator is,

57
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:20.740
which is number one,

58
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.270
protect the individual number to level the playing field and make sure that

59
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:30.040
those two things are not compromised by special interests trying to protect

60
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:34.090
their own domain or profits or,
or,
uh,

61
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.670
dominance within a particular market.
What do you mean by level?

62
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:41.671
The playing field of the playing field so that a individual has the same

63
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.990
opportunity,
uh,
that,
uh,
someone else might have,
our company might have.

64
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.950
So,
okay.
So like anybody who went to account,

65
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.270
anyone can have a Twitter account and you know,
they have,
uh,
at least,
uh,

66
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.510
you know,
an equal opportunity to contribute to it.

67
00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:01.960
And whatever they do with it will change the,
change the outcome.

68
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:05.770
Some people might become very popular because they're saying stuff people want

69
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:06.011
to hear.

70
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:09.310
Some people won't see any following whatsoever because they're not adding

71
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:12.810
anything original or interesting or,
or,
uh,
we're,

72
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.530
we're different in terms of perspective.
