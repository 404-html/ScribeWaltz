1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.870
Full time.
No,
no,
no.
Like battlefield earth there,
you know?
Yeah,
you're,

2
00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:04.880
you're fucking that fucking

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.990
Trump gave NASA a whole shit load of money in like $19 billion and said,
okay,

4
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:15.780
here's the money,
but we're going to fucking know.
Let's go to the moon.
So they,

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.250
they started a campaign to go to the moon and they just canceled the mission.

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.010
Why?
Oh No,
no,
no.
They didn't cancel the mission.

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.480
They canceled the Moon Rover cancels.
I'm talking about as a camp.

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.740
They canceled the,
the construction of the moon and everybody's confused.

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.800
They don't know how they did that because this is like the last moon rover that

10
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:34.710
they,
unless they have some new top secret moon rover that they won't,

11
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:35.970
don't want to let anybody know about it.

12
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:38.940
Maybe they found some new cool shift maybe.
Probably.

13
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.570
Yeah.
Maybe they can't go.
If we really did match up,
said,

14
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.900
let's go.
And I'm like,
okay,
give us the money.
Let's figure it out.
Okay,

15
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:52.590
we'll figure it out.
We've got 19 billion.
Imagine if we really didn't find out.

16
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.140
Nobody else is working on it.
Putting a on the rover on the moon,
but and the,

17
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.330
and the NASA wasn't either until Trump said,
here's the money,

18
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.350
let's go to the fucking moon.
And then we're going to Mars.
She matched.

19
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:06.690
If Trump goes on TV and says,
there's lot of things talk about,

20
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.050
one of them is it's terrible tragedy.
We've never been to the moon,

21
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:14.910
ladies and gentlemen.
That's some shit he would do.
Yeah,
he doesn't know.

22
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.170
He doesn't know.

23
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.230
How do you know he doesn't let them know he's too busy with those friends with

24
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:24.210
Alex Challenge.
He's a legit crazy talk that much because he can't,
they can't.

25
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:26.400
Everywhere they go.
They're wearing wires.
Everyone's wearing a wire.

26
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.600
Their phones are being tapped.
Ain't on is Qa and heard about that.

27
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.470
It's crazy shit.
What is it?

28
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.600
Qa non is someone in the Trump administration but people think it's someone in

29
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:43.470
intelligence in the military who's dropping all these clues on four Chan and

30
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:45.570
eight Chan.
So the whole thing is,
is it real?

31
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:48.910
Is it disinflation if someone's playing a trick but it's he,

32
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.280
he legally can't say what's going on behind the scenes.
Another leg lock.

33
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.050
Look at this.
He legally can't say he's getting it because it's against the law.

34
00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:00.450
So he,
he's dropping all these clues and it's a,

35
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:04.260
it's someone named Q Anan and it's been going on for about three months and

36
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:06.860
there's all these people in the underground.
Uh,

37
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.280
basically he's saying trust the president.

38
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.790
It's going to take a while to take down all these,
uh,

39
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.880
corrupt people at the top of the FBI and the Department of Justice and all the

40
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:19.620
shit.
We're going to take them down one by one.

41
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.290
So He's been dropping all these clues on how they're going to do it.

42
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.650
It's pretty interesting.
You listen to it every day has drops every day and it's,

43
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.030
it's like,
uh,
it gets addicting,
but you don't know if it's real or not.

44
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.600
Like is it,
is it disinformation?
It's called Q Anan and Pete,

45
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.930
he makes drops every day and leaves all these clues of what's going on behind

46
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:40.140
the scenes.
No one can trace back to find out who he is or anything like that.
No,

47
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.830
I think on four Chan or eight Chan,
isn't it?
Like,
if you can,

48
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.460
you can hackers know how to drop information information without being tracked.

49
00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:51.510
Right.
For sure.
Right.
Is that,
that's what's going on on,
I know you have,
right?

50
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.520
Yeah.
There's a bunch of posts about it,
but who knows if it's real or not,
but,

51
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.630
but the people that,
I mean,
there's people who,

52
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.540
there's a guy named Jerome Corsi who works for Alex Jones,

53
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:05.620
who that's his job is to analyze what's all of these clues of what's going on,

54
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.230
what Trump is doing behind the scenes,
because he's got the media,

55
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.110
all the entire media,
Hollywood FBI.

56
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.030
And what they're finding out is they're finding text messages and emails going

57
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:18.260
back and forth,
uh,

58
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.910
between key people,
uh,

59
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.320
running the government colluding to destroy Trump.

60
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.450
That's what's going on.
So for sure,

61
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:33.451
it's a crazy shooting him around people that have been in politics forever,

62
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.250
they didn't think he was going to win.

63
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:40.120
So they did all this shit thinking Hillary was gonna win.
But now that he won,

64
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.960
they're going back and looking at all the text messages from all of these super

65
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:47.170
powerful people.
People are,
are,
are resigning.

66
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.880
It's crazy shit going on and most people don't know.

67
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.640
It's like game of Thrones for real.
You're not.

68
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:56.630
Game of Thrones has like 50 characters and it would take you about a month to to

69
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.650
to catch up on what's going on.
There's just so much going on.

70
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.360
That's what's going on.
There's a game of Thrones going on right now,

71
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.980
but the media is only going to tell you their side and then Qa non is dropping

72
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:11.560
the behind the scenes clues it was,
but it's pretty fascinating.

73
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.610
Arm Triangle here.

74
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.800
There's another hundred percent it's all standing on hundred percent it's over a

75
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.760
hundred percent of the camera.
Oh,
go back to the camera.
He's talking to him.

76
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.930
You should jump to full guard.
You should jump to full guard.

77
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.270
Why do you think this has definitely done?
It's so deep in,

78
00:04:28.271 --> 00:04:30.490
the guy's not doing anything with his left hand while he wasn't,

79
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.330
if he just jumps forward.
There you go.
Okay.
It's over now.

80
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.950
It's no way.
No Way.
He's going to say no way.
No Way.
