WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.280
The joe rogan experience.
Yeah,
let's talk about that one because what we got,

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.750
we had video of that one too.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.520
You went undercover with the Antifa and uh,

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.770
that fucking,
that one was disturbing to me because,
uh,

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.030
first of all you look like slide right in like a glove buddy.

6
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:22.530
Like I was almost matching the guy when I got there.
Guy,
Gal,
we don't know.
Um,

7
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:25.110
and I thought our costume wardrobe lady had actually just,

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.010
just stolen his clothes because it was almost identical to what he was wearing.

9
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:31.680
Isn't it though that when you were a slender man,

10
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.330
like people assume many things.
Oh yeah.
I can get away with so much crap.

11
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.600
That weird.
Yeah.
Well like what is it about slender people?

12
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.220
There's something there,
right?

13
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:44.730
Like what is it about slender people that are almost always left wing weakness?

14
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.490
Whoa.
You think so?
Sorry.

15
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.590
It could be the same reason they see the American flag is right wing.

16
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.900
They see this,
this,
you must be the Third Reich.
Did I say third wreck?

17
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:01.200
I don't even know what it is.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's right.
I Dunno.

18
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.620
I don't know what happened.
Designs,
check them out on that is really,

19
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.570
it's actually really nice and that turnaround is that steel?
Yeah,

20
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.010
that's pretty cool.
Guy makes them.
That's it.
That's it.
I can usually,

21
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.890
I can usually tell when someone's approaching us,

22
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:13.560
if they're friendly or fell by their posture and their body size,

23
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.320
the guy walks in,
your body says,
I'm like,
oh,
that's probably a friendly guy like

24
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.770
queer looking at hundred and 40 pound man like myself.
Approaches and like,
ah,

25
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:23.720
we got to get out of dodge.

26
00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:28.470
He has a shank or screwdriver because I had done you pass it out.

27
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.320
I did so many shotguns an hour ago.
I know it.

28
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.670
I know I didn't go because I was like,

29
00:01:32.671 --> 00:01:35.010
I had done two and now I get made every time I go out after you know,

30
00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:37.860
you dressed as a trainee and you need to be Wendy Davis.
My wig flies off.

31
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.150
She still goes along with it.
I'm on every night.

32
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.520
You got to go in there on a technical level.
Also didn't want to pull it.

33
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:47.970
The seal team six mission between Wednesday and Friday shelf.
So it's true,

34
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.790
but what happened is then when you were in,
you wanted to go back.
That's true.

35
00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:55.620
I was juiced.
How did it get site explained to me how it got set up,

36
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.100
how you did it.
Like what?
What,
what was the meeting balls of stuck boss.
Well,

37
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.290
I mean these kind of,

38
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.080
these things are much different than the Burlington Vermont kind of gigs.

39
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:04.890
I mean that was a throwaway.

40
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.260
This one took months of planning as RegEd to especially to a,

41
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.130
to infiltrating the backend of Antifa red and red.
We call him Richard.

42
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.680
We have a guy who does research for us.
Ah,
don't make it,

43
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:20.680
I won't get into anything specific,
but he is only the high level professor.
Okay.

44
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.450
He has a,
he has a 650 pound squat.

45
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.450
She's like Bain and real life and a brilliant,

46
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.330
he was the one who found the salon pedophile.
That's why we broke that.

47
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.850
She was the,

48
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.190
to file the article where the guy who was currently actively a pedophile,

49
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:38.740
he sent it to me within 10 minutes.
But he's the man of the chairman today,

50
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.930
currently out of wasn't a practicing pedophile.
Right.
You know who he was.
He was,

51
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:45.610
he talked about grooming and all that stuff when we wrote about it.
Yeah.

52
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.560
Really double down on it too,
didn't it?
Didn't it again,
three more articles.
Yeah.

53
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.660
Yeah.
Anyway,
the point is registers,
registers,
just brilliant.

54
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.190
Remove those articles.
I don't know,
maybe they did,

55
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.980
but they did like two or three.
But red is a brilliant researcher.

56
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.370
And so at this point,
explain that though.

57
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:02.500
Cause you were glossing over this for people that are just listening.

58
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.220
Please explain like what that was like those articles.
Uh,
sorry.
Yeah,

59
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.880
we're starting off with that.
So a salon.com what was their first articles?

60
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:13.570
I'm a pedophile.
That an,
I'm not a monster.
And it was talking about how you know,

61
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:16.780
the way to deal with us as again,
not to stigmatize us.
I'm like,
listen,
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:18.850
At a certain point I'm empathetic,
but we send you to therapy.

63
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.910
You still want to have sex with kids.
We take you out to a village,
we shoot you.

64
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.870
We can't take that risk.
Sorry.
That's it.
Um,
so he was like,
I'm not a monster.

65
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.230
And talked about how his struggles with his family.
Okay.

66
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:32.020
You can kind of understand it.
But then Reggie did some research.

67
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:35.620
We found all of his online message board is,
is pseudonyms,

68
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.900
has usernames and coded language about grooming.
Uh,

69
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.640
drew me mean like your grooming kids online.

70
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.010
So we found all of it and we released an article on it and then salon release

71
00:03:46.011 --> 00:03:49.420
another article where he responded and didn't call us up by name of,

72
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:54.421
it was like my week in the right wing hates fear and they ran it on salon.

73
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:58.750
Like we're the bad guys because we found out that you're grooming children and

74
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.510
they released a few and we're like,
we just realized,
okay,
this is the thing,

75
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:05.560
kind of like hormone blockers for kids' salons.
Cool.
With an active pedophile.

76
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.140
Let's move on now.
We're not going to do it.

77
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.090
There's no more convincing to be done here.

78
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.480
So red was the one who found that in red lodge was the one who infiltrated a lot

79
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:16.780
of the antifa groups.
You know,
that,
that's not his real name.
But he has so many,

80
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:20.480
this guy's just brilliant.
So He'd been doing research on the backend,
uh,

81
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.870
upon request and was so good.
So we had all this research.

82
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:23.950
We knew who these people were.

83
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.000
We kind of knew what they were planning with Ben Shapiro going into Utah.
Um,

84
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.610
as a matter of fact,
we were going to go to Berkeley right before that.

85
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:33.430
But then last minute we found out that they weren't going to do it because we

86
00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:37.750
know where they meet.
We were on their cryptic apps where they would text you.

87
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:40.000
So as these apps that you would download,
like I don't know if we're like,

88
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:42.290
are we allowed to say that?
I don't know.
Yeah.

89
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.240
The FBI came to us for information afterwards.
It's like,
Oh yeah,
we're tracking.

90
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.440
There were arrests made,
uh,
because of your undercover thing.
Well,

91
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:52.300
arrest made on the people who we see on the cover.

92
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.780
So they committed crimes again later that day and were arrested.

93
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.710
So the same person who handed him a shank later that day assaulted.

94
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.550
So that was the rest of,
so,
so Raj gets you the information and then you,

95
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.240
how do you make contact with these people?
We will,

96
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:09.910
we were part of their Facebook grouping so we found out where they wanted to

97
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:11.950
meet,
when um,
what and where.

98
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.980
And we show up the campus and I walk in as Jason Antifa person new to the

99
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:21.880
organization.
Say I want to be involved blue contacts and a beanie.

100
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
That's all it takes.
It's much shacks on the tech side.
Blue Contacts.

101
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.740
Just because we're on a budget we need to disguise.
But why,

102
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.170
why do you need this disguise?
He didn't think you could slip,

103
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.123
you thought it'd be,

104
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.730
would recognize we thought we could have been on the radar even though they

105
00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:40.400
tried to find this in a,
in a,
in Austin and to put it on posters,

106
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.220
we take the interview with Tim Kennedy and they were passing,

107
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.820
passing out flyers just when you got waterboarded.
No,
no.
That was another time.

108
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.900
And I would much rather than whining.
Yeah,
he did.
He did.
That was no joke.

109
00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:52.660
And I'd rather do that than the CNN 16 hour live stream.
That's not a joke.

110
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.070
I'd rather be waterboarded but anyways,
good enough.
Dot.
Yeah.

111
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.710
So we show up at this coffee house there me,
Starbucks on campus

112
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.420
where he meets at Starbucks.

113
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.150
So I found him met up.
Uh,

114
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.020
he gives me the cryptic messaging APP.
Uh,
was it a he or she did you find out?

115
00:06:14.021 --> 00:06:14.391
We don't know.

116
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:17.210
I was sure it was a heat because it was a wedding band and the chairs,

117
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.840
Europe Zur Zur sitting there with his wedding band,
uh,

118
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.620
iPhone seven and is,
is brought on the side.

119
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:27.950
It gives me the APP and says we'll see you tomorrow.
So I say,
okay,
see you.

120
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:31.810
Then he gives me full communication.
They did roll call,
the roll call and it,

121
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.920
and it's okay.
Everyone roll call.
We've got Jason and the group like,
yeah,

122
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.140
it's like Firebird,
Firebird.
Uh,

123
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.150
well they went down to like all these like Firebird and rogue two in row flame

124
00:06:44.151 --> 00:06:45.540
thrower nine.
And then there was,
we'll,

125
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.680
we'll will that that was as well named feral fan we found immediately cause I

126
00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:53.420
used to swim so swiftly.
Well it's so easy to find.

127
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:55.070
How can you figure out who will was?
Well,

128
00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:56.660
because the phone numbers are also listed.

129
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.780
It's encrypted messaging APP doesn't lie,
take screenshots,

130
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.880
but it turns out if you have another film,
you could take a photo of your screen.

131
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.020
She was a physical camera.
They didn't seem to work out this kink in the plans.

132
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.280
The snapchat thing when people are sending Dick pics like yeah,
normal,
go see it.

133
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.290
No one's going to say,
well you can't say,
you can't just reach us.

134
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.340
It just informs the person,
which is so much worse than no,

135
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.680
someone actually took it.
It's like yeah,

136
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.760
that just makes it worse for everybody to take note of it with another camera.

137
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:28.910
Like you said.
I'm sorry.
So go ahead.
All these people roleplaying,

138
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:34.030
they're there in dungeons and dragons.
Exactly.
So we uh,
we go back to her hotel,

139
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.940
get ready for the next day,
uh,
and show up on campus where they're supposed to,

140
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.810
to,
to meet up and get together nervous as hell because he's like,

141
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.891
when should we play?

142
00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:45.020
So it was more nervous the day before cause they shouldn't know what I was

143
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:47.460
walking.
Do you want them to stop?
We want to play it first up.

144
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.370
They are all like three seconds as much from from Antifa four.

145
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.030
Which one do you want me to start with?
The how?
Find One.

146
00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.200
So roll the dice producer.
So,
um,
these people different than me.

147
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.730
They were openly advocating violence and they were openly,

148
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:09.690
they were offering to give you a gun?
Not at first.
No,
not at first.
Look,

149
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.633
that's why I say I want to do,

150
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.360
because you actually said the funny part before you said we got into a fight and

151
00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:17.120
you said this is not my job description.
And I said,

152
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:21.890
it is exactly in your job description.
You have to go do this right now.
And,
uh,

153
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.500
we,
we had security everything.
But I remember you were really,

154
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.790
and then after the clips you'll see after they gave you the knife and we were

155
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.520
finally on reports with the cops at that point he goes,
oh,

156
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.800
I'm going to go back in.
I think I can really mess with him.
Like,
no you can't.

157
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:37.430
They just handed you a prison shank and told me they had a sawed off shotgun.

158
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.390
You can't go back in there.
So once he was in it,
I had to reign him back.

159
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.190
There's like a little little too pop pop a couple of times.

160
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.350
Crazy.
He's got a little crazy.
Okay,
so let's play this.

161
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.560
This is my meeting at that Starbucks pluck product placement days.
A Guy,

162
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.360
this is a guy I think I play it.

163
00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:00.663
<v 1>Oh,</v>

164
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.770
<v 0>this is telling you how to show up.
It's hard.
Tactics</v>

165
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:11.440
cannot prepare for what we're planning to have a toolbox full of shit.

166
00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:16.160
Did you bring your gun on the border between just regular right on the border is

167
00:09:16.161 --> 00:09:19.240
going regular rifle.
It us all up and dial in a sawed off style shot.

168
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.910
That's a girl.
Yeah.
I thought so when I showed up to this one.
But you know

169
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.370
Jamie is one where the hand handed Jared was an ice pick,
he said or what was it?

170
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.820
It was a nice pic.
It was a sharp pointy end,

171
00:09:33.821 --> 00:09:37.900
but it was like a school that screwdriver handle a case coming.
Okay,

172
00:09:37.901 --> 00:09:41.120
so here it is.
I think they were lying.
No,
but this is

173
00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:48.150
and telling me how like I can procure my own a bars.
There we go.

174
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.630
Thanks.
Played five inches.

175
00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.700
You strap it on your leg and the Kebar sponsor of Antifa now,
by the way,

176
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:03.350
really stamp on my shit is
okay.

177
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.600
So what they're doing is first of all,

178
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.390
that person never stabbed anybody in their fucking life.
Right?

179
00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:11.820
So these are dorks and what they're doing is they're deciding now they're going

180
00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:16.580
to take action and they're going to enlist the aid of a bunch of other people.

181
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.590
Did you think at that point in time,

182
00:10:18.591 --> 00:10:22.700
like maybe these people are looking for suckers that are willing to do fucked up

183
00:10:22.701 --> 00:10:26.430
shit for them?
She ain't stabbing anybody?
I absolutely think so.

184
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.810
When I showed up,
I met,
there was like four of them when I got there,

185
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.420
they were all running late,
the socialists were all running late,
late

186
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.070
and one of them actually said,
sweetheart,
there are honeybee.
I was like,
yeah,

187
00:10:40.071 --> 00:10:41.870
that's the beauty of being unemployed.

188
00:10:41.871 --> 00:10:43.600
I can just show up on time anywhere I want.

189
00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:47.030
I'm like there is a silver lining I guess,
but just eating.

190
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.410
She was still late.
Oh she was?
Yeah.
She's like so she,

191
00:10:51.411 --> 00:10:54.740
okay so I get there first I'm thinking,
okay this is a bus.

192
00:10:54.741 --> 00:10:57.100
This is a really sad group of people.
Right.

193
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.580
Cause I don't know about the weapons at this point.
I just the,
okay there's,
I'm,

194
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.960
I'm expecting like forties guys in the,
what they called black bloc,

195
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.220
all black goggles,
everything.
And it just looks like a really sad social club.

196
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.660
So like get there,

197
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.590
sit down for a bit and like three minutes in you start telling me they start

198
00:11:12.591 --> 00:11:16.220
passing me stuff,
telling me everything you just saw and I'm thinking,

199
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.170
oh my lord,
this is not,
I,
I need to get out.

200
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.610
I need to get out.
I need to get out to me while I'm on the other side of this.

201
00:11:24.611 --> 00:11:24.771
Cool.

202
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:26.940
Cause Ben Shapiro was being some of the other side of the school and you know

203
00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:28.720
Ben Shapiro's there.
So there are a lot of fans.

204
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.630
I'm kind of taking pictures and you know I got got spotted some take care of my

205
00:11:32.631 --> 00:11:33.351
phone.
If I went home,

206
00:11:33.351 --> 00:11:35.950
I said let me just shut off my phone taking pictures and let me just,

207
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.200
and I see it in chair.
It's like they're handing me knives.
What do I do?

208
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:44.570
Like quick it.
I'm like,
okay,
I need,
I need to,
I need to fast.
And you think quick.

209
00:11:44.571 --> 00:11:47.630
Yeah.
So I told him I had to take a dump and I just left.

210
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.300
That was hilarious.

211
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.150
What the crazy thing about that is that you bring us the footage.

212
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:57.820
So there are cops right there.
So we tell the cops,
because I'm like,

213
00:11:57.821 --> 00:12:00.490
we've got to get him through this,
whatever it is,
quad or whatever is there

214
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:06.250
here I think,
oh yeah,

215
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.330
that's it.
That's not playing.

216
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.210
Let's get corrupted file here.
Go.
Rather than circle.

217
00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:15.640
And they were handing out sharp objects to stab people with said they had

218
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:18.170
someone come in with this guy works for local lines too.

219
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:23.080
Late night hosts comedians to find this out.
You know what?
I wish you guys luck.

220
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.501
Yes.

221
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:27.370
You just saw correctly even being shown the footage in the presence of police

222
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:31.780
officers to confirm authenticity.
They walked away.
Also,

223
00:12:31.781 --> 00:12:35.430
I should note here is from Nightline who was on my podcast airs.

224
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.330
He knew about the footage and the whole story too.

225
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.500
I don't like offered it to them and ask,

226
00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.000
give us a brief spot and when they actually put together weeks later after if

227
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.260
did come out so he had to acknowledge it,

228
00:12:44.261 --> 00:12:48.130
but he put together a small little brief montage of our video that took place on

229
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:52.000
items.
Little profile,
peaceful event though.
It was not without some controversy.

230
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.300
What happens is to me what's so crazy,
it's like again,

231
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:59.320
I offered it to the local guy.
People who do news,
you know April O'neil,

232
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.290
they're not,
they want the exclusive.
I said,
hey man,
do you want this?

233
00:13:02.291 --> 00:13:02.801
Like to run this?

234
00:13:02.801 --> 00:13:05.320
Cause he worked for ABC or local Fox or something and he's doing an Instagram

235
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:08.500
videos with five,
you know,
following and sees,
oh,
a heart go up on his screen.

236
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.250
So I'm looking at him like,
I'm like,
listen man,
do you want this?
And he goes,
uh,

237
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:13.620
what does it,
so hold on,

238
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.560
this is that we tell them exactly what we had and we show them the cryptic APP.

239
00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:20.230
And I'm like,
hold on a second.
We're not here or the police.

240
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.890
So we're showing it to him and he walks away.
He's like,
well,

241
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:27.640
I've got gotta do my job.
I'm like,
this isn't a part of your job.
This isn't,

242
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.190
he didn't think it was.
And that to me was in saint,

243
00:13:30.191 --> 00:13:31.930
we weren't looking for it necessarily a school.

244
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:33.900
We just kind of get this as wide as possible.

245
00:13:33.901 --> 00:13:36.850
He had a rhyme going down the street with their protests.
He had a good day.
Yeah,

246
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:37.721
that's what he did.

247
00:13:37.721 --> 00:13:40.960
He was doing interim and you'll see people peacefully protesting.
And I'm like,

248
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.530
hold up his Instagram,
hey,
hello Donald Trump's luck to him.

249
00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.220
And he just didn't have authority that he was trying to have,

250
00:13:47.221 --> 00:13:50.380
didn't fit the narrative.
Same thing with a guy from Nightline.
It didn't fit.

251
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.840
So the narrative was the anti Trump protesters,

252
00:13:52.841 --> 00:13:56.850
which is what people were tuning into the news for.
It wasn't peaceful,
peaceful.

253
00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.150
There were snipers on the roof tops for that little Jube and Shapiro.

254
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:06.700
This is two weeks after he's a,
he's a smarmy little bastard I love,

255
00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.330
but he's like,
I could see how he pisses people off.
But he's brilliant.
He's very,

256
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.440
very smart because my first lawyer,
he negotiated my contract.

257
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.950
He wasn't even entertainment lawyer.
I said,
Ben,

258
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.850
you got a lot of vowels and your last name and I have a contract with money at

259
00:14:18.851 --> 00:14:20.890
play.
Can you help me?
And I think,
I think I can do it.

260
00:14:20.891 --> 00:14:25.240
And that's how I became friends.
I was 18 that's hilarious.
So this is this,

261
00:14:25.241 --> 00:14:28.540
I mean this is the heat of the ANTIFA fight.
Last summer I,
right after Berkeley,

262
00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:32.890
they were really specifically about antifa trying to downplay the violence.

263
00:14:32.891 --> 00:14:37.000
And the,
the undercurrent that I've seen,
they've given that up.

264
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.530
They seem to have accepted the fact that there's a lot of,
some of them,

265
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.420
some of them,
some of them,
but I think this ha,

266
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.240
I mean I hate not to toot our own horn,

267
00:14:43.241 --> 00:14:47.410
but I think things like this and that got what 15 lean plays in Facebook and a

268
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:48.730
few million on,
on a,
on youtube.

269
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.980
And the reason we've got more mileage just because the news refused to cover it

270
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.330
then was it the dean,
someone,

271
00:14:53.331 --> 00:14:56.210
there's some student activities advisor released an official statement saying

272
00:14:56.211 --> 00:14:59.150
nothing happened.
And so we called him.
So that was a fall,

273
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:02.860
but he remembered listening to that.
We said with the Washington,
what the,

274
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.210
we made up something Washington Harold or something.
She was like,
oh,

275
00:15:05.211 --> 00:15:06.620
it was a really stupid name of Cameron,
one of us.

276
00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.050
And we asked who made the statement that this was entirely peaceful because

277
00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:09.740
honeybee,

278
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.190
he said he's speaking on behalf of the police but never actually quoted a name.

279
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:16.550
So he was,
we figured out real quickly he's speaking on behalf of himself.

280
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.670
And even those opinions we found out he was actually a delegate or something he

281
00:15:19.671 --> 00:15:22.610
was actually officially involved with and stuff at about.
Yeah,
tied to Clinton.

282
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.170
He was a,
he was a kitten staffer.
Yeah.

283
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.940
Supportive and t for this like open supportive and it's very confusing.

284
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.670
It's like,
do you know this?

285
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.440
You got like professors hitting people in the head with bike locks.

286
00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.980
Like this is not,
it sounds absurd,
but it's true.
It's not a wise group.

287
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:37.820
This is not,

288
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:42.620
this is not a smartly organized refutable of,
you know,

289
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:46.460
some crazy power structure.
These are,
this is chaos.
Right?

290
00:15:46.461 --> 00:15:48.350
And it's your question earlier.
Yeah,
I do think they were,

291
00:15:48.351 --> 00:15:52.130
I think they prey on losers of society to become part of,

292
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.780
I mean they were so quick to welcome me in because they need the numbers and

293
00:15:56.781 --> 00:15:59.240
they're willing to accept anybody.
There was no filtration system.

294
00:15:59.241 --> 00:16:03.890
I've got to say that if that was a real faction of anti,

295
00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:06.840
that's the saddest fucking faction that it doesn't matter.

296
00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:09.830
We'll Kelly Case and you're,
you're as bad as anybody.
Tell her later that.

297
00:16:09.831 --> 00:16:14.600
So Honeybee got arrested for tasing,
tasing a guy that's in [inaudible] case.

298
00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.740
Who did she tase?
No,
the guy sucker punched a different guy.

299
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.530
But something happened.
There was a desktop,

300
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:24.800
but now are you missed gender and then no god,
I would never do that.

301
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.560
Never.
No.
Honeybee was actually,
they're not my character.

302
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.820
Honeybee was a late socialist.
Got Arrested for Jason to dude.

303
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.090
And then after jail was texting.

304
00:16:35.091 --> 00:16:39.920
You remember that she wanted her knife back.
Oh my God.
Does she know picture?

305
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.700
Cause I texted a picture of me sitting next to,
to Shapiro.
Full getup.

306
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:47.720
Flipping them the bird.
You texted them a picture in the crypt in encryption APP.

307
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:52.550
Oh my God,
I should have brought the phone,
actually brought the low back.

308
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.310
I'm gonna go to the cops.
We were like,
you bastard,
give me the knife.

309
00:16:55.311 --> 00:16:58.780
Sat next to Ben in just thumbs up.
Oh my God.

310
00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.160
And we told them like when it was going up on youtube,

311
00:17:01.161 --> 00:17:03.800
like keep an eye out tomorrow at six o'clock on Youtube.

312
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.400
So she gets arrested for tasing somebody.
Yeah.
And then what happens now?

313
00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:12.300
No heat for her for all this video of her saying she's got a handgun and we

314
00:17:12.301 --> 00:17:14.660
don't know we,
I mean I think can be saying now we,

315
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.130
I was in a lot of phone calls with,

316
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:21.160
with the FBI obs on the premise with the FBI and they knew the bike footage was

317
00:17:21.321 --> 00:17:26.321
not terribly surprising to any of them because they were already on their radar.

318
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.360
But they did ask how you got an a cryptic gap.
They did add.
Yeah,
they were,

319
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:32.960
they were picking my brain for how they function because there they are

320
00:17:32.961 --> 00:17:34.070
organized to a certain extent.

321
00:17:34.071 --> 00:17:38.030
I mean if there is ignore organized as the Berkeley faction or is any other

322
00:17:38.031 --> 00:17:39.950
faction that's,
that's caused trouble,
who knows?

323
00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.260
But to some level they are and and that's,

324
00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.670
that's where the FBI used us to to kind of help them.
What's,

325
00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.420
what we were talking about earlier,
that my,

326
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.910
my take on it is that if you're trying to suppress people that hardcore,

327
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.690
<v 2>and it's just a guy who's talking and that guy turns out to be Ben Shapiro and</v>

328
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:58.150
you're calling him a Nazi,
like,
do you see those dangerous in?

329
00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:02.280
Do you see the Yarmulke on his head?
Yeah.
Ben Shapiro's a Nazi,

330
00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:07.040
or you out of your mind like this is you,
you're so far gone that you,

331
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.630
like with every single one of these things,

332
00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:12.840
it diminishes the credibility of this,
this whole movement.

333
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:23.100
<v 3>Okay.</v>
