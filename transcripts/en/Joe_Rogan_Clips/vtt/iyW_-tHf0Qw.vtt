1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.640
Suge knight gear for finally.
Are you ready?
I am ready.
Let's do it.

2
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.680
Do you getting a lot of heat online from all these?

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.130
It's all the flat earth people and the chem trail people.

4
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:14.310
Those are the people that are mad at you the most.
That's my specialty.

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.000
Chem trails and flat earth.
Yeah.
Well that's,
I asked people,

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.320
this is hilarious.
I asked people online,

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.680
I said a mic west from metal bunk is going to be here.

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.200
What would you like me to debunk?

9
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.070
And one of the first ones was chem trails because you cannot debunk it.

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.830
It's real.
Dun Dun,
Dun.
I would,

11
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.090
I would say this to anybody who thinks that that has got to be the most

12
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:44.490
ineffective government program of all time.

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.980
Like he asked people what they're doing by spraying things in the sky and the,

14
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.370
the number one thing they'll say is like weather control,
whether controls one,

15
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.620
well,
they don't have any fucking control of the weather because if they did,

16
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:59.130
they'd make it rain all over Santa Barbara and stop these fires.
Yeah.
I mean,

17
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:03.150
there's hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage going on right now.

18
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:06.120
There's a fire that's bigger than this,
the city of Washington DC,

19
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.390
they think they're making this virus.

20
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.430
They think that that's part of the conspiracy.
Anything that happens is,
oh,

21
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.540
as part of the conspiracy,
what do you think it is?
Like what is,

22
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.190
what is it with conspiracies?
Like what,

23
00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:23.010
why are they so attractive to people?
There's something going on with people,

24
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:27.840
right?
Yeah.
I think,
and I've been looking into this a lot,
uh,

25
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.440
and you have,
especially since you're a government show,

26
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.370
<v 1>well,</v>

27
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.010
I'm doing research for the book I'm writing and she's cold escaping the rabbit

28
00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:35.221
hole.

29
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:38.550
And it's about how people get into the rabbit hole and how people get out of the

30
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:41.400
rabbit hole.
So the whole thing is about the rabbit hole,

31
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.250
which is something basically people get sucked into.

32
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.810
And I think people do a lot of research into the reasons behind people getting

33
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:52.950
into conspiracy theories,
like the psychological reasons and the,
uh,
uh,

34
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.930
personality reasons and things like that.

35
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.710
But I think most conspiracy theorist or just regular people,

36
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.590
they're just ordinary people who get sucked into something.

37
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.040
And why do you think that is?
I just from talking to them,

38
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.230
they told me like the origin stories,
the origin stories essentially.

39
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.740
And they told me what happened to them when they got into conspiracy theories

40
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.330
and it nearly always starts with them looking at some video.
I now,
now a days,

41
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:22.770
it starts with them looking at some video and then they just get sucked in and

42
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:25.800
then they start looking at another video and another video and another video in

43
00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:30.801
Facebook and youtube is feeding them these videos because once you start going

44
00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:33.630
down that road,
you just can't,

45
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.320
you can't change your trajectory.
Right.
It's,

46
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.420
it's hard to train in Youtube what since they instigated this,
uh,

47
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.250
uh,

48
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.000
autoplay thing or instituted this autoplay thing or the next video plays

49
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.770
immediately and they're all related.

50
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.260
I think that's definitely been a thing with people.

51
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:55.470
And also like the suggestions on the right hand side if you're watching one

52
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:57.140
video on a particular subject.
Yeah,

53
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.100
I was doing some experiments with that are set up like a completely blank
youtube

54
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.100
<v 0>account and I would just go in there and typing one thing like con trails and of</v>

55
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:07.690
course we need to look up [inaudible] on Youtube.

56
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:10.720
Like half the videos you're going to get are going to be Kentrell videos.
Right?

57
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.140
And so if the first video you click on is a chem trail video,

58
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.210
then they just set you down that road.

59
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.960
Well I remember this was in the days,

60
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.270
I think before Youtube,

61
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.420
this is in the days when maybe youtube was around,

62
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:28.660
but it just wasn't that popular.
I remember me and my friend Eddie,

63
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:30.900
we're high as fuck and we're uh,

64
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.450
talking to my neighbor and there was some plane that was flying over and we were

65
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:38.710
wondering why the clouds coming from behind this planes stood so long.

66
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.400
So I asked him,
I just have this neighbor ice,

67
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.410
call him bling bling cause a bling bling was incapable of talking about anything

68
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:50.530
other than objects.
Like all we talk about that it was nice cars at a new car.

69
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:52.420
Where'd you get there?
Watch that was blank,
blank.

70
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.950
All bling bling wanted to talk about is like material possessions.
So,
so he,

71
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.360
he know we're parked uh,
in front of his,
I was saying hi to him and then I said,

72
00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:04.810
hey man,
do you remember clouds look sticking around in the sky that long?

73
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.860
And he's like,
ah,
no.
I don't know.
Is that a new truck?
And like

74
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.900
I just remember how ironic it was cause I had told Eddie about blink,
blink,

75
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.080
you know,
that like this is all this guy cares about and wants to talk about.

76
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.710
And then he did that and while we were out there,
but I remember thinking,
man,

77
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:25.711
how weird would it be if all of a sudden clouds from jet engines started

78
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:30.940
appearing?
And it just appeared right before our eyes and we had noticed it,

79
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.520
but I wasn't sold.

80
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.510
It didn't make any sense to me because my thought on it was the amount of people

81
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:38.590
that had to be involved.

82
00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:41.020
You're talking about all these different airplanes get all these people to keep

83
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:44.360
their mouth shut.
These are their pilots,
right?
So they're not,

84
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.140
they're not making shit tons of money and they live here too.

85
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:50.680
That's the other thing.
Like if there's actually spraying something in the sky,

86
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.680
they live here too.
Like what are they spraying themselves?
Well,

87
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:58.300
the theory now is that it's basically the power elite in the country is doing

88
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:03.301
these chem trails as it kind of latched last ditch attempt to maintain power

89
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:05.680
before the entire world collapses into chaos.

90
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.810
So they think it's kind of like a desperate situation.
A power grab.
It would not.

91
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:15.500
Exactly,
it's,
it's the,
the hanging on to have that kind of last hurrah.
I really,

92
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.940
they feel like the end of the world is not like,
you know,

93
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.730
this about to bit this environmental disaster and the chem trails are the only

94
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:23.950
thing that is holding everything together.

95
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.890
That's the thing that you get if you go to like,
you know,
Jon,

96
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.240
do you engineering watch Dane Whittington Guy?
He,
he's basically a,

97
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.550
an apocalyptic prophet now.

98
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:38.510
He's basically preaching about how everything is going to end soon and the,
the,

99
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.660
the chem trails,
uh,

100
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.270
the only thing that's stopping it but then also making it worse.

101
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.970
So he's kind of saying like,
you know,
the controls of helping,

102
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:49.090
but we got to stop them.
Otherwise a little,
they'll make it even worse,

103
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.080
but we're pretty much all going to die either way because a lot of money and

104
00:05:53.081 --> 00:05:56.320
we're going to die.
There's a lot of people that love that,

105
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.220
that that trope

106
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.910
<v 1>is just like something that gets carted out constantly throughout history</v>

107
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:05.480
because it's true.
You are going to die.
It's like when are you going to die?

108
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:07.700
You don't know.
So because you don't know,
you're freaking out.

109
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.430
Like is it going to be a car accident?
Is it going to be a fire,

110
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.660
is going to be an earthquake?

111
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.960
Is it going to be a slow aging death or is it going to be the chem trails dumped

112
00:06:15.961 --> 00:06:17.930
on?
Yeah.
I think that type of thing,

113
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:22.100
like fear of dying is one of those fundamental things that every human is

114
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:25.010
hardwired with.
Certain things that are,
they,

115
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.850
that happens in the brain without them thinking about and beer of dying and fear

116
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:32.360
of other things.
Fear of Lena,
a lot,
fear of wolves or whatever.

117
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.020
Something that's hardwired.

118
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.180
And that's the type of thing that leads to different types of thinking that uh,

119
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.990
you know,

120
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.950
you ended up being a conspiracy theorists in part because your brain is wired

121
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:43.490
that way.

122
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.640
You had a great quote about chem trails when we did that television show

123
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:47.001
together.

124
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:51.800
You said Chem trails are like the training wheels for conspiracy theorists.

125
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.320
Yeah.
Cause they're like they're,
they're right above your head and you just like,

126
00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.340
you see them right there for people don't understand why jets produce clouds.

127
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.050
Please explain that.
Cause it's very simple.
It is very simple.
Uh,

128
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.340
jet engines have water,
have water in their exhaust.

129
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.760
You can look at a car on a cold day and you see the exhaust coming out of the

130
00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:14.510
tailpipe.

131
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.960
You'll see like a cloud condensation sometimes and you'll see some water coming

132
00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:22.490
out and when the exact same thing happens with jet engines,

133
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.560
uh,
and when that's exhaust hits,
the colder it condenses,
it freezes,

134
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.950
it makes a cloud.
And con controls are essentially clouds.

135
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:35.210
They're exactly the same physically as irregular cirrus cloud and it's dependent

136
00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:37.730
upon the amount of moisture in the atmosphere.

137
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.010
And you can actually monitor it online.

138
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.130
NASA actually has a website that will show you a,

139
00:07:43.131 --> 00:07:47.600
and I believe it's set up for pilots,
right?
Is that what the air traffic people?

140
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:47.910
No,

141
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:52.730
Sir actually has a contrail forecasting side isn't really for Ios or anything.

142
00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:55.700
It's just part of that contrail research.
Uh,
but yeah,

143
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:58.230
they have a site where it protect,
well,
controls are going to be,

144
00:07:58.231 --> 00:07:59.240
but you can do it yourself.

145
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:02.120
You just go look up the relative humidity at a certain altitude.

146
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.130
There's lots of different sites you can go to.

147
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:08.960
I've got a whole bunch of them listed on metal bunk and just like the clouds

148
00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:13.550
very in the sky,
all the amount of moisture,
various as well,

149
00:08:13.551 --> 00:08:17.930
which is one of the reasons why you will see a jet pass through one area and

150
00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:20.720
you'll see a contrail and then it almost looks like they shut the,

151
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.730
the contrail jets off and then you see it pick up maybe a couple hundred yards

152
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:28.460
later.
Yeah.
And that's when you say like a cloud,

153
00:08:28.461 --> 00:08:30.320
it's really exactly the same as the cloud.

154
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:35.330
It can look at any picture of a cloudy day and then just remove all the clouds,

155
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.950
but they're still there as invisible clouds.
Then when the plane comes along,

156
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.670
it's almost like the plane is this the magic pen revealing these invisible

157
00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:46.130
clouds because all,
all the cloud is a,

158
00:08:46.131 --> 00:08:49.160
is a region of the sky where the humidity is above a certain level.

159
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.630
So you know that the humidity is pretty patchy across the sky cause like there's

160
00:08:53.631 --> 00:08:56.460
a cloud here and right next to it there's no clouds where the cloud is.

161
00:08:56.461 --> 00:08:59.430
It's high humidity where the cloud isn't,
it's low humidity.

162
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.560
But if both of those were just lowered like 10%,
then you get no clouds at all.

163
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.700
Then a plane comes along,

164
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:11.050
he raises the humidity in the cloud area and the non cloud area.
But this area,

165
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.860
because it was a bit higher,
uh,

166
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.120
you get a trail forming and this area getting a trail for me.

167
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:18.430
So it's exactly the same as invisible clouds.
Yeah.

168
00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:22.300
<v 0>Yeah.
And for people that are watching it and you're looking up,</v>

169
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.930
you think they're spraying something if you're a conspiracy minded.

170
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.860
And because of a lot of the videos that are out there in particular two that

171
00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:33.910
were recommended to me or what in the hell are they sprang.
Right.

172
00:09:33.911 --> 00:09:38.170
So I got to meet with that guy that made those documentaries and a right away I

173
00:09:38.171 --> 00:09:41.680
knew something was wrong.
Like he's either on Adderall or something.

174
00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:46.630
He's just like real,
real edgy and speed it up.

175
00:09:46.631 --> 00:09:48.910
And just,
just,
uh,
an odd guy,

176
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.820
which is like a lot of people that are conspicuously,

177
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.480
it's conspiratorially minded.
They seem to be like very,

178
00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:00.840
they're nervous and agitated.
And,
and when we went over like why he thinks,

179
00:10:00.841 --> 00:10:04.690
one of the things he was talking about was the soil samples and water samples

180
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.100
and that,
um,

181
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:11.130
they've detected all this aluminum and barium in water and particularly

182
00:10:12.251 --> 00:10:15.640
aluminum.
And he's showing me all these results that he had,

183
00:10:15.641 --> 00:10:19.030
but even in the very results that he showed me,
it said sludge.

184
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.140
Like he had sent them out for testing.
And I said,
well,
what did you send in his?

185
00:10:23.141 --> 00:10:26.740
He goes,
well,
I sent some water from these,
you know,
ponds.
And I said,

186
00:10:26.741 --> 00:10:31.360
but it says sludge on your testing.
And he said,
no,
but it was water.
I go,
okay,

187
00:10:31.361 --> 00:10:35.320
but the lab said it sludge.
I go,
what is sludge?
She goes,
why don't,

188
00:10:35.321 --> 00:10:37.220
I dunno what sludge is exactly.
I go,
well,

189
00:10:37.221 --> 00:10:42.220
let's look is a combination of water and dirt.
Okay,
so you sent water and dirt.

190
00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.380
So do you know that aluminum is one of the most common metals on earth?

191
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:52.000
And you could basically scoop up a patch of dirt pretty much anywhere and find a

192
00:10:52.001 --> 00:10:56.530
bunch of aluminum in it.
It's really,
really common in trace amounts.
I go,

193
00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:57.280
so you,

194
00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.280
what you did is you tested dirt and it tested positive for being dirt.

195
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.250
I mean exactly.
That's exactly what it is.
And the guy was kind of freaking out.

196
00:11:06.251 --> 00:11:09.850
I'm like,
how did you,
how did you not put this together yourself?

197
00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.650
Like if you're the guys making this video and you're trying to find a reason why

198
00:11:14.651 --> 00:11:17.980
you could,
you know,
uh,
some facts that you could throw at people.
We could say,

199
00:11:17.981 --> 00:11:20.190
hey look,
the government is definitely spraying things in the sky.

200
00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:21.520
They're spraying them aluminum.
Look,

201
00:11:21.521 --> 00:11:25.340
we found the aluminum and we found that in the water.
It's in your water supply.

202
00:11:25.341 --> 00:11:27.370
It's going to get in your body.
It's going to poison you.
Look,

203
00:11:27.371 --> 00:11:29.360
we found in the water,
how did it,

204
00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:33.130
how the fuck did he not look at it himself is what I was thinking and meet when

205
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.660
me and him were having this conversation.

206
00:11:34.661 --> 00:11:38.670
I realize like you have these people that go down us,

207
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.830
they're not open minded in regards to these subjects.

208
00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.640
They go down a very narrow road and that road is,

209
00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:50.230
the government is doing something to me,
I need to find out what it is.

210
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.210
<v 1>Yeah.
And they're really motivated to actually find evidence.
Yes.</v>

211
00:11:53.211 --> 00:11:56.040
So that the trying to find something and you know,

212
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.980
actually trying to find an alternative explanation isn't really that attractive

213
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:03.760
to them.
So they find aluminum in the water or in the soil or whatever,

214
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.190
and then they glom on to that as being evidence of geoengineering.

215
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.230
And that's great for them because they can just find loads and loads of samples

216
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:11.840
of soil.

217
00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.580
<v 0>And that's something that gets repeated online.</v>

218
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:17.510
That very fact over and over again,
the aluminum that they found in the water,

219
00:12:17.511 --> 00:12:18.344
it's one of light there.

220
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.610
<v 1>The core tenants is like one of the pillars of the chem trail thing.
There's a,</v>

221
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.340
there's a,
there's like four or five different things.

222
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:29.340
Like in every conspiracy theory,
there are these core beliefs that,
uh,

223
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.710
the 99% of the people who believe in the theory,

224
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.090
<v 0>one core belief is that you work for the government.
Yeah.
That is a,</v>

225
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:40.950
that is a core belief is a retired video game creator.

226
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.970
You could find that out.
Made Video Games,
right.
Tony Hawk.
Yeah.

227
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Made a shit ton of money and decided to uh,

228
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.590
to debunk dorks.
Yeah.
I didn't,

229
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.500
it didn't start out and I wouldn't refer to them as dogs,

230
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.920
but I'm saying they're dorks.
Yeah.
They're dorks.

231
00:12:58.921 --> 00:13:01.920
If they don't believe this is the problem.
You're not a Dork.

232
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:06.000
If you fall for something,
you're a Dork.
If you fall for something,

233
00:13:06.001 --> 00:13:10.260
you don't believe the science that shows that it's impossible,
but it's not real.

234
00:13:10.261 --> 00:13:14.310
But if you are spraying aluminum in the sky,
folks,
it would look like aluminum.

235
00:13:14.311 --> 00:13:17.460
You dummy,
it wouldn't look like a cloud.
It wouldn't dissipate.

236
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.300
It would look like a thin missed essentially.
Yeah.
And metals not,

237
00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:24.570
it's heavier than fucking air and vapor.
It's not,

238
00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:26.910
it's not going to just sit up there like that.
It would,

239
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.440
it would be a very different experience.

240
00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:31.140
It would slowly settled to the ground and wouldn't look like a cloud.

241
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.560
And there's no reason to do it.
There's no benefit whatsoever.

242
00:13:34.561 --> 00:13:39.561
There's no scientific evidence ever uncovered ever that there's any benefit for

243
00:13:39.661 --> 00:13:43.410
anybody of spraying aluminum over people.
It's just,
it's just,

244
00:13:43.411 --> 00:13:46.140
it's a waste of Aluma thing.
Even with the whole

245
00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:51.270
<v 1>geoengineering field is really no solid evidence that it will work and we don't</v>

246
00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:54.610
know what the side effects will be.
We don't know how much we're going to,

247
00:13:54.611 --> 00:13:59.050
we would need to spray and we don't know,
like,
uh,
you know,
if,
if,
you know,

248
00:13:59.051 --> 00:14:02.110
when we stopped doing it will look the world bounce back in a terrible way and

249
00:14:02.111 --> 00:14:03.040
it'd be a big disaster.

250
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:06.230
<v 0>Well,
that's an interesting thing because one of the reasons why,
um,</v>

251
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.630
con trails are interesting to study is because they actually do have an effect

252
00:14:11.631 --> 00:14:12.860
on the temperature of the earth.

253
00:14:12.861 --> 00:14:16.880
And this is something that we found out after nine 11 when September 11th

254
00:14:16.881 --> 00:14:20.840
happened in 2001 it was the,
the big disaster.

255
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:25.700
There was a shutdown on all flights in the United States.

256
00:14:25.701 --> 00:14:30.510
And when they did that,
the temperature changed.
Yeah.

257
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:35.560
Because this is clouds literally do provide like a cover and it is,

258
00:14:36.681 --> 00:14:40.550
it does,
do they act as a,
an insulator or an escalator?

259
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.220
<v 1>Uh,
they essentially act as an insulator.</v>

260
00:14:43.221 --> 00:14:48.221
They block a radiation incoming radiation during the day and they'd be like

261
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.970
outgoing radiation at night.

262
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:54.980
But the net is that they actually block more outgoing radiation then they do

263
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.550
incoming radiation.
So if planes didn't fly at night,

264
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.940
then you would,
you would cool the earth down.

265
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.590
You'd have to stop flying quite a bit before nighttime.

266
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.040
So if all the flights in the world,

267
00:15:07.041 --> 00:15:10.760
we were between like 5:00 AM and 5:00 PM local time,

268
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.480
then you could actually call the world down by just not having any flights at

269
00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:14.711
night.

270
00:15:14.711 --> 00:15:17.360
Cause it's the night flights that I have this really big kind of blanketing

271
00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:19.790
effect that stopped the outgoing radiation.

272
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:24.230
So the night of flights actually heat the world up.
Yes,
they do.
They act like a,

273
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.980
like a blanket.
Hmm.
Uh,
you know how it's,

274
00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.730
it's warmer on a well in a cloudy day.
Like he doesn't get as cold at night.

275
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:34.130
You know,
deserts get really cold at night because there's nothing over them.

276
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:38.120
They tend to have any,
any cover.
Uh,
it's one,
it's one of the reasons,
but yeah,

277
00:15:38.121 --> 00:15:38.850
they,

278
00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:43.850
the contrary oils will actually a warm the planet because the,

279
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.290
the amount of outgoing radiation they'd lock is just way high.

280
00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:51.500
I just go to the wave lengths and the size of the particles.

281
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:54.400
<v 0>Uh,
so that,
that's something to be concerned about.</v>

282
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.250
That's something that people are legitimately monitoring,
um,

283
00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:01.030
where people need to understand is just because you feel like when you look up

284
00:16:01.031 --> 00:16:04.300
in the sky,
you see this criss cross patterns that they're spraying you.

285
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.430
No one's spraying,
you know,

286
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.760
this is just a natural reaction to jet engines and condensation in the

287
00:16:12.911 --> 00:16:15.130
atmosphere and the heat and the moisture of the jet engine.

288
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.240
<v 1>That's all it is.
They're it.</v>

289
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.450
They are actually talking about a way of using controls for a kind of

290
00:16:19.451 --> 00:16:22.790
geoengineering.
And this is something that people often get confused about.

291
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.520
Cause you,
you see these two words together,

292
00:16:24.521 --> 00:16:27.010
Contreras and Geo Engineering and they think,
oh,
that's chem trails.

293
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.630
But what they're trying to do is use air traffic control and computers and

294
00:16:31.631 --> 00:16:35.950
weather forecasting to make it so the planes don't fly through the contrail

295
00:16:35.951 --> 00:16:39.370
forming areas,
uh,
when they would make Cantrell's at night,

296
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.620
I make it so they do fly through contract or forming areas when it make with the

297
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.980
[inaudible] trials during the day.

298
00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:48.040
So this is our conversation they're having or something that's actually being,

299
00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.170
it's not something that they're,
they've actually done,
right.

300
00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.040
It's something that they can research fairly easily.
So

301
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:59.530
<v 0>we're considering trying to heat up the atmosphere or heat up the earth at</v>

302
00:16:59.781 --> 00:17:03.250
night.
They would just fly over these moisture rich areas and if they weren't,

303
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:07.420
<v 1>it would avoid them by,
the goal obviously is to combat climate change,</v>

304
00:17:07.421 --> 00:17:10.360
global warming,
uh,
man,
cool.
The earth down.

305
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.070
So that a relatively cheap way of doing that,
uh,

306
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.790
to a degree is to have these planes,
uh,
be controlled by computers.

307
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.640
Uh,
and it could increase his fuel costs,

308
00:17:21.641 --> 00:17:24.250
but the airline by about two or 3%,

309
00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:28.330
because they had to make very deviations sometimes in heights and sometimes in

310
00:17:28.331 --> 00:17:29.164
direction,

311
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.980
but it could actually have a significant effects on the earth's climate if we

312
00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:37.750
had the entire world airline fleets all in this program where they would fly

313
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.600
making controls where they were needed and not making contracts where they were

314
00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:43.750
not needed and how exactly they're monitoring the moisture content of the

315
00:17:43.751 --> 00:17:46.510
atmosphere.
Like what are they using to do that?
Satellites.
Yeah,

316
00:17:46.511 --> 00:17:51.220
it's a combination of things.
Uh,
the edu sounding balloons switch a days.

317
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.840
Weather balloons basically,
which got mistaken for Ufo is quite a lot.

318
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.390
And they use satellites and they use a planes,
uh,

319
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.410
sensing the environment when they're flying through it and they use all these

320
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:05.100
inputs and it,
and goes into a big computer model,
which basically predicts where,

321
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.410
what the,
uh,
what the,
uh,

322
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.680
humidity will be at any particular point is basically a big weather forecast for

323
00:18:11.681 --> 00:18:12.450
the upper atmosphere.
