Hello Freak bitches.
I can't wait to see it.
Do you,

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.830
do you like now that you have this gigantic audience,

3
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:09.830
do you feel certain amount of responsibility?
Yeah,

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.960
it was half intellectual integrity is the most important thing.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.570
And the great thing about this and the great thing about the way the Internet

6
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:18.540
works is that,
I mean,
look at the,
look at the people who are at the top.

7
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:19.770
Look at it like something like Pewdie Pie.

8
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.090
[inaudible] man of outstanding moral character.
He,
do you know him?

9
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:25.620
Do you hang with them?
I've spoken to him a few times,

10
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:28.290
but I don't need to hang with them to know,
look at what he does.

11
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.750
He doesn't go around bullying people.
Doesn't go around lying about people.

12
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.140
It doesn't eat.
You guys aren't doing charity and being like,
Hey Bros,
you know,

13
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.430
and being nice to people and being inspiration.
What happened with him?
Can you,

14
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.300
would you go,
okay,
well let's,
let's go over the actual,
this is,
by the way,

15
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:47.301
this is affected me and affected a lot of youtube people where their youtube

16
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:53.910
videos used to have,
um,
much freer monetization.

17
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.010
Meaning that for people listening,

18
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.160
say if Sargon puts out a youtube video,

19
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.260
you could have ads on that youtube video and your youtube videos get a lot of

20
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:06.950
downloads,
man.
I mean it would be very lucrative for you.
Yeah.

21
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.330
And then with us,

22
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.250
our youtube money was cut by more than 60%

23
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.590
to retain 40% of your income was pretty good as well.
Yeah.

24
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.040
Well the old anything controversial,

25
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.410
anything having to do with anything,

26
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:30.240
right wing is deemed not s not friendly for advertising.

27
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.550
Anything that has drugs in the title is deemed not friendly for advertising.

28
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:40.551
It's like we've literally been able to change the title of things and re upload

29
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:45.600
them and then the ads they accepted just,
yeah,
so the same content.

30
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.960
So what all this came from is Pooty pie who has an enormous youtube presence,

31
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:55.380
right?
Doesn't he have like 50 million followers?
Right.
Holy Shit.
And,

32
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.840
and he made some videos that the,
what is it,
the Washington Post?

33
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.870
Cause I would,
it was Wall Street Journal.
Wall Street Journal.

34
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:07.480
Can I tell you about it?
Please do.
Please do.
Because you,
I'm sure much I got,

35
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.130
I did a bunch of videos on this and it was the funniest thing in the world.

36
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.560
I love the language they used as well.
What's a scoop?

37
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.820
A scoop is a new story that other people are not aware of yet.

38
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.280
You got it first.
So if uh,

39
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.310
if tens of millions of people have seen something and then if I'm a wolf street

40
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:28.630
journalist and I come along and I find something with tens of millions of people

41
00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:31.500
who've seen,
can I rightly call that a scoop?

42
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.940
Well you can definitely call it a news story and you could definitely say that

43
00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:39.660
people in see that.
This goes back to what we were talking about before,

44
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:44.630
whereas they have a hierarchy of viewership.
Like what,

45
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:48.270
what is,
what is a,
a real network?
What does a real newspaper,

46
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.970
what is real journalism like in their mind,

47
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.560
I'm sure the Wall Street Journal considers themselves to be in the hierarchy

48
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.070
versus someone who has helped,
but they don't have 55 million downloads.

49
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.450
They don't,
I mean,

50
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:05.330
there's no way if the w if know the Wall Street Journal puts out a video couple

51
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.710
million.
Yeah.
If they put out a video,
if they got a Wii,

52
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.870
a million hits on their video,
that would be a big deal.
Yeah,
that'd be thrilled.

53
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.700
If Pooty pie on only a million hits,
I'm one of these videos,

54
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.650
he'll be super depressed.
He is a much bigger entity than them.

55
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.330
But in their mind,

56
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.100
like a scoop is them the legitimate media.

57
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.960
So pointing out something in the illegitimate,
this new weird,

58
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:32.710
the CTO Lagos' fear.
Yeah.
So basically PD pie,

59
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:36.530
he's a comedian and he makes jokes,
but he's uh,
like I said,

60
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.180
he's a man of good character and he's parents should be thanking Cutie Pie for

61
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:42.810
being the person he is because he's talking to their kids and their kids are

62
00:03:42.811 --> 00:03:45.550
gonna grow up being decent people because of his influence.

63
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:46.601
But the Wall Street Journal,

64
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.550
Ben Fritz and Rolfe Winkler and there was another one,

65
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:49.540
I can't remember his name at the moment.

66
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.430
They decided what they were going to do is,

67
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:54.000
and I don't know who put them up to this obviously,
but they,

68
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.900
they're going to watch about six months of his video,

69
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.520
go through and find any antisemitic jokes that he had made.
Well,

70
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:04.680
I mean by definition is a joke.
So there's not six months.
Yeah,
six,
eight.

71
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.350
They sat together a video every day and they got about under like two minutes of

72
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:11.710
footage or something with him making jokes at the expense of the Nazis

73
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.600
effectively.
And they were like,

74
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:16.960
well this guy's promoting antisemitism to see those jokes.

75
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:18.250
Cause I've heard about them.

76
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.120
I don't know the actual jokes that he said that they were saying,
but,
but,

77
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:23.400
but here's the point.
Let's get to it.

78
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.590
They were saying that he is making light of being a Nazi or pretending to be a

79
00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:31.120
Nazi and that this is what's fucked up.

80
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.390
Like he was promoting antisemitism by parodying.

81
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:38.770
The Nazis tried to explain to people as hard as Hogan's heroes work,

82
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.480
there isn't a Mel Brooks a bit.
Yeah,
bit of an old antique Jesus Christ.

83
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:47.340
He must be.
Yeah.
Oh God.
Just,
you know,
I mean,

84
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.890
springtime for Hitler,
you could say was somehow or another humanizing,

85
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.900
I imagine to created a lot of Nazis can imagine if somebody argument made the

86
00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:01.250
argument that Mel Gibson created Nazis.
That's how far we've come.

87
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.610
Milberg Mel Brooks.
Mel Gibson.
Yeah,

88
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.950
<v 1>he might.
Well,
today</v>

89
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.180
that was clearly a Friday and all they ever ask you about when someone says,

90
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:13.060
Mel Gibson drunk,
I think of him yelling about Jews and cops.

91
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.130
That's all a big bid and everything's crazy.
Fucking Jews.

92
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.680
See Jesus smells,
Jesus smell,
dude.

93
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.320
Let's get right poster boy,
right?
Yeah.
Well he is,
well,

94
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:28.170
he's a serious like nine 11 and

95
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.810
<v 0>conspiracy the lever and yeah,
where's that Charlie Sheen?
Oh,</v>

96
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:36.160
probably lumping them together,
but got my pain.
The,
these,
these videos.
I'm,

97
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:39.490
one of them was the funniest thing because they were taking like,
you know,

98
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.310
the jokes were like,
you know,
like I'm there,

99
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.710
like 20 seconds of joke taken out like a 10 minute video,
you know,

100
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.440
where he's just,
it's just like a cutaway to it,
you know,
skit,
uh,
you know,

101
00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:51.320
Wah Wah.
I'm like,
you know what?

102
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.420
One of them was a joke about how the media takes his jokes out of context to try

103
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:00.010
and frame him as something new.
Right,

104
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.860
and they cut that out of context and used it and it was just like,

105
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:06.260
well that is it.
Which is amazing.
It's incredible.

106
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.840
It's amazing that they had the balls to do it and they would,

107
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.520
they would not only be proud of what they did.

108
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.350
They called it a scoop and then they went to advertisers and said,

109
00:06:14.351 --> 00:06:18.320
look at this hate speech,
but how did they get away with doing that?

110
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.430
No one can lend them to how come no one from the Wall Street Journal sat them

111
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:23.720
down and said,
well listen,

112
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.250
this is definitely not him saying that you're going to take something out of

113
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:29.570
context and then doing it.

114
00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:33.020
Is it because of it is and then you took it out of context and did exactly what

115
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:37.160
he's saying you shouldn't do.
That's kind of crazy.
It's mental.

116
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.040
It is mental.
It's absolutely it's,

117
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.930
but they feel like they can get away with it because they're in the hallowed

118
00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:45.610
halls of actual media and they're putting this stuff out there.
JVC,

119
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.800
you define it,
see it,
see what you can be.

120
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.700
The terms of the jokes that Pooty pie said there were supposedly the,

121
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.540
the funny thing though is if you look at the numbers,
they look like that.

122
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.330
The Wall Street Journal,
if you look at his numbers,
they look like that.

123
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.380
What's so strange?

124
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.030
He's making hand gestures down for the Wall Street Journal up for Pooty Pie.

125
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:04.861
And what?

126
00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:08.210
What's so strange about it though is that Peter Pan isn't that competition.

127
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.500
All right,
here we go.
Here we go.
Let's play with some of them.
Great.

128
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.670
Let's see what we got here.
My name is Pia.
Whoa.

129
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.100
Okay.
So Dan,
27 year old,
but known as PD pot

130
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.410
<v 2>playing video games on Youtube.
Typical Nazis.</v>

131
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.903
<v 3>Okay.</v>

132
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.610
<v 0>53 million subscriber.
You still 55 now Jesus.</v>

133
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.750
The biggest star on the site by far the stories.

134
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:43.410
Oh No,
that's best scoop.
It's better.
Let's get into the latest scoop.

135
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.560
<v 2>So it's him.
This is the,
I think this is the one recently,</v>

136
00:07:50.561 --> 00:07:53.800
some of his videos are brief including Nazi messages,
images of

137
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.710
<v 0>Adolf Hitler and explicit antisemitic commentary.</v>

138
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.240
So this is the Washington Post's version and we'll strip street the Wall Street

139
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:01.960
Journal rather sorry.

140
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.150
Following a request for comment from the Wall Street Journal.

141
00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:07.900
Disney said the videos are inappropriate and cut ties to Pooty pie who ran his

142
00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:12.901
business cost of millions of dollars of Disney subsidiary maker studios cost

143
00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:16.960
Pooty pie millions in a January 11th video,
Mr Blah blah blah,

144
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:21.370
featured two men holding assigned reading death to all Jews after hiring them

145
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.340
more freelance website.
I liked the editing.

146
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:33.170
See the joke is his reaction to the fact that you could subscribe to Kim Star

147
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:35.290
who was like a another big youtube,
but he's mocking them.

148
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.180
I don't think they would actually do it.

149
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.310
I feel partially responsible but just I didn't think they would.

150
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.980
It might just be my sense of crude,
sense of humor,

151
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.170
but I think there's something funny about that.

152
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:52.000
And I don't fire the media for miss characterizing him about,
again,

153
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:56.130
I think there's a difference between a joke and actual like

154
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.340
<v 4>fucking death to all Jews.
If I made a video saying,
hey guys,
uh,</v>

155
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.450
Peter Pie here,
death to all Jews,

156
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.520
I want you to say after me death to all Jews.

157
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.370
And um,
you know,
Hitler was right.

158
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.180
I really opened my eyes to why power and I think it's time that we did something

159
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:18.474
about it.

160
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.050
That's essentially how they're reporting this as if that's what I was saying or

161
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:23.040
some shit like that.

162
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.510
<v 0>Well,
it's amazing how popular it is with such a shitty grasp of English.</v>

163
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.430
He's Swedish.
Apologies.

164
00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:31.820
Can camouflage messages that may still be received and celebrated by hate
groups.

165
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.110
The southern poverty law center says,
yeah.
So if,

166
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.270
if the southern poverty law center condemns you,

167
00:09:38.271 --> 00:09:41.300
it's becoming a bit of a badge of honor these days.
In the video since removed,

168
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.090
he posted a video of a man dressed as Jesus Christ.

169
00:09:44.091 --> 00:09:48.860
I love how they have like since removed is bold and then Jesus Christ is really

170
00:09:48.861 --> 00:09:50.310
nice guy.
The Jesus guy.
Yeah.

171
00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.730
<v 5>What the fuck?
You only want it to act upon.
God's will.</v>

172
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.920
Don't worry though.
He stands beside God now he isn't.
Wait,

173
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.880
that's all folks Jesus out.

174
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:07.380
<v 4>And I wasn't the one who made him say in or was it?
No,
it wasn't.</v>

175
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.000
I don't think so.
He set up a go fund me page and his own website.

176
00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:16.320
So you can take orders from Jesus himself.
And also,

177
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:17.663
can I just point out

178
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.230
<v 0>this is not what I'm looking for.
Where,</v>

179
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:26.220
where are the actual videos of him doing the,
the Nazi shit?
That was it.

180
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.430
That's 100% it is their article that led to all of this.
Yeah.

181
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.700
Right.
But what we're looking at here,

182
00:10:32.701 --> 00:10:36.180
this is the Wall Street Journal's version of it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So this is,

183
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.240
these are the clips that they said,

184
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.590
this is the actual clips that they're saying are the thing that shows him to be

185
00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:44.760
antisemetic.
Holy Shit.
The most of it was,

186
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.140
I thought it was way better.

187
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:49.260
I mean there and I thought it was just a little video he got made off Fiverr.

188
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.260
Yeah,
it's just him prancing around on the Internet.
It's just,

189
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:55.090
it's just silly childish jokes and it's obviously,
I mean,

190
00:10:55.091 --> 00:10:58.110
how many Nazis do you think this made?
Three.
Really?

191
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.930
That's how I got to say hi.
This is so stupid.
It's like you don't,

192
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.620
it doesn't take a lot to like turn them.

193
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.630
There was the really bad thing about this though is the fact that they didn't

194
00:11:09.631 --> 00:11:14.190
put this article out until they had like taken these clips and dumped him into

195
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.310
Disney and Disney.
Disney obviously new shit.

196
00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:20.550
There's going to be a shit storm about this.
Why are they drawn to do this?

197
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.840
Let's go attack.
But why?
What is it?

198
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:28.260
Cause losing money is politics and politics as well.
Yeah.

199
00:11:28.261 --> 00:11:31.830
He marks like,
you know,
he mocks feminism.
He knows mocks social justice.
He's not,

200
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.190
he's not,
he's a liberal.
He's not a progressive.
That's the difference.

201
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.530
Why would they think that they could just do that though?

202
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.950
Because they've got the power to do that.
No one can stop them.
You couldn't,

203
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.960
but they did.
It cost him millions of dollars.
I'm sure they did.

204
00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:46.890
But now costing them their reputation.
I'm salinity.
Yeah.

205
00:11:46.891 --> 00:11:50.880
I mean you can't just do that street journals.
They,

206
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.340
they took a big hit from this.
I'm sure that unbelievably arrogant.

207
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.020
Well actually you,
it's really interesting,
right?

208
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.030
There was a off after all of this shit,

209
00:11:58.031 --> 00:12:02.290
so blue over there was a bunch of polls done of like 13 to 18 year olds and it

210
00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:04.390
was really,
really fascinating how um,

211
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.830
you had like favorability and how well known things where and like youtube was

212
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:11.260
really well known,
really favorable with kids,
you know?

213
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.820
And then you had the Wall Street Journal,

214
00:12:12.821 --> 00:12:17.270
which was really well known but really unfavorable with kids.
How do,

215
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.170
how the kids know what the Wall Street generalists because of Pewdie Pie.

216
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.620
So now they strict with the Wall Street Journal and this why the millions of

217
00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:25.240
people that are his fans.
Exactly.

218
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:29.740
Well that's a big mistake to a guy with a platform like that in 10 years time

219
00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:32.680
when the voters and the were reading and consuming news,

220
00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.980
the Wall Street Journal will continue to be that.
They'll continue to go down.

221
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.060
Pierre Dupont's still be doing well.
But what's the,

222
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.540
what's crazy is I never thought of the Wall Street Journal.

223
00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:44.020
Is that what I thought of the Wall Street Journal as being like informative,

224
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.690
objective information about business.

225
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.870
When if you asked me like what is the Wall Street Journal?

226
00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:52.840
That's how I've always thought of them.
So to see the,

227
00:12:52.841 --> 00:12:55.150
see this video pretty shocking isn't it?

228
00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:58.360
Well it is disturbing because there's nothing there.
No it Mike,

229
00:12:58.361 --> 00:12:59.950
the death to all Jews thing.

230
00:12:59.951 --> 00:13:04.951
The fact that city did he pay those guys to hold up that sign like $5 to write

231
00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:08.770
on a sign so he could go oh cause you know cause has to be right.

232
00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:12.880
He's just breaking it to exactly what exactly.
If nobody had said anything,

233
00:13:12.881 --> 00:13:13.391
nothing would come.

234
00:13:13.391 --> 00:13:16.480
It's in poor taste and if you're representing Disney you can't fuck with that

235
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:20.270
stuff.
That's all that is.
He's been understand shit.
It's not,

236
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.410
my point is I'm defending them.
It's not evidence of antisemitism.
No.
Yeah,
no.

237
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.070
He's just saying something fucked up because he's trying to be shocking.
Yeah.

238
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.030
He's just think that Hitler stuff like,
Holy Shit.
There was nothing there.

239
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.400
Not so stupid.
It's just the stupidest thing in the world.

240
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.510
<v 6>[inaudible]
okay.</v>
