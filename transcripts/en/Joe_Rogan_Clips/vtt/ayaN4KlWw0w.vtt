1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.010
Didn't like the earlier ones.
He's older.
It's all marine,

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.870
which is supposed to be right.
If his body can recuperate from anything.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.930
Why the fuck the aging?
Exactly.
Come on.
Why is he agent like that?

4
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:12.120
Stanley come on where he's losing some of his muscle,

5
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:15.450
but he's still throwing people to the air.
They're talking about he gets shot,

6
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:18.600
recovers right away,
but it's fucking joints hurt his arthritis.

7
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.070
What's happening to the arthritis?
No.
No.
You'd really moved like it these days.

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.970
I don't know if he officially does.
I'm just saying it doesn't make sense.

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.540
How about to come out with another fucking Spiderman?
Oh,
thank God.

10
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:32.790
They need a new Spiderman.
They never want to pay Peter Parker.

11
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.000
When Peter Parker's starts getting big,
they go,
yeah,
well guess what?

12
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.190
We're going to reboot it.
I just keep playing voting it.

13
00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:40.810
They keep telling the same story over and over again with subtle differences.

14
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.450
My spidermans Tobey Maguire,

15
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:46.950
you fuck you fuck take rocks.
Uh,
tell you what though.

16
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.070
The only time that that's worked though the hawk.
Yeah,
they've done it.
Okay.

17
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.110
They started off with that Australian dude from chopper.
What's his name?

18
00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.020
Eric Bana.
Eric Bana.
He was number one,
wasn't thrilled about him as the hawk,

19
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.830
not his fault.
It wasn't his fault.

20
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.700
It wasn't the best managed script and then I had Norton pretty good as a hawk

21
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.800
fan of Ed Norton.
I was like,
okay,
I can buy this.

22
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.830
But then mark refollow best hawk,
best home,
I believe him.

23
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.950
I believe he's really a scientist too.

24
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.410
I really believe he really understands genetics.

25
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.440
You know like Christian Bale is the best Batman.
You're talking about real act.

26
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.480
I agree.
Sorry,
Ben Affleck.
I agree.

27
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.490
How about Michael Keaton was Batman.
Who the fuck that was a good guy.

28
00:01:28.491 --> 00:01:32.160
Dan Batman high cast.
Michael top about this.
George Clooney's Batman too.

29
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.150
He's a fucking Mr. Steal your girl.
I bought George Clooney.
I brought,

30
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.160
I didn't buy for a second.
Oh,

31
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:42.030
when Jim Carrey was the Riddler and then Tommy Lee Joint Jones was to phase.

32
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.300
Those are the best Batman when they were like,
oh,
we need to make this more real.

33
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:48.900
I'm like,
fuck you.
I liked Arnold Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze.
Wait a minute.

34
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:52.820
Who was the Riddler?
Jim Carey was the Riddler.
When?
Who Was Batman?
Uh,

35
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.580
George Clooney.
No Batman returns.
Broan wow.

36
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.350
But Christian Bale's Batman forever.
Sorry.

37
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.570
Christian Bale's it better that it's too real.

38
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.410
Do you know Christian Bale was Batman only like six months after he was the

39
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:08.340
machinist.
That's insane.
Yeah.
I got sue really insane.

40
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.250
He would be down to like almost nothing.
He was dying.

41
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.440
He was eating like a can of tuna and an apple a day.
That's insane.

42
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.291
Kind of willpower.

43
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:20.400
You have to have to let your body literally rot away to this skinny thing for a

44
00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:23.650
movie.
Just for a movie.
You don't have anorexia.
You don't have a disease.

45
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.750
How much you loved the craft of act and to do.
Yeah,
man.

46
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.840
Yeah.
Everybody trying to be the drug to these days though.

47
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.790
That's like the big one.
Tony Hinchcliffe.
He's tries to be,
excuse me,
Tony.

48
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.950
Tony wants to be the joker.
Yeah,
look,
so look,

49
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:42.530
he went from that to that one 21 to one 95 that's all natural.
That's insane.

50
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.130
There was another movie in between,
I think equilibrium.

51
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:47.550
It said there's not a picture of here,
dude,

52
00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:51.660
you're telling me that's not photo shopped at all on the left?
No,
no,
no.

53
00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:54.150
That's what it really looks like.
That is so unhealthy.
Oh Dude.

54
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:57.960
It takes years off your life.
I mean,
you're putting unbelievable stress.

55
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.890
He organized,
he's a beast.
He's English.
You know that.
I thought he's Australian.

56
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.480
He is.
He is.
He thinks so.
I thought that this act really English bro.

57
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.300
A lot of them are Australian.
They'll,
they'll throw you for a loop Jack,

58
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.700
but Jackman like as an actor,
like Christian Bale at your words.

59
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.240
He does some stuff.
Wolverine night.
Look,
I'm a fan.
Don't get me wrong.
Um,

60
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.260
but Christian bale does some stuff like in American psycho.
Okay.

61
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.910
That's another one.
Dude,
he was in the fighter when he put,

62
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.610
when he played a Micky ward's brother.
Oh my God.
Dude.

63
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.150
Up and down the whole time when 85 201191305145 him and reign of fire,

64
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:43.030
he is bodied the fuck up.

65
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.090
So he got down skinny again to play a Micky ward's brother and meth addict.

66
00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:50.320
Yeah.
Yeah,
I forget.
Mickey wears his brother,

67
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:52.680
but his brother fought sugar ray Leonard.
Yeah.

68
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.150
This is like between two rescue dogs and we saw that one fucking beast.

69
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.030
That dragon movie was dope for one of them.
Silly dumb movies.

70
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.300
Which Dragon Movies in a dragon movie.
What was the dragon movie he was in?

71
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.310
Was It in dragon movie with Matthew mcconaughey?
If it was uh,

72
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.610
it was in the future.
Yeah.
The everybody had to live underground drugs.

73
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.640
I did them all.
They had to live Raina fire.
Oh,
of fire.
Yeah.

74
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.780
Yeah.
That's the drag number.
That's a reign of fire.
Oh Damn.

75
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.430
There's a dragon movie.

Matthew Pecan Hayes jacked in that movie.
Oh Man.

76
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.630
Super jacked to see.

77
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:28.780
He got Super Skinny for Dallas buyers club when he had eight.
Yeah,

78
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:29.800
He's another one.
Yes.

79
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:34.750
See if you get a picture of Matthew mcconaughey jacked dude.

80
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.130
I heard rumors about Tom Hardy shirtless take when Matthew mcconaughey shirtless

He was jacked for this moment for her to that movie.
Not Math.

83
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.170
It's a dumb movie.
Is it?
Is it bad?
It's just dumb.

84
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:55.660
It's entertaining.
It's silly.
You know that these dragons,

85
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.880
fuck everybody up and you know,

I watch game of Thrones.

Spoiler.
You fuck's been up for nine years.
He Burns that fucking frozen wall.

89
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.140
I'm talking about standing ovation.
I was in the middle of my living room.

90
00:05:15.141 --> 00:05:18.490
Slow clap.
Those dragons are fun and scary that when they,

91
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.170
the one turns into a fucking white walk.
Yeah,

Ooh.

Don't ever cancel it.

94
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.060
Just keep going.
It's all just,

95
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:32.380
you're never going to do anything better than that.

96
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.220
Now that's the greatest show of all time.
I know.

97
00:05:34.221 --> 00:05:36.910
I don't know what you're thinking.
Just write some new episodes.

98
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.140
Figure out some new shit.
The greatest show of all,

Look at that.
Miss Jana.
Matthew mcconaughey,

100
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.510
jacked Jack.
I feel like for me to get that skinny and thin,

101
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:50.800
I would have to go on some,

102
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:54.610
I'd have to get some roll like Dallas buyers club and blew it up one right above

103
00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:58.060
that.
Right above that.
Right above your cursor.
Right,
right there.

104
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.540
I'm on different,
Oh,
who's that?
That's Bradley Cooper.
Cooper bodied up to son.

105
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.130
Look at him,
but wouldn't you get do all of the steroids to play these roles?

106
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.920
I think they called me to be Batman.
I'd like a,
all right,

107
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:12.650
let me get down a gold's gym.
See you.
I can do,
yeah,
you would have to.

108
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.570
You'd have to.
You'd have to go on the carnivore diet.
Drop your body fat down.

109
00:06:16.571 --> 00:06:20.640
I wouldn't you though.
Yeah.
Intermittent fasting.
Just the whole cryo every day.

110
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.050
Yeah,
you would.
You'd be training camp,
get shredded,
be training camp.

111
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.250
You would want to have that scene.

112
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:28.250
What you're putting on your fucking outfit and you're just talking odd like we

113
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:32.880
need more scenes where I'm sure it lists town downtown bullshit.

114
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.960
Oh,
Ryan Reynolds.
Ryan ramp.
Is that Ryan?

115
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.900
That's blade blade blade three.
That's Ryan Reynolds and blade three.
Well,

116
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.180
who is that guy that's,
oh no,
that's next level.

117
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.990
See if that's what you got to try for.
That's what you gotta try for.

118
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.460
No one ever tries to that.
Do chicks don't dig that though.

119
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.800
Take fucking shot.
Take that shot.

120
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.920
They say that because they're trying to make you feel better.
Oh my God.

121
00:06:57.921 --> 00:07:01.930
I think it's so gross.
I like geysers soft.
I liked it.

122
00:07:01.931 --> 00:07:06.130
Grab your back and fill up fat.
Look at Ryan Reynolds with this.
Fuck no bro.
Pack.

123
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.730
No.
Oh my God.
It way.
I mean,

124
00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:13.250
I definitely don't want his dick in my mouth.

125
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.490
A little belly fat on my nose.
Full rack of ribs now fuck in the shake.

126
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:21.470
Once we're done with this shit,
man.

127
00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:24.920
He was just relax like me and doesn't want to deal much.
