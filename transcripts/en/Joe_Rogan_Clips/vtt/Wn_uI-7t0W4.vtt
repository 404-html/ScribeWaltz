1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.840
Right?
So coming to the fights this weekend,
I was invited.
I was like,

2
00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:08.010
hopefully we get along and have a fucking dope.
We got along.
It was fine.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.330
I have massive respect.
You know,
Brian's a crazy motherfucker.
I tell a story,

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.080
you know,
that whole school down there,
it was,

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.350
I wanted to tell the story about mine because he
fucking,

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.190
he's hilarious.
He's,
I used to take,
uh,

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.160
Tony Rts is one of the senior students or master choice.
Another guy won't,

8
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.900
we'll call him chuck,
but he's with the government now.

9
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:35.780
He's a fucking bad motherfucker.
So they always used to go around and,
and,

10
00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:39.270
and wanna fight balances and all this shit.
That was what they did.

11
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.730
They would fucking fight the biggest,

12
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.890
scariest looking motherfuckers and just destroyed him.
So blue worked.

13
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.510
I said his name,
sorry.
But my friend worked with a cro mags and stuff.

14
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.620
We took them out security,
uh,
with us in case we have problems or whatever.

15
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:58.620
So it was like everything always went smooth.

16
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:03.060
So one time I used to work at all the underground hip hop clubs in New York.

17
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:08.061
So my friend was doing a party and it was all fucking deep Brooklyn heads,

18
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:11.040
fucking like homeboys and shit like the real deal.

19
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:13.830
This hip hop club and I take Brian,

20
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.930
another dude from the school and Tony and we go over there and Brian is in the

21
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:23.991
middle of the fucking dance floor doing the Funky fucking white boy nerd dance

22
00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:25.050
and all these fuck.

23
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:30.051
And the floor just opens up in these fucking black fuck and hip hop crazy

24
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:34.350
fucking homeboys are like,
Yo,
look at this mother fucking white boy.

25
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:38.670
Like it's bugging and he don't give a fuck.
He's ill.
Seriously,

26
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:41.390
like a fucking piss it have to roll with.

27
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.380
So then I might go,
ah,
I got to go.
But listen man,

28
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.000
I know what y'all motherfuckers do.
Don't start.
No Shit,
please.

29
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:54.630
It's my friend's club.
So I get home,
go to sleep,

30
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.300
wake up the next day I get a fucking phone call,
Yo.

31
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.330
Like he didn't know that they were with me.
He's like,
Yo,

32
00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:04.410
there was these three fucking karate experts in the club last night and they

33
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:09.120
beat up all my fucking bouncers.
Dude.
It was fucking crazy.
Like,

34
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.800
and,
uh,
one bounce walked up and started some shit with,
uh,

35
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.000
Tony was trying to talk to a girl,
whatever.
And,
and then like,
you know,

36
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:20.910
this guys all on the juice rips off his shirt like,

37
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.190
fuck a Tony throws a kick,

38
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:27.840
fucking dislocates the guy's fucking knee cap.
And then,

39
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.550
uh,
the melee just ensued any,
it,
it was just constant.

40
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.980
These fucking huge bouncers,
common Adam and Brian sack.
I fucking,

41
00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:42.840
Brian could fight.
Brian is a,
uh,
you know,
he's,

42
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.710
he's,
he's a comedian,
but he could throw it down.
And then he,

43
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.100
Brian just told me this because I didn't hear the other party.
He goes,
yeah,

44
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.940
then all of a sudden I'm fucking whack and these dudes and us,

45
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.900
we're fighting these guys.
And then this fucking gigantic motherfucker.

46
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.650
Like I was just like a little fucking baby in his arms,

47
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.890
lifts me up and carries me out the fucking door and throws me across this car.

48
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.300
And I look and I turned around and I'm ready to go.
And then Brian says,

49
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:13.991
and I look in,

50
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:18.991
it's this fucking crazy white dude with a fucking scar from one end of his face

51
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:25.900
down his throat and he points at behind it goes,
don't even think about it.

52
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.780
And like Brian was like,
Yo,
well my friend called me up the next day,

53
00:03:29.781 --> 00:03:32.890
he's like these motherfuckers and I called him up and I'm Mike Bryant.

54
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.330
The fuck did you do man,
I told you guys to fucking keep chill.
He's like,
Yo,

55
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:41.980
these bounces were assholes and you know it was,
he's,
he's a,

56
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:45.490
he's a character.
Like I said,
I was at his first comedy show ever.

57
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.080
He lived a wildlife in his young days.
I met him after all that stuff.

58
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:54.250
I met him when he was more calm.
I met him in the 90s yeah.
Yeah.

59
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:55.660
They were in big time.

60
00:03:55.661 --> 00:04:00.661
Master Choi was all about fucking getting out there and fucking contact.

61
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:04.070
There was a lot of martial arts coaches,

62
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.670
instructors that wanted you to get in street fights.
Yeah.

63
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.610
Cause you would practice cause it looks,

64
00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:11.380
treat fights would show you how things would work in the real world.

65
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:15.460
That the more you did it,
the more you understood urgency,
closing the distance,

66
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.100
you know,
delivering the first strike,
all that kind of shit.

67
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:22.600
Like people were hesitant.
Cause in sparring you always hold back.
So like,

68
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.700
you know,
I Wando background.
