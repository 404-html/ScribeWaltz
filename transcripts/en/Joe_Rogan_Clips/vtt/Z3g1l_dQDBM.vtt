1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.750
Can I have you that fun?
He'll blow up a paper view.
Yeah,
for sure.

2
00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:07.110
So cause you still look great.
Phenomenal.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.760
He's ends in La Right now.

4
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.350
Training with Freddy and they said he's real thin to looking at a 55 fight.
Wow.

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.960
And even though even though it could be,
does stand a lot and,

6
00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:19.500
and play on his feet a lot,
his,

7
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.400
his main objective is to take a motherfucker down.
That's the main,

8
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:27.780
that's number one.
Don't fuck around and throw some strikes.
Why?

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.500
Why are they still talking about a Floyd Mayweather fight?
It's embarrassing.

10
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.380
I don't know what the fuck they're doing is just talking about,
I know he goes,

11
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.790
I have three fights left.
If it's up to me,
it's Tony Gsp,

12
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:43.680
GSP and fully man Floyd Mayweather.
When I hear that I want to throw up.

13
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.360
But what do you,
they just want some money and get the fuck out.

14
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.410
Do you think he thinks he can beat him cause he's such a savage.

15
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.120
Mike can't beat him.

16
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:53.940
Like they don't think Floyd can knock him out while we're in for a rude

17
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:58.200
awakening.
Well he certainly bad.
Are you?
I mean,

18
00:00:58.201 --> 00:01:01.920
maybe he lasts all 12,
but they get battered to fuck up will be awful.

19
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.350
But he'll be okay.

20
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.300
You know what's going to get paid if that's what you wanna do you get paid?
Do I?

21
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.980
I'd much rather see him fighting GSP.
Yeah,
me too.
But I don't think,
um,

22
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.060
I don't think it's,
I mean it's a terrible move for him to fight.

23
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:17.130
Floyd Floyd would just look,

24
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.900
Floyd is the best box or maybe of our era maybe of all time.

25
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.840
He's,
he's undefeated.
Here's the problem.
The UFC,

26
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:27.440
let Connor do that once and now he's Kinda,

27
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.110
we can barely get them to fight is worth a hundred.

28
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.680
You galean dollars and they're like,
do please fight.
He's like,
Nah,

29
00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:35.040
I make so much money,
whiskey and this.
Yeah,
I'll fight when I'm ready.

30
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.200
They're not gonna let that ever,
you're never going to see that again.

31
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.330
I don't think you ever,
you see that crazy.

32
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:44.331
They made an app now that now,

33
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.473
now that,
uh,

34
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.080
the Fertittas don't own the UFC and now like this corporation owns it.

35
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.790
Now everyone is not one is at the helm.
But what are you saying?

36
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.110
I'm saying that Connor has so much leverage now where it's not a good thing,

37
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:02.520
so you think you're going to make someone a giant star who could be a giant star

38
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:04.590
because they're worried that person's going to have leverage.
No,

39
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:06.390
they'll make them a giant star in the UFC.

40
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:09.840
They're not going to let him jump over and do a co-promotion with Floyd

41
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.160
Mayweather.
Again,
listen to doing it.
Who else would they do it with theirs?

42
00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:17.570
That's the better question.
Here's the thing.
If they had another Connor,

43
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.970
they do it the same way.
It's a way to make money.
It's a smart way to make money.

44
00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:23.880
It was a fun fight.
We watched it.
We got to seat.
You can sit education.

45
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.240
It's an education for people that appreciate martial arts because you really got

46
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:30.570
to understand what a world class top of the food chain,

47
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:33.900
maybe the best of all time boxer does to an MMA fighter and you think we're

48
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:37.020
going to pay for it.
The general audience,
he keeps paying for that.

49
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.750
I'm not what I'm saying.
What I'm saying is is it was getting us up.

50
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.590
It was good for the,

51
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.440
it was good for the sport and if someone comes along that's different.

52
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.490
Someone comes along,

53
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:48.300
it's not Floyd did someone else and the same situation arises again and this is

54
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:50.610
another opportunity to make a shitload of money.
They're going to do it again.

55
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.000
How many tenants do you see in a load?
Floyd's 40 years old.

56
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:55.920
He probably doesn't want to do it that many more times.

57
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.840
The only thing that would fuck Floyd up is it.

58
00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:00.920
His extravagant isn't a bad look for MMA too.

59
00:03:00.921 --> 00:03:05.380
So let's say Floyd's 27 at this point and he's one of the greatest and we go,

60
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:09.820
here's Connor smokes him,
here's Khabib's smoked him here.
Style bench smokes it.

61
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.740
At what point is UFC like this a bad look man,
our guys can fucking torched with.

62
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:19.741
Depends on whether or not it's obvious that they had no chance.

63
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.130
Like with Connor,
the,

64
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.020
the interesting thing is like he landed a couple of shots get up and you go,

65
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.920
okay,
if this guy could take this guy down or even just kick his legs,

66
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.290
if car I could just kick his legs,
it would be a wash.

67
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.630
And it's interesting to watch someone even fail against someone who's way better

68
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:40.690
at their sport.
The real question is,
you're ever,

69
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.500
are you ever going to see a worldclass boxer by Tom?
We saw James,
Tony,

70
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.030
he had been like really late in the game when Vince Phillips Fought Masato and k

71
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:52.660
one he was way late in the game.
They were on their way out looking for money.

72
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:57.250
Right?
Afterthoughts,
right after thoughts for the most part,
for the most part.

73
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.120
Do you ever think you're going to see like a,
uh,

74
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.030
a Crawford step into MMA Aloma Chanko step in MMA in their prime?

75
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.220
I don't think so.
Why would you get making so much money?

76
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.560
I know they need to make it sell cause if they're at that level,

77
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:15.610
they're making so much money and you,
why would you risk going to the UFC?

78
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.630
Think about in 50 years how awesome that put a poster is going to be at Conor

79
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:23.170
and Floyd fucking I love frame that.

80
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.530
She loves going to be 90 and it's going to be framed and I have that shit.

81
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:31.150
I have the official one,
Joe Louis Max Schmeling Dolly and Gnocchi.

82
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.840
Yeah.
Oh,
you're in your living room.
See,

83
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.710
I'm all good on that.
See,
I saw that.
It was a great spectacle.

84
00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:43.300
I love being part of watching.
I'm glad killed the paper views.
I'm out,
man.

85
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.120
If someone else does it,
it's not,
it's fun.
I don't think talking about,

86
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.830
so if someone else comes along,

87
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.000
so you're telling me you same person would and Connor,

88
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.210
I'm saying it could be even Floyd,
you'd be like,

89
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.450
well you're talking to degenerate.
I watch it.

90
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.490
I watch women fuck in their underwear.
Beetle kill you like me to,

91
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.710
I'm saying the mass is,
I don't think,
God don't worry about the mat.

92
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:04.120
I don't think.
I don't think you're right.

93
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.430
Well that's what the UFC where think many more.

94
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.270
If it could be stepped in and tried to fight Floyd right now.
Right now,

95
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.530
if they set it up in two months,

96
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.760
I guarantee you it would sell at least a million pages about an encounter.

97
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.720
You would want to say you think it does?
No,

98
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.890
I don't think that's close to a million.
I said it does.

99
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:23.840
1 million could fight the fucking Jamie from,

100
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.790
do you think you would do a million pay per views or more or more something
like,

101
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:29.890
well,
here's the thing,
you'd be proud to a million.
It's Floyd.

102
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:32.770
He doesn't miss when,
who was,
um,

103
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.810
who was a Floyd's last fall?
Was it Pacquiao and then Tim Bradley,

104
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.080
if I pack out then Tim Bradley and I'm retired.
Right.
And the pack,

105
00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:44.920
y'all got the giant,
the most paper view numbers ever.
But then Tim Bradley,

106
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:49.230
if I'm correct,
only got a few hundred thousand,
like 300,000 out of there.

107
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.920
Wasn't that right?
Yeah,
that's right.

108
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.100
So then he fights Connor and he gets like 2 million,

109
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:57.760
whatever the fuck it was her giant paper.
You say Andre Berto.
Rj Birds.

110
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.330
That's right.
So he fought.
My apologies.
Tim Bradley.

111
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.140
So then he fights Andre Berto that only gets 350,000 or something like that.

112
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:09.190
Pay per view buys.
Then he flights.
Connor fights Connor,

113
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.120
and it's millions of pay per views.
If he fucked could be,

114
00:06:12.121 --> 00:06:14.480
but it would still be better than fighting any of those other guys.
Agree.

115
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:18.360
100% Bradley.
Like if safe,
he had a fight with Bradley or save Nolan's tuna.
No,

116
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.360
that couldn't be that many pack elvish fully middle is probably,

117
00:06:21.361 --> 00:06:24.160
you can get that again.
It's a big one.
That's a big one.
Especially bandy pack.

118
00:06:24.161 --> 00:06:28.550
Hell now after we be Broner.
After he backed up that Australian dude look good.

119
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.500
He looked very Jeff [inaudible],
the Australian guy,

120
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:34.490
he lost his power TC and then

121
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.920
40 40 okay.
He's still good.
