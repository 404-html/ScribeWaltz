1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.780
Decided it's going as I've gotten older,
I can't even read my Twitter feed.

2
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:06.030
I have,
fuck these people.
I don't live,
I don't read it.

3
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:08.250
If I don't put my glasses on,
I don't know what the fuck they're saying.

4
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.690
Oh my God,
it's so,
so,
so good.

5
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.490
But get depressing.
It actually,

6
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.050
I'm sitting psychosis is a different thing.
Okay.
Okay.
I think we're,
we're,

7
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.250
we are dope though.
Discussing overall mental health.
Yes.
I mean,
look,

8
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:26.670
I'm saying this because I really think that this is something that I've,

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.840
I've made a big turn over the last few years,
uh,

10
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.820
with myself that I take a quick bathroom break.
He's gone.

11
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.090
I don't think marijuana is a safe,
as I used to think it is.

12
00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:38.760
I used to think it was benign.
I really used to think there was no big deal.

13
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:43.200
But I have a friend that I discussed the other day who was a really confident

14
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.740
fucking muscular,
handsome man that never did anything.

15
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.060
And he took a marijuana edible to go to sleep.
And for two weeks,

16
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:53.390
this guy was funny.
This is a different guy.
Not that I was talking to.

17
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:57.060
Not Not Rafi,
no.
A different guy.
He took it and the experience,

18
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:01.320
suicidal thoughts and all these,
he had like severe consequences.

19
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.290
I think that the human beings,

20
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.530
we vary so much biologically that to just make this overall blanket statement,

21
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.700
what's good for you is good for me is irresponsible and I've been irresponsible

22
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.070
in saying that.
Well one reason,
it's interesting,
one not reason.

23
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:21.030
I think that alcohol is so widely accepted despite all the problems it causes.

24
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:21.900
And again,

25
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.400
alcohol can certainly cause problems is that alcohol affects most people pretty

26
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:28.460
much the same way.
You know if,

27
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.130
and you sorta know if what somebody looks like when they have one drink,

28
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:34.650
when they have five drinks,
I've got some trans,

29
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.800
I've got some friends that get those [inaudible] you ever see when people get

30
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:39.690
sharp guys they just gone.

31
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.930
Then they start talking crazy and like Whoa,

32
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.380
but you sorta know that and you sort of know how long it's gonna take to clear

33
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:49.830
your body.
Yes,
cannabis is so different.

34
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.460
It's really complicated drug and it does affect different people in different

35
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:57.890
ways.
And also the tolerance has changed radically.
So you know,

36
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.200
people say,
well two and a half milligrams of Thc,
you vape it.

37
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:04.080
That's like one drink for somebody who you know,
who doesn't use.

38
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.990
But then if you're,
if you're a tolerant user,

39
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.470
you can use 200 milligrams in a day.
That's 80 drinks.

40
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.300
It's a weird drug.
And then there's the issue of eating it.
When you eat it,

41
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:18.720
your body produces something called 11 hydroxy metabolite.

42
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.670
It's a far more psychoactive.
You were all along for the ride when that happens.

43
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:26.580
Yes you are.
Yes.
And it can take days for it to get out of your system.

44
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.940
I know many people have eaten marijuana edibles and then they call me up the

45
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:34.620
next day like,
dude,
I'm still hot.
Yeah,
it's true.
So I think,

46
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.030
I think the legalization community has sorta said for years like,
oh,

47
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:41.990
there's basically no downsides to this.
There's only upsides.

48
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.090
The cops will bus smokers,
there'll be tax revenue.

49
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.390
All these people have a way to get high.
That's clearly safer than alcohol.

50
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.020
And unfortunately that's just not true.
I think you're right.
And I think the,

51
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.600
the issue that people,

52
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.770
from what I've read are having with your book are people that are marijuana

53
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.860
advocates to think that your position is unbalanced and that you've ignored the

54
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:07.030
positive aspects of THC in terms of like what he was talking about cognitive

55
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:11.170
benefits for people with psychotic episodes and that you are only focusing on

56
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:15.820
the negative or plead guilty to that cause I think that for 20 years people have

57
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:18.890
only heard the positive.
Right.
I think that's a,

58
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.300
I think that's also I'll plead guilty to up myself cause I think that I've only

59
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:26.680
been discussing the positives and one of the things that I've tried very hard to

60
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:29.800
do and one of the things I've learned how to do from doing this podcast and

61
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:32.710
experienced in criticism and communicating with a bunch of different people with

62
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:36.970
a lot of different viewpoints is examine my own positions and try to figure out

63
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:41.560
am I coming at this from a truly balanced position or am I trying to support a

64
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:45.040
conclusion that I started out with and I'm trying to,
you know,

65
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.050
somehow or another backup my own work or back up my own,
my own statements and,

66
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.100
and,
and sort of prop them up instead of being really honest and objective.

67
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.840
It's very difficult to do.

68
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.960
I wrote a book called Tell Your children the truth about marijuana,

69
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:02.110
mental illness and violence.
I don't think you can,

70
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.440
you can think that that book is going to be a compendium of the pros and cons of

71
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:10.060
both.
If you want to tell your children the truth though,

72
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.200
you really do want to tell them the pros and cons,
right?
And you did indicate,

73
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:18.130
Alex,
you said,
you know,
we should tell people the truth in the book,
right?

74
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:21.250
So you know,
I think that when you're telling it and you're saying that,

75
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:22.630
that you're telling the truth,
and Alex,

76
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:26.120
I'm agreeing with you that you're telling part of the truth,
right?

77
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.930
But part of the truth is,
you know,

78
00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:31.810
a little bit deceiving and deceptive in some ways,
right?

79
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:34.570
You want to tell the whole truth when you tell the whole truth,

80
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.020
then you give the whole story and then people can actually make you know,

81
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.390
a good informed decision based upon that.

82
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.680
If people are going to just read one part of the story,

83
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.700
then of course they're going to make a decision just based upon that one part.

84
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.840
They're not going to make an informed decision based upon all of the parts.

85
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.190
And because of that,
people are going to make you know,
some very poor choices.

86
00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.380
I completely agree with that.
But to me,

87
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.040
the last 20 years have been an exercise in the other side,

88
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:05.650
in the legalization side,
doing a very,

89
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:09.130
very good job talking up its arguments.
And essentially there's,

90
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.600
there's almost nobody on the other side.

91
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:13.990
There's this one guy can't see what's going on.
Jeff sessions,

92
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.800
he had the fucking Goddamn attorney general telling people that good people

93
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:21.380
don't smoke marijuana.
And that's literally a quote that says,
yeah,

94
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.570
thank God that little more on,
it's not in an office anymore.
But that's,

95
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.420
that's a terrible thing to say.
People don't smoke marijuana.
I,

96
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.570
there's a lot of wonderful people who smoke marijuana.
That's just not true.

97
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.310
And by the way,
I think this is a personal choice.
Okay.
Especially for adults and,

98
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.270
and you can make bad personal choices.
You Go,
look,
I play cards.

99
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:43.030
I love to play poker.
I'm sad that on this trip to La,

100
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:44.380
I didn't get to go to a poker room.

101
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.620
But you can go into casino and you can see people who've lost change your flight

102
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.610
places close by him already.
He used to make a living doing that.

103
00:05:53.611 --> 00:05:57.950
When I'm struggling with comedy,
don't encourage me.
Um,
but,

104
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.920
but you can go to a casino and see people who've lost their houses.

105
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.200
It doesn't mean that gambling should be illegal.

106
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.780
It also means that there's less and more dangerous forms.

107
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.170
That device in your hand where you can bet on what the next pitch is going to
be.

108
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.180
If it's going to be a baller circle,

109
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.700
that's more dangerous than my having to drive to the commerce and play there.

110
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.030
And 100% or 98% THC that an 18 year old vapes is a lot more dangerous than a 5%,

111
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:24.290
you know,
CBD 15% THC product.

112
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:27.740
The doctor heart might suggest is patient uses once a night to go to sleep.

113
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.580
But that,
but that's the message that,
you know,
we should be putting out there,

114
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:35.810
right?
We shouldn't just be focusing on one side of the story.
Like that part,

115
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.210
you know,
should also be included in the book and like,
you know,
you're a book.
Um,

116
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.300
you know,
in some ways has made me rethink the way that I write.
You know,

117
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:48.080
because my first book was coauthor with Jeremy Costs and called friendly fire.

118
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.740
You know,
my second book that I'm writing now is called cannabis for PTG.

119
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.540
So is how to transform posttraumatic stress into posttraumatic growth,
right?

120
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.240
Because I feel that,
and you know,

121
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.880
we all know examples of people that have you encountered really difficult

122
00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:04.650
obstacles in their life and some people have,
you know,

123
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.540
succumb to that stress and they've gone down the wrong path kind of thing.

124
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:12.000
And then other people have used that stress to their advantage and they've

125
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.920
actually become better because of it.
And you know,
um,

126
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.010
CBD and Thc can both help facilitate that process.
You know,

127
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:24.590
when you're looking at someone like a veteran,
for example,

128
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.150
you're the hallmark of song with his PTSD is someone who doesn't leave their

129
00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:33.740
home and they can't sleep at night.
So like when I see that in my office,

130
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.010
a lot of the times they'll be leaving their home like five to 10 days a month,

131
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.200
right?
So when you give him CBD,

132
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:40.790
and this is really important for people to understand,

133
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.650
CBD has been shown to decrease learned fear.
That's incredible,

134
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.250
right?
So,
um,
if you can get people outside of their home,

135
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:52.550
because I'm not talking about,
again,
you know,
someone who's,
you know,

136
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.950
I'm too nervous to like go to,
uh,
uh,
you know,
uh,

137
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.160
the bar with like the friends and stuff like that.

138
00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.630
I'm talking to people who were like,
you know,

139
00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:01.250
it was difficult for them to go to the grocery store,

140
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:04.180
just like pick up a few things.
So,
you know,

141
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.130
those are the type of people that I see in my practice of CVD is really

142
00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:10.640
excellent for that.
Then when you look at,
you know,
the,
the nighttime component,

143
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.140
um,
you know,
THC,
again,
it's excellent for reducing nightmares.

144
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:19.130
That's been shown in studies and it was even shown with one pharmaceutical drug

145
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:19.820
nabilone.
Again,

146
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.820
I don't really use nabilone very much because it's only one cannabinoid and I do

147
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:28.910
believe in,
in,
in the entourage effect and using all of the cannabinoids.

148
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.740
So I don't use that that much,
but that shows that she,

149
00:08:31.741 --> 00:08:36.110
she came reduce nightmares and you know,
if you have,
you have,
if you have PTSD,

150
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.920
I mean if you talk to someone who has PTSD,
and again this is,

151
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.010
this comes from a clinician's point of view,
they will tell you,

152
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.780
I will try anything.
And that's the same way when you get with like,
you know,

153
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.040
um,
the parents of,
of,
of a,
of kids who have seizures all day,

154
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.190
nobody wants to see that you like and like,
and like Alex,
you know,
if your kids,

155
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.910
you know,
ever started getting,
getting seizures,
which,
you know,
I hope,

156
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.190
I hope they don't because it's,
it's terrible.
You know,
what,

157
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:06.510
what it can do to people.
But if that ever happened,
you know,

158
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:08.410
I would hope that you would consider,
you know,

159
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.560
CBD as a potential treatment option.
He's not against that.

160
00:09:12.561 --> 00:09:15.670
I think we have to be really clear as a distinction.
Like CBD,
you're not against.

161
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.700
You would be at all.
And I don't,
I don't think anybody is.

162
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:21.330
I think no one really is arguing except maybe the federal government in certain

163
00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:23.040
levels is arguing against CBD.

164
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.560
That's probably some pushback from the pharmaceutical industry.

165
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.480
The reality is CBD is proven to be,
at least as far as I've read,

166
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:34.230
very safe and very effective for a bunch of different disorders,

167
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:36.380
especially those that are about reducing.

168
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.150
And I have something to do with inflammation or seizures.
Yeah.

169
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:41.710
One of my good friends,
his son has,
uh,

170
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.260
developed seizures and CBD knocked it out,
just killed it,
killed it.

171
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.500
This is very recently,
you're somebody who's a,
you know,
who's a cannabis user.

172
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:53.320
You obviously know a lot of users.
Why do you think it is that people,
you know,

173
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.950
in legal states where they can really express a preference,

174
00:09:55.951 --> 00:09:58.080
they can go into a dispensary,
know exactly what they're buying.

175
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.700
Why is it that they want such high potency THC product?

176
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.920
Because they get used to it?
Um,
you,
your tolerance develops,
it builds up.

177
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.820
You know,
every year we do this thing called sober October.
Well,
we don't do any,

178
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:16.390
no drinking,
no,
no pot.
And we do do some sort of crazy challenge.
Uh,

179
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:21.090
me and three of my buddies and,
uh,
when we do it,
uh,
what,
what's,

180
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.150
it's very interesting how your tolerance is radically reduced.

181
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:28.410
Like I'll smoke pot at the end of that month and I'm like,
Holy Shit.

182
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.650
Like I don't even know what I'm talking about in the mid sentence and I'm just

183
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.180
blitzkrieg whereas,
you know,
now like,
uh,
I smoked a little weed last night,

184
00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:39.030
did some stand up,
had a great old time.
There was no,
no issues with it at all.

185
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.310
But I'm used to it.
And if the weed that I smoked last,
I,

186
00:10:42.311 --> 00:10:44.730
I assume you don't smoke.
I do not.
Okay.

187
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:47.670
If you and me were together last night and I gave you a hit of my joint,

188
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.750
you'd beat still there in the corner,
in the fetal position going,

189
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.750
what in the fuck is going on?
Because the marijuana is ridiculously powerful.

190
00:10:54.751 --> 00:10:57.210
But once you're accustomed to it,
once your body acclimates,

191
00:10:57.211 --> 00:11:00.710
it's really not that big of a deal.
The problem is,
uh,
you,

192
00:11:00.711 --> 00:11:05.250
you're dealing with a lot of habitual daily users.
And for those people,

193
00:11:05.251 --> 00:11:10.140
like my friend Joey Diaz,
there's a video of him giving this a other comedian,
uh,

194
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.020
w how many milligrams of those stars of death,

195
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:17.850
Tilly when we give Owen,
what did he give?
Oh,
I think just one.

196
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.130
He ruined his life would have been about 200 to 250,

197
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.110
two 50 door and went out.
The Joey made a video,

198
00:11:25.111 --> 00:11:29.820
but the day changed Owen's life.
Like literally fucked the guy's head up.

199
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.610
Like he went outside and he vanished and he's gone.

200
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:39.450
That's cannabis.
Like,
oh,
well I think,
I think there's a real argument to be made.

201
00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:43.500
It's particularly with him.
It was going to make two points on that.

202
00:11:43.501 --> 00:11:48.501
So you definitely came develop a tolerance and I tell people all the time,

203
00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:53.290
try and take at least one,
three week break.
Um,
but the evidence does show that,

204
00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.720
uh,
if you stop for four weeks,

205
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.830
generally all your receptors return and it'll be like you've never used cannabis

206
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:04.420
before.
She saw it.
And that's even with people who are really,

207
00:12:04.421 --> 00:12:08.230
really heavy users,
I can go back and get the study.
Um,

208
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.760
but I mean these people are you using,

209
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:12.460
I'm pretty sure it was like close like seven joints a day.
Well,

210
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.400
really heavy users and snoop Dogg's a good example of that.

211
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.730
And my friend Tony Hinchcliffe was good buddies with snoop Dogg and he said

212
00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:23.050
snoop dog just smokes all day.
And he'd just like,

213
00:12:23.051 --> 00:12:25.260
he's always high and you know,
they're like,

214
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.390
well what do you do when you're not high?
He's like,
what?
He's like,

215
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:33.300
I'm never not high.
So everything he does,
he has high as fuck everything he does.

216
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:37.030
Like for that guy,
it's not that big of a deal.
And for the way he lives his life,

217
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.600
like he's just a relaxed,
easy going guy.
It's no problem.

218
00:12:40.601 --> 00:12:44.410
You can be high all day and live his life and he's obviously wildly successful

219
00:12:44.411 --> 00:12:46.640
with this strategy.
Yeah,
wildly successful.

220
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:50.650
And the second point I was gonna I was gonna make on that too though,

221
00:12:50.651 --> 00:12:55.651
was there does not appear to be any tolerance at the CB two receptor.

222
00:12:56.081 --> 00:12:58.840
So cheesy attaches to the CB one receptor.
And that's,

223
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.140
and that's where we know we can get tolerance.
You know,
some people,
you know,

224
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.590
they have some pain that use some cheap cheapsy and sometimes they need a little

225
00:13:05.591 --> 00:13:08.340
bit more,
sometimes asleep,
you know,
the youth QC,

226
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.370
it'll work and then we'll stop working with CBD to,
we haven't seen that.

227
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.250
Meaning like the people who,
uh,
you know,
get,

228
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:19.240
get seizure control generally they don't need to increase the dose.

229
00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:22.800
Like the girl I was talking about earlier,
um,
you know,
at first described,

230
00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:26.160
I think when she was 20,
when she was buying him 20,
she's 25 now.
Um,

231
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.270
she's never increased her dose.
I mean,

232
00:13:28.271 --> 00:13:32.180
she's just used the same amount to CBD for the last five years.
Medicine.
Right.

233
00:13:32.181 --> 00:13:37.000
Like it works for you.
I think we should really stop talking about CBD.

234
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:41.860
I just didn't want to make a note on the,
uh,
on the tolerance of the CPU on,

235
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:45.070
I just wanted to make a note that CB two there doesn't appear to be tolerance.

236
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:49.760
And so it's just,
there's just such a significant impact,
um,
when it,

237
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:54.370
when it comes to especially edible THC,
uh,
it's a,

238
00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.750
there's a significant impact on people's state of mind.
And it's not always good.

239
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.280
It's just a fact.
