1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.600
Have you been
a lot of break up here?

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.680
That guy's been calling you out.
Have you talked about it?

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.920
How's Jones know that fighter?
Which one?
Oh,
Colby.

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.060
Colby is funny man.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.050
Cobras and I know Colby and I also know very well.

6
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:22.570
One of Colby is really good friends.
Is My friend,
uh,
Cam Hanes.

7
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.720
They're live in the same town.
Why is this fucking with you?
Because he's,

8
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.750
it's good.
It's good.
It's good.
You're really got to choose to be heal or hero.

9
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:34.860
And I would always go,
he'll,
he's all healed.
Oh,
it's so much more fun.
Go.
He'll,

10
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.791
you know what's really hilarious?

11
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:40.791
Chels son mad that I talked about what he does that I know that I talked about

12
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:44.010
with Colby does.
I go,
he's having fun.
I go,

13
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:48.390
he's playing up the role of the villain and he's selling papers cause you're the

14
00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:51.830
fourth wall to the business.
It's so ridiculous.
Meanwhile,

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.660
he's given up the secrets of the business by talking about me giving up the

16
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:57.360
secrets of the business.
It's the dumbest shit of all time.

17
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.950
I can't tell if it's a work.
I can't tell if what he's doing he's doing,

18
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.360
if he's fake upset.

19
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.070
There was a point where Cheo was the best trash talker in sports.
Yeah,
no,

20
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:09.870
he was phenomenal.
He still is.

21
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.800
But the idea that you bring up the trash to the octagon,

22
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.250
it's thunder.
When Anderson Silva walks in,

23
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:20.040
it sounds like a mouse pissing on cotton.

24
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.570
It's like what the fuck?
I've never lost a fight in my life.

25
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.710
I've never lost a route of,

26
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:32.670
I've never lost one second of one fight in my love life and that.
Then he's like,

27
00:01:32.671 --> 00:01:34.680
what about here where you're going to fucking stop.
Didn't matter.

28
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:36.690
He just kept going.
I loved it.
It was beautiful.

29
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.040
He's a smart guy but he's also getting us to talk about it and getting us to

30
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:41.671
talk about his show,

31
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:43.350
which I'll give him a plug right now cause I'm sure it's great.

32
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:48.351
He's an Ariel Helwani and chill son and have a new show called aerial and the

33
00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:53.040
bad guy and you got to get that ESPN.
Shayle Kann,
he's the bad guy.

34
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:53.874
He's great at it.

35
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.600
He's great at us and he ranted and raved about us for like 10 minutes.

36
00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:00.840
And then he and then brandy responded it and he came back with another 20

37
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:04.740
minutes.
You don't ever talk about the business,
first of all have to,

38
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.770
because my job is to call what I see.
My job is not I,

39
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.780
even when I'm promoting things,
if I'm promoting things,
I'm calling what I see.

40
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.670
If I say Francis and Ghana was the most terrifying heavyweight contender ever,

41
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.770
I say that because that's what I see.

42
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.970
I see him put Alistair Overeem into fucking orbits side of it.

43
00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:25.320
So you're just talking about the fighting part.

44
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.100
That's what you're experts that I talk about.
Whatever I want to talk about.

45
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.570
Listen,
here's the deal chain.

46
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.060
You stick to fighting a promoting and let intelligence,
uh,

47
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.110
leave that here too intelligent people.
You're out of your class.

48
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.470
Fucking deal with it.
Whoa,
uneducated.

49
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.220
You're a high school dropout and you know it.

50
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.820
You're going to trash talk and that's it.
I don't think he's home with your wife.

51
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.640
I think he graduated from college.
No,
he didn't.

52
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.030
He fucking dropped out of high school early,
like sophomore year.
No.

53
00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:55.170
That guy's dumb,
bro.
Chill.
Son is gone.
Are you sure?
Yeah.

54
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.800
Have you ever talked to him?
Yes.
You told me two points above retarded.
Oh,

55
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:02.740
that's fat.
What are the points?

56
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.050
What points do you get when you got a real issue,

57
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.660
but we'll keep your mind just go.
The line that they have medically is like,

58
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:10.840
if you are barely retarded,
you're still not really retarded,

59
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:13.140
but I should be more politically correct with our use of that word,

60
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.830
mentally retarded
tab,
trans and trans start all.

61
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:19.820
You can't say that.
You can't say that it's illegal.

62
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.630
It's like depending on who's president,

63
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:25.930
you'll get arrested for that to come in for you.
I like chill.

64
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.943
I like what he does.

65
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.920
I have to talk about the fact that someone's talking shit to build up,

66
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.900
but it doesn't stop someone from talking shit.

67
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.290
It also makes it more fun to watch.
I know what the fuck it is and I like it.

68
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.950
People are going to like it.
It makes it more interesting.
It makes it look.
