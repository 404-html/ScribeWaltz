1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.050
The joe rogan experience.
What so what do you think about?

2
00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:07.830
The Washington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos,
the richest guy in the world handy.

3
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:08.460
Fascinating.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.840
And he sits on a Pentagon board and he has a $600 million deal with the CIA and

5
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:16.840
he runs the paper of $600 million deal with the CIA.
Yeah.

6
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.380
Which is like something home twice as well.

7
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.710
Amazon Alexis doing so he's on Alexis just gathering up information on

8
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:27.270
everything you do.
Yes,
it is shit out of me.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it's not good.

9
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:29.640
Jamie and I were just talking about that new apple home thing,

10
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:31.260
which has the most amazing microphones.

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.590
Jamie was saying that while the music is blaring,
you could say,
Hey Siri,

12
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.570
just real quiet.
Hey Siri,
which suck my Dick.
Seriously.
I can't do that sir.

13
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.870
Details about the CIA's deal with Amazon $600 million computing cloud built by

14
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:49.770
an outside company is a radical departure from the risk averse intelligence

15
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:53.730
community.
Now they're in bed with the Washington Post or a Jeff Bezos.

16
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.690
Now he also sits on a Pentagon board.
He's got so much money.

17
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.030
He's fascinating to me because like what?

18
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.120
How do you keep going when you have 105 billion?

19
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:06.190
Like what's getting up in the morning?
So he's a megalomaniac,
right?

20
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.650
How do you accumulate more wealth than any person in the history of the world?

21
00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:14.070
That means kings,
Queens.
That's not necessarily true.

22
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.660
The reason why is we don't count the same kind of money that the oligarchs have.

23
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.000
Like especially people that,
first of all,

24
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:24.180
people have said that it's very possible that Putin is the richest man alive

25
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.050
because they,

26
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.350
they're not counting how much money Putin has stolen from all the various

27
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:31.710
companies,
that he's just sort of absorbed and that he owns all that stuff.

28
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.950
But also we don't count all these kings and these princes in the Middle East,

29
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.040
they're,
they're not publicly,
they're not public people.
So,

30
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.970
so let's say if all the people we can count,
he's the richest guy,

31
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.420
a billionaire friend of mine who's a legitimate billionaire,

32
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.590
told me that it's entirely possible that some of these guys are trillionaires

33
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.430
some of these Middle Eastern guys.
He's like,
you've never seen wealth.
Life is.

34
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.760
It's insane in,
do you know in the United Arab Emirates,

35
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.530
they make it rain every week.
Once a week.
They make it rain.
I mean,

36
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.200
they see the clouds really get rain.
Yeah,

37
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:09.420
because they're in the desert and they're like,
Eh,
I don't like this.

38
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.530
Or like a terrain.

39
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.920
So they fucking put all that shit that they have to put into the sky to make it

40
00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:17.550
rain,
which they've been doing forever.
Cloud seeding,
but insanely expensive.

41
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:22.500
But they do it once a week.
So 52 times a year at rains there.
So what do you see?

42
00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:26.880
You see a problem with the richest guy in the world owning the political paper

43
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:31.470
of note and being in bed with the CIA and he's on a Pentagon board.
Yeah,
no,

44
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:34.500
it's all spooky.
It's like some kind of Orwellian fucking nightmare.

45
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.710
Then we've got so much money and you can't criticize him in the paper.

46
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.940
They won't let their,
you know,

47
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:41.180
the people who write for that paper aren't going to fucking great session,

48
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.050
post duck can't write anything bad about it.
They're not going to write the,

49
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.420
wouldn't imagine they would even dare.

50
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.260
One guy wrote something bad about Amazon and the Huffington Post,

51
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:52.410
he got disciplined.
There was a guy who was a writer for the Washington Post,

52
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.610
wrote something in the Huffington Post that was critical of the Amazon and he

53
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:58.950
got disciplined at the Washington Post for doing that.

54
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.580
So that's the world we live in.
And then we have the government.

55
00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:04.960
And if you ever tried to tell her about a crime inside the government,

56
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:07.810
then the government would use the espionage act to correct on you.
So we're,

57
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:09.730
again,
we're living in oligarchic Joe,
we are,

58
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.920
democracy has already been taken from us.

59
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.540
So you know that this isn't a democracy.
They've done studies.
This is provable.

60
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.070
The thing about the,
from the Huffington post to derail this,
but was it valid?

61
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.430
Was it,
yeah,
the self criticism,
was it about,

62
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.350
he criticized about how Jeff Basil's treats his workers.
Oh,
okay.

63
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.040
That has been an open area of discussion that they,

64
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.310
I've talked to someone who actually worked there and they were saying that they

65
00:03:34.311 --> 00:03:36.890
get like a countdown.
So say an order comes in,

66
00:03:36.891 --> 00:03:40.410
they literally have like a countdown on their tablet and the countdown says,

67
00:03:40.411 --> 00:03:42.320
you know,
like,
I don't know what the net amount of time is,

68
00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:45.530
but you have to run and find that fucking product and get it in the box and get

69
00:03:45.531 --> 00:03:48.290
it shipped out inside a very small window of time.
He goes,

70
00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:52.400
so I'm literally running.
I go,
you run?
He goes,
yeah,

71
00:03:52.401 --> 00:03:56.120
you literally run because if you don't meet your countdown,
he goes,

72
00:03:56.121 --> 00:03:58.700
you can only get away with that for a certain amount of times.

73
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.800
Then you get in real trouble.
So they also have these new things,

74
00:04:01.801 --> 00:04:04.970
the risks to bands that they've just developed a shock.
You like a shock,

75
00:04:04.971 --> 00:04:08.260
you know where you serious?
Yeah,
I was joking.
They vibe,

76
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.890
they just fucking shot.
He'll pull it up.
They,
but they'll vibrate and if you're,

77
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.100
if you're,
if you're moving the wrong way,
it will shock you back.

78
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.630
It'll shock you back to the right.

79
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.830
It hurt or is it like if you ever been to her new Cadillac?
Yeah.

80
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.500
Either new Cadillacs,
if you,
if you go too close to the side,

81
00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:29.180
it gives you an example of subs,
gives you like a little feeling Amazon pet,

82
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.350
which bands designed to track and tracking steer employees movements.

83
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.190
So Jeff Bezos,
it's been reported it,
which is true,
is that he would,
uh,

84
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.290
rather it's not running run.
Well,
you my shit that day.

85
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.400
So now there's plenty,
there's,
there's a couple different fixes for this.

86
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.320
The problem of this robots,
uh,
one of them would be a unions,

87
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.330
right?
So I'm like,
my whole thing is,
you know,
why can't we unionize Amazon?

88
00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:59.670
Why can't we use a Nice Walmart?
I know they make it hard.

89
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:01.450
Walmart literally shut down their meat.

90
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:05.760
Meatpacking in Texas because of the meatpacking group.
They unionized in Texas.

91
00:05:05.761 --> 00:05:07.830
They fuck it.
We're not going to sell meat anymore in Texas.

92
00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:09.990
That's how we'll fuck over the union.
So,

93
00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:12.510
but we got to figure out a way to get unions.
And there was another thing,

94
00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:14.850
you know,
Teddy Roosevelt was a trust buster,

95
00:05:14.851 --> 00:05:17.100
which was that he was a monopoly buster.
You know,

96
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.960
50% of all online purchases go through amazon.com in the United States,
50% yeah.

97
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.920
You know,
51% of households in America have Amazon prime.

98
00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:27.810
Only 49% have a landline.

99
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.300
So more people have Amazon prime in the United States then have a fucking land

100
00:05:31.301 --> 00:05:34.020
line.
So why is that real?

101
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.070
So Ted,
Teddy Roosevelt would come along and go,

102
00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:41.570
we've got to break this company up.
Wow.
He would say,
this is aunt.
But first,

103
00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:44.460
first of all,
Jeff Bezos,
because he owns the paper,

104
00:05:44.461 --> 00:05:45.990
he got the Trump was right when he said he,

105
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.070
he's there to get the tax in his favor because he was able to go around and

106
00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:51.270
hollow out economies,

107
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.480
a main street in little small towns all around because he didn't have to pay

108
00:05:54.481 --> 00:05:57.440
taxes,
income tax,
and for Amazon.

109
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.910
And so the brick and mortar places did,
he closed them down by undercutting them.

110
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.910
Right?
Because he,
and now he's opening up brick and mortar stores,

111
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.280
he closed out all the Barnes and nobles and the borders books,

112
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.770
and now he's opening up Amazon bookstores.
Did you know that?

113
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.960
So 64 [inaudible] 64 there you go.

114
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:17.690
I would see 40 even up higher than,
than from when I looked.

115
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:21.500
I have Amazon prime now.
How many of those people use it for television?

116
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.640
This is my question because I know that Amazon started to make apparently some

117
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:29.330
very good shows,
but I don't hear anybody talking about watching them.

118
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>
