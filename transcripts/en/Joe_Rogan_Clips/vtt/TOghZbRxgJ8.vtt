WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.910
I mean I do the previews right.
We'll do the prelims.

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.650
Uh,
well I want to have that single cause.
Well I guess they're just,

3
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:10.710
the contract comes over like does everyone like the UFC tonight crew.

4
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:14.250
Everyone's like,
just check this over.
You have seen,
I was never working for Fox.

5
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:17.500
I didn't do the fire.
It was one of my one of these days.
Yeah.

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.790
But one of the stipulations of my newer contract decided don't want to do the

7
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:24.300
Fox events anymore and that deal through when you don't have to be done.

8
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.670
It's already done.
I mean it was a bit like this year.

9
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:28.140
I don't do any of the Fox events.

10
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:31.140
If you notice like when there are big fights on,
I know you don't do that.

11
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:35.130
Don't do any of them done the big ones?
Nope.
None of them.
Zero Justice paper.

12
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:37.800
If he's still doing it right.
Don't want to do anymore.
Too much work.

13
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.250
Too much work did this suit is not a big deal because they have the suit there

14
00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:46.950
for me.
But the,
my issue was a fox actually paid me less money,

15
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.180
less money to do the fence on Fox.
I was like,
you guys are never paying you.
Yeah,

16
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:56.100
I thought the UFC Pagan,
no,
I get to Fox event.
It's a Fox event.
So,
um,

17
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.260
that,
but it was also,

18
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.260
I didn't like when I first started doing it for them,

19
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.800
they got in my ear like the very first events for Fox.

20
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.540
They were like telling me what to do.

21
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.330
They were like telling me to take it down a notch,

22
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:13.830
don't be so amped up about that.
Yay.
And I was like,
what?
What are we doing here?

23
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.520
I go,
listen,
I do commentary.
This is what I do.
I've been doing it forever.

24
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.610
This is how I do it.
If you think you can change me,

25
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.910
then we're not going to work together.
I'm like,
what a real problem.

26
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.720
And that was a fox deduction,
right Joe?
Yes.
It was a fox productions junior.

27
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:31.740
Dos Santos came the last case upon.
Yeah,

28
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.610
I believe that was the first one.
Yeah,
but it's just,
I just didn't,

29
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.650
I didn't like it.
They want a sports guy like,
look,
MMA is what it is.

30
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.730
It's,
it's fighting.

31
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.410
It is a very specific kind of sport and I've been doing it the way I do it

32
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:49.080
forever.
If you don't like the way I do it,
that's fine.
Don't hire me,

33
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.440
but don't try to get me to become some sports guy.

34
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:55.530
I'm not interested in that at all.
When I commentated for pride,
they told me,

35
00:01:55.531 --> 00:02:00.300
I said,
Nice.
Too much.
No,
say Nice.
He was like,
no,

36
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.430
I couldn't even speak English.
I think Nice Shot,

37
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.770
Nice Jab.
To their credit,
they stopped.

38
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:11.880
They stopped doing it after the first event.
When I voiced my displeasure,

39
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.510
I just let them know like really clearly we're not going to do in this.

40
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.620
I'm not going to change how I do it to make you do this if I'm helping you.

41
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.220
It's not even that.
It's just like,
if you don't like the way I do it,

42
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.200
this is not an option for you to direct me and tell me to do it the way you like

43
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:32.880
it because you think that that's better.
This is a personal choice by one or two,

44
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:35.700
whoever the fuck the people were that were producers or executives,

45
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.060
I don't agree with them and I'm not doing it that way.
Like this is just how it,

46
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.850
it's like real simple.

47
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:45.720
Like if you bought a Ferrari and it had a certain sound to it,
you're like,
man,

48
00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:46.830
I don't like this sound.

49
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.430
Can you guys go back to the factory and fix these mufflers?
They'd be like,

50
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.900
what do you,
hi,
this is what a Ferrari is like.
This is you don't like it.

51
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:57.000
Then you're like Ferrari's,
no,
no,
no.
I like a for ride,

52
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:00.340
but I want it to sound like a Corola doesn't work.
They'd be like,
no.

53
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.530
Now you probably a bad analogy,
but the idea behind it,
you get,
I'm not,

54
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.690
this is what I do.
Like,
I get amped up if some shit is going down,

55
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.900
these guys were throwing blows and I'm screaming.
It's because I feel that way.

56
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:17.140
Some would call it passion.
Yeah.
It's bullets.
Legitimate Passion.
I'm not,

57
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.280
I'm not faking it,
but they didn't want that.
But they let it go after awhile.

58
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.820
But it's not like they fought for me when I quit either.

59
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.100
How long has the Reebok deal for?
Uh,
three years.

60
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.910
I think three years.
Two and three.
I wonder if it worked out for Reebok,

61
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:37.900
like his Reebok.
Reebok exploding now because of this.
Well,

62
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:42.010
Adidas owns Reebok to Adidas is killing it,
but I dunno.
Free box exploding.
They,

63
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.400
they're the niche,
right?
The MMA,
the therein with crossfit.

64
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.670
So they're in that world and to Reebok's defense,
you know,
they,

65
00:03:49.671 --> 00:03:53.140
they made the offer.
They don't know.
They didn't know what the deal was.

66
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:56.140
They know they're screwing over fighters.
It's more of a UFC thing.

67
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.680
It was not Reebok Reebok,
it's like,
Whoa,
what the fuck?

68
00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:03.370
It seemed like even the UFC wasn't aware of how much fight is we're actually

69
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:05.230
making off of sponsorships.
