1
00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.400
Cause you hear people like give a bear charges,

2
00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:05.850
male climb a tree and the black bay climbs a tree.

3
00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:09.690
Like I mean fucking high do you have seen it?

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.020
And then there's the minimum black bear and she's got cubs and she goes so fast

5
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:20.320
up that dude holy,
he can't climb up a tree to get away from a bear.
Yeah,

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.880
get the fuck.
Yeah he had done the big ones just don't want to do it anymore.

7
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.870
But they get still,
I can still do it.
Still do it.

8
00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:29.190
Like the idea is I go to the big ones won't chase you up a tree.

9
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.400
When you see the speed that they go up a tree,

10
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.390
then you can imagine the speed that they come across land.
You know?

11
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:38.340
And it's just like,
oh cause I always say,

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.250
I always tell people about that one that was sleeping on an elk kill,

13
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:45.390
that I had a grizzly.
We showed that video the other day.
Did Ya?
Yeah,

14
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:49.530
we showed it on the podcast and I remember I yelled at that Grizzly,

15
00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:54.120
the one that was sleep on the elk carcass and it fucking disappeared so fast.

16
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.250
And quietly,
dude.
And I'm like,
if you don't have eyes on one coming at you,

17
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.420
don't know it's going to come at you until you hit,

18
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:04.440
until it's on your fucking eat in your face.
They're pads are so soft,

19
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.100
the pads of the feet are so soft in order to sneak up on things.

20
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.510
I remember the first time I went bear hunting with Cam and one was walking in.

21
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:14.970
He goes right there.
Right there.
Right there.
I turned to look.

22
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:19.950
I'm like some noise.
He's like this.
So this is that video.

23
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:24.780
Yeah,
here it is.
Rude gallon up or run and dude galloping up the true running.

24
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.730
Yeah.
And then fucking scary sheet.
It doesn't stop there.
He ended up coming.

25
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.820
Hang on.
That's a black bear with carbs.

26
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.660
So you can imagine that situation with the grizzly and her cubs.

27
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.670
So fucking scary.
And so that's a color phase.
And we'll target California.

28
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.960
One on the top is the black bear cub.
No,
that's a,

29
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.160
I looked like a full grown black bear of caliphates has got a carb back up the

30
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:53.940
mountain with her.
Yeah,

31
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:56.280
that's some crazy shit.
Fucking boy.

32
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.750
Boy Crocodiles don't fucking climbed trees.
That's what I heard.

33
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.070
I heard they're dumb.
When are we doing this?
Someone started the petition.

34
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:07.860
I fucking,
Joe Rogan needs the hunter Australia.
Yeah.

35
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.290
You keep trying to get me out there.
You've got snakes too though,
bro.

36
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:14.100
You get sponsors.
Okay,
let's fucking,
let's go over some shitty.

37
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.230
The whole season in Australia,
the whole season in Australia,
I seen two snakes.

38
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.740
One of them not poisonous like a red belly.
Black steak.

39
00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:25.010
Not going to harm your friendly snake lava.

40
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.630
One a barely poisonous snake of a heresy.

41
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.930
Not Very poisoned.
It might kill a kid or a dog fighters.
You guys have though,

42
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.340
the audience know this is a giant
thank you.

43
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.560
Talk to him.
Fucking stay out of it came.

44
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.380
One thing I wanted to ask you about is the thylacine the Tasmanian Tiger.

45
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.770
Yeah.

46
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.770
I read that there was credible reports by people in the woods that they might

47
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:56.160
have seen.
One.
I wish.
I don't think so,

48
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.100
but it's so remote.
There's so many cameras.

49
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.700
There's guys are scouting cameras that have putting it over da Lowe's and stuff

50
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.050
like places that I would come in the drink.
It was a big animal,
right?
Wasn't it?

51
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.090
Yeah.
Big.
Did they get like a hundred pounds?

52
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:12.310
I'm like something like that might be a bit bigger than that.

53
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.920
What a cool looking at him,
dude.
And I may always come up and like this,

54
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.050
it is scientists hunt for extinct Tasmanian Tiger after sightings in Australia.

55
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:24.340
Yeah,
that's probably what I saw.
I wish the,

56
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.710
what does that air article from what year?
Scroll up.
Oh really?
Interesting.

57
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.450
I love the extinction was driven from paypal,
right?

58
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.770
Sort of like,
cause they fucking meat eater.

59
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.500
So they'd come in and start eating cheap or whatever.

60
00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:41.170
They get shot by farmers and stuff like that,
which is a shame.

61
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:44.730
And I'm sure they didn't realize how doing it at the time,
but that,
you know,

62
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.300
I pushed him to extinction.
You know,

63
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.230
if there's one thing that we should bring back from extinction,
if we,

64
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.960
if it's possible,
I believe they should be brought back if it's possible.
Right.

65
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.070
If they have some DNA because uh,
I mean,
no.
Do I believe,

66
00:03:57.071 --> 00:04:01.420
be nice to have some sort of an animal like that that could knock down some of

67
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:05.440
the populations go rules and they probably,
I probably wouldn't.

68
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:08.120
I probably just come in and devastate,
look lives.
Don't stop.

69
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.590
People thought it was a shiny,
yeah.

70
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.740
But let me get back to why you need to come to snakes all year in Australia.

71
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.610
Fucking 17 snakes in the first month in America.
Dude,

72
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.130
17 Schneider got bit the other day.
Did he really?
Yeah,

73
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:30.430
I think he was in North Carolina or some shit.
I forget where it was.

74
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:33.100
Somewhere in the south and my buddy Joe's.
Wait,

75
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.950
so this is the first hunt that I did when I come to America.

76
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:38.730
We flew in the Idaho and we drove straight down to southern Colorado,

77
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.610
the hunt prong on,

78
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.050
and we're driving into the property at like 2:00 AM in the morning and there's a

79
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:46.960
problem hall and just standing on the side of the road,
you know,

80
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:50.800
and it's just like a daze,
you know?
So my buddy James pulls up,

81
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:54.970
he walks over to it and like literally touches it on the head.
Like it's like,

82
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:57.480
it's just like walking down the road and we're like,

83
00:04:57.481 --> 00:05:00.850
did it get hit by a car next minute?
I seen him jump back.

84
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.860
A rattlesnake had bit the pronghorn and he stood,

85
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:08.740
he had a leg on ava side of the rattlesnake and it striked him.

86
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.960
It actually strived in twice at miss both times.

87
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.880
I know I had the cake question and I'm like,
did that bite you?
And he's like,
not,

88
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.240
I'm like having to think about it.
Did a fucking bite you?
And he's like,
no,

89
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:24.010
I didn't cause I watched it in the headlights go for him twice.
And uh,

90
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.890
once we set up camp and went back there and that problem home was decorated,

91
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.150
killed that problem.
Wow.
Yeah.
And I'm like,
Fuck America,

92
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.800
Fuck America,
this dryer is so much safer.

93
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.900
A friend of mine was a hiking and he almost stepped on a rattlesnake and he

94
00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:45.280
jumped back and then realized it was a nest of them Holland.

95
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.610
It was a new one surrounding him.
There were all over the place.
He was like,

96
00:05:48.611 --> 00:05:52.360
fuck yeah.
Jumping,
hopping around on one leg after.
Nothing crazy.

97
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.860
I actually had,
um,
as a,
but apparently that happens all the time.
Yeah,
it does.

98
00:05:56.861 --> 00:05:59.120
Yeah.
And trenchless there,
dude.

99
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.410
Everywhere those Tris is walking over the ground.
Everywhere else it,
that's cool.

100
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.860
A bold,
the bold effort to prove the Tasmanian tiger is still out there.

101
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:07.820
Wildlife Biologists,

102
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:12.560
forest gallente has brought one species back from the dead and he wants to do

103
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:14.000
the same with the Tasmanian Tiger.

104
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:15.830
What the fuck is he brought back from the dead?

105
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:20.831
This god Damn Frankenstein on the able to plate the Cuban saw Leno.

106
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:27.470
Dawn is one of the most curious animals and plants.
Small,
shrewd,
shrewd.

107
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.700
I must be shrew.
Like creature memo is a mammal,
but a highly venomous one.

108
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:34.250
Funny you bring that back in.

109
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.310
The marriage specimen found that was thought to be lost forever.

110
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.630
Then unexpectedly three Rakat just a few years later.
The extinct species mark.

111
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:45.920
Dot.
So that may be the case with the Tasmanian Tiger.

112
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.710
Hmm.
It'd be awesome.
I hope so.
Okay.
So here it is.
Uh,

113
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.790
Galantes a wildlife biologist made his life mission to search for animals that

114
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:54.290
have wrongly been deemed extinct.

115
00:06:54.291 --> 00:06:59.100
And among those species on his list at the Tasmanian Tiger,
uh,
Dah,

116
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.420
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
difficulty leads to,
and he's like,

117
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:04.190
who the fuck has seen once keeps crowing?

118
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.150
See if anybody like legit scene when he's been traveling around the world

119
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:13.151
searching for evidence of species like the Tasmanian Devil Paki Lemoore and the

120
00:07:14.161 --> 00:07:17.810
new found land Whitewolf still exist.
100 species deemed extincts worldwide,

121
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.160
annual annually.
This process isn't foolproof in every now and then.

122
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.610
Animals are rediscovered after they were thought to be gone forever.

123
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:29.360
But proving the animals still out there is no easy feat.
Hmm.
I wonder,

124
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:31.763
<v 1>Huh?</v>

125
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.330
<v 0>I'm sorry.
Yeah.</v>

126
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.500
Captured footage of a Zanzibar leopard,

127
00:07:38.501 --> 00:07:43.270
which is thought to be extinct for 25 years due to persecution by local hunters

128
00:07:43.271 --> 00:07:47.140
in the Zanzibar archipelago and Tasmania,

129
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:48.880
Tanzania rather.
Excuse me.

130
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.323
<v 1>Wow.</v>

131
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.310
<v 0>That would be plucking pretty dope if they actually did find that thing.</v>

132
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.080
It's a cool looking animal,
you know.
