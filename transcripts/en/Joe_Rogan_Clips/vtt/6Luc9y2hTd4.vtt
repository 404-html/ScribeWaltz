WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.210
Yes,
we're live.
Tommy bonds us do it,
dude.
Did you,

2
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.110
um,
did you go to the comedy store at all yesterday?
Yesterday?
No.

3
00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:16.530
Going the night is heavy.
It wasn't heavy.
Yes.
Here.
Yeah.

4
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.200
I imagine it would be heavy.
The day after Mitzi died,
the clothes,

5
00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:23.840
the comedy store down on Wednesday and yesterday was the first day it was open.

6
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.680
It was heavy.
I imagine that's the first time it's been closing alone.

7
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.080
Like they never closed.
I can't remember the last time it was closed.

8
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.130
It was heavy.
You could just feel it in the air.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

9
00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:37.470
I felt it was everybody talking about it,
but it was bombing to really

10
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.210
not on my show wasn't too bad when the Olr man,
uh,
it was thick.

11
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.560
Boy is in the air,
you know,
that's real sadness.
Oh yeah.
Pauline,

12
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.520
I've never seen Paul.
He cry.
He was there.
Yeah.
Paul,
he was crying in the onstage.

13
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.230
No,
he didn't go on stage.
She's not going to go on stage for a while.

14
00:00:57.231 --> 00:00:59.780
I wouldn't have gone on stage if I wasn't getting ready for the special.

15
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.690
I would have definitely taken the night off.
Yeah.
If I could have,
you know,

16
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:07.400
if I wasn't earning for tweet,
people aren't,
are going to see it.
It just felt,

17
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.040
I didn't feel silly.
You know what I mean?
I like to feel silly.
I feel loose,

18
00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:17.330
loose in a good mood,
happy.
Everybody felt vulnerable.
Everybody felt,

19
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.160
you know,
I mean,

20
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.200
out of all the people in the world that are not comedians,

21
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.930
she is under the number one most important figure in all of comedy.

22
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.420
Wasn't a comedian.
And then even when you say the ones that were comedians,

23
00:01:35.421 --> 00:01:39.260
damn,
she's in the running for number one.
Even with the Comedians,

24
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.540
I know she's shaped so many,
you know,
she built that whole,

25
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.190
that place and,
and,
and she,
she,
you know,
they call her godmother,

26
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.910
but it really was like that because she advised so many people,

27
00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:54.940
and actually here's the thing,
a lot of people have advice for you,

28
00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.160
but yeah,
she was giving good advice to people.
I mean,
look how many people hire,

29
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.110
hold her in that regard.
Yeah.
You know,
legendary people are like,
she's it man.

30
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.780
Universally.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's no one going Mitzi shore and shit.
No.

31
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.990
Nobody says that she didn't pass you.
Yeah,
like me.

32
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.610
I met her once and she was like,
no thanks.
What year was this?

33
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.990
2006 or seven.
Oh yeah,
I remember.
Well,
here's the thing,

34
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.110
when I met her,
she was,
um,
she was already like,

35
00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:28.510
it was at the end of when she would be at the store.
She was,

36
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.400
she was not 100% doing well.
No,
she was rough around then when you would see her,

37
00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:36.600
she would be shaking.
It would be very hard.
Yeah.
I just,

38
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.600
you know,
when someone's gone,

39
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:42.960
you stop and think about those times when you were around them and just like,

40
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:46.620
I wish I took it in and realize more that she wasn't,

41
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.820
she wasn't going to be there one day,
you know?

42
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.320
Did you guys have a good relationship?
Yeah,
we did.
I mean,

43
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:54.810
up until the seven years that I wasn't there and even then,

44
00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:56.010
it was never her fault.

45
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.190
I called her the day that whole Mitzia thing broke out.

46
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.370
Like I called her up and told her everything.
I told her.

47
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.070
The guy's been stealing material and the whole deal,
and they'll,

48
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:10.180
every comedian feels so uncomfortable working around them that they flashed the

49
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:12.760
light whenever he's in the room so that no one does their material.

50
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:16.150
And you just start working the crowd.
I go,
it's a fucking war zone there.

51
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:20.470
It's terrible.
And her exact words.
Well,
wow.

52
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:25.190
Jazz Day away from mom.
What time you want to go up tonight knows it.

53
00:03:25.191 --> 00:03:29.410
Yeah.
And I,
I said,
and whenever you want to put me up,
she gave me a spot.

54
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.690
And then the comedy store called me an hour,

55
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.350
two hours later or whatever it was and said,
I was band.
And I said,
I go,

56
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:38.470
what the fuck are you talking about?
I just got off the phone with Mitzi.

57
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.320
She gave me a 10 o'clock spot.
They're like,
well,

58
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:45.040
Muchi wasn't aware of everything that was happening.
I got the fuck she wasn't,

59
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.420
I told her,
I told her everything.
I go,
who's running the store?
No.
Uh,
you,

60
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.790
you run in this door.
The Fuck Outta here.

61
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:56.350
I'm not working for you and you guys are going to ban me because I outdid a joke

62
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:58.930
thief like this is you guys sell art.

63
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.760
You've got a thief of art that's in your midst.
Yeah,
you did.
You understand that.

64
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:04.870
What a big deal that is.

65
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:08.710
Someone is making millions of dollars off stealing other people's ideas and you

66
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:12.220
guys are just going to let it go because he sells tickets.
The Fuck Outta here.

67
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.200
But my Cora was never with her.
I was with the other guys.

68
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.290
Did you guys speak after that happened and I ever spoke to her again.
Wow.

69
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.110
Wow.
I said,
yeah,

70
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:27.550
well by the time I came back she was real rough,

71
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.970
real rough.
You know she had other things to worry about.
Of course

72
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.580
he said,
well I had that one showcase.
Those.

73
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.490
My only direct experience with her when I met her in 1994 she gave me a lot of

74
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:41.830
good advice.
She did.
She,

75
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.370
she always gave me good spots like hard fucking spots.

76
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.230
Always like after dice,

77
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.760
after Martin Lawrence after anybody who would crush.
I go on after him,

78
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.480
after Chris Rock,
after this guy,
after that guy,
anybody that would crush she,

79
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.330
if she liked you,
she would give you the,
the death spots really well.

80
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:06.040
But she,
she realized that you have to,
you gotta eat shit man.
You got to develop.

81
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.090
You can't just have,
it's like there's an analogy with fighting.

82
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.150
Like you can't just fight people that you could beat the shit out of.

83
00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:15.100
You have to fight people that are going to test you.
Sure.

84
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.130
Cause otherwise you're going to develop like a unrealistic sense of your

85
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:24.340
abilities and an unrealistic sense of other people's abilities.

86
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.600
And you have to,
you have to,
you have to feel what it's like.

87
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.140
I think as an up and comic comic,
like you start thinking you're pretty good.

88
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.900
And then you have to see someone who's really good and then you go,
oh my God,

89
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:35.670
I'm terrible.

90
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.670
And then you go on after them and that feeling of just total ineptitude or you

91
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:44.500
just feel so shitty and clunky and awful.
