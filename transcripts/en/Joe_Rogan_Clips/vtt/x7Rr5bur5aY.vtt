1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.410
It's very fascinating to me.
These,
um,

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.230
these sort of mindsets that you see on the left and on the right,

3
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.650
that there's certain subjects that you,
if you support that subject,

4
00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:15.100
you are automatically thought of as a left winger.
Have you support this subject,

5
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.250
you're are automatically thought of as a right.
If you were on the right,

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.120
you probably think,
yeah,
in some way.
Like there's,

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.350
if someone says to me that they think that climate change is probably an

8
00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:31.510
overblown thing and it's a cycle that the world has been going through forever,

9
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.650
I go,
Oh,
you're a winger and you'd be right.
Yeah.
Well,
almost always,
always,

10
00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:37.540
always.
And if you think,
you know,

11
00:00:37.541 --> 00:00:40.330
all gay people should be allowed to get married,
who cares?
Oh,

12
00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:41.200
you're probably left winger.

13
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.240
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
That,
that,</v>

14
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.790
that was probably 10 years ago and it's actually less true now.

15
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.570
That's one of these amazing changes.
So sometimes there can be these changes.

16
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:52.270
It's just catch us all by surprise.
And gay marriage is one of them.
I mean,

17
00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:56.760
that was like,
uh,
even people on the left have misgivings about climate change.

18
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.220
I remember.
But gay marriage,
I'm sorry,
in the 90s,

19
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.800
it was still something that a lot of people on the left,

20
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:03.840
we're kind of had the mean,
let's not go that far.

21
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:06.870
Maybe we should have civil unions or you know,
uh,

22
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.280
now the whole of the country has flipped,
but you,

23
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.040
but in general,
so the f these changes can happen,

24
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:19.041
but you're right that a lot of opinions are just wealthy badges to a coalition

25
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.170
and they can sometimes change in,
in very strange ways.

26
00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:26.670
So we've seen it in the last year or so with,

27
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.320
with a Donald Trump who is in many ways a pretty radical right winger,

28
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.650
uh,
in things like,
uh,
what do you think?
What did,

29
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.540
what's your opinion of Russia now for decades?
If you're on the right,

30
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.840
you mistrusted Russia and if you're on the left there,
you know,

31
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:44.460
they weren't so bad,
they misunderstood.

32
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.640
Now it's like totally flipped and opinions on whether you trust Russia,
uh,

33
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.160
just because of the influence of Donald Trump have shifted to the people on the

34
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:55.350
right are more sympathetic to Russia.

35
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.190
Something that would've been almost unthinkable a couple,
uh,
even 10 years ago.

36
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.660
Free Trade is another example.

37
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:05.340
It was kind of a right wing cause and then Trump managed to flip it.

38
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.400
So what it shows is,
I mean where I'm going with this,

39
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.370
and this is something that I've,
where I've changed my mind,

40
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.510
I used to think they were these ideologies kind of like religious catechisms

41
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.730
where these are the beliefs that follow from one another but a lot of is just

42
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.650
raw tribalism.
It just like,
you know,
in in sports the,
the,
the players,

43
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.120
you know,
churn through the tip,
the rosters with free agency and you know,

44
00:02:29.121 --> 00:02:31.590
w w we used to be a guy who used to be a good guy.

45
00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:33.780
Well now he's on the other team,
now he's a bad guy.
You know,

46
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:34.950
as Jerry Seinfeld once said,

47
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.720
you rooting for clothing and that kind of happens with political ideologies as

48
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:41.580
well to I think to everyone's shock.

49
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.770
<v 0>Yeah.
That the tribalism thing is very,
very confusing to me because you,</v>

50
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:50.390
you,
you could see it like it's such an obvious pattern.
And that when it,

51
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.730
when it plays out,
like,
you know,
uh,
the,
with the global warming thing,

52
00:02:54.731 --> 00:02:58.390
I was having a conversation with a guy in my Jujitsu class and I'll never forget

53
00:02:58.391 --> 00:03:02.290
this.
And he was like,
oh,
it's been a,
it's a cycle.
You know,
it's a cycle,

54
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:06.730
a global warming.
And then the climate change has always been a cycle.
And a,

55
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:09.210
you know,
the,
the people that say that it's not,
it's like,
Whoa,

56
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.180
how much should we study though I use scientists,
like,

57
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:16.600
I don't know a lot about global warming.
I don't know a lot about climate change,

58
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:21.010
but I know what I've read and it seems to me to be a very complex issue.

59
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.540
And I'm talking to this 25 year old guy who was in the military who's telling me

60
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.060
this.
I mean,
do you have an education?
And this is like,
no.
I'm like,
well,

61
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:32.050
why didn't you just automatically like decide that this is it?

62
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.440
We're talking about the very temperature of the planet earth.

63
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.960
This is complex.
And what is causing it?
Is it a carbon monoxide thing?

64
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:42.130
Is it a,
I mean,
what,

65
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.450
why do you just automatically subscribed to this?

66
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:49.240
And it's because that's how his tribe communicates.

67
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.650
This is how his tribe and that it gives people comfort to be in these weird

68
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:56.200
little groups where everybody has group thing.

69
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.360
<v 1>Yeah.
And this is a,
uh,</v>

70
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.970
I talk about this phenomenon in enlightenment now because it's a book that

71
00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:07.620
argues for,
uh,
the,
the importance of reason and uh,

72
00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:11.640
and how there has been progress thanks to application of reason.

73
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.510
And a natural pushback is,
well,
you look at things like that,

74
00:04:15.511 --> 00:04:18.090
we don't seem so reasonable.
It's as a species.
How can you,

75
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.080
what's going on that we're getting,
we seem to be getting less reasonable.

76
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.580
And I think the answer is there's reason can work in for different goals.

77
00:04:26.581 --> 00:04:31.140
And here I'm using the ideas of a Yale scholar named Dan Dan Daniel Kahan,

78
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.300
where he notes a perverse way in which there's actually is a kind of rationality

79
00:04:36.301 --> 00:04:38.880
to that kind of belief.
Namely,
when you vote,

80
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.560
what are the chances that your vote's really gonna swing reelection pretty close

81
00:04:43.561 --> 00:04:47.780
to zero.
On the other hand,
when you express an opinion in your,

82
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.090
your peer group,
the people you work with,
your family,

83
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.830
what are the chances that holding the wrong opinion will lead you to be kind of

84
00:04:55.831 --> 00:05:00.120
condemned and ostracized and treated as a real weirdo?
You know,
very high.

85
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.410
So if you're,

86
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.440
if everyone thinks what opinion is going to help my esteem and the people I care

87
00:05:07.111 --> 00:05:11.100
about,
they can latch on to all kinds of beliefs.

88
00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:15.490
If they've become kind of identity badges for their tribe.
Uh,

89
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.420
this is rational in terms of the world they live in.

90
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.640
It's not so rational for the planet as a whole.

91
00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:25.641
If people just subscribe to beliefs based on tribal loyalty instead of truth and

92
00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:27.060
the challenges,

93
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.950
how do we align beliefs more with truth and less with tribal loyalty?

94
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.490
Now it's not hopeless because there are a lot of beliefs that people used to

95
00:05:35.491 --> 00:05:38.460
have that are,
that have been there have been overturned.

96
00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:42.600
People don't believe in Unicorns anymore or alchemy and fueled people believe in

97
00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:47.340
astrology.
And,
and a lot of scientific issues are,
there's no controversy.

98
00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:50.070
Do antibiotics work.
Yeah.
I mean there's no,
you don't,

99
00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:51.630
it doesn't matter whether you're on the right or the left.

100
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.110
It's a part of the challenge is how do we get more and more of our beliefs to
be,

101
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.441
get,

102
00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:00.980
have our social norms be such that if you believe something just because you're

103
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:03.230
on the writer of on the left,
then you're an idiot.

104
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.060
What you should be doing is looking at the best possible study with an open
mind.

105
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.480
That's what a cool person does.
And only an idiot,

106
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:14.210
just parrots though the right wing line.

107
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.460
That's the kind of social change we need to aim for.
Ryan.

108
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.450
Just almost a shaming of that kind of ignorance.

109
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.230
But this does the desire that people have to subscribe to a predetermined

110
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:27.500
pattern of thinking and behaving because it's,
it's comforting.

111
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.090
It's comforting that you know,

112
00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:32.600
and then also like they know that other people on their group,

113
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.450
we'll also think like that.
It's like if you're in the right,

114
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.140
one of the things about UC,
about right-wingers is kind of hilarious.

115
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.250
I was watching this,
uh,
Kyle Kuklinski,
a secular talk,

116
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.570
a podcast where he was talking about this,
uh,
these,
uh,

117
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.440
Christians who are talking about Trump.
And when you are on the right,

118
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.140
you must have a belief in God.
You just have to,

119
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.810
and when they were talking about Trump,
they were saying,

120
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.150
we're talking about the man that existed before he accepted Jesus.
You know,

121
00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:05.930
I don't have up.
And the guy was literally saying,
I don't have a past.
Okay,

122
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.140
how about you?
Cause I've accepted Jesus Christ into my life.

123
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.000
And that once you accept Jesus Christ,

124
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.830
like you are now a believer in Christ and you're for,

125
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.530
you're forgiven for all of your past sins.
And this is,
this is on the right,

126
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.710
there's a giant percentage of the people that are on the right that subscribed

127
00:07:23.711 --> 00:07:28.700
to I a religious Christian mindset.
It is fascinating.

128
00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:33.020
And especially when it comes to our current president who by any standards is

129
00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:36.860
like the least Christian.
Yeah.
A leader that we've ever had asked.

130
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.760
He's accepted Jesus,
then he doesn't have a pass.
Well,
yeah,
but he's still,

131
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:44.600
you know,
I mean the Christian virtues include things like,
you know,
modesty,

132
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.940
passion for the week.
Sure.
A temperance,

133
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.760
chivalry gentlemen leanness and this guy is lewd and,
and vain,

134
00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:57.530
glorious and arrogant and contemptuous for,
for losers.
But with shows,
again,

135
00:07:57.531 --> 00:07:59.480
it kind of going back to our discussion,

136
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.530
it's just amazing how much of the loyalty doesn't have to do with the actual

137
00:08:03.531 --> 00:08:07.460
content of the beliefs.
It's just whoever's on,
on my side.

138
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:12.870
And of course he promised a lot of perks for the,
for uh,

139
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:16.490
the,
the religious right,
like the repeal of the amendment that,
uh,

140
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.450
tax exempt organizations can't engage in,
in politics and in lobbying.

141
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.140
The so called the Johnson amendment,
which meant that if you're a church,

142
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.070
if you don't pay taxes,
you can't be politically active.
Well,

143
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:31.190
they didn't like that and he promised to repeal that amendment and so he got

144
00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:32.350
their loyalty.
Uh,

145
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.310
and so it was just raw political muscle kind of overcame Christian virtue.

146
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.550
So bizarre.
So bizarre.
Yeah.
But it's,

147
00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:43.280
it's fascinating to watch just these patterns,

148
00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:46.270
these tribal ideological patterns.
When you,

149
00:08:46.271 --> 00:08:51.230
you see these groups that have this sort of one mindset in this very clear

150
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.240
things.
I can flip another example.

151
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.690
People forget this sort of taking environmentalism,
you know,

152
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.500
kind of quintessential,
you know,
left green because not so long ago,

153
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:05.070
it was the other way around is actually considered to be a cause of the right.

154
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.960
Why?
Well,
if you are,
if you're left wing activist in the 60s,

155
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:11.430
he would say,
well,

156
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.970
the only people concerned with the environment are rich people who like the view

157
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:19.050
from their country estates and they don't want them to be spoiled by being cut

158
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:21.730
down for apartments,
for poor people.
Uh,

159
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.110
or they're your duck hunters who want to be able to go and hunt ducks.
And,

160
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.720
and if you're really socially concerned,

161
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.560
you should care about Vietnam and racism and poverty.

162
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:35.280
And it's just a luxury to worry about,
you know,
trees and flowers and,
and ducks.

163
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.030
Now I flipped and then environmentalist and became a left wing cause.

164
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.270
But it these,
uh,

165
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.280
these connections between your coalition and your beliefs aren't set in stone.

166
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.810
Yeah.
Wasn't it in the beginning of the forming of this,

167
00:09:51.811 --> 00:09:54.180
the political parties that it was,

168
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.170
the Democrats were very different and Republicans are more like Democrats?

169
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.470
Oh yeah.
Well starting with Abraham Lincoln,
the first republican president,

170
00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:04.470
and they were the,
there,
of course they were the party against slavery.

171
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:09.720
And in fact,
even in my lifetime through the 60s,
they will,
in the south,

172
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:14.460
the Democrats were the right wing racist party.
I mean,

173
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.630
had George Wallace,
the governor of Alabama who said segregation now,

174
00:10:18.631 --> 00:10:22.860
segregation forever.
He was a democrat.
He formed his own party and 68,

175
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:27.000
but then back in 72,
he ran for the Democratic nomination.

176
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.470
And the southern Democrats were they the kind of the right wingers and it was

177
00:10:31.471 --> 00:10:34.830
often the northeast Republicans who are the liberals.

178
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.940
That's still partly true in Massachusetts.

179
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.910
We have a little bit of a remnant of that.

180
00:10:38.911 --> 00:10:43.080
We've had some liberal Republican governors.
We have one right now.

181
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.490
Charlie Baker is a Republican and he's be a pretty moderate middle of the road.

182
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.810
Uh,
William Weld,
who was then the libertarian vice presidential candidate.

183
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.470
He was a Republican,
or even,
you know,
even when Mitt Romney was our governor,

184
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.770
he was not particularly conservative.
He's,
he was a republican.

185
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.500
So there's the remnant of that in Massachusetts.

186
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.410
They used to be a little bit of bad in New York where they were liberal

187
00:11:04.411 --> 00:11:06.300
Republicans.
Uh,
but yeah,

188
00:11:06.301 --> 00:11:10.560
that's a case where it's flipped a now democratic goals left of center

189
00:11:10.561 --> 00:11:11.700
Republican,
Right.
Of Center.

190
00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:21.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>
