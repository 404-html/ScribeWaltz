1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.030
But they must be pissed.

2
00:00:01.031 --> 00:00:03.690
The weed's legal everywhere else because people used to go to Holland,

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.410
specifically friends that own coffee shops over there and they're like,
yeah,

4
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:10.270
there's,
there's a lot of fucking,
well,
what's going on right now is there's,
um,

5
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.380
if I understood what he was telling me,
right?
Um,

6
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.330
Canada is investing shit,

7
00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:19.410
tons of money with the government over there to like corporate,

8
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.990
like stark growing corporate we'd like,

9
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.310
and they're going to phase out to the locals and take it over.
Ah,

10
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.940
like during the phase out the coffee shop,

11
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.170
because their weed isn't legal in Holland,
it's decriminalized.

12
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.410
If you own a weed shop,
you can only have,

13
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.000
let's say 500 grams at a time in the shop legally.
All right?

14
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.490
If you have a good shop,
you're moving that,
you know,
in a fucking afternoon.

15
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.860
So,
and getting,
bringing weed to your shop is illegal.
Like,

16
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:53.490
it's like it's a smuggling operation has to be in there and once it's in there,

17
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:55.350
it's okay.
Once it's in there,
you could sell it,

18
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.310
but getting it to your spot as the problem,

19
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.510
it's fucking illegal to move that much weed.
It's fucked up.
Like these guys.

20
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:04.950
I have no,
a couple of guys,
I want a cup of coffee shops and they're just like,

21
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:07.380
it's fuckery,
man.
You and getting it,
it's like us constant.

22
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.550
It's like half a criminal operation.

23
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.630
They're running and it used to be that you get mushrooms,

24
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.320
you should be able to get mushrooms,
you to be able to get like a bunch of shit.

25
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.490
And now you can't hard like narcotics,
like coke or anything like that.

26
00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:22.140
But anything natural,
like mushrooms,

27
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.060
you could get acid when I was first in there,

28
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.970
but I don't know if that was legal because I was really young.
I just,

29
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.450
well Holland,
just a wild ass place.
