Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.110
I found the need for everything to be conspiracy is a real problem.

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.590
It's a real problem for a lot of people that need to know that they're right

4
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.240
about things is a real problem.

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.600
You know the the not admitting that you don't really know part is a problem

6
00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:20.920
because until you,

7
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.490
until I'm absolutely certain that what you're saying,

8
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.100
like I have to know when I'm talking to you.

9
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.400
If you say I'm absolutely 100% positive that if I liked this paper on fire,

10
00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:36.850
it'll burn 100% if this is regular paper and I have a regular fire,

11
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.370
I'm 100% positive.
I have to,

12
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.590
if I have to hear you say if I have to know that that's how you really are

13
00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:45.424
operating,

14
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.500
so if you're telling me it's 100% of the Kennedys drivers shot him,
dude,

15
00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:54.550
it's 100% you watched the video,
it's 100% Kennedy's driver shot him or any,

16
00:00:54.551 --> 00:00:57.190
any kind of crazy conspiracy like that.
As soon as you say,

17
00:00:57.191 --> 00:01:00.970
you know for sure it's like God damn man.
It's a huge,
no,
no,

18
00:01:00.971 --> 00:01:04.240
for sure that it wasn't a plane and hit the Pentagon,
you know for sure.

19
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.910
How do you know for sure.
Right.
I agree with you completely.

20
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.390
You can't know for sure.
And if everyone agrees,

21
00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:13.390
like I always get freaked out when like everybody agrees on everything.

22
00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:15.280
I feel like I'm going to call it.
Yeah.
It gets,

23
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.660
it gets super culting bolts on both sides as being a skeptical person.

24
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.630
Like there's a lot of people that are skeptics that they'll look at things even

25
00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:25.410
like operation Northwoods and they'll be like,
well that's just,

26
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.380
it didn't no big deal.
If they were planning on killing Americans,

27
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.390
they were going to RM Cuban friendlies and have them attack Guantanamo Bay
there.

28
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:36.520
We're trying to get us to go to war with Cuba and they were going to manipulate

29
00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:40.750
us.
They were going to blow up a drone jet liner and blame it on Cuba.

30
00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:44.190
So we'd be outraged.
We want to go over and kick Cuba's ass.
You it cost,

31
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.000
who knows?
Countless thousands of American lives for sure.
Cause we're,
you know,

32
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:52.690
you're talking about 1961 or two or whatever it was when they,

33
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.410
when Kennedy vetoed this shit,
it's signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

34
00:01:56.411 --> 00:01:57.580
They were really gonna do this.

35
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.340
Like anybody who doesn't look at that and get disturbed,

36
00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:03.130
this is from the freedom of Information Act.
That's not a conspiracy.

37
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.860
The problem with the really wacky conspiracies,
like you know,

38
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.350
Kennedy's drivers shot him or you know the,
the goes deep as you want.
Yeah.

39
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.130
The really wacky ones distract from the real ones.
They mask it,

40
00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:16.590
it makes it so nothing means anything.

41
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.380
Like Alex Jones was saying something fucking crazy today.

42
00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:25.360
Like there's Jewish actors pretending to be Nazis in Charlottesville.

43
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.100
Like these guys had tattoos of swastikas on their chest.

44
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.310
It's not a fucking does not Jewish person cause you're not supposed to get

45
00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:35.890
tattoos.
Right,
exactly.
It's not a fucking actor.

46
00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:40.060
Once you tattoo a swastika on your chest that you're not acting anymore.
Right.

47
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.420
You've committed to a team.
Jesus Christ.
That's,

48
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.570
that's like one of the biggest steps I can possibly think of as a human being is

49
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.530
to go to a tattoo parlor.
And be like,
give me the fucking craziest one.

50
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.500
Yeah.
