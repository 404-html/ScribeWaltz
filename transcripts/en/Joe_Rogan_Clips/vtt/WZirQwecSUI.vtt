00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.330
The joe rogan experience,
there's,

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.630
there's some great good to exposing these things.

3
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.700
But in doing so,

4
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.820
the overzealous approach of accusing all men of being potential rapist is an

5
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:20.470
adjust just an overreaction.
And then won't it balance itself out?

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.080
Do you or do you think that it's more complicated than that?
It's gonna.

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.980
It's gonna Backfire because the problem looks like a power grab.

8
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.560
But won't the backfiring balance itself out?
I mean people,

9
00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:33.250
reasonable people like you or myself or we're always going to recognize the

10
00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:36.490
difference that there are monsters.
Yes.
Right.

11
00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:40.750
And we're not going to deny monsters because someone goes too far in the accused

12
00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:44.110
garrison Keillor of being a monster when we know that that's not true.

13
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.940
It doesn't make sense.
The story doesn't make sense.

14
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.830
So because most people who I've talked to about the garrison Keillor story,

15
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.810
which he was consoling a woman and he touched her back and then she pulled back

16
00:00:55.811 --> 00:00:57.970
and he apologized and I didn't mean to do that.

17
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.000
And then he sent her an email apologizing and she said,
no big deal.

18
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:04.030
Don't worry about it.
They were good for awhile.
And then years later,

19
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.940
right when all this me two things,
she just decides,

20
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.800
I remember something that was wrong and let's,
let's take this guy down,

21
00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:14.650
like with just,
which didn't make any sense that,
first of all,

22
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.350
well let's leave it alone.
Didn't make any sense.

23
00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:21.340
But where's garrison Keillor now?
Right.
Yeah.
He hasn't been resurrected.

24
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.800
It hasn't been resurrected.
They took his shows off the air.

25
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.510
It doesn't make money.
So it aside,
you know,

26
00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:27.730
whether or not you like him as an artist or creator,

27
00:01:27.731 --> 00:01:31.270
just like they actually destroyed not just him,
but his legacy for a hug,

28
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.420
for something that at the time both parties agreed was no big deal.

29
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.500
Yeah.
I just saw,
I don't understand it.
I don't,

30
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.840
it's completely unacceptable and it's the death of justice.
Well,

31
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.900
was that just getting caught up in the hysteria of just like trying to find

32
00:01:47.081 --> 00:01:49.300
Todd?
There's one put that fire out immediately.

33
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.053
<v 1>Um,</v>

34
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.090
so we have a couple of problems and one of the problems is that the folks who

35
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:03.030
are advancing this movement and the other parallel,

36
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.440
I wished they hadn't taken the term social justice because,
um,

37
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.880
we need a replacement term for that.
That is,
uh,
not overzealous.

38
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.690
But those movements have engaged in a kind of naive,

39
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.850
um,
conclusion making that makes them,

40
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.600
uh,
inevitably hijack.

41
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.060
They get inevitably hijacked by bad actors.
So if you,

42
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.730
you are essentially looking at a situation,
if you say,
um,

43
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.620
we must believe all victims,

44
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.890
that's like putting out a neon sign for bad actors that wish to utilize this

45
00:02:46.991 --> 00:02:51.950
structure,
right?
So,
um,
and there will be bad actors.
Yes.

46
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.460
Every population male is a population of females,
a population.

47
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.830
They're monstrous males who have been behaving predatorily.

48
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.850
There will be women who will take advantage of this and accused people without

49
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.290
reason.
I mean,
we,
I don't know whether the numbers are robust or not,

50
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:13.291
but I've heard numbers that somewhere between 1% to 4% of the population are

51
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:14.710
sociopathic.

52
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.040
If you set up a system in which we are obligated to believe every victim,

53
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.170
then those people will come out of the woodwork and they will use this to level

54
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:29.500
their enemies.
And so at the very least,

55
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:32.200
what that tells you is rule number one,

56
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.690
you cannot make the rule,

57
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:38.410
you must believe all victims or you will have lots of people piling into the

58
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:42.490
category of victim that don't deserve to be there.
And who is hurt most by that?

59
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.010
Not only the people who are going to be sabotaged by bad actors,

60
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.500
but the people who have suffered the worst,
um,

61
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.830
cases of rape,

62
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.890
they are effectively having the terrible things that have happened to them

63
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:03.670
diluted by stories that are either fictional or minor that are being lumped in.

64
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.600
So it's further victimization of them.
It is,

65
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.170
it's a transfer of wellbeing from the people who have been most harmed to people

66
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:15.530
who've been less harmed or our cynically using,
um,
the structure.

67
00:04:15.531 --> 00:04:17.210
So if,
uh,

68
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.260
the idea of a me too of the reckoning that has finally come for these really

69
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:27.790
terrible guys who were getting away with all of this awful stuff.

70
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.620
If that is close to your heart,

71
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:34.621
then what you should want is a set of rules that is careful enough and robust

72
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:38.830
enough that we can keep holding those kinds of people to account what will

73
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:41.530
happen if we don't do that.
And I promise you this,

74
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.210
from a game theoretic perspective,

75
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.480
if we decide you must believe all victims and all transgressions are equally

76
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:53.380
bad,
we're going to turn the thing to 11 for everything from that to happen.

77
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.360
I agree with you.
But how did that happen?
If you're,

78
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.230
if you're cynical kind of nuance in part.
Yeah,
it is.
It is,
uh,

79
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.490
the death of nuance because if you're wielding this thing as a weapon,
right?

80
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:07.000
If you have,
what you want to do is turn the tables on all men.

81
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:11.500
If you want to take power and say you listen,
well,
this is a frightening weapon.

82
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.900
So in order to make that weapon maximally dangerous,
you,

83
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.430
um,
you equate you lower with call.
Yeah.
You,
you say it's all one.

84
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.570
Uh,

85
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.570
there's nothing a woman could ever do that would increase her likelihood of

86
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.890
facing any of this.
And you know,

87
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:31.960
we should cover that in a second because that's one of the,

88
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:34.670
it's another one of these booby traps where,
um,

89
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.810
you can very easily say the wrong thing and suddenly,
uh,

90
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.510
you're on the defensive even though what you said is very rational.
But it also,

91
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:46.450
it denies the reality of what Male,

92
00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:49.090
female relationships look like when they're at all healthy.

93
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.560
There's going to be risk.
There is risk as you get to know people.

94
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.600
And I don't,
you know,

95
00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.500
we're just meeting say instead of having met in high school so many years ago,

96
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.740
I don't know if I like you yet.
You don't know if he liked me yet.

97
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.550
We're going to take some chances and maybe you're going to say something wrong

98
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.410
and I'm not going to be thrilled with it.
Are you at fault?
Do I?

99
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.900
Do I blame you?
Do I cry?
Harassment?

100
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:19.901
Because you said something that didn't quite fall right on my ears or did it

101
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:23.650
sound right and I kind of like you anyway.
And so I go like,
oh,
that's,

102
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.490
that's fine.
You know,
we're good.
Well,
it really depends on,
you know,
how it,

103
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.600
how I receive that depends a lot on how I feel about you.

104
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.260
Otherwise you could say exactly the same words and you know,

105
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:38.090
you could say it and someone else could say it.

106
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.910
And from that guy I might feel like,
I kind of wish you hadn't said that,

107
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.440
but that has to mean that that isn't big deep problem that he said it because

108
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.920
we're engaged at something where we're trying to discover do we like each other,

109
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.870
are we into each other?
Like what's going on here?

110
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.460
So the process of discovery is going to involve mistake and risk and,

111
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.330
and even some sort of its,
its game playing.
You know,

112
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:02.510
you're involved in the social game in which you're trying to figure out who each

113
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:07.511
other are and after the fact saying that guy is kind of gross.

114
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:13.430
So the thing that he said was Harris Smith,
sorry.
No,
not,
not acceptable.

115
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.610
It's changing the rules of the game based on whether or not you liked a

116
00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:20.350
particular individual and that's not a legit move.
So we,

117
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.310
we gotta be super careful here.
Yeah.
Um,

118
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.820
one thing that is true is we are facing a landscape in which

119
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.020
we are,
I think effectively rewriting the rules of,

120
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:37.730
um,
male,

121
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:42.731
female interaction in order to make sex with strangers perfectly safe.

122
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:45.081
Now,

123
00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:49.340
sex with strangers can't be perfectly safe in a world in which you're dealing

124
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:52.480
with,
let's say it's 1% sociopath's you can,

125
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.480
they can't make a world in which it's safe to take a sociopath home and have sex

126
00:07:56.481 --> 00:07:59.000
with them,
right?
That that's not going to happen.

127
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.310
But in order to try to make it safe,

128
00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:06.200
we're going to turn up all of these protections.
So for example,
um,

129
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.420
we've got the issue of affirmative consent.

130
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.333
Now,

131
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:18.340
affirmative consent is a great fail safe in a circumstance where you are dealing

132
00:08:20.481 --> 00:08:21.590
with a stranger.

133
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:27.580
It seems like it would be absolutely essential because the danger of a

134
00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:33.191
miscommunication is so great that you have to be perfectly explicit and there

135
00:08:33.531 --> 00:08:37.140
can be,
there's no room for,
uh,

136
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:42.170
any coyness or subtlety about it.

137
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.350
In other words,
it has to effectively be transactional.

138
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:50.130
No courtship that's going to make it into the history books or literature is

139
00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:53.880
going to involve affirmative consent at every stage.
You can do it.
Yes.

140
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.190
How about now?
Yeah.
Did you remember

141
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.640
<v 0>that video that they released?
There was a video that,
boy,</v>

142
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.080
I don't remember who did it,

143
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.900
but as essentially showing how consent can be sexy and so,
uh,

144
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.180
it shows this millennial couple making out and uh,

145
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.840
like every few seconds the guy has to ask the girl if it's okay if he kisses

146
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:19.920
her,
if it's,
is it okay if I touch you here?
Is it okay if I take your shirt off?

147
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:24.050
And she says not yet.
And then they keep going and going and going and then the,

148
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:28.110
the girls asking the guy,
which is hilarious,
is it okay if I do this?
Like what?

149
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:33.210
Because this is magic.
Right?
Exactly,
exactly.
Which is the phosphorus,
right?

150
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.410
Well that was also an issue with,
um,
they've sort of abandoned this,

151
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.910
but a few years ago there was this thing where if you had sex with someone and

152
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:45.900
alcohol was involved,
you raped them because they could not consent.

153
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.041
But then like,
well,

154
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:51.210
that means I've been raped a lot of times because that's ridiculous.
Like it did,

155
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:53.760
but it never worked that way.
It does.
If you want symmetry,

156
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.750
you would have to say that if a man has consumed alcohol and the woman hasn't,

157
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:02.160
than the woman is raping the man.
I don't want to freak you out.
But,
um,

158
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:07.590
Heather and I have been assuming each other's consent for 30 years.

159
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.810
I mean,
we have inferred it from cues that were not verbal.

160
00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:14.250
It guys didn't discuss.
What about radio writing things down?

161
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.980
Do you have a chalkboard or,
no,
I mean,

162
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.530
and the thing is the only thing that keeps us safe from being arrested for this,

163
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:24.060
right?
The board.
We've both done it.
It's like damn right.

164
00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:29.010
You're both criminals.
Yeah.
But this,
this,
these changing,

165
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.440
these shifting of the rules.
It's a,

166
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.740
it seems like it's almost like you were talking about game theory.
It does.

167
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:39.780
It really does seem like a type of game.
It is life.

168
00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:44.400
But it is a thing where people are looking to call people out.
You're,

169
00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.760
you're looking to score,
you're looking to like score.
Uh,
you're,

170
00:10:48.761 --> 00:10:52.140
you're finding someone who's done something inappropriate or finding someone who

171
00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.080
doing done something that used to be appropriate but is no longer,

172
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.830
and we're looking to establish this new parameter and this new way of existing

173
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.040
and that there's this,
it takes on this competition element,

174
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.770
which I'm very familiar with.
I understand competition,

175
00:11:04.771 --> 00:11:09.120
so when I see it clearly and I see like teen behavior,
I'm like,
well,

176
00:11:09.121 --> 00:11:11.580
I see what's going on here.
This is not rational thinking.

177
00:11:11.581 --> 00:11:14.220
This is someone who's trying to score points.

178
00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:16.280
You're trying to get one on the board.
Yes.

179
00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.040
It's absolutely competitive and it's mostly competitive at the moment.

180
00:11:20.041 --> 00:11:23.190
It looks like second,
if within women and it's going to destroy,

181
00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:26.970
it's actively making male female relationships.
Impossible to navigate.

182
00:11:26.971 --> 00:11:30.960
But I understand it for as a man,
I get the motivation.

183
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:35.990
I think that women overwhelmingly have been victimized as opposed to like men

184
00:11:36.241 --> 00:11:39.630
being victimized by women in that regard.
In terms of being sexually harassed,

185
00:11:39.631 --> 00:11:40.530
it's not even close.

186
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.770
I mean is it was one of the most unbalanced things in our culture ever.

187
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.850
Completely.
Right.
But it's posted in our culture,
right?

188
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.390
This is what we're talking,
right.
What do we want out of this now?
Now that it's,

189
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.250
but,
right.
Do you want 100%

190
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.180
<v 1>safety?
Right.
Do you want to maximize safety at the cost of oil?</v>

191
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:01.300
We have to kill sociopath,
so I want to do that.
Yeah.
The point is if you want,

192
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.490
if you want absolute safety,
I mean we're,

193
00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:06.240
we're getting to the point where this is just robbing.
Okay.

194
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:11.250
If the point of this is to make sex safe because it's pleasurable,

195
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.910
this is going to rob all over the pleasure from sex.
I mean,
it's,

196
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:20.410
it's getting to the point where you'd be crazy to have sex without witnesses.

197
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.770
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Um,
but,
but anyway,

198
00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:27.750
the point is now that the stuff is on the table right now that we've,

199
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.290
we know that there are monsters.

200
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:33.040
We know that there are economic forces that actually protect these monsters,

201
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.670
which frankly is a big part of this story.
Hmm.
Right.

202
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.880
Is that the economic structure of something like Hollywood causes this to

203
00:12:41.921 --> 00:12:46.921
continue with it being effectively an open secret that these people are abusing

204
00:12:46.991 --> 00:12:51.420
women and then silencing them and contractually obligating them,
uh,
not to,

205
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.380
to do anything about it.
That,
that,

206
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:58.650
that cancer on the social system is now open for discussion and we,

207
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.720
all of us decent folk know that we have to get rid of it.

208
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.810
If you get rid of it though,
on false pretenses,

209
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:11.860
I promise you the very same game theory that caused it to happen in the first

210
00:13:11.861 --> 00:13:14.680
place will cause it to reemerge.
The only,

211
00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:17.480
the reason it makes it harder to address the next time.
Yeah.

212
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.620
<v 3>Okay.</v>
