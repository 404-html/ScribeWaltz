1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.430
Well,
I mean,
I think,
um,
maybe,
maybe it'll just be,

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.270
you can only have an electric car,
um,
you know,
maybe 10 years from now,

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.800
like it'll be illegal in the u s to build,
uh,
like,
uh,
you know,

4
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.160
a gas guzzling car.

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.570
I got an alert to car recently and it's amazing the blowback from my friends.

6
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.910
What are they sensing?
Well,
first of all,
it's always homophobic or,

7
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:22.770
or a or a feminine.

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.180
They're always going after you about your estrogen levels and your manhood.

9
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:31.020
It's like,
it's weird.
It's kind of like a space.
I mean,
Tesla's are kind of like,

10
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:33.020
there's kind of like space ships though.
They feel,
I mean,

11
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.180
there's only been in one.
Yeah,
he driven one.
I haven't driven one.

12
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:37.790
I've driven in one.
I've,

13
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.910
I drove in one years ago and I wasn't that impressed,

14
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.580
I want to say like maybe five or six years ago,

15
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.050
but now I have one of the new ones that's crazy fast.
It doesn't even make sense.

16
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.400
Regular cars are stupid.
They're stupid.
And you spend all that money on gas.

17
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:55.740
Why would you want to do that?
But I mean,
they're stupid.

18
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.270
Like they don't work as good.

19
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.930
Like that thing is way better than any car I've ever driven and it's only gonna

20
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:01.860
get better there.

21
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:05.320
They don't even make sense how fast they are and they drive themselves.
Yeah.

22
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.880
Like you hit this little thing.
Go do do and it just fucking steers.

23
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.510
It takes over.
Yeah,
like it drives,
yeah.
And it's,

24
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.960
it stays within the speed limit and you can just kind of half ass space out

25
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.720
because keep your hand on the steering wheel and it a,

26
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:21.770
it breaks when there's cars in front of you and slow.
It's very strange.

27
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:26.490
I'll even change lanes for you.
Amazing.
It's fucked.
It's weird.

28
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.450
It's weird.
It's,
it's very difficult to let go and to give in like that.

29
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.840
But the strange thing that I felt was the,

30
00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:38.850
the blowback from my friends like,
and they're joking around.

31
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:42.120
Obviously most of my friends are comedians,
but it's a,
it's hilarious.

32
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.340
Even people have heckled me about,
yeah.
Well,

33
00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:47.010
I feel that like I just at the aesthetic level,

34
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.980
I understand that mocking of like the Prius,

35
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.490
but I feel like the Tesla is actually,
it looks a macho,

36
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.940
well the piece is a piece of shit.
It's like a cheese wedge wheels.

37
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.160
But I mean it's like,
you know,
yeah,

38
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:02.760
we live in a sick culture where like being like healthy and responsible.

39
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:06.780
It's like I'll just take staff.
It was like cigarettes and whiskey in mock,

40
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:10.560
someone eating a salad.
It's very weird.

41
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.460
It is very weird.
But um,
I was a,
that is an American problem.

42
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:15.520
Like other parts in the world,
they don't,

43
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.200
they're not as attached to their trucks and shit.
Grouse were gross,
but,

44
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.880
but there's something particularly strange about being on that side of it.

45
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.830
Cause I was um,
I wanna,

46
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.760
I don't want to say I was pessimistic about electric cars,

47
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.860
but when Elan did the podcast,
I told him I'd buy one of his cars because he was,

48
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.330
he was telling me how great they are.
I'm like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

49
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:37.260
I'm probably one of your cars.

50
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.270
But I really did not expect to like it as much as I do.
And then once I got it,

51
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:44.670
I was like,
oh,
okay,
now I get it.
Yeah.

52
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.180
But then I was thinking about my own resistance to it because I like cars.

53
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:52.620
I have,
you know,
muscle cars.
I have a couple,
I have an older Porsche.

54
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:57.450
I love them.
They're fun.
I liked those kinds of cars,
but they're stupid.

55
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.800
They really are dumb.

56
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.290
That's a dumb way to get around the Tesla is a way better way to get around.

57
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:03.750
Yeah.
And you know,

58
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.650
he's got one that's coming out in 2020 that's going to have a 660 mile range,

59
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.330
which is insane.
I mean,

60
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:13.420
you drive all the way to San Francisco and back with one charge,
you know?
I mean,

61
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:16.480
he's incredible.
I think,
you know,
I like there,

62
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.220
there are reasons why he gets the shit that he gets.

63
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:22.360
But I also think like Tesla and solar city are incredibly important.

64
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.400
And I'm actually,

65
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:27.670
I don't understand why there aren't more people in Silicon Valley who are

66
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.170
focused on climate in this way.
