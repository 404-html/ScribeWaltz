1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.710
Yeah,
I thought that was on a paper view.
That's right.
Yeah,
you're right.

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.120
I'm sorry it's doing my thing.

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.950
But that fight was really like a top contender.
If,
I mean chaos,
uh,

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.450
had been on a roll.
He's very strong on the ground,

5
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:17.880
which is one of the reasons why it was so impressive that he took his back and

6
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:21.990
choked him like that.
Yeah.
I mean I think I have a different style than,
than uh,

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.360
a lot of people can see,
you know,
you,
you,
you go back to could be and,

8
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.340
and all this.
I like,
his style is,
it's good.
It's obviously very good,

9
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:32.700
but I can see a lot of holes in it.
And I saw those holes many years ago.

10
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:34.230
I've been called how big he could beat for years.

11
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:37.500
I've been wanting to fight them just because people got those questions.

12
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.220
I've got those questions too.
So I'm like,
let's see what this motherfucker got.

13
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:43.530
Like,
cause I see it,
I see them hoes,
you know,

14
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:47.430
I don't really focus on too much of the good.
I'm like,
what holes?

15
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.230
That boy number,
I'll tell you.
What are the holes?
What do you see?
You know,

16
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.070
even on some of his take on a lot of his takedowns,
he misses a lot of them.

17
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:59.550
You know,
he's very square.
He kinda just bum rushes.
You know,

18
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:02.190
people were talking about the Barboza fight before and they're like,

19
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.070
are you looking at that fighter and you're going to try and build off that one?

20
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:08.880
I'm like,
yeah.
I mean he did.
Okay.
The fight was good.

21
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:12.000
He beat the hell out of Barboza,
but I saw the holes in it.
You know,

22
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:15.570
he's just running square forward.
Adam,
you know,
he got hit with a lot of shots.

23
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.790
I didn't see people in the outside watching him because the way he just came

24
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:24.720
forward on Barboza was like he was indestructable.
Yeah,
I mean it didn't matter.

25
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:27.390
I'm just going to get you,
it's just a matter of time.
Keep throwing your kicks.

26
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:30.150
I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you you.
I got you.
You got those guys.

27
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:32.310
But the body gives up.
You know,
you got Justin Gates,

28
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:35.410
you as the same way the body will give up and met with you.

29
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.430
You can't keep putting your body on the line like that.
I mean,

30
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.040
if he wants to run at me square for it,
a square like that,

31
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:45.910
that's what I'm getting paid.
I'm getting paid.
Oh,

32
00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:50.160
sorry.
I love the,
I love watching him fight,
but part of me is like,
Jesus,
man.
