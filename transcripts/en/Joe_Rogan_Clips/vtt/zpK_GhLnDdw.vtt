00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.840
Hello Freak bitches.
How did you,
this,
this,
uh,

2
00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:07.420
impression you're doing to this White House character?
What's his name again?

3
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.070
Stephen Miller.
How does,
first of all,

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.580
everyone's doing Sean Spicer or they weren't until he got fired or I'll,

5
00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:20.580
I'll uh,
Scaramucci and two and Sean sweat.
Yeah.

6
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:24.660
Melissa McCarthy was doing Sean Spicer.
He killed it.
Yeah.
Was hilarious.
You know,

7
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.230
it's funny,
Trump thought that it made him look weak,

8
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.960
that a woman was doing an impression.

9
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.130
What would she go and do an impression of Trump now because of that?

10
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.150
<v 1>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No,
I mean,
I don't know.
I mean I think that,
you know,</v>

11
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.100
I did a special,
what was it?
I've been to like,

12
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.840
I think it was like 2012 for showtime called politics where I went to DC and I

13
00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:52.250
did standup in DC and I interviewed all po.
I love politicians.

14
00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:56.390
Like that's all I watch when I come home at night.
All I watch is CNN,
MSN,

15
00:00:56.391 --> 00:01:01.160
and Fox just because that's it.
Cause I'm in shock and I can't believe it.
No,

16
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:04.690
I just go back and forth that there's so many fucked up things that are going on

17
00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:07.830
in the world.
The whole North Korea thing is insane.
It's Gary.

18
00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:10.290
It's fucking insane.
Well,
what's scary is

19
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.280
<v 0>Donald Trump is saying shit like fire and fury that the world has never known.</v>

20
00:01:15.281 --> 00:01:18.710
Like Jesus Dude,
like this isn't a movie.
This is real life.
Yeah,

21
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.660
<v 1>but I mean this North Korean guys fucking nuts.
He is fucking this fucking nuts.</v>

22
00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:27.380
It's like,
it's like dude,
stop shooting fucking missiles in the fucking,

23
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.360
this isn't like a play pen thing.

24
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.970
Do you just keep shooting missiles in the ocean all the time?

25
00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:36.560
Like it's like he's like a kid or some shit and he can't,
it's just,
I don't know.

26
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.453
It's just a,

27
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.640
<v 0>well I think Guam is only like 2000 miles away from North Korea or something</v>

28
00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:44.560
like real close.

29
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.910
So they're talking about him possibly bombing Guam and that's what they're

30
00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:52.960
saying now I know I been watching it like a death sentence.

31
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.220
I mean if,
if we decided to attack North Korea,

32
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.810
it would be a death sentence to them.

33
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.420
<v 1>And then also I heard,
cause I know,
I know Dennis Rodman,
you know,
I know Dennis,</v>

34
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.870
do you,
did you talk to him when he went over there?

35
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.540
I know I don't want to get too too into it,

36
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.930
but I know that he goes over there a lot and he meets with Kim Jong.

37
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.470
Ooh.
They just fucking get drunk and I don't know,

38
00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:22.970
they go on jet skis or some shit.
Like he like,
he like a,
um,

39
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.520
he likes Dennis Rodman,
so he brings them out.

40
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.960
But from what I heard is that Kim Jong Goon really loves Donald Trump.
Like,

41
00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:32.930
you know what I mean?
Like his,
the American,
he loves America,

42
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:35.570
but he's like kind of acting like he doesn't love America.

43
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.190
Like he loves the American way at that picture.
Yeah.

44
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.390
So my point is,
is I think,

45
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.980
I really think that if Donald Trump went over there to meet with the guy,

46
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.580
I think that would appease him and just show him the fuck out.

47
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.090
I think that's just my opinion.
Maybe you should be like a liaison.
Yeah,

48
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.210
there you go.
But he gets,
he gets,
uh,
you know,

49
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.200
he goes over there and hangs out with them because they,
Kim Jong and kid loves,

50
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.850
loves.
Um,
I think he loves America.
Yeah.
He loves America.

51
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.800
And that's,
it's just kind of like a weird,
you know,
there's,
there's no,
um,

52
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.870
what's the word?
There's no,
uh,
uh,

53
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.120
I don't get a modification communication.
They're not communicating right.

54
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.750
You know.
Well,
there's language barrier obviously,
but isn't he young?

55
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.370
Isn't Kim Jong Un like in his thirties?
Hold Z.
Yeah,
he's pretty young.
It's,

56
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.370
I mean,
imagine running a military dictatorship in your thirties,

57
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.490
and he's already murdered a gang of people who are already in.

58
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.460
The thing that's so crazy about the whole thing is that like,

59
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:46.540
you think of Isis and you think of that whole,
you know how those people,

60
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:49.720
like they don't care to dot,
and they don't care if they're going to die.

61
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.200
And I think that he's trained his people,
all the cmec always on CNN,

62
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.190
all these marching soldiers.
I think those guys are ready to die.
Well,

63
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.490
if you lived in a shit hole like North Korea where every day you're under the

64
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:04.110
oppressive of a military dictatorship,
maybe you'd be ready to die too.

65
00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:07.790
You're like,
it's either escape to South Korea or die.
You know,
I,

66
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.770
I think what what should happen is I think Trump should hire Dennis Rodman and

67
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:15.340
like put like a tracking device on them and their jet skiing out in fucking the

68
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:20.341
ocean drinking and shit and it's seal team six comes in and fucking takes Kim

69
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.810
Jong Goon and slides new America gives all the North Korean internet and like

70
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.940
sets them free.
No,

71
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.600
<v 0>this is like a movie dude.
And that was Stephen Baldwin.</v>

72
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.500
<v 1>I think that there's probably a way to,
to,
to,
to,</v>

73
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.380
to chill everything.

74
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.620
<v 0>There probably is a way to shut everything out.
This is not the way,</v>

75
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.070
like launching test missiles and saying fire and fury and all that shit.
Nah,
not,

76
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.110
not chilling anything out,
but you know,

77
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.220
I don't understand what the conflict is about in the first place.

78
00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:54.990
I'm not exactly sure what everybody's angry,

79
00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:57.240
but I think because they think that we're going to bomb them.

80
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.590
And why are we going to bomb them?
That's what I was,

81
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.720
I think that we did years ago.
Right?
They hear a,
the career,
well,
North Korea,
no,

82
00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:05.720
Hiroshima was Japan.
The Asians.

83
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.830
I don't know the details,
but I know that there are different part of the world,

84
00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:15.300
but that's cool.
They'll be super psyched.
Conflate the two of them.

85
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.220
Yeah,
no,
it's,
I'm mean the,

86
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.170
we did horrible things during the Korean War to the North Koreans.

87
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.730
I mean that's literally the cause of all of this.
All the anger and all the,

88
00:05:26.731 --> 00:05:27.390
you know,

89
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.390
but that's when North Korea and South Korea were split and North Korea went

90
00:05:32.761 --> 00:05:37.170
communists and you know,
it's a,
it's all a byproduct of that.
You know,
there's,

91
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:40.620
it's,
you could read about it and actually there's a really good book called dear

92
00:05:40.621 --> 00:05:42.180
reader from Michael Malice.

93
00:05:42.181 --> 00:05:45.990
He's a guy who was on my podcast and the history of that part of the world is

94
00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:46.830
really fucked up.

95
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.420
But it's interesting because you have North Korea and then below you have South

96
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.610
Korea,
South Korea,
you have a thriving economy,
amazing electronics,

97
00:05:55.611 --> 00:06:00.390
Samsung,
they make all kinds great shit over there.
And spaz probably,
yeah,

98
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.480
on plastic surgery.
Yeah.

99
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.490
And then North Korea is just right next door to them.
Terrible dictatorship.

100
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:12.380
It's fucked up man.
Well no president has been able to,
to deal with it,

101
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:16.040
so no.
Yeah,
probably won't be able to mean.
How do you resolve that?

102
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.910
One of the things that my mouse was telling me that makes it so fucked up is

103
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:22.400
that everybody has to rat on everybody else.

104
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.350
Like say if you and I were working together,

105
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.590
we wouldn't have to go somewhere and tell someone what each one of us did wrong

106
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.553
during the day.

107
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.760
Like maybe you didn't cry hard enough when somebody died or maybe you weren't a

108
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.030
excited enough when something good happened,

109
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:41.420
he didn't cheer loud enough and they'll,
they'll rat you out for that.

110
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:42.111
And then you know,

111
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:46.040
you have to be accountable and then so they have like a culture of rats.

112
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:49.280
Everybody's ratting everybody out.
It sounds fun.

113
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.770
We don't realize how lucky we are,
you know,
to live in America

114
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.910
<v 2>[inaudible]
okay.</v>
