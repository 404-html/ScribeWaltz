1
00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.660
We should start bringing it to other people too.
Occasionally.

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:08.100
Especially when a accounts out of town cause counts.
Always busy.
Yeah,

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.390
but he brings a cheese then nothing's like the four of us though.

4
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:15.450
The chemistry with the finance.
You can't,
you can't fuck with it.
No.

5
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:19.260
It is the best and it's the most fun by far is the most fun to watch.

6
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:22.680
Fight a different dynamic.
Yeah,
but the talking over my God,

7
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:26.110
I tried to listen to it.
You did.
I tried to listen to someone.
What you do,

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.470
cause I want to know what it sounded like.
We were talking over everybody.

9
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.820
It's terrible.
Drunk and high and a long time and it was awesome.

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.870
People for whatever reason,

11
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:41.730
love those kind of chaos shows like that Alex Jones show.
They'll love chaos.

12
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.450
They'll love it.

13
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.450
They'll love a struck and stoned and an interdimensional child molesters and

14
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:50.550
fucking,
they love all that shit.
They love it off the charts.

15
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.360
Nuts that Alex Jones one though I told you I've never been a fan of his.

16
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.650
Then I watch it.
I'm like got to like them now.
People are mad at me.
For.

17
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.120
Some people are mad at me,
but you know,
there's nothing I could do about that.

18
00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:01.170
There were going to be mad at me anyway.

19
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:05.070
But one of the things that they were saying was,
you know,
fuck you for uh,

20
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.000
there were saying giving them a platform for normalizing him and like you got to

21
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:13.260
understand,
that's how I know him.
I know him like that.
That's how I know him.

22
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:17.400
I know that guy,
that guy friends.
Yes.
That guy that came on here,

23
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.420
and this is a guy that by the way on his show said he was gonna kick my ass and

24
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:24.440
break my legs and fucking all kinds of crazy shit and I want to find him in the

25
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:27.180
UFC fight.
I'm to offer him $1 million.

26
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:31.920
Like I knew I knew him.
I know the real him.

27
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.710
I'm like,
well,
we're not in front of each other.
You could say crazy shit.

28
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:38.210
And like I'm immune man.
I don't,
I don't care.
It doesn't bother me.

29
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.800
I don't care anymore.
He's doing an entertainment show.

30
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.240
He is doing entertainment but,
but when I know is the Alex Jones,
those here,

31
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:45.751
and by the way,

32
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:49.070
he was right about a lot of shit while the crazy shit that he's saying about
the,

33
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.860
about fucking human pig hybrids that they're working on those and actually

34
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.350
making human pig hybrid fetuses.
That's real.

35
00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.370
They really aren't.

36
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.730
The problem is is he throws so much shit out there at all at one time.

37
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.410
I don't know what to believe in what exactly.

38
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.650
And you got to slow down to look into all of that and you got to go slow.
Whoa,

39
00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:10.440
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
Let's take start.
Start over again.
W what?

40
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.850
What's happening on the moon?
He's for sure a little crazy.

41
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:16.710
I like him but he's,
he's crazy.

42
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.890
But I think the crazy is okay and it's entertaining and I'm not a fucking child.

43
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.300
So if you want a nerf the world and make the world so that only children can

44
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:29.100
watch everybody cause like make,

45
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:33.600
make things at their own that are safe for everyone,
including children.
Well,

46
00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:36.390
I don't want that.
I want,
I'm a discerning adults.

47
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.660
I'm pretty rational and I can figure out what's real and what's nonsense.
