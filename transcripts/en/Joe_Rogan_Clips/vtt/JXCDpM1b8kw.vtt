1
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.960
I don't eat as much as I used to.

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.290
I just feel so much better when I just skipped the middle meal and like whose

3
00:00:08.781 --> 00:00:11.860
idea was it?
Three meals a day anyway and you don't need that.
Right.

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.320
And I've found that I can live very comfortably.

5
00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:17.140
I'm not into like torturing myself.

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.630
Like I'm going to starve and nail myself to this chair.
But you know,

7
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.400
if I'm too just too distracted to work as I'm hungry I need to address that.

8
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.580
But what I found is if I just kind of don't eat a lot after a couple of days,

9
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.590
I'm like a jet in the high air where you're burning no fuel cause you're just in

10
00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:40.260
the thin air where I walked pie food going like Nah,

11
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.600
I've had like two meals in the last two and a half meals like in the last three

12
00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:49.160
days and I feel fine actually.
I feel like really bouncy.

13
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.780
Like I don't need the,
the postworkout seven minute power nap.
I,
I,

14
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:57.290
I'm feeling really good.
Do you do intermittent fasting at all?
Um,

15
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.240
yes.
On the,
the woman I work with,

16
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.350
you know Heidi,
she does that sometimes and I'll just follow her lead.

17
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.460
So she'll go,
hey,
I'm doing this.
I'll,

18
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:10.730
I'll try that because I just don't know this stuff.

19
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.420
And she knows a lot more about it than I do.
So I just do what she does.

20
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.190
And so a few years ago he got into like one meal a day.

21
00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:21.320
I was just trying it out.
No one told me to.

22
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.090
I was in India of all places and I was out all day taking photos and sweating

23
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.160
and I would eat dinner and that would be it.

24
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.970
And I would like sleep through breakfast and go back out and with my camera.

25
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.230
So dinner became my meal and the first three days of that was a little tough.

26
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.350
And then it was like I never wanted,

27
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.550
I kind of felt bad when I went back to the western boy.
I'm eating a lot of food.

28
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.310
Your body adapts.
Yeah,
well we can adapt.

29
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:49.790
You can live on pizza for the rest of your life,
very happily,
all,
you know,

30
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:51.800
whatever.
But your body really does adapt to that.

31
00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:54.650
Intermittent that time will not,
I'm saying it'll adapt to anything.

32
00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:58.550
It'll adapt to too much food and Moodle depth to like a fraction of what you

33
00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:02.510
used to eat right here.
But just,
here's what I have found.

34
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.690
When I start limiting the food,
I'm more alert.

35
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.030
My sleep is more restorative and I bounce out of bed,

36
00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:13.280
like just flying out of bed.

37
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.100
I don't have that afternoon drowsiness.

38
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.840
I just stay with it and I just feel way more buoyant and present,

39
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.890
uh,
type faster,
just concentrate more.

40
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.790
And I,
when I'm on tour,

41
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.880
it's usually I do one point something meals a day.

42
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.750
Like I'm about to leave on tour.
It'll be,
it's an evening meal post,
show

43
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.010
<v 1>myself into an eight hour feeding window and 16 hour fasting window every day</v>

44
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.520
hall.
And I've been pretty consistent with that over the last like four or five

45
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:49.020
months.
And as a,
it has a big impact man.
When you,
when I eat dinner,
you know,

46
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:52.080
say if I'm done at eight o'clock,
I just time it out.

47
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:54.900
16 hours later is when my first meal comes.

48
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:57.180
I can have a coffee in between now and then,

49
00:02:57.181 --> 00:03:00.460
but nothing with any real significant calories.

50
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.430
<v 0>I'm just having some liquid or something like that.
And that's it.</v>

51
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:07.330
And then it just,
by doing that man,
I just like,
I wake up in the morning,

52
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.420
I'm not craving breakfast.
I'm not,
I'm not even hungry.

53
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.090
My body's is totally adapted to it.
Yeah.

54
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.580
It just gives your body a chance to digest.

55
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:19.210
I think we're always in a state of feeding and your body just never has really a

56
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:22.600
chance to digest.
Lot of juggling.
You know,
the body's like,

57
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.570
as it's processing,
it's incoming.

58
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:30.400
Like really another order never gets to realize digestion.
Like,
yeah,

59
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.650
we're done.
It's always like,
you're like a cow.

60
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.890
They're always processing nutrition.
Uh,
and I,

61
00:03:37.891 --> 00:03:41.920
I wonder if that's a western model because in other parts of the world,

62
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.030
people live very differently than we do.
It just,
it is what it is.

63
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.400
And a meal.
This,

64
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:52.720
it's almost just a thing that happens now and then it's not like it's dinner

65
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:56.860
time and we're going to talk about report cards and gathering.

66
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.360
It's like the whole family works all over the city and they're going to eat,

67
00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:06.310
I think get some point where every even sleep you go to like parts like Vietnam

68
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:09.910
and people just like sleeping behind the counter of the store they work at

69
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:13.360
because they'd been there for a day and a half because mom can't come in.

70
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:16.960
So there were running the store and they sleep as this thing that you get now

71
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:20.440
and then and I think food is like that and a lot of parts of the world,

72
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:25.090
like a meal,
Eh,
uh,
the next time I eat will be the next time I eat.

73
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.500
When you go to these places,

74
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:28.630
and I know you traveled pretty much all over the world,

75
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.930
do you go out of your way to try to sample in as wide a variety as the local

76
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:38.170
cuisines?
You can,
no,
no.
Depends on where I go.

77
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.980
And I'm not that dye who just brings it all from home and I never leave home

78
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:42.814
when I'm abroad,

79
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.300
but I can't afford to eat a bad meal and be a bedridden,

80
00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:52.120
bedridden for the next day when I should be out hitting the streets,

81
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:55.510
looking at stuff.
And so I've had,
you know,
as you do,

82
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.200
you run into the bad meal where you're like hugging a tree,

83
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.630
watching the arc of vomit.
Like wow,
Linda Blair.

84
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.470
And I've done that from here to a Mayan Mar and Russia,

85
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:10.990
wherever.
I've had some bad meals.
And so when the food looks dodgy,

86
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.430
like in the interior of Africa where you pointed the meat object and go,

87
00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:17.920
what is that?
And the guy will say,
I think it's goat

88
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.410
Clif bar just because I just can't.

89
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.420
And so what I've learned to do,

90
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.850
and it's hard on your back cause it's a lot of weight.

91
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.540
I take say I'm going to be out in Africa for two weeks.

92
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.280
I bring about two meals worth of chow with me.

93
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.470
That's a lot of nuts.
A lot of clif bars,

94
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.740
a lot of like peanut butter and you know things that just don't go bad and heat

95
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.780
where I can just look at the food and gum.
No,
no,
not tonight.

96
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.810
It's going to be a handful of almonds and this and water also in parts of the

97
00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:57.070
world were waters dodgy.
You find a store,
you buy the box of water,

98
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.040
rip it open to

99
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.470
<v 1>make sure it hasn't been tampered with by the whole box.</v>

100
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:04.670
Put it in your backpack and lug 40 pounds of water for the next five days.

101
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:09.140
It sucks.
But you,
you can't be somewhere and be like,
Ay,
I'm thirsty.

102
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:12.050
And I don't know about that water cause that could go sign the,

103
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.470
you know they have these portable backpack filters and Steri pens and things

104
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:20.000
that a lot of backpack hikers they use there.
They're very small now.

105
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.610
They're very small and lightweight and you can get some,

106
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:25.100
like if you're saying in a place and you think it has dodgy water,

107
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:28.040
you can get a gravity filter.
Oh you put water.

108
00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:30.470
Like you could literally get rain water from outside in a puddle.

109
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:30.860
And I don't know.

110
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.280
A lot of people do that and they take it and they put it in this large gravity

111
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:35.630
filter and a drip down,

112
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.310
almost like it looks like someone's peeing at the bottom of this huge bag of 60

113
00:06:40.311 --> 00:06:41.390
liter bag of water,

114
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.260
but it filters at all and it allows you to drink basically puddle water.
