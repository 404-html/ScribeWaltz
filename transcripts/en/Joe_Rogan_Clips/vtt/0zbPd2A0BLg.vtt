00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:01.680
Hello

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.260
<v 1>Freak bitches.
Actors don't get a lot of that.</v>

3
00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:07.830
That's one of the reasons why the kind of shaky more shaky.
Yeah,
right.

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.100
Don't get a lot of like that testing it live in front of people.

5
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:12.380
That humility that comes with that

6
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.720
<v 0>and,
and,
and it's,
and it's tough.
I was talking to her act,</v>

7
00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:19.130
another actor and it's tough cause see I'm a comic who became an actor so I'm

8
00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:22.070
cheating.
He,
I'm saying I can go do this and I can go,

9
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.370
I'm going to be in Saint Louis tomorrow,
you know,
some jokes so I can,
you know,

10
00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:29.960
I gotta get,
I can get my thing off.
But just actors,
it's tough.

11
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.550
<v 1>Once you figured out a way to balance three careers,
you can sing too.</v>

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.820
I mean you could do anything.
You're a weird guy in that way.

13
00:00:36.821 --> 00:00:38.290
You've got a lot of weird talent yourself.

14
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.650
It's talking about Justin Bieber and Chris Brown.

15
00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:44.730
You've got some weird ability to shift to.
It's

16
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.650
<v 0>not only him,
but I've been fortunate in the fact that now things have opened up.</v>

17
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.340
Like,
you know,
back in the day like you could only do one thing.

18
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:56.610
One thing I will never forget Keenan Ivory Wayans told me,
he said,
Yo,

19
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.560
what's with the singing shit
yo you want a month?

20
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:04.750
Like I can't see you tried to sing and shit.
I would try to sing it and be like,

21
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.810
can you see them?
No,
it is real.
And grew up at Ou.

22
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:13.290
Jamie Stop Youtube funny in the face to face is too funny.

23
00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:15.350
I see wine and singing to me it's funny.

24
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.740
So I was like fuck maybe I never seen,
you know.

25
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:23.940
So I was doing of course the stand up,
you know,
doing the one the shit.

26
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.510
And then it wasn't until literally,
um,

27
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.980
I was throwing these parties at my crib and I would always throw parties for

28
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:34.770
like musical guys,
you know.
So I threw a party for puff,

29
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.610
puff comms and big party.

30
00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:41.340
It's like 2000 puffers there and it's all about him.
And I'll never forget,

31
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:45.390
he got mad at me a little bit because I would follow him and I would actually

32
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:48.810
follow him with a,
with a,
with a camera.
Because at the time,
at that time,

33
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:50.490
puff was the biggest guy in the world.
You know,

34
00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:53.110
you couldn't even get in this party.
So the way I would getting this party,

35
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.280
I show up with a camera,
like your puff,
you need to document,
document the shit.

36
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.220
What's up playboy?
I said,
yeah,
let me get that man.

37
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:01.970
Ain't nobody getting this and I,
and it wasn't back in the day with the,
you know,

38
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.820
with the camera phone,

39
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:06.480
I had the big fucking cannon that you put it on your shoulder and the light and

40
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:08.760
the shit.
I said,
let me change the battery.
Let me get all this shit.
Right.

41
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.220
So at one point I told him,

42
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.180
we were actually in Philly and he was throwing a party and he said,

43
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:19.260
you'll play boy,
this party is a million and a half dollars.
I said,

44
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.230
like two for what?
I mean,
what are you saying?
He said,

45
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.760
it cost a million and a half dollars to throw this party.
I said,
puff,
Oh my God,

46
00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:29.850
I love it.
The parties amazing.
Yes,
the mayor is here and everything.
I said,

47
00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:32.490
but that's too much money.
I said,
you come to my place in La,

48
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.200
I'll throw your party for 400 bucks that will rival this party.

49
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.330
And he got a little mad because you know,
he was like,

50
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:41.500
Yo know I'm known for this shit.
Don't front.
I said,

51
00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:45.270
and I'm not not I respect you.
I said,
but la,
I just know how to get around.

52
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.570
So he gets to La and he calls me early in the morning,
you'll play board,

53
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.990
make that shit happen.
It was a Saturday.
I said,
cool,

54
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.760
I'll go in on my phones and by 12 o'clock in my small house in Tarzana and God

55
00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:58.950
bless my neighbors that live there,
I'm no longer there.
I,

56
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.940
they wanted me to get out of it cause I was too much.

57
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.330
But the parties fevered pitch and I invited the right people.
You know,

58
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:07.990
the right girls were beautiful but not too tight.
Not too,
you know,

59
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.380
just everything was great.
The guys wouldn't know haters.
They're,
you know,
La,

60
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.090
you know,
main fucking,
I'm fucking not wanting to it that it was the right guys.

61
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:19.510
And he shows up and when he shows up,
he goes,

62
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.780
that's the girl on that TV show.
Oh,
that's the girl in the movie.
I said,
yeah,

63
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.870
yeah,
we're friends.
He's like,
we all hang out here.
So it's like,
you know,

64
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.620
it's all good and that's the girl.
I said,
yeah.
I said,
but look at the party.

65
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:32.140
I said,
look over there on the table.
I got Kentucky Fried Chicken,

66
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.300
but I put it in a nice plate.
I got Coca Cola,
but it's just in a picture.

67
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.640
I said,
we're at 280 bucks right now.
And counting,

68
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.480
I won't go for a hundred and he had the most incredible time,
right?

69
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.030
But at that party was all musical people.

70
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:50.440
And I did it for a reason at that party.
Missy Elliot,
of course,
she had her room.

71
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.450
Everybody's going crazy.
And missy Elliott.

72
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.840
I'm going into my garage and there's two guys,

73
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.960
a little guy like this and a tall guy.
The little guy goes,
Yo,
Yo,

74
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.350
it's like this all the time,
be.
I said,
yeah,
who are you?
He says,
oh,

75
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.400
we didn't have to.
Oh,
my name is Farrell.
I said,
yeah,
man,
I heard of you.

76
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:09.880
That's how long ago this was.
Wow.
So he's like,
can I say,
just go on and have it,

77
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:13.720
have a great time.
Uh,
there was another guy standing on the wall,
green jacket,

78
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.340
like a green little jumpsuit.
Nobody's talking to him.

79
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.160
Guess who was who?
Jay Z.
Nobody knew.

80
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.650
I said,
what's up man?
He's just great.

81
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.260
So Snow Jz,
you know,
no one knows.
But,

82
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.980
and now the way I got into the music,
however,

83
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.270
is that all these different parties was going on and I would have like different

84
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:43.540
musical people leave me music in my little studio that I built.

85
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.210
I went and got this great studio built in the back of my house.

86
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.640
And so one day incomes as kid,

87
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.890
backpack on jaws busted.
Who is it?
Oh,

88
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.940
it was Kanye.
Oh,
his.
John's buster from your car accident,
right.

89
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.900
Kanya and walks in.
And I said,
who's that?
They said all that said,
new mom.

90
00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:04.090
Fuck Kanye man.
He bout to beat the shit.
I said,
what did he do?
Well,
he produces,

91
00:05:04.091 --> 00:05:06.970
but he also wraps.
I said,
well,
anybody come to my house?
They got to perform.

92
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.780
So I said,
Yo man,
they say you,
you know,
you wrap it.

93
00:05:09.781 --> 00:05:12.460
He wrapped the most incredible free.
I don't know if it was free,
it wasn't Carl.

94
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:15.460
I said,
I don't know why you aren't famous.
He did it with a broken jaw.

95
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.940
He had a little little jobs,
a little swollen.
I don't think it was broken,

96
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.200
but it was a little swollen cause it wasn't too long after that accident that he

97
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:25.780
had.
Right.
And then he goes,
ah,
I,

98
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.760
I got a song dat,
dat you or you'll be gut on.

99
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.720
Ah,
I got that song.
I know you could kill it.
I was like,

100
00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:36.970
me song,
goofy face

101
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.820
from a limit.
He said,
yeah.
I said,
Oh shit.
Cool.
So we go in the back,

102
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.850
we're going to do,
I've got the studio in your bag.
So he sings,
he says,

103
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.410
the song's going to go.
She say she wants some Marvin Gaye,
some Luther Vandross.

104
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.180
So I said,
I got it.
She said she wants some,

105
00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:58.910
Marvin ain't good.
He's like,
what are you doing?
I said,
well,
I've got to put the,

106
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:01.490
you know the arm be on it.
You know what I'm saying?
I'm a real singer,
you know,

107
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:03.620
I've been singing.
He says,
I don't do that.

108
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.080
Don't just sing the song because it's hip hop.
And I said,
okay,
cool.

109
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:16.490
So I begrudgingly sung the song.
I'm thinking songs whack.

110
00:06:16.491 --> 00:06:19.680
He's not gonna make it.
So I went off,
I did a bad movie.

111
00:06:19.681 --> 00:06:24.050
I'll come back about six weeks,
eight weeks later,
that song is number one.

112
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.510
My boy goes like,
you remember that song you said,

113
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:31.100
well shit is number one in the country.
And then that's how I got into the music.

114
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:34.190
So long story longer.
It's like,
yeah,

115
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:38.000
you can do all of the things and there's a lot of actors and actresses that can,

116
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.420
you just need those opportunities.
Just like in life when your,

117
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.160
when your opportunity comes,

118
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.150
if you prepare for it now you get jumped into it and grab it.

119
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:50.990
And what I was told was by my Guy Brianne,

120
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:55.580
who does all of my music,
he founds slow jams.
He found a gold digger,

121
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.620
he found,
blame it on the alcohol.
He says,

122
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.040
you gotta Stop Singing Funny Shit and sing a real record.

123
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.040
And once you sing the real record and not say it's you singing it,

124
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.060
now you got a better goal.
So now after all of those years,

125
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.570
the people that grew up with me,
what doing,
stand up or watch a cut date,

126
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.560
they're older.
And at a young folks,
it's like

127
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.340
you'd Kanye man,
just like how,
you know the guys now going to Microsoft.

128
00:07:24.341 --> 00:07:26.350
So,
so as I get older,

129
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.480
you hope that you're blessed with opportunities and you know,
the old saying,

130
00:07:31.481 --> 00:07:34.960
but there is sort of reinvent or reintroduce yourself to people who may not know

131
00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:35.794
who you are.

132
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.060
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
