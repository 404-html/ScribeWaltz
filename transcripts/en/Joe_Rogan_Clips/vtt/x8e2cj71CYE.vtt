WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.430
Her low freak bitches,
I,
but,
but to go back to the brain warm idea,

2
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:08.160
so I coined the term not to be cute,

3
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:10.860
but to actually named this collective condition.

4
00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:13.850
I called it ostrich parasitics syndrome.
Yeah.

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.740
We've talked about this before we talk about it.
I know that that's a myth,

6
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.120
but yeah,
yeah,
that,
that,
yeah,
it's because it's become just a metaphor for yeah,

7
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:21.890
absolutely.

8
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.280
The Myth being folks that ostriches don't really stick their head and they these

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.110
exactly.
Uh,
and,
and it's,

10
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.510
it's really taken on a life of its own at this point.

11
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:33.060
I'm actually thinking of studying this scientifically,

12
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:35.490
not just as something that I talk about on my public engagement.

13
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.730
What is it that causes some people to be more likely to be parasitized by the

14
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.110
types of mindsets that would cause you to suffer from ostrich parasitic
syndrome.

15
00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:49.620
So a classic example would be,
which I guess we'll,
we'll get into

16
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.860
how much evidence do you need to see around the world that there might be some

17
00:00:55.861 --> 00:01:00.030
religious ideology that is somewhat problematic and antithetical to secular,

18
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:01.380
liberal,
modern values?

19
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.430
How much information or what is the type of information that you would need to

20
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:08.580
see before you're able to arrive to such a conclusion.

21
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.880
And so one of the things I'm thinking of doing is to formally quantify a score

22
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.360
of ops.
How much somebody suffers from,
won't be as,
as a type of mindset.

23
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.980
And what are some predictors that could help us understand who is more or less

24
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:25.920
likely to be effect the afflicted by this mindset?
Well,

25
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:29.310
there's certain people that just never want to hurt anyone's feelings,
right?

26
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.990
Except when they think that it is within their rights to attack that person

27
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:36.900
because that person is somehow or another victimizing someone else.
Right.

28
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.170
And then there'll be far more egregious than the original offense.

29
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.890
Did you know about the guy that in Canada that's getting sued?
Well,
he,

30
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:46.040
the human rights council,
um,

31
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.460
find him $12,000 because you walked into his apartment that he owned with shoes

32
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:54.420
on us because there was a Muslim family living there.
Um,

33
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.990
their lease was up and he was looking to rent the apartment.

34
00:01:57.991 --> 00:01:59.970
They stopped responding to his texts.

35
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.420
And so he opened up the apartment to show this,
uh,

36
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.780
this apartment that he owns and because he walked into a building that he owns

37
00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:11.070
with his shoes on,

38
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.310
he has to pay them $12,000 for failing to accommodate their religious practices

39
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.490
while showing their apartment to perspective tenants.
That's crazy.

40
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.380
Welcome to Canada.
We just had a thing called the motion and one oh three.

41
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:27.590
Are you familiar with this?
Look at this.
Look at this statement though.

42
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:28.231
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

43
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:33.231
But the human rights count tribunal of Ontario also found that he harassed them

44
00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:37.530
and created a poisoned housing environment.
It's right,
there you go.

45
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.460
Cause he refused to remove issues.
Some sensibilities are more equal than others,

46
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.750
but that is just what,
why is it that people are so,

47
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.290
especially in,
particularly with Muslims like that,

48
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:53.190
you'll notice that there's a lot of people that are,

49
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.450
they will accuse everyone of Islamophobia yet they'll shit on Christians.
Yeah.

50
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.620
It's really common.
Like they don't,

51
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:01.720
it's not that they believe in religious freedom,

52
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.220
it's that they have like a pet cause and the pet causes almost like being a

53
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:11.221
contrarian to a lot of like far right people who are really terrified of

54
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:14.430
Muslims.
Like they're trying to like figure out how to,

55
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.460
how to balance that out with their own ridiculous left wing version of it.
Well,

56
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:20.290
I think there are two elements to it.

57
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:24.700
One is that they're just afraid to criticize Islam just because they are greater

58
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:28.210
repercussions to do so than to criticize seventh day.
I haven't this,

59
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.290
so just from a very basic sort of survival instinct,
but I think secondly,

60
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.990
which is kind of part of the ostrich parasitics hundred will not,
speaking of,

61
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.970
there are all sort of erroneous ideas that people have been infected with.
Uh,

62
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:44.830
you know,
the,
the,
the Muslim religion is a religion for the downtrodden.

63
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.970
The Brown people,
uh,
the exotic other and so to,

64
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.120
to criticize them when they are a hapless exotic minority is simply racist and

65
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:55.181
sexist.

66
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:59.140
And people believe that even though most of the countries that these people are

67
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:02.380
coming from when they come to the west,
not only are they the majority,

68
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.930
they're almost the exclusive majority.
Right?
So,

69
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.670
so they are out of I think 56 countries that constitute the OIC,

70
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:13.930
the Organization of Islamic cooperation.
Something like 29 or 30 countries.

71
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.370
They're exclusively Islamic.
They are no longer any religious minorities.

72
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:20.440
It's in the order of 99.9 something.

73
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.190
So to argue that people who come from these countries are,
you know,

74
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.720
religious minorities,
why me?

75
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:27.670
They religious minorities when they come to the west,

76
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.210
but they're all coming from countries where not nevermind that they're the

77
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:34.990
majority.
They've never interacted with someone who did not share their faith.

78
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.440
I don't think people understand that if that happens here,

79
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.550
like you can't turn back from that without violence.
Right?
Like if,
if,

80
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.150
I mean I'm not saying that it would happen in the United States,

81
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.590
but the fact that it can happen anywhere means it can happen everywhere.

82
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.810
I mean it really can.
I mean,
it's a,
it's a,

83
00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:55.900
it's a big reach on my part to say that because there's no evidence whatsoever

84
00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:56.980
that it's going to happen here.

85
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.390
But if you really look at some of the countries that are suffering under this,

86
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.080
these really oppressive religious ideologies where women aren't allowed to
drive,

87
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:07.900
where they have to wear a covering all over their body,

88
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:12.070
that signifies that they're a part of this religious sect.
Like if that,

89
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.600
if someone tried to do that today,

90
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.710
like if you had some blonde haired blue eyed guy that made all women wear a

91
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:20.980
certain outfit and they weren't allowed to drive and they weren't allowed to

92
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:23.980
have the same rights,
how many people would be standing up for them?

93
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.530
That's incredible.
Especially if it was a new thing.

94
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.910
There's something about old things like old ideologies and legitimacy.

95
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.700
So strange.
What is that?
Uh,
while it's exactly what you said,
uh,

96
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.980
you take an idea that someone holds,
if he doesn't cloak,

97
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.590
cloak it under the robe of religion.

98
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.070
You commit them to a psychiatric institution.
If he says,
no,
no,
no,

99
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:49.240
but this belief as part of my religion,
suddenly you get a free pass.

100
00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:50.140
It's grotesque.

101
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.890
But to speak to your point about well that you are stretching about it happening

102
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:56.740
in the United States.
You're not stretching it at all.
As a matter of fact,

103
00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:58.010
I've argued,
uh,

104
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.290
<v 1>for example,
when the,</v>

105
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.330
when Trump won that if you look at a long term view of the issue of Islamic

106
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:08.140
immigration,
if,
if,
if what you focus on is,
uh,

107
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.200
do we have the proper vetting processes to stop terrorists,
isis,

108
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:15.560
terrorists from coming in?
That's a very short term view of the problem.

109
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.750
But if you recognize that societies will take often,
very,

110
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:22.410
very long time before they become Islamized.

111
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.600
It's not as though every single country that today is Islamic became

112
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:29.750
instantaneously overnight Islamic.
And some cases it wasn't very,

113
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:33.770
very quick invasion and other cases it took 500 years before the demographic

114
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:37.340
reality shifted.
And so yes,

115
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:40.670
if you look at it from the perspective of 10 20,
50 a hundred years,

116
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.590
the u s stands no threat but take a longterm view.

117
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.770
I love this quote from the,
I think it was the Taliban who said that the,

118
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:53.450
the United States have all the clocks and watches we have all the time in the

119
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:57.980
world.
In other words,
in Sharla,
eventually God willing,
we will conquer you.

120
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.680
So this is the right way to look at this issue.

121
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.120
Do you wish to have a society become more Islamized or less?

122
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.770
Let me draw another analogy.
Uh,
at the end of every day,

123
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.010
you can weigh yourself and one of three things is going to happen.

124
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.810
You've either lost weight that they,

125
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.050
your weight did not change a single ounce or you've put on weight.

126
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.100
So let's analogize this with Islam.
When Islam comes into a place,

127
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.840
either the society gets better,
nothing changes,
or it gets worse.

128
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.940
Do we have enough data at this point,

129
00:07:28.941 --> 00:07:33.940
after 1400 years to suggest that we can try to bet what will happen to the

130
00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:38.390
society?
The answer regrettably is yes.
Again,
I hate to have to preface,

131
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.201
of course,

132
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:43.040
most Muslims are lovely and peaceful and wish to simply raise their children.

133
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.630
But Islam as an ideology when it comes into a new society,
is it a good thing?

134
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.690
If yes,
let's alternate Islamic.
If no,

135
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.600
then maybe we should have an honest conversation about this and honest

136
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:57.050
conversation is what's really important because these things get so emotionally

137
00:07:57.051 --> 00:08:00.440
charged like the infamous Ben Affleck,

138
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:02.870
Sam Harris Debacle on Bill Maher show,

139
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:08.260
but that to me is a perfect example because Sam speaks in such a measured tone

140
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.450
and he's so educated about it.
He's not making these big gigantic leaps,

141
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.950
but people love to jump on him and call racism.

142
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.590
He sent me some video that I just watched the other day.

143
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:26.591
We were a bunch of people are just taking complete out of context statements,

144
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.380
attributing into him as being like,
this is what he believes on things.

145
00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:34.160
When if you listen to the full extent of the conversation,

146
00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:36.410
he's literally saying like that.

147
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:39.680
I'm going to say something here that could be taken out of context,

148
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.270
but what I'm saying is like,
imagine if someone was saying this right.

149
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.050
How do you respond to that?
And they use that as a statement.
I mean there's,

150
00:08:48.051 --> 00:08:51.440
there's so much of that going on.
There's so much.
It's so dishonest.
Well,
this,

151
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:55.920
there's this weird not me thing that they're doing.
It's they,

152
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.300
<v 0>they're,
I'm not the racist,
right.
He's the racist.
Right.
And they get very,</v>

153
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:03.780
you are racist.
Like the Ben Affleck thing.
Like he was like,

154
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:05.880
that is so gross that it's so racist.

155
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:09.990
Like instead of just discussing this conversation,

156
00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:13.050
I'm discussing this,
especially on the bill Maher show,

157
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:16.080
because that shows all those shows is not the criticized that show,

158
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:18.420
but all those shows,
we have a panel of six people.

159
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:21.270
What you see is a bunch of people waiting to say something and they'd have to

160
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:25.410
jump in and it's almost like they have to be salacious or they have to be

161
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:28.620
outrageous just to get heard.
You know,
like everyone,
it's,

162
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:33.300
it's those kinds of shows promote this sort of disingenuous communication

163
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.240
because you have to,
you can't be polite like you and I can be polite.

164
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:40.890
It's just you and I,
we can talk and we can have these long form conversations,

165
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:42.300
but on that show,

166
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:47.530
do you don't have the time to unpack what's wrong with all ideologies,

167
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.850
all things that tell you how to think.

168
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.960
Forget about whether or not you think it came from Jesus or the Prophet Mohammed

169
00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:55.950
or Joseph Smith.

170
00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:00.840
Any times there's a doctrine that tells you how to think because of some

171
00:10:00.841 --> 00:10:02.220
mystical presence,

172
00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:07.221
some God or Deity or prophet who has gotten the wisdom of the universe and you

173
00:10:07.951 --> 00:10:09.210
meant it must not question it,

174
00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:13.050
and women have to wear veils and dress up like beekeepers and I mean all that

175
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:14.190
stuff is very,

176
00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:18.510
very problematic because people are prone for whatever reason.

177
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.380
I mean some,

178
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.160
I guess it's some something that goes back to tribalism and Alpha male

179
00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:27.270
chimpanzee behavior we're prone to follow through.
I'm prone to follow leaders.

180
00:10:27.271 --> 00:10:30.830
I mean it makes it easier and that's one of the things you're seeing here while

181
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.561
it looks amazing,

182
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:36.510
is that it's one thing to attack Sam because in the game of identity politics,

183
00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.040
he scores really poorly.
Right?

184
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.930
He's a southern California and white male who doesn't speak any of the languages

185
00:10:42.931 --> 00:10:45.570
that matter,
Arabic or so on.
And his parents had money,

186
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.200
that's his parents had money.
So I've loved that.
So your parents had money,

187
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:52.680
you sinner.
Exactly.
I only recently found out maybe a year,

188
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.820
a year and a half ago when I met him last that his mother is the creator of

189
00:10:58.351 --> 00:11:01.740
golden girls is,
you know though.
No,
I didn't even know that.
Happy.
And I actually,

190
00:11:01.741 --> 00:11:05.900
I,
I just looked at one of the golden girls that was rerunning and you'll see,

191
00:11:05.901 --> 00:11:08.450
I think it's Susan Harris or something.
But anyways,
uh,

192
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.480
someone like me who comes from the Middle East who escaped that reality,

193
00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:15.720
someone like Ayaan Hirsi Ali and I had many people on my show.

194
00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.340
I don't know how much you followed,

195
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:19.830
but a lot of people who've all escaped from this world,

196
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:24.030
either they still considered themselves Muslim,
but you know,
not,
you know,

197
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:28.570
Muslim light or ex Muslims.
In many cases they will be attacked.

198
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:29.550
So imagine,
you know,

199
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.870
so there some woman who went to Wellesley college who doesn't know anything

200
00:11:33.871 --> 00:11:37.680
about Islam,
short of whatever she learned in her bullshit progressive course,

201
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.660
she would lecture to us what true Islam is.
Not The people who lived under it.

202
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:46.910
Not The people who ran away from it.
She knows better because,
so it's,
it's,

203
00:11:46.911 --> 00:11:49.860
it's really,
it's grotesque.
It's infuriating.
It's stunning.

204
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:54.090
And it's also confusing because like,
when,
when you them do it,
like,
uh,

205
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.480
I mean anytime someone goes so far overboard that objective reasoning is out the

206
00:11:58.481 --> 00:12:00.280
window and you're,
you know,

207
00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:04.210
you're so committed to whatever position that you're in that you can't look at

208
00:12:04.211 --> 00:12:05.560
both sides of it.
I mean,

209
00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:10.561
I could see why a lot of religious traditions will be comforting to people,

210
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:14.040
remind them of where they came from,
give them pride of their homeland.

211
00:12:14.041 --> 00:12:15.820
We give them a personal good feeling.

212
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.730
They're connected to some sort of an ancient tradition.
Right.

213
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:24.030
As long as it's not a pressing other human beings and there's gotta be some,

214
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:28.360
I mean I actually cultural patterns of behavior that people do,

215
00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:32.830
like celebrations like October fest or something like that.
Those things,

216
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.070
you know,

217
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.640
promote some sort of a pride like I guess a pride in Germany and their beer

218
00:12:36.641 --> 00:12:40.720
making and all that stuff without oppressing people,
you know?

219
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.451
<v 1>But by the way,</v>

220
00:12:41.451 --> 00:12:46.451
this is a good segue to what you're talking about is something that is upsetting

221
00:12:47.511 --> 00:12:49.060
me these days increasingly so.

222
00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:54.061
So some people are now trying to draw a distinction between Islam and Islamism.

223
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:58.130
The reason why I mentioned this is because Islam has two elements.

224
00:12:58.131 --> 00:13:01.160
There's a spiritual part,
right?
Which is,
you know,

225
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.640
kind of like your October fest prayed this way,

226
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.950
believe in a god and a mono fiesta,
God and so on.

227
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:12.580
But then within Islam is a much larger component of politics,

228
00:13:14.361 --> 00:13:18.080
political Islam.
So when you say something like,
well,
you know,

229
00:13:18.081 --> 00:13:22.700
we should be attacking Islamism as if it's something that is outside of Islam,

230
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:27.260
that's simply false Islam.
Islam is Islam,
right?
Ird the one,

231
00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:31.610
the prime minister of Turkey.
And I can quote many other,
uh,

232
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:35.480
Islamic experts said,
Islam is Islam.

233
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:40.130
The term moderate Islam Islamism and all these other qualifiers are nonsensical.

234
00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.031
Now,

235
00:13:41.031 --> 00:13:45.800
the reason why that upsets me is because [inaudible] grants people a false sense

236
00:13:45.801 --> 00:13:49.340
of security and hope,
you know,
Islam is wonderful,

237
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:54.020
but we need to attack this separate thing called Islamism.
Well,
from day one,

238
00:13:54.021 --> 00:13:56.810
1400 years ago,
Islam was Islam,
Islam.

239
00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.060
Now that doesn't mean that there isn't a spiritual element.

240
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.470
That doesn't mean that most Muslims just want to practice the spiritual part,

241
00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:08.980
but there is no set of doctrines and a separate book called radicalized Islam,

242
00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:13.430
Islam.
It all comes from the same texts.
It comes from the Quran,

243
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.860
it comes from the head east,
and it comes from the Sierra,

244
00:14:15.861 --> 00:14:17.630
the biography of Muhammad.
So,

245
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.960
so this kind of false narrative that people are promulgating so that they seem

246
00:14:23.091 --> 00:14:27.680
as though they're not frontally attacking a religion while laudable.

247
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:31.880
While Nice,
I get that reflex,
it's false.
And so again,

248
00:14:31.881 --> 00:14:36.050
to go back to our point of talking,
honestly,
we need to talk honestly,

249
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:39.680
there is only Islam.
Some people choose to practice it fully.

250
00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.110
Some people choose to ignore the ugly part,

251
00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.800
but there is no such thing as Islamism.
Islam,
Islam is part of Islam.

252
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.130
<v 0>Now you're a person that goes out of your way to say,
no,</v>

253
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.610
we're not talking about the kind

254
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.970
<v 1>sweet Islamic people that just want to raise their children now.</v>

255
00:14:55.971 --> 00:15:00.971
So how do you sort of manage those two ideas that they're the same?

256
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.150
Like when the term radical Islam gets thrown around,
right?

257
00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:10.151
So radical Islam simply means I really take my Islam seriously,

258
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:15.740
right?
It's,
it's,
it's,
let's draw us a silly analogy.
If I don't eat pork,

259
00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:20.720
uh,
my radical Jew,
or am I a Jew right now,
I happen to be Jewish.

260
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:25.520
I simply ignore the kosher edict that says don't eat pork.
That does.

261
00:15:25.521 --> 00:15:28.220
Why do you do that though?
Because in my case,

262
00:15:28.221 --> 00:15:33.221
I simply identify as Jewish in the sense that at Judaism as a multi attribute

263
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:37.430
identity,
it includes a shared history,
shared lineage,
sh,

264
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:41.360
sh kind of a race.
It's what some could argue it's array.

265
00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:43.490
So it's considered in a lot of people's ideas.

266
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.320
So I could still in the same way that you might identify as coming from Boston

267
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:52.160
and there's a shared history from all people who grew up around the time that

268
00:15:52.161 --> 00:15:56.570
you grew up in Boston and there was a sense of affiliation and tribalism,

269
00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:01.700
would that reality being Jewish as far as I'm concerned and for most Jews is

270
00:16:01.701 --> 00:16:06.500
exactly that.
We don't necessarily take the religious elements very seriously.

271
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.460
Now that doesn't mean that we are practicing a light Judaism or non radical

272
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:16.070
Judaism.
We're simply ignoring those parts of Judaism that we choose to ignore.

273
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.890
So there is no such thing as radical Islam.

274
00:16:18.891 --> 00:16:21.440
There are no books called radical Islam.

275
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.670
There is a set of doctrines called Islam and then I could do what's called

276
00:16:25.671 --> 00:16:29.960
cafeteria Islam,
which is I pick and choose the parts that I wished to adhere to.

277
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:32.630
So again,
the discourse is a false narrative.

278
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:37.990
I understand the reason for it because people find that rather Gauche to attack

279
00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:41.990
frontally religion at least to attack Islam.
So they have to,

280
00:16:41.991 --> 00:16:46.820
I call this the the the ism magic eucharistic rite.
You add as him to something,

281
00:16:46.821 --> 00:16:51.710
it makes it bad.
Islam is good,
Islam,
Islam is bad for you.

282
00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:52.040
Um,

283
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.220
I would like to defend you if there's a lot of people that are listening right

284
00:16:55.221 --> 00:16:59.630
now or offer up some,
not,
not even defend you,
but offer up some information.

285
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.640
Like as you grew up in a place where being Jewish was lethal.

286
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.580
I mean you,
your life was threatened certainly when the civil war broke out.

287
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.650
Prior to that you could live in Lebanon as a Jew.

288
00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.600
People knew that we were Jewish,
but know your place Jew.
That by the way,

289
00:17:17.601 --> 00:17:19.910
is something that I explained when discussing,

290
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.620
and I'm not sure if we've discussed this on the show,

291
00:17:21.621 --> 00:17:25.330
but it might be worth repeating if we discussed your past and Lebanon,
how you,

292
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.720
yeah.
Okay,
so do you know what a dummy is?
Have you heard that term?
Yeah.
Right.

293
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.530
You,
you explained it,
but please do again,
just Soso at them.

294
00:17:32.531 --> 00:17:37.531
Me As a third class citizen comes out of Koranic edicts that basically said that

295
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:43.070
when Islam comes into a society,
you basically have three choices.

296
00:17:43.071 --> 00:17:45.980
If you're not a Muslim,
you could either convert,

297
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:50.400
you could either get killed or you are people of the book,

298
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.170
meaning Christians and Jews,

299
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.870
meaning people are the book that you're also monotheistic.

300
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:56.610
You're also from an Abrahamic faith,

301
00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.650
then you could live as it [inaudible] and then me as a protected class protected

302
00:18:01.651 --> 00:18:04.740
and quotes we tolerate you.
And in order to tolerate,

303
00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:09.741
you were going to remind you repeatedly of your subservient position.

304
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.980
Now at different points across the last 1400 years,

305
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.900
that mechanism was either instituted very forcefully or more lightly.

306
00:18:18.901 --> 00:18:20.550
So in the context of Lebanon,
which is,

307
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:24.090
which was a very progressive and modern country in the Middle Eastern context,

308
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.560
there wasn't somebody knocking on our door and levying the Zizia pay us or else

309
00:18:28.561 --> 00:18:29.730
we're going to rape your daughters.

310
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:34.820
But you didn't wear a big star of David because that might be construed as

311
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.340
inflammatory.
Just like the,
the example that you started off the show,

312
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:42.600
you're hurting our sensibilities by pushing your Judaism on us,
right?

313
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.460
So your,
your status,
the not always have been,

314
00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.780
uh,
threatened in that my head is going to come off at any minute.
Right?

315
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:54.030
My parents grew up and lived there.
They didn't die.

316
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.240
But once the civil war broke out,

317
00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.910
then it became lethally dangerous to be Jewish.

318
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:01.560
I think we were going to be executed.
We left.

319
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:06.710
So you never know when we're going to go from tolerating you to off with the

320
00:19:07.651 --> 00:19:11.310
heads.
And that's been the history for the past 1400 years.

321
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:15.270
And so again,
when people think,
but Islam is not that bad.

322
00:19:15.271 --> 00:19:17.270
Look and under Lucilia,
uh,

323
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:22.050
Jews and Christians and Muslims used to walk around hand in hand and in Spain

324
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.460
around the 15th,
16th century.
Bologna,
yes.

325
00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:30.060
People were not being beheaded every day,
but you knew your place.

326
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.560
That's not equality.

327
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:37.350
<v 0>And it's kind of interesting when you talk about this idea about how people are</v>

328
00:19:38.921 --> 00:19:43.000
reluctant to criticize Islam because they're worried about the repercussions of

329
00:19:43.001 --> 00:19:43.690
this.

330
00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:48.690
It kind of speaks to how rare it is that people do violate those principles in

331
00:19:50.591 --> 00:19:51.460
those countries.

332
00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:55.690
Because if you do have a culture that's 99% Islamic,

333
00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.190
especially if they go by the book,
like every step of the way,

334
00:20:00.191 --> 00:20:04.030
like there's not going to be a lot of people that are stepping on the line for

335
00:20:04.031 --> 00:20:06.430
fear of the horrific repercussions.

336
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.190
Now psychologically in this country,

337
00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.070
you're seeing that for some strange reason,

338
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:16.960
a emerging from the left and emerging from a lot of like really progressive

339
00:20:16.961 --> 00:20:21.961
colleges and universities where they want to be almost the first ones to step up

340
00:20:22.451 --> 00:20:26.830
and say,
don't criticize this one particular religion,

341
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:32.010
which is very odd because it's the most regressive.
It's unbelievable.
It's,

342
00:20:32.011 --> 00:20:32.531
it's very,

343
00:20:32.531 --> 00:20:37.300
it's a really strange position to be a progressive who's reinforcing the

344
00:20:37.301 --> 00:20:42.301
ideologies of a regressive culture that's very ancient.

345
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:46.720
<v 1>But what's incredible is that they'll come up with ways to defend this
cognitive.</v>

346
00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:50.430
Hence that's part of the ostrich parasitic syndrome that I was mentioning.

347
00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:53.900
What are,
what are some ways that they defend?
So example,
uh,

348
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.880
and to just give you a few manifestations of ostrich logic.
Uh,

349
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:03.370
my friend Mohammed is a very nice guy and he drinks and he fornicated and he's

350
00:21:03.371 --> 00:21:04.204
very liberal.

351
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:09.330
So the idea then becomes that as long as I can identify a single exemplar of a

352
00:21:09.821 --> 00:21:13.510
Islamic person who does not otherwise,
uh,

353
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.220
adhere to what Islam dictates,
then it's not true that Islam is bad.

354
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:21.910
Now this is,
this is a manifestation of a more general cognitive bias,

355
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:25.710
which goes like this.
If I walk into class and I say,
look,
uh,
you,

356
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.210
homo sapiens are sexually dimorphic,

357
00:21:28.211 --> 00:21:30.610
they are an eight sex differences between the two sexes.

358
00:21:30.611 --> 00:21:33.940
Men are bigger than women.
Someone will put up their hand and say,

359
00:21:33.941 --> 00:21:38.320
but my aunt Linda is taller than my uncle Joe.
Oh Gee,
Darwin is dead,
right?

360
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.070
So they,

361
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:44.070
they identify a singular exemplar that is supposed to falsify a statement that

362
00:21:44.861 --> 00:21:47.260
is only true at the population level.
So here's,

363
00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:50.800
so that's one example of why Mohammad is nice.
Therefore,
Islam is nice.

364
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.080
Here's a second example.
Uh,

365
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.480
they point to a particular historical context where Jews lived in Islamic

366
00:21:58.481 --> 00:21:59.710
countries and weren't killed Hae.

367
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:02.380
But God said you lived in Lebanon and you still have your head.

368
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.240
There were a torque that I usually give as well until they were going to cut off

369
00:22:07.241 --> 00:22:10.990
my head.
But secondly,
Jeffrey Dahmer,
if you take,

370
00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:15.130
I think he was guilty of 17 uh,
uh,
murders.

371
00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:20.490
If you take the number of days that he lived as an adult until he was caught as

372
00:22:21.431 --> 00:22:23.860
a percentage of the days that he killed somebody,

373
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:28.210
99 point whatever percent of the days.
Jeffrey Dahmer is a lovely guy.

374
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:33.040
So it's unfair for you to say that Jeffrey Dahmer is a mean guy given that 99%

375
00:22:33.041 --> 00:22:33.874
of the time he's nice.

376
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:38.830
So what you have to basically do is take each of these ostrich logic arguments

377
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:43.210
and analogize how the Arctic they are.
But it's very exhausting because the bent,

378
00:22:43.211 --> 00:22:43.691
as you said,

379
00:22:43.691 --> 00:22:48.691
of all these progressive's is to do whatever they can to protect the ideology.

380
00:22:48.911 --> 00:22:53.740
And so it becomes exhausting to consistently have to try to fight through all

381
00:22:53.741 --> 00:22:57.500
the clutter.
And it's not a thought that it's,

382
00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.990
it's not something that is structured with objective reasoning.

383
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.790
It's something that's structured with their own particular ideology that does

384
00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:11.791
not want to criticize this one segment of the human population that they think

385
00:23:11.831 --> 00:23:14.350
is being persecuted.
Right?
And meanwhile,

386
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.950
if you think about throughout currently in the world,

387
00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:23.180
which ideology persecutes the most number of other people.
So if,

388
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:27.850
if you talk about bloody borders,
right?
Islam has fought with Buddhists,

389
00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:32.710
Islam fights with animus Islam,
fights with Jews,
Islam fights with Christians,

390
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.160
Islam fights with Tibetan monks,
right?
So in other words,

391
00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:40.510
Islam doesn't necessarily make for very good neighbors.
Why?

392
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:41.710
Because again,

393
00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:45.320
not withstanding the fact that most Muslims are lovely and just want to raise

394
00:23:45.321 --> 00:23:48.470
their kids Islam as a supremacist ideology,

395
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:53.500
it basically says that the world is meant to all be United under the flag of a

396
00:23:54.251 --> 00:23:57.140
law.
Now,
some people take that seriously,
others don't.

397
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.750
But the doctrines of Islam are very clear.

398
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.330
We should all submit to Islam.

399
00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:06.890
So even if 95% of Muslims don't adhere to that t tenant,

400
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:11.270
if only 5% do,
that means we're always going to have friction.

401
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:16.190
In some cases it'll be like Lebanon.
By the way,
I've predicted that in Europe,

402
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:17.360
this is on record.

403
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.770
We can probably find that that in Europe within 15 2025 50 years,

404
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.190
we're going to have Lebanon all over the place and now it's starting to happen,

405
00:24:25.191 --> 00:24:29.760
right?
At one point,
we were having daily attacks all over Europe.
So,

406
00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.950
so again,
if you're going to increase Islamic immigration to the West,

407
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.000
of course most people are nice and just want to escape to a better work.

408
00:24:38.001 --> 00:24:41.840
But are you willing to take the risks for what's about to happen?

409
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.860
Are you willing to accept people whose cultural and religious values are

410
00:24:45.861 --> 00:24:48.470
perfectly antithetical to yours?
So example,

411
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.280
if you do pew surveys from around the Middle East or Islamic countries about

412
00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:56.030
your views on Jews,

413
00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:01.070
while you'll get things like 95 to 99% Jew hatred.
So if I am,

414
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.200
if I'm a Canadian Jew,
right,

415
00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.470
and I see that 50,000 Syrians are going to come in,

416
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:11.150
is it that I'm filled with hatred towards Syrians or am I simply someone who

417
00:25:11.151 --> 00:25:15.440
calculates the testicle irregularities and basically says that out of 50,000

418
00:25:15.441 --> 00:25:20.060
people,
if 95% have endemic Jew hatred as part of their identity,

419
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.690
do I have a right to be concerned about this?
I,
I'm not worried about Haitians.

420
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.590
They're black people.
I'm not racist.
I'm not worried about the Vietnamese.
Right.

421
00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:31.370
I'm worried about the cultural and religious baggage that you bring in.

422
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:36.530
What about your views towards cliteracy or homosexuality or a religious

423
00:25:36.531 --> 00:25:41.150
minorities or,
or black dogs?
Darwin forbid,
if you're a black dog,

424
00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.330
you're not,
I mean,
Muhammad hated dogs,

425
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:48.830
but he particularly hated black dogs.
Uh,
so again,

426
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:51.760
so what do they do at black dog?
Well,
go,

427
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:55.540
go on and you'll see some pretty ugly animal cruelty.
Uh,

428
00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:57.980
they're not very tolerant towards dogs.
Uh,

429
00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:01.730
if you touch a dog before you're heading to prayer,
uh,

430
00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.940
this is called an measures.
It's impure by the way.
The Kuffar,

431
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.320
the non Muslims are also nudges.
They're there.

432
00:26:08.321 --> 00:26:13.160
They're there as in pure as urine and blood and sperm and feces.

433
00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:18.460
So should I feel bad that there is an ideology that considers me and in pure

434
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.990
quality now does that mean that all Muslims are like that?
Of course not.

435
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:28.370
99% of the Muslims I've met have been lovely and many of them are my friends.

436
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.550
But we should be able to talk about what's inside those books.

437
00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:36.320
And those books are not radical Islam.
They're Islam.
Well,
let me ask you this.

438
00:26:36.321 --> 00:26:40.400
What's the alternative like save for Syrian refugees?
I mean any kind,

439
00:26:40.401 --> 00:26:44.250
caring person who has for our fellow human

440
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:48.270
<v 0>beings,
these people fleeing and sees the horrific conditions that they're,</v>

441
00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:52.410
that they're confronted with in their own country and they really don't have a

442
00:26:52.411 --> 00:26:55.380
lot of options and they're trying to escape to the west.
What,

443
00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.680
what are the options?
What do you do?
There are no clear answers.

444
00:26:58.681 --> 00:27:03.300
I would certainly say you first placed the people who are most at risk and those

445
00:27:03.301 --> 00:27:07.290
societies on in the front of the queue.
So you bring the Yazidi women,

446
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.960
you'll bring the Christians who are being persecuted women.

447
00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:14.070
But what about the father?
If the dad is with the wife and the children,

448
00:27:14.071 --> 00:27:17.940
you can't just have the father stay back behind the tent and you let the mom go

449
00:27:17.941 --> 00:27:20.070
to Toronto with the kids.
No,
fair enough.

450
00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:25.050
What I was saying though is that let people who are non-Islamic who are fleeing

451
00:27:25.051 --> 00:27:28.650
those areas and the front of the queue first,
but isn't that,

452
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.920
isn't that religious persecution?
I mean,

453
00:27:31.921 --> 00:27:35.820
or at the very least it's prejudice,
right?
I mean you're,
you're,

454
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:40.230
you're singling people out because of their ideology or because of what religion

455
00:27:40.231 --> 00:27:40.621
they're from,

456
00:27:40.621 --> 00:27:44.610
not because of their past behavior or any predictors whatsoever about their

457
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.690
future behavior.

458
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:50.720
But we do have some statistical irregularity about what types of values those

459
00:27:50.731 --> 00:27:54.180
guys are going to come with.
So I'm not suggesting we closed the door.
Right.

460
00:27:54.181 --> 00:27:57.330
So wouldn't that in a way,
I mean,
just to play devil's agitation,

461
00:27:57.331 --> 00:28:02.331
wouldn't that in a way kind of put the Muslims in Toronto who do immigrant,

462
00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:06.240
which would have picked that city who tried to immigrate to Canada in the same

463
00:28:06.241 --> 00:28:09.480
sort of a position that your family was in in Lebanon,

464
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:12.690
where you were hiding the fact that you were Jews.

465
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:17.850
No one has an inalienable right to integrate anywhere.
Correct.

466
00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:20.940
So if you wish to immigrate to the West,

467
00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:26.130
then leave every single syllable that constitutes a belief,

468
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.020
attitude,
position,

469
00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:32.790
value that is contrary to ours at the door and then welcome in my brother.

470
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.331
But man,

471
00:28:33.331 --> 00:28:37.740
isn't that a crazy thing to say to someone who's entire life and their ideology

472
00:28:37.741 --> 00:28:41.820
is a big part of their identity and who they are,

473
00:28:41.821 --> 00:28:43.320
like how they view the world.

474
00:28:43.321 --> 00:28:47.070
So that's the structure for which they interface with other human beings.

475
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:48.750
But if those values,
so let,

476
00:28:48.751 --> 00:28:52.470
let's suppose I agree with you in a way I agree with you overall.

477
00:28:52.471 --> 00:28:55.440
When I talk about the entire human population that it would be wonderful if we

478
00:28:55.441 --> 00:28:58.470
did that.
But from individual to individual,

479
00:28:58.471 --> 00:29:01.800
we know about the trials and tribulations that people go through on a day to day

480
00:29:01.801 --> 00:29:06.801
life and religious freedom and religious ideology in many cases helps people get

481
00:29:09.001 --> 00:29:12.570
through the pains of life.
It helps them get through the struggles.

482
00:29:12.571 --> 00:29:14.100
I'm not saying that it's rational,

483
00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:19.290
but I am saying that in many ways it's a scaffolding for their own personal

484
00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:21.030
behavior.
Got It.
Uh,

485
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:26.300
you would have to then ensure that you'll religious practice is exclusively

486
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.090
practice privately.

487
00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:35.070
Never should there ever be an intrusion into the public sphere.
No.

488
00:29:35.071 --> 00:29:38.010
Asking for prayer rooms at the university.

489
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:42.070
They example that you gave is the slight creeping jihad,
right?

490
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.920
<v 1>It's the slow.
It's uh,</v>

491
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:48.070
so my next book is called tentatively might change death of the West by a

492
00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:51.160
thousand cuts,
right?
That's the idea that when you take,
again,

493
00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:52.660
a parable of the frog,

494
00:29:52.661 --> 00:29:55.660
when you put it in boiling water and you do it very slowly,
the frog,

495
00:29:55.661 --> 00:29:59.020
if you do it very,
very slowly,
if it falls below a just noticeable difference,

496
00:29:59.021 --> 00:30:02.770
it doesn't notice that the temperature is rising until it's too late and it

497
00:30:02.771 --> 00:30:03.670
boils to death.
Right?

498
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:07.420
So this idea of just noticeable difference is something that's very important in

499
00:30:07.421 --> 00:30:12.220
this conversation.
We're not going to get Islamized overnight,
but Egypt,

500
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.670
before it became Islamic,
used to be non Islamic.

501
00:30:15.671 --> 00:30:18.910
Once upon a time today it's about 10% Coptic Christians.

502
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:23.980
Turkey is now 99% Islamic.
One day it wasn't Iran.

503
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.440
The Great Persian empires were not Islamic.
Today,

504
00:30:26.441 --> 00:30:27.880
it's almost exclusively Islamic.

505
00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:32.740
So the United States and Canada are not going to become uh,
Islamic,
uh,

506
00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:36.040
you know,
in the next 10 years.
But give it enough time,

507
00:30:36.041 --> 00:30:41.041
have a long enough view of history and I worry about your grandchildren and

508
00:30:42.191 --> 00:30:45.940
mine.
Uh,
and so we,
that's how you have an honest conversation.

509
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.280
And I'm not sure what the answer is.
One possibility,

510
00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:51.820
which I've discussed with folks on my show who are trained lawyers,

511
00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:56.890
is that there are provisions in the law,
at least in the United States,

512
00:30:56.891 --> 00:31:00.100
to declare an ideology as being seditious,
right?

513
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:05.140
So in the same way that you could say that Nazi-ism is seditious to our values

514
00:31:05.141 --> 00:31:08.410
or communism,
they are elements of Islam,

515
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:13.450
the nonspiritual parts that it doesn't take Einstein to recognize that they are

516
00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:18.570
perfectly antithetical to every single value that you and I would hold dear as

517
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:22.510
Westerners.
So like what,
what would be some of those values?

518
00:31:22.511 --> 00:31:24.430
So take for example shallow,
right?

519
00:31:24.431 --> 00:31:28.240
Which is the Islamic law by which you organize society.

520
00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:34.630
The first premise of Islamic law is that the,
uh,
crime,

521
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:40.200
its severity and its punishment depends on the identity of the perpetrator and

522
00:31:40.961 --> 00:31:41.710
the victim.

523
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:45.130
So imagine the idea and the American constitution that justice is blind.

524
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:49.000
Well that is already violated as the most fundamental tenant of Sharia law.

525
00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:51.700
If a Muslim kills a Jew,
it's very,

526
00:31:51.701 --> 00:31:55.960
very different crime than if a Jew kills a Muslim.
You can just go,

527
00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:57.880
go look up reliance of the traveller,

528
00:31:57.881 --> 00:32:01.360
which is the English translation of Sharia law.

529
00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:05.740
And you'll see all these things.
So why should we tolerate this kind of stuff?

530
00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:10.120
Right?
Come in my Muslim brothers,
but keep the stuff that you,

531
00:32:10.121 --> 00:32:13.540
yourself escaped from out of our country.
We don't want it.

532
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.710
And if you keep it out,
come in and let's grow together and hug it out.

533
00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.200
But why should I be tolerant towards the intolerable?
I,

534
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:23.380
I agree with you in theory,

535
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:27.490
but I think the problem is as soon as you tell someone to not follow certain

536
00:32:27.491 --> 00:32:30.940
aspects of their ideology,
those aspects become even more attractive.

537
00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:35.780
<v 0>And especially if they consider the west to be decadent and filled with sin and</v>

538
00:32:35.781 --> 00:32:40.700
fornicating and drinking and all the,
all the things they think of disgusting.

539
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.170
And then these people are the ones who are telling you that you can't follow the

540
00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:49.250
word of God has brought down by the profit from up on high.

541
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.630
It becomes even more attractive to them.
So what do we do?
What?

542
00:32:53.631 --> 00:32:57.260
So what's your trucks?
Psychedelic drugs.
Everyone gets on mushrooms.

543
00:32:57.261 --> 00:32:59.840
And I'm kidding.
Not Kidding.
I really,

544
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:05.020
I really think you need transcendent experiences to escape from the day to day

545
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:10.070
vibration of normal life.
How about just the commitment to reason and science?

546
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.750
It would be wonderful if we could do that,

547
00:33:11.751 --> 00:33:16.310
but people are so terrified of death and they're so terrified of the unknown.

548
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.040
And they're so terrified of not having structure.

549
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:23.830
People love having ideological structure that they can govern their life by.

550
00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.673
Yeah.

551
00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:33.820
<v 2>Okay.</v>
