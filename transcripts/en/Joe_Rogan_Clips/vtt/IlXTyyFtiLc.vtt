00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.200
So when I was,

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.490
I was having some pretty good thoughts on this acid and some different paths.

3
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.420
The killers,
by the way,
I fucking killed it.
Mm.
Um,
sob,

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.320
you see stuff in like when you're out there on psycho dog,
so a truth,

5
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.850
I call them universal truths where you just like,
yes,
that is real.
That is right.

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.440
100%.
And it's hard to bring that shit back into this realm,
you know,

7
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:24.480
to understand it.
It's trying to get us kicked off of Youtube.

8
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.540
It's passing car.
So it's hard when you come back to be like,
oh,

9
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:33.780
I saw the truth of something and then it's like,
and you can't express it.

10
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:35.160
And when people come back,
when they're around you,

11
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:37.290
they say something and you're like,
what?
And they're like,

12
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:39.240
they realized I get frustrated.
They're not saying it right.

13
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.370
And then it slowly going away.
So when I was there in that place,

14
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.320
sometimes I try to remember like when you get back,
say this to this person,

15
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.340
so that state told me to tell you that m and m is one of the real estate MCS.

16
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.790
I'm not going to argue with it.
I don't know what exactly it means,

17
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.080
but it was like,
does that could be a funny bit,
dude,

18
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.400
there's a funny bit in there like about how like some things are just in the

19
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:18.450
moment.
They seem so profound and then I'll be like,

20
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.300
what the fuck is wrong with me?
And my was one of the realest MCS.

21
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.050
Well I would agree with that.
I would say he's very,
very real.

22
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.330
It seems fairly real.
Yeah.
And as I heard it,
I was like,

23
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:33.690
that's going to sound dumb in the real world.
But I was like,
all right,

24
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.230
bet music awards thing he did where he will like freestyle,
right?

25
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.950
Well No,
some people liked it,
some people liked it.
The anti Trump thing,

26
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.170
everybody gets old artists get old.
But he was,
you know,

27
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.850
he was angry and he had all of his friends around him.
Yeah.

28
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.811
That was the weird thing.

29
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:57.930
Like why all those dudes just standing around kissing up?
No,
those,

30
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.480
they're all just hanging around these cars like in a circle.

31
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.110
They're all waiting while m and m wraps.
So he's got like all these,

32
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.190
it's the rap cypher.
That's what they all take turns.
Oh really?

33
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.670
They all did it turn you.
But where's the other ones?
The videos.

34
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.450
The other guys too.
I was like,
Oh,
mine was far better.
One guy steps forward.

35
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.230
I need to understand rap culture better.
I definitely almost said rape culture,

36
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.180
you know,
they go hand in hand to be Iti award shows.

37
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.130
That's how they do it.
They did at the bet awards show.

38
00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:29.110
It's like a thing where they find it.
I'll fucking parking lot and go do it.

39
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.580
That different groups have different labels maybe would have taken to put up

40
00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:38.590
their own guys.
It's called keeping it street.
Oh really?

41
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.510
That's interesting actually are not street.
You don't know anything.

42
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.670
That's why they had to tell you that.
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.790
And was one of the real estate MCS.
I already knew.
He keeps it street.
But uh,

44
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.180
that thing was,
it was interesting.
It's like when people,
you know,

45
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.910
when you create this big explosion,

46
00:02:56.911 --> 00:03:00.820
this attack on someone from some that that's always fascinating to me to watch

47
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:04.660
that go down.
Like,
what's someone doing here?
Like what?
What's happening here?

48
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.400
What's,
what are you,
what is your support?
What was your take on it?

49
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.560
It wasn't as best work.
Right,
right.
You know,
I mean,

50
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.240
I think he's an amazing rapper.

51
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:17.920
Like some of his shit from the past is fucking incredible freestyle.
Well,

52
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.990
first of all,
I'm not feeling that cold chain.

53
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.110
Jamie's like,
but that was doing styles anymore.

54
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.630
It's not nothing to really freestyle.
It's just not,

55
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.400
I don't even hear it was freestyle.
Things are east.

56
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.370
I feel like you write up a lot of those.
Oh yeah.
It's all good.
Again,

57
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.600
it's all practiced.
Matt.
I liked the Cadillac in the back.
I'll tell you that.

58
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.960
I've got a boner for that lack on the right.
Yeah.
That looks like,

59
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:45.690
what is that like a 70 something Cadillac that things fucking beautiful.
Oh,

60
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.180
I love those things.
I don't give a fuck about this wrap with that.

61
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:53.440
Cadillac is the shit.
I got a boner for old cars,
dude.

62
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.330
I'm one of those old dudes that likes old music and old cars.

63
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.900
Do you see that?
That rap where it's like a,
I forgot who it was,

64
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:04.870
but it was like sang from the white point of view about what performance black

65
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:07.780
people,
and then from the black point of view,
as far as with white people,

66
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.530
that's a video is somebody like lips.
I can pretty well,
it's,

67
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.590
I'm like redneck Dude,
sorry.
Black people always complained about this and this,

68
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:17.650
and then it goes back.
Hmm.
I forgot who it is.
Young something.

69
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:23.440
But the problem with black people and white people is that people say black

70
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:26.230
people and white people.
I said just people.
Yeah.
Instead of just people.
