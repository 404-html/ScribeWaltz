WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.950
Say,
who are they?
They're scientists cults who were based on uh,

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.510
your uh,
psychic ability,
uh,

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.370
and on your Iq and then on your commitment to the program.

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.660
And so the program starts with we go and check black people with syphilis for

5
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:22.920
greater costs or will you do research programs on babies where we tell poor

6
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:27.740
women,
uh,
that Oh your baby died right when we're born we're,

7
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.270
we'll keep the baby alive and sometimes killed himself on his harvest.

8
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:33.210
Them sometimes do experiments on them.
That's why they've not a lot.

9
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:36.510
A lot of nurses have noticed now that the baby's disappear at birth and I tell

10
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:38.370
him,
oh your baby die.
That's why the governor said,

11
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.250
who's actually organ harvesting doctor?
He goes,

12
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.090
we keep the babies in love and have a discussion.

13
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.770
They are getting caught now cause we'd be compartmentalized leading me.

14
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.140
I'm confused what you're sensing.
How just never rinsed.
Yeah.

15
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.430
What you saying about babies?
Like what did they do with babies?
You,

16
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:59.040
you saw the governor of Virginia say we keep babies alive after they're born and

17
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:03.270
kill them.
Right.
Well I didn't see that.
I am very,

18
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.930
very concerned with late term abortions.

19
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.840
Post-Birth Joe,
do you understand?

20
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.120
Post-Birth how much money do you think they get?
Seven and a half pound baby.

21
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.910
They can keep alive for two weeks and Mama doesn't know.

22
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.080
So if they can register the organs and get betters bleeding me,

23
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.750
your DNA can make 500,000 saying they kill on the spot only gets 50 grand.

24
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.210
But even saying that they take the baby from the mother and the mother doesn't

25
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:36.740
know that the baby's alive.
Yeah.
You know how they engineered tomatoes?

26
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.580
The last on the shelf?
Yes.
You can pull all this up.

27
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.090
California's past.
It should've be Virginia.

28
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.430
Virginia is about to pass in New York trying to pass it.

29
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:51.210
California trying to pass in three other states trying to pass it to keep babies

30
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:55.410
alive and allow notice.
The governor goes,
we don't want the three minute clip.

31
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:57.840
Pull it up.
We don't want the Glove Min vol.

32
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.330
The doctors and the mother who's drug dubs?
You didn't say that.
Oh go on.

33
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.210
I'm just sad about the future and maybe she keeps baby alive a week.

34
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.500
Maybe she sat to get rid of baby.
Wait a minute.
Is this a viable baby?

35
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:12.280
There's nothing wrong with this baby viable.

36
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.760
The Senate voted three days ago on Monday

37
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.350
to not pass the bill for post birth abortion to not kill livable post burdens

38
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.560
has viable.

39
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.620
Baby's already born can be killed if the bioethics port.

40
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.870
I bet you 10 million's probably that up,
Jamie.

41
00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:34.290
We've got to figure it out of the listeners want,
believe me.
What'd you go?

42
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:38.370
Crazy post about this?
But it says that he did.
It's been taken out of context.

43
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.440
What does that media matters when he Snopes Huffington posts is that snaps?
It's,

44
00:02:43.441 --> 00:02:48.090
it's mostly false.
Ah,
Huffington snope said
Jamie,

45
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.580
Jamie,
go to,
you'd go to the source of the governor,

46
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.360
go to youtube and type in governor of Virginia talks about post birth abortion.

47
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.640
Watch the unedited three minute videos and you call it abortion if it's already

48
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:03.070
been born.
Well,
that's what Trump said.
He said,

49
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.280
he said a month ago when this first broke,
he said,
I see the left.

50
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.890
So compartmentalize,
I'm saying,
are the less mainstream media,
whatever.

51
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.850
We're so censored now.
They're making their move right now.
Who's they?

52
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.000
The globalist technocracy the mad scientist.

53
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:18.990
The guys that are one to learn the secrets of the universe,

54
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.890
probably only handling.

55
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.080
So what you're saying is a lot of this censorship allow us is about one mil.

56
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.000
I don't have 10 million.

57
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.410
I will give before God and country to Jamie's.

58
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.600
Uh,
I'm not kidding.

59
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.450
I will give $1 million to your charity of choice.
All right.

60
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.420
Now listen to me.
This is serious change.
Come out eight children.

61
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.530
I'll give you $1 million if you can prove that I'm making up that the governor

62
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:49.660
said we keep babies alive after they're born.

63
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.170
We keep them comfortable and then it turns out he's an organ harvesting thing

64
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:57.160
and that's what they're doing.
So they keep babies alive.
Don't go to Snopes.

65
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.270
Go to the governor,

66
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.700
go to the governor of Virginia and that's why they want to head and burning for

67
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:05.410
the black face.
But they were using the blackmailing.

68
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.680
They already had that on him as soon.
Same Guy,
same guy.

69
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.920
As soon as he sailing as soon as Trump and we all cover it.

70
00:04:12.921 --> 00:04:14.620
As soon as he tweeted,
he said,
yes,

71
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.330
we're getting rid of babies after they're already born.

72
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.660
You don't want none of that.
No.

73
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.540
Already have figured out with George Soros was putting in it right
now.
I mean,

74
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:23.870
I over simplify that in the media took that.

75
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.690
I know I said they've weaponized marijuana into an hallucinogen category,

76
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.600
so it causes more schizophrenia.
I think he does.

77
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.710
I said that two years is going to court angry.
Yeah,
I think it does.

78
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.270
I think it does for certain people.

79
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.880
I a lot of friends who were already susceptible and the weeds so strong that

80
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:43.390
that,
that,
that,
that they start thinking that I'm wearing swastika shoes.
No,

81
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:44.980
listen,
I agree with you on that.

82
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:49.510
I mean I think I have a strong alpha types needed to not have a heart attack.

83
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.590
Well,
I don't know if I needed to not have a,

84
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.040
when you wanted me to smoke pot with you in that,
in that bathroom,

85
00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:57.430
shooting a video like as a joke like 20 years ago.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Then I said,

86
00:04:57.431 --> 00:04:59.110
it makes me paranoid.
Yeah,
that was funny,
Joe.

87
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:00.940
The only time I feel fell we were weird.

88
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:04.420
Fucking George Bush and George Bush senior master dancing around the capitol.

89
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.650
I was fun time.
You value the paste and leave the song that you wrote.

90
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.680
You have to a fucking song about it,
Jamie.
Jamie,
this is a joke.

91
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.180
I will give $1 million.
You don't have to give any money,
but I believe you.

92
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.890
I just want a little bit.
I have skin in the game.

93
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.040
I didn't pull it up on my phone.
I believe you.
I mean,
he's going to find it.

94
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.903
We'll listen to it.

95
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.350
You don't have to when we're listening to you and then he uses these arguments.

96
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.370
He uses these arguments.
He goes,
well,
sometimes it was a baby.

97
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.450
Sometimes the baby is is just the phone.
No,

98
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.160
they want the organs and so who sold the planned parenthood videos out a Texas

99
00:05:39.161 --> 00:05:43.000
to California two years ago,
the project Veritas,
others,
God who are there saying,

100
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.020
I'm getting a yellow Ferrari,
man.
I'm making hundreds of thousands off each baby.

101
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:49.570
We partial birth.
They keep the baby alive,

102
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.280
they take it in the back and then they have a van pull up that takes it to a

103
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:57.590
Chinese government run facility in the u s and they got the soccer.

104
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.970
Let's listen to this division after birth.
The boards.
This is a gym.
Okay.
Oh,

105
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.260
is this it?
Alex?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hearing yesterday when Fairfax County delegate,

106
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:10.970
Kathy Tran made her case for lifting restrictions on third trimester abortions

107
00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:12.770
as well as other restrictions now in place.

108
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.210
And she was pressed by Republican delegate about whether her bill would permit

109
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:21.380
an abortion even as a woman is essentially dilating ready to give birth.

110
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.680
And she answered that it would permit an abortion at that stage of labor.

111
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.220
Do you support her measure and an explain her answer.

112
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.700
<v 1>Yeah.
And I,
you know,
I wasn't there.
Uh,</v>

113
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.710
Julie and I certainly can't speak for,
uh,
delegate Tran.
But,
um,

114
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.530
I will tell you one first thing I would say.

115
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.030
This is why decisions such as this should be made by providers,

116
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.240
physicians,
uh,
and,
uh,
the,
uh,

117
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.210
mothers and fathers that are involved.

118
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.980
<v 0>Jan had been interrupted her arm back up two seconds.
Notice he's usurping law,</v>

119
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.320
but their whole plan is bioethics and explain in a minute,

120
00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.380
but let's let him let him

121
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.740
<v 1>two minutes.
Ah,
mothers and fathers that are involved.
Um,</v>

122
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.740
there are,
you know,
when we talk about third trimester abortions,

123
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.770
these are done with the consent of obviously the mother with the consent of the

124
00:07:14.921 --> 00:07:18.010
physicians more than one physician by the way.
Um,

125
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.430
and it's done in cases where there may be severe deformities,
there may be a,

126
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:26.590
a fetus that's non Bible.
So in this particular example,

127
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.580
if a mother is in labor,
I can tell you exactly what would happen.

128
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.470
The infant would be delivered,
uh,
the infant would be kept comfortable.
Uh,

129
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.690
infant would be resuscitated if,

130
00:07:37.691 --> 00:07:40.660
if that's what the mother and the family desired.

131
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.100
And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
So,

132
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.700
so I think this was really blown out of proportion.
But again,

133
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.930
we want the government not to be involved in these types of decisions.

134
00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:57.840
We want the decision to be made by,
uh,
the mothers and their providers.
And,

135
00:07:57.841 --> 00:08:02.620
and this is why Julie,
that legislators,
most of whom are men by the way,

136
00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:06.040
shouldn't be telling a woman what she should and shouldn't be doing with our

137
00:08:06.041 --> 00:08:06.690
body.

138
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.800
<v 0>And do you think multiple physicians should have to weigh in as is currently</v>

139
00:08:10.801 --> 00:08:12.530
required?
She's trying to lift that requirement.

140
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.220
<v 1>Well,
I think it's always good to get a second opinion and for,</v>

141
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:20.220
for at least two providers to be involved in that decision because these

142
00:08:20.221 --> 00:08:24.720
decisions shouldn't be taken lightly and I would certainly support more than one

143
00:08:24.721 --> 00:08:25.554
provider

144
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.740
<v 0>go back to the front.
Wow.</v>

145
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:32.510
That's a weird thing that she just kind of let him say [inaudible] story,

146
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:37.740
but hold on a second.
It's,
what's weird is that she was talking,

147
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.700
they were talking about resuscitating the baby,

148
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.780
that they would keep the baby alive.
Then a decision would be made.
Isn't that,

149
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.220
that's like euthanasia.

150
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.250
Like you can't even do that while you're so smart gentleman cause your ass,

151
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.910
but you can't do that to your grammy.
Right.
Your grandma,
he's like 80 years old.

152
00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:56.340
You can't,
you can't just kill her.
The Newsweek cover it.

153
00:08:56.341 --> 00:08:58.770
The case for killing her auntie.
They say that.
So let me explain.

154
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.920
Now you've got it.
Did you hear that?

155
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:05.190
Legal ease turns out when I saw that clip a month ago,

156
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.510
cause they had them do a debate about the bill,
right?
And they said,
yeah,

157
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:12.310
we'll kill babies after they're born.
And they're debating,
well how,

158
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.220
how far along what?
Whatever the doctor say.
But its jurisprudence,

159
00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:21.330
there's law,
you can't do that.
So this is saying,
oh the government not involved.

160
00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:25.050
This is the medical system you surfing.
If they can kill a baby after it's born.

161
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.680
Cause sometimes they deformed,
he knows he has,
sometimes they the phone.

162
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.560
Here's the key.
Notice he shed.
We resuscitate.

163
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.040
They don't consider you alive till the bio ethics board shares that you're a

164
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:44.760
viable human.
And under the bioethics in Europe and under the UN now,

165
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.820
which is all Nazi by the EU,
was set up by the Nazis.
Volkswagen,

166
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.160
I'm not against Volkswagen itself,
but that,

167
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:52.740
that was literally drawn the first of all Texas by Hitler,
Audi,

168
00:09:52.741 --> 00:09:55.680
the Olympic symbol.
I mean,
Hitler was a really bad dude,
but he literally,

169
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.780
so much of our world's government,
NASA,
everything,

170
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.480
they had a system where they first killed babies,
they thought were deformed.

171
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:08.460
That was 1934 the final solution happened like six,
seven years later.

172
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.640
And so he's saying because they've got a big problem,

173
00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:13.530
they've got an undercover videos are keeping babies alive.

174
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.230
You want to pull those up.
I'm up BSA,
there's hot,
there's dozens.

175
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:21.540
So they've got to start getting it going now with governor physicians in people

176
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.321
to go,

177
00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:25.860
because the nurses are freaking out and they're saying we're keeping babies

178
00:10:25.861 --> 00:10:28.450
alive,
and they get put in a van and drive away what's going on.
They're like,
oh,

179
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.620
well what do we keep them comfortable?

180
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.900
Show the baby's worth $500,000 who's paying the in the chain of delivery just on

181
00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:42.150
time delivery?
I mean,
each organ is worth a lot of money and so,

182
00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:45.120
but,
but if you kill them,
run on the spot.
They were like,
wow,

183
00:10:45.121 --> 00:10:49.920
we wasted in this seven pounds of meat.
So see if they can keep them alive.

184
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:53.210
And now they've built these new wings.
They've built new ag so I can shut,

185
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.460
pull up a book.
They have wings where they go,
oh,

186
00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.720
we consider the baby dead.
The mother decided it did live.

187
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.530
If she decides we resuscitate and it lives,

188
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.020
but it didn't resuscitate,
it's flesh.
It's illegal ease.

189
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:14.210
It's passed into a special ward with doctors and make a few million a year and a

190
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.530
little foolish.

191
00:11:16.531 --> 00:11:21.531
Bolo is kept alive and comfortable until all the oldest come in the planes land

192
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.230
and they take the logins.

193
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:30.120
Then they take this blood and they take the skin Joe,

194
00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:35.190
and you see how it works.
Now you know with his voice?
No,
no,

195
00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:38.880
but see as the southern Leb and bullets,
you see,

196
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:43.350
my dad knew Oregon Harvesters in Dallas and he shed,

197
00:11:43.351 --> 00:11:45.240
don't sign your organ donor card.

198
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.930
They've got corrupt hospitals where if you are totally viable,

199
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.500
they take your organs.
Oh Jeez.
And then I said,
dad,
you're crazy.

200
00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:55.840
But I didn't send the donor card.
And then my dad owned a hospital,
two in Dallas.

201
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.020
Then when I was deck,

202
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.140
a decade later at my grandparents house before my grandpa died watching 60

203
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:03.280
minutes and it was Dallas,

204
00:12:03.281 --> 00:12:07.900
Texas and Chicago caught killing people that were viable to take their organs

205
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:12.100
tonight they 60 minutes expos a and it was a freaking hospital.

206
00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:17.080
My Dad told me about Jesus Christ.
So Joe,
that's what I'm telling you is,

207
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.700
were you at the kitchen table when you were eight hearing about cyborgs t that's

208
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:25.780
why I know about this.
My Dad never got fully into it.
He decided to get out of it

209
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.750
and he decided to get out of it.

210
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.040
He decided that you're legitimately freaking me the fuck out Joe.
I will.

211
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:34.090
I will let you know.

212
00:12:34.091 --> 00:12:37.600
The problem is some of it makes sense because people figure out a way to

213
00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:40.930
rationalize a lot of things and if you see a guy's mangled in a car accidents,

214
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.730
but he's still alive and you know you could sell the broken,

215
00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:48.970
he can save five loaves.
Yeah.
Kim,
comfortable.

216
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.130
Yeah.
I mean Joe,

217
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:55.570
but the thing is how many people would have to be involved for that to be real

218
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.050
show.
I can show you.
Let's not exaggerate.

219
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:04.560
15 videos of planned parenthood workers laughing,

220
00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:07.750
saying,
I made 1 million bucks yesterday,
last year.
It's incredible.

221
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.300
If we could just keep them alive longer,
we'll get 10 times the money.

222
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.780
We're only getting 50 grand per baby cause we got to kill them before they leave

223
00:13:13.781 --> 00:13:17.860
the building.
The mother doesn't know their,
they talk her into it.
Oh ma'am,

224
00:13:17.861 --> 00:13:19.900
you're three months pregnant.
All the baby might have a problem.

225
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.690
Might have a heart murmur.
Oh,
the ultrasound.
Oh yeah.

226
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.350
And then they get the uterus.
You're going to get to,
this is the truth.
Yeah.

227
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.060
They then keep it alive,

228
00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:31.840
but only a few hours and they got to get planes coming in and vans and they

229
00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:34.450
don't get the full price because they can't put it on the auctions.

230
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:37.880
They've got digital corporate auctions.
Look this up for organs.
