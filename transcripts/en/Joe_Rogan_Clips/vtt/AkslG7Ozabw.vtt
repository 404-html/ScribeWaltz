1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730
And when you finally get his life

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.700
in the big time,
when you think back when you're driving that Budweiser truck,

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.650
I just,
ah,
I appreciate every job that I had.
You know,
I appreciate every,

4
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.980
everything that,
you know,
that it happened to me in my life.
It May,

5
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.980
it allowed me to appreciate,
you know,

6
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:23.460
who I am now allowed me to appreciate just the smaller things.

7
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:25.740
It allowed me to just be myself.
You know,

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.500
I'm a type of person that I don't really care about fame.

9
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.900
I don't even want to be called the celebrity.
You know what I mean?

10
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.380
I want to be able to live my life and do what I do.

11
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:37.920
I want to be able to enjoy just the smallest things in life.

12
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.950
I don't want people to take that away from me.
You know what I mean?

13
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.300
Being able to go to a movie or a grocery store or whatever,

14
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.850
spend time with the family you can't shut.
Cause I like cooking.

15
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.760
I like going to the grocery stores,
the fresh market,

16
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.070
pick up my fruit and stuff that I want to put in my whatever I'm preparing for

17
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:59.220
the night and stuff like that.
And I'm a people's person as well,

18
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:03.390
so I don't mind being bothered,
but you know,
it can't get crate.

19
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:06.780
I've seen other people get it get crazy for an iron man,
you know?

20
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:08.910
And they said it themselves like they don't,

21
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.860
they wished that they could do certain things,
normal things,
but people,
people,

22
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.490
people take it to the next level,
you know,
get all in your bit.

23
00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:21.240
Especially after this fight.
Like I didn't had to cut some people,
you know,

24
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.210
I didn't have to cut some people because they attentions was already wrong.

25
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:26.210
They seen the potential.
I put,

26
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.630
they seen the opportunity and they tried to make moves on me,
you know,
already,

27
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.470
you know,
and different things.
That's why I said lonely at the top,
you know,

28
00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:36.480
because you get to the point where you don't know who to trust.

29
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:39.570
You start down everybody around you.
You know,

30
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:44.430
I'm an energy person so I'm always re refreshing the feeling of the energy.

31
00:01:44.431 --> 00:01:47.980
Let me see what it feels like.
You know what I'm saying?
None of that.

32
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I always allow me to meet certain people to be around certain people because if

33
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:57.870
you change your presence,
the energy just to just,
it would change as well.

34
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.990
It changes.
It shifts the way you feel when you're around.

35
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.780
Then all of a sudden you feel like they're looking for angles and trying to

36
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:07.770
profit off of you.
They're trying to get you to do things.
Yes.
You know,
Eh,

37
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.810
you know,
I'm a,
I'm a strong minded person.

38
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:12.300
I got a lot of strong minded men around me.

39
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.250
I always tell people we speak positive,

40
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:18.240
we think positive and we surround ourselves by positive,
you know,

41
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.140
positive energy,
you know,
and then I will,
results is always positive.

42
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.730
The only time you ever see me,
you know,
acting out,

43
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.490
I would say if someone would come and break that piece,

44
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.390
you'll never find me and my brothers,
you know,
out and you know,

45
00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:36.480
mess with someone's starting anything.
I'm not a,
I'm not,
I'm not,

46
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.870
I'm not the one that started anything because I want peace.

47
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.200
I don't even want to see a fight outside.
If it's not in the boxing ring,

48
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.100
I'll walk away if I see it on the outside because I feel like they don't know

49
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:50.850
what they're doing.
You know what I mean?
It's then something could happen easily.

50
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:54.900
You see guns being pulled out now a days and you know,

51
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.160
any little thing.
So I started to stay away from confrontation much as possible.

52
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.020
That's why I think God it on my home body,
you know,
if I'm not here,
I'm at home,

53
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.820
you know,
because they say when you had to find,
I mean you had to,
you know,

54
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:12.030
find things to do and you had to leave home all the time.

55
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.090
You don't have a peaceful home.
And um,
I believe in that,
you know,

56
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.060
I don't understand when you're,
when it's busy,
you have to work and stuff.

57
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:22.270
That's one thing.
But you know,
when you just said,
man,
let's go here.

58
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:24.550
Let's go ahead and do it.
See,
I don't want to,
I don't,

59
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.420
I don't put myself out there to be a risk for no one.
You know,

60
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.760
my risk is at home.
If something's going to happen,
then you know the was at home.

61
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.170
You know,
I don't,

62
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:38.650
I don't put myself out there to have chance chances at the chances of where

63
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:42.340
people look down and it's like,
Hey,
let's do this.
Let's do that to him.

64
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:46.510
Or I tried to,
because I know what I'm capable of doing.
You know what I mean?

65
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.860
And I like being me.
I just like being laid back down to Earth,

66
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.450
get along with everyone.

67
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.780
I'm a people's person and a lot of people would never know it because they only

68
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:57.460
see the perspective of me and the ring.

69
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.840
Or they see me on youtube and those interviews,
yes,

70
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.980
you're a very mellow guy.
Like right now,
I'm sure I'm a lay.
I'm just,

71
00:04:05.981 --> 00:04:07.420
I'm the coolest.
I'm the best.
