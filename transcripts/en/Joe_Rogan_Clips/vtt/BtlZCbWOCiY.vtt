1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.830
Predict you better.
It's like you're all wearing the same decoder ring.
Yes,

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.350
yes.
Yeah.
Well that is what a lot of it is.

3
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:10.050
A lot of it is whether or not you believe in God or not.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.680
It's the saying that God's real and the worshiping God and the talking about God

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.300
is just letting everybody know that they can predict you.

6
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.870
They know where you kind of like if you're a gentleman,
if you're a gentleman,

7
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:25.110
you wearing a tie with a nice suit on and pair of pants,

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.290
I can fairly likely predict that you're going to be reasonably behaved.

9
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.810
Yeah.
You're a gentleman,
you know,
if you're a Christian,

10
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.110
if you're a person who calls himself a Christian and you know,

11
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.980
well we go to the buy would go to church every Sunday and uh,

12
00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:43.500
I like to read the Bible and I am a Christian and people automatically go,
oh,

13
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:46.560
okay.
I kind of know where you're coming from.
I can,
I can see where you are.

14
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.410
And now I like that you can predict to me cause you will like me better so we

15
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:54.750
don't have to talk.
Yes,
no.
All right,
we'll reinforce those,

16
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.450
those patterns in your head.
And I'll say some things that,
uh,

17
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.130
I've repeated things that I've heard other people say about God and Jesus and

18
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.720
yeah.
And it's a nice way to kill time.
It's not a bad way,
you know,

19
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.500
believing in God and going to church and state,

20
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.880
it's a great way you kill time until death nullifies all meaning.

21
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.990
Well I think the community thing of it is a good thing.
There's,
there's some,

22
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.030
there's some really powerful like bonding experiences that people have when they

23
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.840
agreed to be humbled together.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're describing curling,

24
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.610
curling,
curling.
Great.
That's a sport.
Look,

25
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.320
there's two words in Canada are very popular.
Countering,
curling.
Yup.

26
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.830
That's right.

27
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.150
And there's no way he's curling is one of the top TV shows cannot rise to the

28
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:41.460
tops of curling without humbling yourself.

29
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.330
Cause you humble yourself the minute you say I'm not to go curly.

30
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.270
When you pick up that brush and a big smile on your face side to sweet bites.

31
00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:51.060
Yeah,
I'm tried.
Curling man.
It's not easy.
No,
it's hard.

32
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.440
Which still doesn't make it a sport.

33
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.220
I made fun of it in Newfoundland and they fucking got so mad at me.

34
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.770
He'll read a theater where I was at like how these pictures of curlers on the

35
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:05.680
wall and I just could not stop shitting on them yet.
We're like,
hey,

36
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.500
hey,
there were legitimately upset.
I'm like,
it is a endeavor,

37
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.630
you know,
and I know it.
You're sliding a rock on the ice.
Yeah.

38
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.770
It used to be a reason to drink.
That's what curling was where everybody,

39
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:17.920
we had to get steal it.

40
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.500
And you don't fall very far on the ice because we're already squatting.
Yeah,

41
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.710
right.
Yeah.
And the other people are leaning against brooms.
That's right.

42
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:28.110
You got a broom to lean against.
It's great you're drinking.

43
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.960
It's also like when you fall on ice,
it's almost always funny always.
Yeah.
Yeah.

44
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.450
No one's,
no one kind of catches himself.
No,
you don't like gently fall it.

45
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.300
You could try to get up as good to know this.

46
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.500
You don't fall elegantly on night hiking and slip a little and catch yourself

47
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.280
and that.

48
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.610
But even like when you're watching the NHL and you'll see players that will just

49
00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:50.520
fall down.
Yeah.
Like just for no reason.
That's hilarious.

50
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.990
These are the best skaters in the world,

51
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.200
and they're just going to fall down on his ass.
He's a professional employee.

52
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.770
Yeah.
Yeah.
And like if I ran ahead and chill with at Volkswagen,

53
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:02.530
I couldn't knock him over.
Yeah.
Right.
But he just fell.

54
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.840
How long has curling been around a hundred years old.
It's a Scottish court.

55
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.480
It's a Scottish sport where they used to use actual rocks they'd find in fields

56
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.790
and play it on frozen lakes.
The lakes,

57
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.610
because that's the only kind they have in Scotland.
Yeah.
Mm.

58
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.020
Are frozen ones and the lochness monster can around.
There's a lot of,

59
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.410
he's a wonderful curler.
David,
are you Scottish?
I believe I'm from,
yeah,
I've got,

60
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.130
yeah,
I got the holes.
Shell part Scottish.
I mean,

61
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:29.050
there's a lot of Scottish people in Canada,

62
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.500
so you can see my curling would be popular,
you know,
very,

63
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:36.540
very Scottish country Canada.
It's strange.
That's why there's so many gourds.
And,

64
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.160
and Craig's that Gordon Johnson.
Gordon 40.
Yeah,
that's right.

65
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.790
That was a Scottish word,
right?
Yep.
Gordon Gordon.
Yeah,
and of course,

66
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:48.220
because of Gordie Howe,
everyone named their kids.
Gord.

67
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.650
I went to school with a guy named Greg [inaudible].
I mean,

68
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:51.550
that was his first name.
