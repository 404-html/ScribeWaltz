1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.430
Are you familiar with what's going on with Patrion with a,

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.240
and that's like the podcast pay for him or you can pay for shit with Patriana.

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.230
Well,
yeah,
you can pay for things,
but it's not necessarily just for podcasts,

4
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:16.070
but people do use it for podcasts,
but we use it for many things.
Okay.

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.920
But there's this guy,
his name is Carl Benjamin,

6
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:24.921
and he goes by the name of Sargon are our cod and he considers himself a,

7
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.380
what did you call a classic British liberal,

8
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.240
which is more leans,
more conservative than our idea of what a liberal is.

9
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.870
But essentially it's more of a like a libertarian.
Toward what,
how would you,

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.230
how would you describe a classic British liberal?

11
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:44.220
Like what would be the definitely Google that the front of the name would be

12
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:49.110
Carl Benjamin.
I mean,
that's a strong name.
Well,
Sargon of cod.
His,
his,

13
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:53.400
uh,
his screen name and he has a youtube channel.
And uh,

14
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.930
he said something on a podcast,

15
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.100
not even a zone.

16
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:04.101
He was a guest on another channel and he said something about white supremacist.

17
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.250
He was talking about these white supremacists that are acting up and doing all

18
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:11.370
these horrible things.
And he said,
and this is,

19
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.140
it's a poorly formed thought,
but what he essentially said was,

20
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.240
you guys are being niggers almost.
You act like white niggers.

21
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:23.820
This is his word,
cheesy.
See this is what he's saying.

22
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.300
You're acting like a bunch of niggers.
Just so you know,

23
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:29.770
you act like white niggers.
I'm sorry if you heard that word.

24
00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:31.230
And so offending you right now,
ladies and gentlemen,

25
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:35.640
I'm just reading exactly how you described black people acting is the impression

26
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:38.370
I get dealing with the alt right.
I'm really,

27
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:41.100
I'm just not in the mood to deal with this kind of disrespect.

28
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.690
So that's a very,
very shy,

29
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.510
it's a very poorly thought out way of expressing himself.

30
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.090
Um,
that's what I'm thinking.

31
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.120
I'm reading this and I think also sometimes people like using that word to shock

32
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.780
and they think they can get away with it.
And you know,
when you're using it,

33
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.620
what's this?
What's this and what's the context of this?
Like what is it?

34
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:07.140
But you also said,
here,
look,
you carry on,

35
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:10.110
but you don't expect me to have a debate with one of your faggots.

36
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.940
Like why would I bother?
Okay,
now that is more egregious because that is,

37
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.830
I mean,
and if you're,
you're just dealing with censoring words.
There's not,

38
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:24.831
he's not using that saying you're acting like the way you call gay people.

39
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.820
He's not saying that.

40
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:31.050
He's like calling someone a gay slur and he sang it again and again.

41
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.140
So this was just what they had decided to use.

42
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.480
Now I don't agree with any of these things.
He said,

43
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.160
this is what I'm reading this.
I'm like,
this is,

44
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.210
these are poorly thought out arguments.

45
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:45.240
This is a poorly thought out sentence.
It's not,

46
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.140
well just stop scrolling there for a second.
Put that back up.
It's not,

47
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.730
it's not well thought out.
Not at all.
Not Good.
So they've,

48
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.210
but this has nothing to do with his patrion page.

49
00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:02.770
It doesn't even have to do with his,
his channel.
This is something,

50
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:06.310
he made this comment as a part of a longer wide ranging interview with a

51
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:11.160
youtuber named Michelle Kaitlin Catlin.

52
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.590
And you can watch the full interview on this.

53
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.720
It says chatting with Sargon of a cod about the liberalist community.
Um,

54
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.090
so he,
you know,
it was free flowing any,

55
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.950
he said a bunch of really stupid things that,

56
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.490
but what he was trying to say is that these people are behaving exactly the way

57
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.140
they do when they try to say racist things about black people.

58
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.440
Essentially they're are behaving exactly the way they're describing race in a

59
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:51.190
racist way.
Yeah.
It's just not well thought out.

60
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:54.610
I mean this guy needs a class and how to fucking be articulate.
I mean,

61
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.020
Jesus Christ.
But that's,

62
00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.550
that's what I'm getting from this patron decided to remove him because of that.

63
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.740
And there's many people that feel like that's not exactly why they did it,

64
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:07.000
that they were looking for an excuse.

65
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:11.050
And it's really because of his anti liberal bias.

66
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.470
So they will,

67
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.540
a lot of people are disgusted by the idea that Patrion is now censoring voices

68
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.530
and the deciding who should or should not be able to receive donations from

69
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:31.180
their fans based on their own personal political biases.

70
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.150
So this is the argument now and it's a,

71
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:38.140
it's an interesting thing that's popped up because people like Sam Harris who is

72
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.670
very left,
I mean he gets accused of being all right,
which is kind of hilarious,

73
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.890
but he's very progressive and you know he's a public intellectual and he's

74
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:52.891
decided that this is a moment where he is going to pull his patriotic countdown

75
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.400
because he doesn't like the way they are choosing to censor people and d

76
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.640
platform people based entirely on something that has nothing to do with anything

77
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:09.520
he's done on their platform and has something to do with something that was out

78
00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:10.900
there on a,
on another channel.

79
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.310
So it's one of those weird little battleground situations.

80
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.560
Do think like a patient has a private enterprise,
right?
Yes.

81
00:05:19.561 --> 00:05:23.380
So they can do whatever the fuck they want.
They essentially they can and did it.

82
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.830
So then people can decide that they don't want to deal with Patrion because

83
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:29.950
Patriot doesn't support free speech,
free speech.

84
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.580
The argument would go that free speech is not just supporting speech,

85
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.300
that you agree with it.
True.
Free speech is letting people express themselves.

86
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.530
Right now,
the way he expressed himself,
they're not very good,

87
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.090
clumsy,
right?
Heavy.
That's an understatement though.

88
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.240
Like your thoughts on it this year,
you've never seen this before.

89
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.480
What are your thoughts on it?
I'm like,
dude,
Jews.
I mean it's such a,

90
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.040
that choice of words is such a way

91
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.090
<v 1>to just,
if I'm,
if I'm person reading that,</v>

92
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.450
unlike my immediate,
my eye goes,
you said what you can't,
like,

93
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:09.680
it's such an offensive word where you can't even go there immediately distracts

94
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:13.100
from the point that you're trying to make.
So it's a good way of putting it.

95
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:16.100
You know?
It's,
it's such like a,
you just need it.
You need like,

96
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:18.410
I don't think that guy,
I don't know if he's racist or not,

97
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.160
but like I don't think he is.
But your immediate reaction is like this guy,

98
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.010
you can't do that.
You have,

99
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.500
you have fundamentally destroyed whatever point you were trying to make because

100
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:33.530
of your choice.
It's like a,
you could be trying to save,

101
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.010
I can't think of the analogy now,
but like it's,

102
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.970
it's such a distracting choice of words.
That's a great way of putting it.

103
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:41.804
You know,

104
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.840
<v 0>he could've said,
and by the way,
like all conversations including this one,
right?</v>

105
00:06:46.841 --> 00:06:49.690
Like I'm trying to formulate these opinions on the fly.
So are you,
yeah,

106
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.970
that was what he was doing on the fly.

107
00:06:51.971 --> 00:06:54.240
I don't think there's anything he prepared.
Sorry.

108
00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.210
<v 1>Damn dog.
You mean that wasn't vetted?</v>

109
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:01.141
Oh Dude,

110
00:07:01.141 --> 00:07:04.770
he's gone over that with a fucking highlighter is the key points and once I hit

111
00:07:04.771 --> 00:07:06.710
on,
it must have been a few websites.
I don't know.

112
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.550
<v 0>No,
no.
I was trying to look up the ones exactly,</v>

113
00:07:08.551 --> 00:07:12.240
but I know for instance on twitch in the last year they've changed things on the

114
00:07:12.241 --> 00:07:16.020
terms of service that kind of what you do broadly yes.

115
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.690
Affects what you do on anyone's account.
Problem with that.

116
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.530
What you're just saying right now is the guy who's a CEO of Patriot actually win

117
00:07:22.531 --> 00:07:24.480
on Dave Rubin's show,

118
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.600
the Rubin report and said that they're only concerned with things that happen on

119
00:07:30.001 --> 00:07:32.520
Patrion is that that's what they focus on.

120
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.240
Then they changed that after this because here's the problem,

121
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.320
like I see their point with this,

122
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:47.100
this particular thing that this guy said.
I see.

123
00:07:47.101 --> 00:07:51.780
How they find that offensive and if that becomes a thing that he does more than

124
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.730
once and becomes a thing that he uses that all the time and uses that kind of

125
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:02.490
that kind of language in that context a lot.
It's like,

126
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.020
hmm,
this is not,
it's clunky.
It's not,

127
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.750
it's not a wise choice of words.
It's,
it's,

128
00:08:09.751 --> 00:08:13.740
it's sloppy and it's kind of lazy.
Right.

129
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:18.100
And also it's kind of racist,
but it's why is it racist?
Well,

130
00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:23.101
it's racist because what he's doing is attacking people who are racists by

131
00:08:23.131 --> 00:08:25.950
saying,
and he could have done it this way,
right?

132
00:08:25.951 --> 00:08:30.951
He could have said you people rally on about black people and call them this and

133
00:08:31.501 --> 00:08:34.550
you say they're doing that.
This is what you do,
right?

134
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.900
You are exactly what you're,

135
00:08:36.901 --> 00:08:40.890
the only thing that's missing is that you don't have the right pigment to,

136
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.340
to receive your own,
hate your own self,
hate what you're doing.

137
00:08:44.341 --> 00:08:49.040
The very things that you accuse that you in a racist way accused black people of

138
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:50.880
doing.
It's stupid.

139
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.450
But it's the way to combat that.

140
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:59.870
I eat when you start censoring people and taking away their ability to make a

141
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:02.550
living by expressing themselves.

142
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.720
I just don't think that's the way to go because you're just going to receive

143
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:09.730
backlash and that's,
that's the thing.
It's one of those that's,

144
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:14.830
that's one of those instances where it's like you've set a trigger word that is

145
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:20.250
clearly a trigger word and what you just said is the way he should have said

146
00:09:20.591 --> 00:09:24.730
what he wanted to say.
Right.
And in hindsight,
if you gave them an opportunity,

147
00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.230
like you say,
Hey Carl,

148
00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:30.040
here's a time machine or I go back right before you said that and say it again.

149
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.030
What I'll just say I'm Patriot on the,
like I,

150
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.710
I'm reading their stance on it as a website.
They don't host anything.

151
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.510
So like to say that it's something that's happening.
History logs,

152
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.130
like Jordan Peterson wrote a blog on Patrion,

153
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.910
but that's what most of their content is,
is links from other websites.

154
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.740
They have to take into account what you're creating as a creator anywhere

155
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:56.250
almost,
right.
This isn't the whole argument of him as a creator though.

156
00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.560
This was him.
A guest on someone else's show.
So this is not something he,

157
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.050
that's his own content that he put out their stances that he collaborates with

158
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:07.190
other creators and this,
this would be considered a collaboration.
Yeah,

159
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.380
I see that point.
I do not think that it's a wise thing to censor him though.

160
00:10:13.381 --> 00:10:16.810
Do you ah,
get that mother Fucker,

161
00:10:16.811 --> 00:10:19.510
a PR coach dog with Jesus Christ.
The very least.

162
00:10:19.511 --> 00:10:20.890
Maybe that this is the first dance,

163
00:10:20.891 --> 00:10:24.160
which I think they're saying it is a definitely a warning or maybe,
yeah.

164
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.790
But here's the thing,
man.
Here's the fan temporary ban.
Here's the thing.

165
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.210
What he does is he's,
uh,

166
00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.630
he's,
he's a commentator.

167
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.310
He sees his life and he talks about it and I've listened to a lot of his stuff

168
00:10:39.311 --> 00:10:42.730
and it's very good.
He's a,
he's a smart man and a lot of it's very good.

169
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.020
This is not very good.

170
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:49.380
So the right way when it comes to these things is let the people who contribute

171
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.640
to his patron decide that they don't like what he's doing.

172
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.530
So they're are no longer going to subscribe.

173
00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.510
That's the correct use of the platform.

174
00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:03.600
The platform exists because people who are fans are able to contribute that.

175
00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:07.870
I say new mash,
I really like what you do.
I'm going to send you $100 every month.

176
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.240
And if someone wants to do that,
they can do that.

177
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.070
And there's a lot of people that do do that.

178
00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.070
When you say something that makes them offended,

179
00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.650
that makes him realize you're sloppy with your words,

180
00:11:17.651 --> 00:11:20.440
that makes him feel like you're a fool.
They go,
you know what,

181
00:11:20.441 --> 00:11:23.920
I'm not sending that fucking guy money and the marketplace talking about,

182
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:28.810
and then they pull back.
If you lost 30% of his market because of that,

183
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.260
and then a bunch of blogs are written about how stupid what he said was,

184
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:36.270
that's the correct response.
Correct.
I think,
I don't think po,

185
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.300
but the problem with pulling out is then guys like Sam Harris or pulling out and

186
00:11:40.301 --> 00:11:44.950
they've lost somewhere around 20% of all their patriotic accounts because of

187
00:11:44.951 --> 00:11:47.920
this.
Oh,
she goes,
there's been a backlash.
And by the way,

188
00:11:47.921 --> 00:11:52.390
a backlash that's primarily coming from people who don't agree with what that

189
00:11:52.391 --> 00:11:53.224
guy said,

190
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:58.260
but do agree that it's a very slippery slope to start censoring people.

191
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.580
That's a good moral stance to take.
Like,
uh,
it's like Kinda like I,

192
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.830
I forget which political figures said,
I was like,

193
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:10.180
I do not agree with what you're saying,
but I will die.
Defend,

194
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.650
fight to the the day your ability to see the ability to say yes.
I think that's,

195
00:12:13.651 --> 00:12:16.870
it's important because the only way that ideas get worked out is through

196
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:19.450
discussion.
And as soon as you silenced voices,

197
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.530
then you no longer have that discussion.
Now,
to Youtube's credit,

198
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:25.750
he still up on Youtube.
Okay.

199
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:28.900
Cause this was a talk that he had that's available on Youtube.

200
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.460
You can listen to it on youtube.

201
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.140
He still has his youtube account and he's still able to.
