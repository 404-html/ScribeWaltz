00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
W,
you know,
when it comes to Trump,
what did he do?
He missile strike in Syria,

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.750
weapons,
deal of Saudi Arabia,
commando raids in Yemen,
a little girl got killed.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.030
And I've been for the most part,
very,

4
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:12.480
very critical of him in any other administration who engages in regime change

5
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:16.740
foreign wars.
And look,
I've got to say,
you know,
when it comes to domestic issues,

6
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:20.610
I'm not,
that's not my wheelhouse when it comes to foreign policy stuff.

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.460
Only a little bit like I've been to some countries,
I've experienced stuff,

8
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:27.960
but really,
you know,
on the ground cultural between people is more my thing.

9
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.330
But I know more about foreign policy than domestic.

10
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.020
And when I see Trump's foreign policy,
I was very critical of it.

11
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.820
But I will point out withdrawing from Syria,
I'm a fan,
um,

12
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.830
I understand a lot more than probably the average person does.

13
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.320
Some of the issues surrounding Syria,
Russia,
the cotter,

14
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:44.400
Turkey pipeline and things.

15
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:48.020
But typically I think it's usually a bad idea when the u s involves itself's

16
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.990
inform foreign interests and tries engaging and these regime change change

17
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.700
strategies to build allies.

18
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.200
But one of the things that really blew my mind is I saw a survey,

19
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.510
at least it was going on in the inner on social media.

20
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:03.630
So who knows if it's true that claimed the Democrats have a favorable opinion of

21
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.480
George W.
Bush,
you know,
something,
something that affects,

22
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.680
and they're there in retrospect,
like,
yeah,
like today they pulled them,

23
00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:11.400
they're like,
oh,
he was good.

24
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.920
And there's a video of him like giving a piece of candy to Michelle Obama and

25
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:16.170
everyone was like,
it was going viral.
And people are laughing about,
I'm like,

26
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.580
not say hold hands.
That's crazy.
That guy's awful.
I'm like that guy.

27
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.110
But what,
what happened?

28
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.200
And then when Trump announces he's going to pull troops out of Syria,

29
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:27.300
everybody opposes it.
Like the media saying it's wrong.

30
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:29.550
And you've got a lot of like mainstream people on the left thing.
It's wrong.

31
00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:34.080
And I'm like,
it is,
what do you mean?
Like that's crazy to me.

32
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.540
Like,
you know,
uh,
all of my activist friends,

33
00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:38.580
we've never been in favor of that stuff.
We've always opposed it.

34
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:39.960
That's always been the left's position.

35
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.130
And now I'm seeing people who claim to be on the left support multinational

36
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:46.290
businesses as private businesses doing whatever they want.

37
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.640
Meaning like social media course.
Yeah.
Like,
like dude,
you know,
Saudi Arabia,

38
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:54.270
I think it's a,
a Saudi prince is one of the biggest investors in Twitter.
Briony.

39
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.110
Yeah.
Yeah.

40
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.980
And so it's like there there've been a series of people who have gotten letters

41
00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:02.460
that they violated Pakistani law.
I mean they,
they,
they send screenshots,

42
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:03.450
you know,
screen house can be faked,

43
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:05.610
but there've been a couple of people who have been like,

44
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:10.500
for some reason Twitter decided to inform me of this.
And then it's,
it's,

45
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:12.670
it's a multinational let,
let's,
let's talk about the,

46
00:02:12.671 --> 00:02:15.240
the Adler algorithmic apocalypse.
Let's segue into that.

47
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.800
You've got a platform where our public discourse is happening where the left has

48
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:24.000
repeatedly said that Russians used it to manipulate our elections where one of

49
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:27.210
its biggest investors is a Saudi prince or something to that effect.

50
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.070
And they're banning people of,
of a certain,
uh,

51
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.860
who oppose a certain ideological bent.
Like that sounds like a democratic crisis,

52
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.340
right?
If,
if this is where the public sphere is,
if you,
you know,

53
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:40.770
you said is no longer in the conversation,
you know,

54
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.570
he's banned from Twitter even though he's got millions of followers,

55
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.450
they don't talk about him anymore.
He's off Twitter.
Twitter really is important.

56
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:48.090
The president is there.
So if you start removing people,

57
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.510
you've got foreign interests who have a stake in what Twitter is doing.
Yeah,

58
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:56.370
they can seriously influence our elections and,
and,
and they,
they are.

59
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.211
But I'll,
but I'll,

60
00:02:57.211 --> 00:03:01.600
but I'll move into what most really crazy New York Times reported.

61
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.660
There's a group that false flagged the Republican's in Alabama with fake Twitter

62
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:09.730
accounts that they made to convince the media.

63
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.280
Russians were propping up the campaign of Roy Moore.

64
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.130
So basically this,
according to the times is all fact.

65
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.080
This is,
they've seen the documents,
they reported it,

66
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.640
that democratic operatives smeared,
uh,

67
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.560
engage in a false flag campaign to make it appear like the Russians were popping

68
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:29.110
up.
Republicans and the national media in the u s ran with it.

69
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.820
How that's not a crime is beyond me that's interfering in elections and we know

70
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:37.670
it.
And this group is,
is still being cited.
They're smearing Tulsi Gabard,
right.

71
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.900
Yeah.
An NBC news article came out saying that Russians are,
you know,

72
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:42.940
I've taken notice of our campaign are promoting it.
Same Group,

73
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.313
still running the story.

74
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.330
Dang.
How that's not a crime is mind blowing to me.

75
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.200
But the New York Times reported it.
So it's at this point,
it's like,
I mean,

76
00:03:57.201 --> 00:03:57.380
that's,

77
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.680
I think we have to be aware that there's so much manipulation going on right now

78
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.800
from almost every angle.
Oh yeah.
So,
I mean,

79
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.420
and what's hilarious is that people look at what's going on with Russian troll

80
00:04:08.421 --> 00:04:11.930
factories and you know,
the way they're trying to influence our elections,

81
00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:16.070
that it's particularly egregious.
Yeah.
Where we do that shit,

82
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.560
I'll totally plus,
and I'm pretty sure we,

83
00:04:18.561 --> 00:04:21.260
we learned about the u s doing it well before we learned Russia was doing it.

84
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.150
And I'd be willing to bet the u s started it.
