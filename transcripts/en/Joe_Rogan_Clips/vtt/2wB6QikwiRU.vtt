00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.460
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.380
You can get a hell cat fur used Hellcat like 45 grand.

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.900
You know what I mean?
Like 600 bucks a month,

4
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:13.170
700 bucks a month and you got 700 horsepower.

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.950
You hooked me up with one of those when I was in Denver when I was essential to

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.220
over read Hellcat a mountains.

7
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.930
I remember that with the astronauts outfit on fast.
Right.
Great.

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.490
It's a great car.
Now they have a wider,
have you seen the wider bodywork?

9
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.540
I like that.
It's actually got quite a lot more tire under it.
That was good.

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.450
I had a complaint.
It doesn't have that muscle car ass.

11
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.960
I like a car with the wide body.
Hellcat does.
Yeah.

12
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.970
There's something about those fat tires in the rear man,

13
00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:46.200
like as an old school muscle had dork.
That's what you want.

14
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.590
I saw a know moderator,
Matt de Andrea.
No,

15
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:52.080
he was on Adam Carolla's podcast and card does car guys.

16
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.390
He just posted a picture on Twitter of he saw your old sick fish spotted

17
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.670
somewhere.
That's funny.
It was not in a,
it was not in the,

18
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.250
it was in a bit of a sad state,
honestly.
It wasn't really just,

19
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.810
it was a little tired looking beat up one into the picture.
Yeah.
Someone had,

20
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:10.740
that's unfortunate.
Yeah.
It was a cool looking car when that thing came out.
Yeah.

21
00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:15.120
That football player,
Reggie,
what's his name?
Bush.
He bought it.
Oh really?

22
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.260
He bought it off.
The guy that I sold it to,
king hasn't been around.
Yeah.
It's a,

23
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.030
it's a great looking car that that year,
like all those years,
like 70,

24
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:28.280
71 those,
those second generation barracudas.

25
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.380
That's a special look and I think a lot of the Hellcat is in that same kind of,

26
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.830
it's pretty close.
It's pretty close.
But I really wish it was the same size.

27
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.960
A Hellcat is 125 or 130% inflated,

28
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:46.830
overinflated scale version of that.
That's those,
those 70,

29
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:48.930
71 Kutas,
uh,
are,

30
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.410
are the most valuable muscle cars that there are today.
Those hammy ones,
right.

31
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.750
The hemi Kudos are the rarest and most valuable of the,
of those.

32
00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:01.830
They are the ones that owe me,
uh,
get,
uh,
over,
over,

33
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.610
over like a million usually.
That's incredible.
For car,
that was what?

34
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:10.380
$30,000 new back in [inaudible] 75,000 it was.

35
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:14.130
It wasn't 5,000 I don't know.
My reverse math doesn't go back that far.
Really?

36
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.470
Let's take a guess.
Let's take guess.
It was like,

37
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.400
I think like five to 6,000 wouldn't be out of the question.
Hammy.
Kuda all right.

38
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.530
The name motor.
Let's go with 8,500 8,500 bucks.
Okay.

39
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.360
You go with 8,500.
What did I say?
30,000 I'm going to re reevaluate.

40
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.370
Think you need to reevaluate for 26 Hemi Cuda I'm going to play a dirty game.

41
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.970
Prices,
right.
I'm going to go right above.

42
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.840
It's Jamie coming in with a dollar fucking assault of winning the show for 26,

43
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.800
four 26 Hemi Cuda.
Which year?
[inaudible] 70 70 yeah.
That's the good year.

44
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.730
Well,
the two years of my favorite year.
70 and 71 71 and the same.

45
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:55.850
I think [inaudible] 70 one's got four headlights.

46
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.980
Oh seven two yeah.

47
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.640
70 also has the smaller grill face,
like the teeth are small on the front,

48
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:08.610
which is what I had.
I had a 70 where it's 71 has the full real,
yeah,
yeah,

49
00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:10.420
yeah.
It's really more aggressive.

50
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.150
I think 71 might be a little bit better looking to be honest with you.

51
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.150
I can't recall if one year is more valuable than the other.

52
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.470
71 I think is probably the best or the results in Jamie window sticker.

53
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.970
Yeah.

54
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.860
34333000430 $3 Oh my God.

55
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.240
The Dalton with Jamie's $1 wouldn't want it.
That's the cause.
Yeah.

56
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.640
Jamie pull up 1971 barracuda knows that is a,

57
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.240
that's my one.

58
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.640
I think my favorite look in any muscle cars in 1971 barracuda.

59
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.900
It's just like this aggressive American.
Yes.

60
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.690
Some,
I mean that is,

61
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.680
that is about as fucking aggressive as a grill can get.

62
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.560
That's got a mouth full of teeth.
It looks like a Barracuda really does that.

63
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.080
It does actually fucking nailed it man.
They were better at at actually,

64
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:05.830
I think naming things what they looked like back then.
God Damn,
that looks good.

65
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.940
I do still think the corvette stingray looks sting ray ish.

66
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.960
I think that still works a little bit.
Kind of.
Yeah.

67
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.870
That looks like a fucking Barracuda though,
is it?
Does that,

68
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:16.990
it looks like it's going to get you.

69
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.960
I just found a way for you to spend another million dollars Joe Rogan.

70
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:23.290
I would never buy one of those.
I don't like I'm,
I'm weird with Shit.

71
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:26.530
I don't like stock old cars.
What cars they drive like garbage,

72
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.190
but that'd be why zero interest in them.
You got your vent,
right?
Yeah,

73
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.150
but that's like a modified Bob pro touring chassis and all hundred percent.
Yeah.

74
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.700
And it's got a ls one.
Oh,
so it drives it more charged.
Yeah.

75
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.590
It tries like a normal car in the stock.
One of the of that year.
No,

76
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.250
it's not good.
You're lucky guy up the street.
He hates me.
He,

77
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.270
we,
we live in the same block and he's got an original,

78
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.680
he's one of those original guys.

79
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:53.550
He drives around with a paper boy hat on and drives around the neighborhood.

80
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.540
Said like lawn chair at cars and coffee and play fucking sock hop music.

81
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.840
Fuck those people in his face.
When I told him that it was,

82
00:05:01.841 --> 00:05:06.010
none of it was original except to shell outside.
I go,
it looks original.

83
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:09.370
It doesn't have a goddamn thing in it.
The inside,
I guess the,

84
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.510
the shape of the dashboards original fuck him.
Well he was just,
I was like,

85
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:18.070
look man,
I like them to drive like a car.
That works good.
Yeah.

86
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.180
Like why is it bad to upgrade the brakes?
No,
it is not.
You're fine.

87
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.040
But this whole thing that it's somehow or another,

88
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:27.490
they like doing a disservice to the vehicle by upgrading the brakes.

89
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.230
These people are assholes.
[inaudible] was the peace man.
It's an obstacle.

90
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.400
If you're going on the lawn at Pebble Beach,
you keep it original.

91
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.730
Other than that,
I mean especially,
look you ever,
I mean you,

92
00:05:37.731 --> 00:05:39.460
you love the depths of the Internet.

93
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.700
Look at Los Angeles driving circa 1960 and then Los Angeles driving today.

94
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.610
You know the heat,

95
00:05:48.611 --> 00:05:52.750
the traffic on an old car is not meant to handle that shit.

96
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:56.260
You want to drive an old car here,
you need to upgrade.

97
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:58.510
A few things breaks.

98
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.000
When I find out that a dude just drives an old car,

99
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:03.990
I give him an extra level of respect.
Yeah.

100
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>
