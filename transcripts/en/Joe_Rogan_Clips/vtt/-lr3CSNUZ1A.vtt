1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.990
Great coach now too.

2
00:00:00.991 --> 00:00:04.830
He was in a Colby Covington scorner this weekend and I told me after the fight,

3
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:08.610
he's like,
dude,
this kid's cardio is insane.
He's like,
it's insane.
He goes,

4
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:11.640
I think it might be like a,
just a natural gift that he has.
I mean,

5
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.320
he trains really,
really hard,
but he said his cardio it just off the charts.
Hmm.

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.960
Yeah.
Interesting.
It's funny how much attention,
he's like,
man,

7
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.650
I don't know if he wasn't that good before,

8
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:24.960
but it seems like he got a ton of fucking intention.

9
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:27.240
That's when he started talking shit.
Oh,
for sure.

10
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.720
I mean just talking shit or in the room.
Yeah,

11
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:34.230
well the talking shit got him to the dance,
but beating my,

12
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.140
the way he beat my ass,
everybody had to open their eyes up and go,
Huh.

13
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.850
But a lot of people had doubts.
They were like,
dos,

14
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.380
he's a fucking straight up assassin.
He's going in there again against,

15
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:45.800
they got fucked up.
Robbie Lawler,
Gow Merch,

16
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.590
Neil Magni like how's he going to beat this guy?
And he beat the shit out of him.

17
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:53.490
Yeah.
He literally beat him every round.
It was crazy like he watching,

18
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.990
I mean maybe you could give the first round of Dos Anjos and you know he was

19
00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:01.800
always a threat because he's still got power but Colby just on and it was like

20
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:06.030
Nick Diaz style just pop,
pop constantly.
Constant attack,

21
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.910
constant kicking them,
constant punching him.
I was very impressed.
Very impressed.

22
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.200
A watch,
see it.

23
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.170
So I can't really say very impressive men that the most impressive thing was the

24
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:17.330
pace he put on them cause they'll,

25
00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:22.320
Santos is known for his cardio and he had a real problem with that cardio when

26
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:25.590
he was at one 55 cause he had diminished his body so much and then he moves up

27
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:29.190
to one 70 and you're like,
well now he literally doubled his output.

28
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.110
If you look at the strikes per minute in the 155 pound division and then one 70

29
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:37.840
it was double at one 70 and still Colby melted him.

30
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.300
Just just stayed,
stayed on and kept that heat on.
It was crazy.
That's impressive.

31
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.950
Very impressive.
But now he's got tyrant.

32
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.150
So mad Tyron wants to fucking kill him.

33
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.900
That that's a different person like Tyron has.
It's a myth because he hates him.

34
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.470
It's all the shit talking Colby has been doing.
He did.

35
00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:58.980
He did interviews with people.
We told them don't bring up Colbys name.

36
00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:01.950
I don't want you to even bring up his name because he didn't want Colby getting

37
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.650
any attention.
But now it's too late.

38
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.310
Now he's got way anyone's name other than his brother all the time on any show

39
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.240
ever.
Period.
Ever.
If I ever get a fight now,

40
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.650
he should be happy.

41
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:18.990
That guy talks a lot of shit now because that's what gonna make them money.

42
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.853
You're right.

43
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.990
<v 1>I mean good for both of them.
Fuck yeah,
go for it.</v>

44
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.430
How do you feel about shed talking?

45
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.330
I was never shit talker but because I never wanted to be that guy.

46
00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:30.730
That Shit Talk Shit.
Come back it up.

47
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.660
So I like when people talk shit cause I'm gonna beat your ass anyway.

48
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.520
But you know it works for some.
It doesn't.
Like I said,
for me it was not,

49
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.820
I was never one of those guys,

50
00:02:39.821 --> 00:02:43.720
but it has been one of those things that like you see every,

51
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.010
every couple of years,
it's those one guy that stands out from talking shit,

52
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.080
and it's like I had worked for him.

53
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.440
Then you start to see everybody tried to trickle it.
Right.

54
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.990
<v 0>Well,
I think Connor did that for a lot of people,</v>

55
00:02:55.991 --> 00:02:58.930
but Colby saying some hilarious shit.
I'm gonna take this belt,

56
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.070
bring it to Donald Trump.

57
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.310
<v 2>He's going to
fucking,
it's fucking fun though,
man.</v>

58
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.280
Working Shell did chose like,
it's obviously fun,
like just,

59
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.800
it's obviously bullshit,
but it's,
it fucking works.
Yeah,
exactly.

60
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.540
But Chels still the best of you.
Make me go watch him talk about anything.
Yeah.
