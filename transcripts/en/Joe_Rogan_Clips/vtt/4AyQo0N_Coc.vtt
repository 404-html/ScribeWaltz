1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.000
There was a gentleman,
I just covered him on my,
on my youtube channel.
Oh,

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.520
I don't know who he is.
His name is,
I think Noah Carl.
He's a young,

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.330
I think postdoc at Cambridge University who from all I know is a very reasonable

4
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:20.460
gentlemen who had been invited to speak at a conference on intelligence.

5
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.530
And because of that,

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.830
a bunch of folks decided to put together an open letter arguing that Cambridge

7
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.790
University should not hire this guy.
And so on.
This is now become the,

8
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.270
the standard way by which the baits are our resolve.
You,

9
00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:39.870
you signed these open letters,

10
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:43.680
so for had another guy on and you should definitely check this,
this guy out.

11
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.510
His name is Alessandra Stromeyer.
Uh,
he is a physicist.

12
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.400
Do you know this case?
No.

13
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.950
He's a physicist at the University of Pisa who is also a,

14
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.640
who was a research scientist at cern,
the,
the nuclear research center in Geneva.

15
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.003
Uh,

16
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.020
he was invited to speak at a gender and theoretical physics conference.

17
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.250
Everything's about identity politics.

18
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.030
And of course the narrative was going to be,
you know,

19
00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:15.360
women are discriminated against in physics and you know,
we need to help them,

20
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.030
you know,
improve their lot and physics and so on.

21
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.620
So he got up and he presented Biblio metric data.

22
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.970
So let me just for your viewers,
explain what that is.
The real metric data is,

23
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.980
is uh,
data that quantifies science.
So for example,
if I want to know,

24
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.670
uh,
which disciplines sites,
which other discipline,

25
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.220
I will look at citation patterns across disciplines.

26
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:42.540
Does economics ever site physics?
That's physics ever sites,
uh,
economics,
right?

27
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.050
So bibliometric data is a way to parameterize science.

28
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.560
And so what he did is he looked at for a given job in physics,

29
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.950
if a woman gets a job versus a Furman gets a job,

30
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.440
how many citations did they have?

31
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.770
Citation is basically how many other people have cited your work when you

32
00:01:58.771 --> 00:02:01.980
published it.
So you and I might have had,
have published 50 papers each,

33
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.760
but you've been cited 10,000 times.
I haven't cited 2000 times.
Therefore,

34
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:06.990
your work is more influential,

35
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.180
even though we've both published the same amount of papers.

36
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.190
And he showed through very objective data that for a given position,

37
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.340
women were getting the jobs at much lower citations while that was construed as

38
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.480
terribly offensive,
terribly sexist,
you know,

39
00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:29.481
Nazi like and so over 1600 scientists using the,

40
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.880
the appellation particles for justice.
I'm not making this up.

41
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:40.881
What you can go to articles for just young Jamie can check it out yet and you

42
00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:41.161
can,

43
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:46.161
you can read their letter and it includes I think one or two of your former

44
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:47.350
guests who,
um,

45
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.440
have become a very anti fan of anti fan and not antifa.

46
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.750
Uh,
uh,
because to me they're,
they're sounding like intellectual cowers and fools.

47
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.260
Who were these people?
Uh,
I think one of them is Sean Carroll.
Uh,

48
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.030
you know who that is?
I think he's feeling shore's been on several times.
Yeah.

49
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.200
So he's on that list and I don't know,
I don't want to misspeak,

50
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:12.130
but I think maybe Neil degrasse Tyson is on it,
but maybe not.
So that one,

51
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.350
that one I'll,
I'll,
I'll hold off on that one.

52
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.340
But definitely Sean Carroll is on it because I've even tagged him and I said,

53
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:21.760
hey,
come on my show.
That's discuss it.
So the letter was basically,

54
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.110
it starts off and it says,
we will not tolerate that.

55
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:28.450
Someone within our community,
I'm,
I'm paraphrasing,

56
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.280
will question the humanity of anyone based on their race,

57
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:36.610
their gender,
their gender orientation.
He didn't no such thing.

58
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.940
All he did was report bibliometric data to either support the contention that

59
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:45.670
women in physics were being discriminated against or not,

60
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.970
that should not yield a,

61
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.630
an open letter that chastises him and the way that they did,

62
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.220
not the only thing that he did incorrectly in my view.
And he's admitted to it.

63
00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:59.020
He came on my show recently.

64
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.500
At one point during the presentation,

65
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.650
he showed his bibliometric profile versus two other women that had gotten a job

66
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.590
over him.
So he personalized it and,
and,
and doing that,

67
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.010
some people thought that that was inappropriate and that's fair.

68
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:21.370
Maybe it's not a nice thing to do to present,
you know,

69
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.530
your CV versus someone else and a public conference.
Maybe we can discuss that.

70
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.780
But the idea that we can't use bibliometrics objective scientific data to either

71
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:35.200
prove or disprove a narrative is insane,

72
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.340
and yet 1600 people decided to sign that letter.
That does seem ridiculous,

73
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:41.590
especially when it's an accusatory narrative.

74
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.510
You're accusing people of sexual discrimination and then the scientific data

75
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:50.260
shows otherwise exactly what they're looking for,
a quality of outcome,
right?

76
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:53.340
They're looking for an equal amount of female physicist and sal amount.

77
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.840
That's you just,

78
00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:58.390
you're not going to get an equal amount of people interested in it.
So then you,

79
00:04:58.391 --> 00:04:59.620
what you really have to shows,

80
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.680
you have to determine that there's been something that's holding those people

81
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:04.120
back from achieving that goal.

82
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:07.330
Is there some sort of a concerted effort to keep women out of that field?

83
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.750
That's what should be demonstrated and when you demonstrate that,

84
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.160
I think here's the,
here's the glass half full version of that.

85
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.280
You're looking at that,
the blue bibliometric data.

86
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.120
What that shows is that people are encouraging women to get into this because

87
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:25.960
it's the opposite,
right?
That instead of them being held back,
they're actually,

88
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.231
they're,

89
00:05:26.231 --> 00:05:29.980
they're looking to even out the playing field and help these women along.

90
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.430
The problem with that is then it makes it look like the women aren't as capable

91
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:37.210
as the mat,
so not as effective as the men with their work and you know,

92
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:39.820
that's bad for everybody.
That's bad for women and for men.

93
00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:42.730
It's bad for science because it makes it look like you're not being objective,

94
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:46.780
which is what all we want.
Every everyone who's not a scientist like myself.

95
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.990
What I want more than anything is to know that you're,

96
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.760
if you're a scientist,
I want to know that what you're telling me is a fact.

97
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.840
What I don't want is your own political spin on that fact because you don't want

98
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:04.430
to be criticized at work by radical feminists are radical leftist or any people

99
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.640
that might in some way potentially misconstrue your actions and your thoughts as

100
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:14.230
being sexist or what,
or fill in the blank,
homophobic,
transphobic,
whatever,

101
00:06:14.231 --> 00:06:17.690
whatever the fuck it is that you're scared of.
I don't want to hear that.

102
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.000
What I want to hear is that you're looking at reality.

103
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.900
There are brilliant women out there,
there's brilliant men out there,

104
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.500
and a lot of those brilliant women choose not to do the same fields is brilliant

105
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:31.310
men.
And as long as no one's holding them back,

106
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.120
that shouldn't be a problem to problem is got to be in someone being held back,

107
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.600
someone discriminating,
someone trying to keep you out.

108
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.410
And you Kinda have to demonstrate that.
And I'm sure that exists.

109
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:46.340
I'm sure that exists.

110
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.590
I'm sure there's women out there that are hearing this right now that have

111
00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:52.850
experienced all sorts of discrimination,
sexual discrimination,
sexual harassment,

112
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.430
and they have their own personal stories.
This is true,

113
00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.140
but that not is not necessarily why the data reflects that.

114
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:04.520
There's more men that are successful at this.
It could seriously,
this is,

115
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:08.790
this is what people are really uncomfortable with.
Seriously represented.

116
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.090
There's differences in the sexist.
