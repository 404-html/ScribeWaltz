1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.440
Well,
the signal to noise ratio in terms of like people tweeting,

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.760
it's almost mostly noise.
Oh,
it's nice.
There's a few people that are great.

3
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:12.900
You could fall a few people that are really posting about real news and it is

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.930
for some journalists,
17 of them.

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.260
I think journalists are maybe the best people to follow on Twitter right now it

6
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.990
seems like.
But the problem is who's a journalist?

7
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:25.970
There's very few real journalism takes a long time.
Yeah,

8
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.860
it's expensive.
Like real investigative journalism.

9
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:31.260
But I've had some of these guys in my podcast,
they come on,
they go,

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.260
they've ruined their life.
They spend five years looking into something.

11
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:35.041
Nobody cares about it.

12
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:37.320
They figured out it was true and nobody wants to talk to them.

13
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.840
They will have white hair.
They're families hate them.

14
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.260
They live in little apartment in New York City.
That's a journalist.
Well,

15
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:45.890
sometimes people do journalism,
right?
And they,

16
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.740
they do spend a long time working on the project and it's in something like the

17
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:53.580
New York Times and no one cares.
No one cares.
Like the thing about Trump,

18
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.890
like the report on Trump,
this scathing report,

19
00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:56.970
they thought it was going to bring them down.

20
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.000
Literally it was in and out of the news cycle on a day or two.
Yeah.

21
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.330
They don't care.
That guy just pops an extra Adderall and doesn't give up.

22
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:05.880
He doesn't care.
He doesn't give a fuck.

23
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:09.000
He is the only guy that should ever write a motivational HealthSouth hop

24
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.730
the secret.
Right.
Whenever the secret is he's got it.
I think it's speed.

25
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.860
It's speed.
You think he's really,
yeah.
Yeah,
I do.
Yeah.
I think it's speed.

26
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.240
I think he's on something.

27
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.930
I mean I think this is the only way that it makes sense to me that a 70 plus

28
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:28.410
year old man has that much energy.
A guy doesn't exercise,

29
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:32.550
eats fast food and he's fucking bouncing off the walls and he can campaign for

30
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:37.280
days and days,
just ooze AFC double downs and flay a fishes.

31
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.940
And let me ask you this,
how often if he gets his dick sucked?
Hmm,
good question.

32
00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:46.320
Who's doing it?
Great question and not asked enough.
Probably not that much.

33
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:50.310
I don't think a guy like that is driven by sex.
I don't get that.

34
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:51.940
Maybe he can be,
but yeah,

35
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.120
Millennia seems to be not into it as much.
It seems a little upset with them.

36
00:01:57.121 --> 00:02:00.660
She seems a bit cold,
but there she Slovenian or something,
something like that.

37
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.500
They're called.
I don't know.
That's some of the generalizations.
They're white,

38
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:07.830
so I can generally say what I want about them.
Ciao.
Okay.

39
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.920
Let me say what the Hell I want out eastern Europeans.

40
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.320
Can I not have Slovenians you can.
Okay,
thank you.
Ah,
she's called.
Well,
she,

41
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:18.760
I think she's a little annoyed with them.
You know what I mean?

42
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.200
It's very humiliating for her.
They had the pest life.
Yeah.

43
00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:25.380
Up until he ran for president.
He really,
I mean,
imagine telling his kids,

44
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:28.620
he's like,
I know you got world billionaires.
You'll party everyday.

45
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.090
You do coke with impunity.
It's New York City nightclub.
When you boarded that,

46
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:35.670
you'd go to Europe,
do it on a boat.
When you boarded that,

47
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:39.330
you go to some origene Athens.
That's all done right.
But we're going to Canton,

48
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:43.800
Ohio and I'm giving a speech.
And you can stand there because,

49
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.790
and every camera,

50
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.090
every news reporter is going to watch every move you make for the rest of your

51
00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:50.480
life and begin to crawl up your ass with the microscope to,

52
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.630
and everyone hates you and some of them might be going to jail.
I mean,
we don't,

53
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:57.530
we really don't know what's going on with this Mueller investigation.

54
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.171
I think a lot.

55
00:02:58.171 --> 00:03:00.880
I mean I think it's going to disappointing everybody's preparing us for

56
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.640
disappointment.
Everybody has prepared us for disappointment.
Yeah.

57
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.690
CNN is actually was saying that that don't expect much.

58
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.080
It's like when you get a report card and you tell your parents,
you're like,
no,

59
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:13.390
I've changed but I'm still me.

60
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.200
I'm still the guy who gets high before he goes into school and was caught

61
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.280
smoking by the priests.

62
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:24.400
Like I used to get caught smoking weed by the priest who's driving it in my

63
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:27.400
Catholic school and he would drive me to the school.
So I would be like,
yeah,

64
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:28.720
I've made some changes,

65
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.470
but I'm still very much that person that you guys raced.

66
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.670
So that I think is what the molar report is going to be like Trump.

67
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.660
But the thing about Trump is he's corrupt.
He's a con man.
You know,

68
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:44.470
he said he this whole wall that there was no wall.
Well this is not coming.

69
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.730
Little links,
the walls not as some wall.
There's no wall.

70
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.090
This is a little little signs.
It's a finished the wall.
But this part,

71
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:54.150
this part of a wall,
there's more of a,

72
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.360
there's more of a wall of raw around houses in Belair.
Right.

73
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.790
Then there is at the border.
Well,
you know,
it's a smaller area pillar.
It's,
yeah.

74
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:06.730
And there's probably more of a reason to have a wall,
you know,

75
00:04:06.731 --> 00:04:10.090
and the people that run bel Air I probably more serious.
Yeah,

76
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.820
that's definitely something that,
you know,
I,

77
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:16.150
I don't know about this whole wall thing.

78
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.380
I really feel like it was one of those campaign slogans that he got stuck with,

79
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.650
you know,
build that wall.
And then once he got in he's like,
oh Christ,

80
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:26.050
I really got to build this fucking thing.
It's a slogan,

81
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:30.040
someone whispered into his ear,
you think Ann Coulter probably said,

82
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:33.520
get out there and say build the wall.
And he goes,
that's good.
I mean,

83
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:37.690
he just went out there,
build that wall.
I love the one of the speeches,

84
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.250
he doesn't really build things.
He lent his name to be franchised.
Yeah,

85
00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:44.870
he definitely does that.
He's not a bit like this idea that he's like a bit,

86
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.850
the things he's built are disgusting.
If you go to Atlantic city,

87
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.440
what can any building he has built it is to,
Chris Hedges wrote a book,

88
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.530
he's an interesting guy.
He wrote a book called America,

89
00:04:56.531 --> 00:05:00.520
the farewell tour and he goes,
he went,
he went to Trump tower in Atlantic city.

90
00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:03.490
He goes,
there's junkies in the bathrooms,

91
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:06.910
does like rats running around is falling apart.
And he's like,

92
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:10.020
that's kind of what you know America will be,
but no anything he's built.

93
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.800
He's not nice.
Did you watch it?

94
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:15.520
There was a documentary about an architect called costs us the carry on us and

95
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:20.410
he,
and a lot of the documentary is about him convincing Trump to not make his

96
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:24.700
building gold in New York City and I,

97
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.130
and it's like,
is it golden New York City or no,
but it's golden.

98
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.940
Vegas is gold a lot of places,
but like he was going to ruin the,

99
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.980
the the downtown of Manhattan with a gold building.

100
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.940
Why is that ruining it though?
A gold building.
Why not?

101
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.880
You've spent too much time on the west cost,
but why is that bad?

102
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:45.760
Why is it bad for it to be one car?
It was a better,

103
00:05:45.761 --> 00:05:49.510
if it's all black or all white or silver,
it's a look.
It has a feel.

104
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.200
You can't come in with a gold building.
It's not Vegas.
It's not Atlantic city.

105
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:56.950
This is not right.
You know,
like Mandalay Bay,
what goes on in a gold.

106
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.820
I've never looked at a gold building and said,

107
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:00.800
I bet what goes on there is honest,
like,

108
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.960
and decent gold buildings should be for doing coke and losing money.

109
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.530
That's what it's about.
You don't walk you up,
call building and get a checkup.

110
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.390
That's a good point.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a very good point.
That's what it's Gaudy.

111
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.260
It's disgusting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
God,
he is a weird thing,
right?
Like who's that?

112
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.160
Who's that good for?

113
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.370
Like when you go to a place and it's got opulent Chandelier's guilded furniture

114
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:30.080
or sociopaths who sacrifice human beings.
That's the way they want to lift.

115
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:34.190
They want to live in a,
uh,
a palatial opulent environment.

116
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.850
And then just,
you know,
I think Matt Taibbi said this,

117
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.010
he said that Trump is a poor person's idea of a rich person.

118
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.890
Absolutely.
That's what,
when a rich person's thing,

119
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.050
when a poor person thinks about a rich person,
they think,
oh,

120
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:50.720
he's got his name on his jet and he's got his name on its building.

121
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:54.050
And the guys I grew up in long island,
if somebody went to them and said,
hey,

122
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.630
you could own the Miss Universe pageant.

123
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.910
You could have a building with your name on it.
You could be in the WWE,

124
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.520
that would be amazing.
You'd be a winner.

125
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.880
They would be a winter where I grew up in long island,
that would be,

126
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.930
that is the highest you can go.
So I think that's kind of what it is.
It's a very,

127
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.260
what's,
see what's appealing.
That's also what's appealing about him.

128
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.930
What's appealing about him is there is no veneer,
right?

129
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.670
You don't get the idea that you're being played,
you get the idea,
you know,

130
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:25.760
you're kind of being played,
but you're being played on a level that you accept.

131
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.710
It's like when you go buy a car and you know,
the salesman,

132
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.710
he and I used to be in sales,
so like when I'll go to buy something,

133
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:33.650
sometimes I know the salesman needs to the sale cause I used to.

134
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.970
So like sometimes I'll be like,
yeah,
whatever it is what it is,
you know,
I just,

135
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.000
I'll do it.
That's kind of with Trump,
you know,
you're being sold,

136
00:07:41.001 --> 00:07:43.340
but you're okay with it.
You let it happen.

137
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.540
What do you think's going to come after him?
Um,

138
00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:50.060
it seems like he's throwing a giant monkey wrench into the gears.

139
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.950
Twitter is any indication,
a prolonged civil conflict,
uh,

140
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.693
where there will be,

141
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.530
where some will emerge as a few different nation.

142
00:08:00.531 --> 00:08:04.640
States will barter with each other.
Um,
I don't know,

143
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:08.880
maybe Joe Biden and then nothing.
He's got no chance.
He's,
he's who do you,

144
00:08:08.881 --> 00:08:12.410
who's coming and she's got no chance.
Bernie.

145
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:15.470
They hate now they hate burning.
You know,
a lot of people hate Bernie.

146
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.140
What happened?
I don't know.
He just missed it.

147
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.330
Some guy on his staff was accused of sexual assault.
Oh.

148
00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:22.520
And now they hate burning.
He's a rapist.
Well,
that's,
you know,

149
00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:27.350
that's what happens.
Bernie's,
he's a white,
straight male.
He doesn't get it.

150
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.740
He doesn't get it.
Plus he has like two houses.

151
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:35.860
He's worth like $300,000.
You know that offense people does.

152
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.170
Yeah.
How'd you get that money off the backs of poor people in the country,

153
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:42.280
by the way,
where people make that a in and hour on youtube.
You know,

154
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:47.030
some people do.
What's
Logan,
Paul and all those guys,

155
00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:51.440
those guys,
you know,
you see people in la,
I'll see a kid in la on a skateboard.

156
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:52.430
I'm like,
he's a millionaire.

157
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.360
He owns three houses because he used youtube live streamer.
Yeah.

158
00:08:56.361 --> 00:08:58.070
He's probably playing video games on Twitter.
