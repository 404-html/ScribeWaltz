WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.040
You had a drinking thing for awhile too,
Huh?
Yeah.
That's,

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.840
that's one that,
uh,
that gets a lot of fighters.
Yeah,
it does.

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.760
Um,
but it's one that,
you know,
on that,
that,
that

4
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.030
it ticks me off and it don't,
it ticks you off.
Yeah.
How so you'd,

5
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.260
a lot of it was ran through to the hometown,
you know,

6
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.160
and the troubles that I,
that I got in with the,
um,

7
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.310
TMZ,
stuff like that,
you know,
look,

8
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.470
the incidents that happened were petty small,

9
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.520
and if it was,
it wasn't in Youngstown,

10
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.880
it would've never made news stuff that kind of happens like my shit.

11
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.650
No BB guns and in a four wheeler,
yeah.
I shot a,
a kid,
we were playing around.

12
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:52.800
I was taking care of them.
And this is the truth of this story,

13
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:57.120
taking care of them.
I was putting a,
a big lake in my backyard and,
uh,

14
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.800
I got the country boy.
I mean,
I want,

15
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.060
I went out and rented two excavators and some bobcat's and started putting,
uh,

16
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.000
the pond in this,
uh,

17
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.660
this guy I was helping out.
He knows how to run the excavators.
So I,

18
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.720
he needed work.
He had no money.

19
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.580
I was taking care of him and his kids over at the house.
He's,
he's working.

20
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.770
So long story short,

21
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.550
after about five days I come home and he's in the pond or lake just in his

22
00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:29.880
underwear playing around.
I grabbed the BB gun,
I'm joking around with him,

23
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.181
you know,

24
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:34.320
cause we were shooting targets for a couple of days in between work and I shoot

25
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:35.150
him in the,
uh,

26
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.720
on the arm for 42 years old at the 41 years old at the time too.

27
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:44.130
So it wasn't a kid.
He gets out,
he's like,
ah,
you shot me.
And,
and uh,

28
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:47.220
he's crying about it and everything else and next thing you know,
he,

29
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.690
he's cool though.
He gets out of these,
it's on Facebook and he's Giggling,

30
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.210
laughing about it and he stays at my house that night.
His kids come over,

31
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:58.230
I'm feeding them,
we're having cookouts the next day and little things.

32
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:02.220
I don't know that I'm glad that I'm not involved in no more or I don't put

33
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:05.350
myself in that situation.
So He's,

34
00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:09.990
he stays for two days after that at my house.
And uh,

35
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.860
his uncle comes there who worked for the sheriff,

36
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:18.750
the local sheriff's department and it goes,
hey,
is so on and so here.
And I said,

37
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.250
yeah,
he was,
I haven't seen him.
No.
And he goes,
okay,
listen.
He goes,
Kelly,

38
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.000
I'm coming here to tell you.
So that way the news,
the media,

39
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:28.170
everything else don't come.

40
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.870
He has a warrant out for his arrest and tell him,
you know,

41
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.110
if he comes back,
call us.
So he leaves,

42
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.350
I go walk it through the house and they come.

43
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.960
Brian comes down the steps and I was like,
do jetty,
get the hell out of here.

44
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.950
I was like,
I didn't know anything of this.
You having a warrant,
blah,
blah,
blah,

45
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:50.130
blah.
He goes over and passes out on my couch.

46
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.860
I call his uncle,
hey,
you want him?
He's here.
So he finds out,

47
00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:58.740
he ends up running out of the house and they catch them,
you know,

48
00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:01.150
that night or whatever,
they take him in,

49
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.310
he does two months and a county jail,
gets out,

50
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.280
takes his uniform off,
walks over to the sheriff's department,

51
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.170
Sheriff's department and presses.
Charges on you.
Yes.
For shooting with a BB gun.

52
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.453
Yes.

53
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.000
And a buddy of mine who was there when it happened was video in it.

54
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.830
His girlfriends laughing in the background,
you know when it happened.

55
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.470
But that was,
it was just a video of it happening.

56
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.420
He'd sold it to a TMZ and next thing you know,

57
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.370
I ended up getting served or whatnot.

58
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.080
My attorney calls me also and it says,
Hey,
go down,

59
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.850
turn yourself in.
You know,
it's a federal assault charge.

60
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.360
Yeah.
Kinds of federal assault.
Yes.
Yeah.

61
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.550
And that was it.
And again,
it was all over money.

62
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.000
It was a drawn out case.
I'm supposed to have been beat.

63
00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.250
And it turned to that over a BB gun,
but a guy and he said it was an assault.

64
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.510
So I always trying to get from you.
You got nine grand.
And it was supposed to,

65
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:07.420
when he filed a civil suit a couple of months into this,

66
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.750
the criminal charges are supposed to be dropped at that point because prosecutor

67
00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:14.230
and,
and everybody knew that it was all about money.

68
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.220
So they ever going to drop the criminal charge.
They never did.

69
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.310
And uh,
it goes back in Youngstown,
you know,

70
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.170
I was out in the public eye and someone that people would eight,
they had it out.

71
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.280
They have

72
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.280
<v 1>to for people to understand how big star you are in Youngstown.
I mean,</v>

73
00:04:31.281 --> 00:04:33.800
I remember at the time,
I remember reading stories,

74
00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:38.030
see in news clips mean Youngstown's not a big place and other than ray,
boom,

75
00:04:38.031 --> 00:04:40.730
boom man seen,
he's not a whole lot of like really famous people,

76
00:04:40.731 --> 00:04:42.440
especially fighters had come out of Youngstown.

77
00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:45.940
But you were a fucking giant celebrity in that.

78
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.990
<v 0>Yeah.
And that was Kinda my,
my bad on that.
That's where I think the,</v>

79
00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:51.940
the fault.
What else?

80
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.470
<v 1>Probably hard for you to recognize.
You're not even 30 years old.
Yeah.</v>

81
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.300
All this shit is going on.

82
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.740
<v 0>Yeah.
And it's true.
And I'm not looking for that as an excuse.</v>

83
00:05:00.741 --> 00:05:02.930
You know when I say it,
but it is true.
I looked,

84
00:05:02.931 --> 00:05:07.040
I looked at myself as everybody else.
Right.
I think that was the issue

85
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.790
<v 1>you hadn't recognized yet that you're in some weird place we have to watch.</v>

86
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.770
<v 0>I felt like if I go to the bar and somebody goes,</v>

87
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:16.110
boy you Kelly Paulis been here three days,
he's a lush.

88
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.820
My argument was I got every right to be here just like you do.
Matter of fact,

89
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.420
I have more of a right.
You know,
I'm retired,
I've got my money put away.

90
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.170
You're probably drinking your weekly pay away.
That was my,

91
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.810
my thought processes,

92
00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:35.700
thought process of that and it was probably wasn't right.
You know,
because the,

93
00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:40.701
it comes down to is you are a big fish in a little pond and it's a small city.

94
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.620
And I think that by being out there,
I brought a lot on myself because of that.

95
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.780
It is what it is.
Unfortunately,
as an athlete,
you,
you can't do that.
And,

96
00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:56.760
um,
so that happened over a period of time and the word got around and a lot of

97
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.800
anger,
you know,
you have some jealous,
some angry,

98
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.210
there's some who just didn't like me.
So just so much fun for them to gossip.

99
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.350
Yeah,
exactly.
Because what else is really not beating up young song?
I love it.

100
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.820
It made me who I am.

101
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.650
But if you really look up young Saunders not drained a lot to talk about besides

102
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:19.550
the fact that we do put out the most NFL players,
the per capita really?
Oh,

103
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:22.940
absolutely.
Youngstown does.
Why is that?
You think?
I don't know.
Is averages,

104
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.210
there's just some,
some bad ass dudes from,
from Youngstown and it is,

105
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.790
I don't know why.
I mean,
even the boxing part of it,

106
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.970
if you truly break down the five rural champs from such a small city and 36

107
00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:38.310
years as,
as it came up with the other world champs besides the rate boom,

108
00:06:38.311 --> 00:06:39.290
mass seedy area,

109
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:43.750
Roya Roya actually held the title in the same way class Ron,

110
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.140
the same exact time that Massey and he did.
You had Jeff Lampkin,
uh,

111
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.860
Greg Richardson.
And,
uh,

112
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.320
then you had a handful of other guys like rolling Cummings and fighters out

113
00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:56.360
there that were making noise out of Youngstown,

114
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.340
that guy can cigarette cigarettey who fought Chavez and Comacho out of

115
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.150
Youngstown.
But,
um,

116
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.560
being at being at being there like that,

117
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.740
it brought a lot of attention and people who wanted,
wanted,
you know,

118
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:11.480
and there was a lot of angry people.

119
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.620
Was it weird growing up there and then becoming a famous guy there?
Yeah,
it is.

120
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.610
Because again,
you know,
you don't,
people will tell you,
hey,

121
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.070
when you get to that level,
when you wouldn't have rolled title,

122
00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:26.390
Shit's going to change man.
And you're going,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Okay.
You think,

123
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:29.570
you know,
right?
Like you're going,
yeah,
I got what you're saying.

124
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.190
And then it happens and you win it.
And it's so true when they say overnight,

125
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.910
like you're not,
you know,
more,
you know,
like you're,

126
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:40.220
you can't be yourself no more.
It's a,

127
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.310
everything changes and it comes down to the person.

128
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:46.670
Even though if you don't want to change and you like living your life the way

129
00:07:46.671 --> 00:07:51.340
you did two days ago,
uh,
fortunately you can't,
you know,
and it's,

130
00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:53.120
it's a hard,
and it's something that

131
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.760
you got to learn how to deal with that.
That wasn't my choice though.

132
00:07:58.761 --> 00:07:59.750
You know what I mean by that?

133
00:07:59.751 --> 00:08:02.600
My choice wasn't to go out and act like a jack alone.

134
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.320
My choice was kind of just be me though.
And um,

135
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.690
you just did what you wanted to do.
I did.

136
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.760
And then it just became a big issue because you were a famous guy.

137
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.070
Yes.
And the,

138
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:20.060
another issue on top of that came to was where I could actually take the blame

139
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:24.080
for this.
And,
and I honestly,
Cam a lot of it came down to,

140
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.650
and everybody's different,
so I'm not,
I'm speaking for myself.

141
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.110
I trained my ass off when I trained,
you know,
I was a six,

142
00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:35.730
seven hours a day type guy.
And,
uh,

143
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.170
that's what got me to throw as many punches as I did around,
you know,

144
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:43.280
and I was in great shape for every fight.
I sacrificed a lot of things.

145
00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:46.580
I gave up a lot.
You know,
even starting from high school,
you know,

146
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:49.550
being in the amateurs and,
and just turning pro right out of high school,

147
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.650
I missed a lot of things.
My mentality was when,
you know,
I had time,

148
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:59.610
I was gonna,
I was gonna live,
I was going to live like my friends who were 19,

149
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:03.930
20,
2124 and that was the process of it.
Um,

150
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.770
I do believe though,
at a point,
especially after I retired,

151
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:12.600
that it got a little got a little out of hand.
Absolutely.
You know,

152
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:16.110
and I'm not going to be the person to sit here and say,
it doesn't,
you know,

153
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.580
it did.
I'm not naive enough to say that,
well,
you know better than anybody,

154
00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:23.780
but the rumors were always that you were drinking a lot,
but,

155
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.920
and that was affecting your career.
It mailed to some point.

156
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.600
I don't think it did.
People say,

157
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:34.290
use the fact that Hopkins beat me and that was this.
That was the reason.

158
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.790
And that's why I retired so young and it wasn't,
it truly wasn't.
Um,

159
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.010
maybe some of this stuff I was doing,

160
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:44.310
especially as I got older in between flights to drinking.

161
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.070
I think that that could have,
that may have heard a little bit.

162
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.090
I don't think it was enough to make any significant changes in my career,

163
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.320
to be honest with you.
Um,
but you know,
who knows what that,

164
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.990
if I didn't,
we'll never know again,

165
00:09:57.991 --> 00:10:01.230
but I lived up and do I got anything to regret about it?
No.

166
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.500
Do you still live in Youngstown?
Yeah,
we're on the outside in the suburbs,

167
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.600
you know,
is it,
I mean,

168
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.400
it's gotta be strange to have grown up there,
been a child there,

169
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.520
and then become an internationally famous world champion boxer and celebrity and

170
00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:22.020
still stay there.
Yeah.
It's the world changes.

171
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.680
And you're still Kelly Pavlick and I think after I retired,

172
00:10:25.681 --> 00:10:29.400
as far as some of the mistakes I've come to where I should have gotten out,

173
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.750
maybe come out here to California or go to a Newmont.
Yeah,

174
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.210
right.
I don't,
yeah,
we're working on it.
Plenty of room.
Yeah.
