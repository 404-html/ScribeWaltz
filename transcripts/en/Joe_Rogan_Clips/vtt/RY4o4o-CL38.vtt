1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.860
The joe rogan experience most because he enjoyed it.

2
00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:06.270
It was just barely breaking even.

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.300
But it's probably one of those toy stores where it was mostly like puppets and

4
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:10.170
like,
like you know,

5
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:13.930
educational toys and it wasn't like Gi joes and they had everything.

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.600
They had a lot of stuff.

7
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:19.020
They had regular like action figures for comic books and stuff like that.

8
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.973
What are you doing?

9
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.850
I just [inaudible] there's this documentary on Netflix right now called the toys

10
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:27.890
that made us,
and it's very interesting and like you learn so much like a,

11
00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:31.230
showed the history of Barbie Barbie started off as a hooker.

12
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.490
Like it was a hooker doll.
The in Germany.
Come on.
Yeah,
swear to God.

13
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.380
Like they uh,
Google please.
Yeah,
there was this true,
the Barbie doll.

14
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.580
There was a doll that looked exactly like Barbie that they used to guys used to

15
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.730
like carry around and give to women.
And it was like a way of like,
uh,

16
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.770
a flirting with a woman like,
Hey,
I,
this is what I want to see you wearing later.

17
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.490
And so this,
uh,

18
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.210
person came over to Germany and saw this doll and modeled Barbie right after

19
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:03.510
this hooker doll.
And so if you look at the original Barbie,

20
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.070
but what it was modeled off of it,

21
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:07.900
it was just like a creepy looking hooker checking.

22
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.940
I'm sure you can find a picture of a,

23
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.590
but this documentary is so amazing cause it goes through like all the famous

24
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.880
enters your mind.
We like,

25
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:17.780
I just definitely gonna look into the history of Barbie and no,

26
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.750
it's just a documentary.
It just goes through the toys,
the toys that made us,

27
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.600
it's so good.
And it goes through like Heman and GI.

28
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:28.530
Joe Gi Joe is interesting because you know that back in the day,
you know,

29
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.980
releasing a guy doll like,
no,
we're not gonna make no guide.
All,

30
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:32.910
no one's going to play that.

31
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:36.720
But Gi Joe ended up being like one of the biggest toys in the whole entire
world.

32
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.810
That's why you had to call in an action figure.
I used to have a Steve Austin,

33
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:42.970
$6 million man action figures.
You had to call it an action figure them.

34
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.360
And that's where action figures came from.
Gi Joe.

35
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:50.190
That was the way around the doll thing.
Yeah.
Smart move.
Because dolls,

36
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.210
yeah,
dolls are not for boys.
Not Funny,

37
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.230
but you could have dinosaurs,
right?
Raw.
What does that sort of doll?

38
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.780
It's a doll.
It's a dinosaur.
A doll.
One of them was,
which one was it?
Not Gi Joe.

39
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:11.310
One of those was like a,
they made a whole cartoon and just made a toy.
He man.

40
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.520
Yeah.
It was just designed as a marketing tool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They decided how do,

41
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:19.950
how are we going to fight star wars toys?
And they're like,

42
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.690
let's make it bigger and stronger.

43
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:24.750
So if you see a he man doll next to his star wars twice,
like,

44
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:27.330
well here's this little pussy doll,
you know,
so,

45
00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:31.260
and then they made a cartoon around it and uh,
it's really interesting.

46
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:34.350
Like you wouldn't think it would be that interesting.
But even the Barbie part,

47
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.980
it was like,
wow,
this is fascinating.
And how they changed barbies.

48
00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:41.670
Look every year,
like nadir sexier made her like her waist.

49
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.420
Like she gets so much shit because her waist is really small.
And like stuff.

50
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.020
That's because when you put clothes on for it to fit and look right,

51
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:50.810
that's how they had to make her waist just,

52
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.190
it was more for like the style of the clothes she was wearing,

53
00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:54.390
not of what it looked like.

54
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.960
It was more like just to have the doll work right it,

55
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.153
it's really cool.

56
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.640
<v 1>It's got to be fucking super hard to be a check and look at like those dolls and</v>

57
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:10.090
look at your body and go,
what in the fuck?
This is not impossible.
Yeah.
You know,

58
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:12.340
cause a lot of those dolls,
they're not possible.

59
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.080
<v 0>Well,
what's really funny is one of the things in the fifties</v>

60
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.930
<v 1>what does he say?
There is the only dog.
Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.550
The build Lilli doll or something by literally dog can be bought and tobacco

62
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:24.940
shops,
bars and adult themes.
Toy stores,
Gerber rights.

63
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.940
Men got Lily Dallas's gag gifts at bachelor parties,

64
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:29.710
put them on their car dashboard,

65
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:33.820
dangled them from the rear view mirror or gave them to girlfriends as suggestive

66
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:38.080
keepsake.
What does that mean?
Suggestive keepsake.
Hey look at this,

67
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:39.150
but I want to say,
wow.

68
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.370
This prodo Barbie was just shy of a foot tall with bulging breasts and platinum

69
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:48.910
blonde ponytail made up for a night on the town with red puckered lips and blue

70
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.140
eyeshadow.
Wow.
Interesting.
The Journal,
German dolls,

71
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.940
heavy makeup and suggestively arched eyebrows didn't carry over to the American

72
00:03:57.941 --> 00:04:00.370
version.
That's interesting,
Huh?

73
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.310
They tried to lighten it up a little.

74
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.100
<v 0>Yeah.
Then they even go into like how her eyes are looking to the side,</v>

75
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.720
not right at you.

76
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.940
<v 1>Neat you.
If she could fuck you in this alley.
Yes.
To becoming,
Oh God,</v>

77
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.020
they're dead comics for this little adult.
To what?

78
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.030
Your comic.
Oh,
that's hilarious.
Lily was witty,

79
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.250
irreverent and sexually uninhibited.

80
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.340
One stripped summarize by Lord,
who's Lord.
Lord of the writer.

81
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.233
The writer.
Okay.

82
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.960
Shows lily covering her naked body with a newspaper explaining to a friend.

83
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.490
We had a fight and he took back all the presence he gave me.
Get it.

84
00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:46.370
She's naked.
Another shows Lilly in a bikini.

85
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.810
When a police man tells her that two piece swimsuits are illegal,
she says,

86
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.940
oh,
and in your opinion,
which part should I take off that dirty bitch?

87
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.520
<v 0>One interesting thing too is like,</v>

88
00:04:58.521 --> 00:05:00.420
you know how Barbara gets so much shit for him?
You know,

89
00:05:00.421 --> 00:05:02.750
I like being a fatter woman,
having a,
you know,

90
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.030
the body issues and stuff like that.
Shit.

91
00:05:05.031 --> 00:05:09.290
There was like a workout Barbie and she had a little scale and the scale was,

92
00:05:09.291 --> 00:05:12.320
had a sticker on it and it was stuck at 110 pounds.

93
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.240
And then there was also a book that came with it,
like a cookbook or,

94
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.010
or like a book that's like how to lose weight on the back.
It says,

95
00:05:19.011 --> 00:05:20.570
don't eat instead of that

96
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.500
dude that's dark.
Yeah.

97
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>
