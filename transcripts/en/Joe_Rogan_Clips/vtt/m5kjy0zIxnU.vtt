1
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.570
Yeah.
Um,
so we were talking about this Elsa gate thing.
Yes,
this is,

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.210
this is weird.
Now this is not a conspiracy theory ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.690
So before you go,
oh,
I can't believe you show,
here's the merch.

4
00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:16.530
So it's your turn to stolen.
Listen,

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.430
there's something going on where they're making these youtube clips and they

6
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:27.060
play like,
you know,
how have you watch,
if you watch a youtube clip,

7
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:31.620
say on the brand new 2019 corvette Zr one like I'm a,
I'm a car freak.

8
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:35.880
I love watching those videos.
Like wow,
look how fast.
Look at it.
Go what a beast.

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.460
And if you just let that play ill,

10
00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:43.461
youtube will suggest a another corvette movie or video and play that and maybe a

11
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.610
video on a shootout between a couple of different types of cars.

12
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:48.570
He would handles better.

13
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:51.510
And then you'll just keep playing like car videos cause it thinks you're on that

14
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:54.960
loop will somewhere along the line,
if you're on a kid's loop,

15
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.370
you can get looped into one of these Elsa gate videos.
Now,

16
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.830
some of them,
like the one Brian showing me,

17
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:06.831
he's like really shitty CGI second life and it's like these cartoon characters

18
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:13.161
get together and they become like sexualized and they drink sometimes and the

19
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:16.740
babies keep getting their heads busted open.

20
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.000
Like the babies fall and the beer bottle flies through the air and hits the baby

21
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:23.460
in the head and cuts the baby's head open and blood's all over the place and

22
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:28.290
that one happens all the time.
It repeats itself over and over and over again.

23
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:33.291
That same scene in a bunch of different weird cartoons with like babies and baby

24
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:37.350
animals and you know there's anthropomorphization videos where it's like,

25
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.280
you know the,
the,

26
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.180
the wolf has a bunch of pigs with them and shit and the pigs get drunk like that

27
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:42.780
kind of shit.

28
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.520
But there's like hundreds and hundreds of them and youtube is me.

29
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.100
They had to be alerted to this stuff.
You know,

30
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:53.520
people were watching them with their kid and it would go on auto play and your

31
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:55.650
one year old is also in watching a beer bottle,

32
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:57.980
fly through the hair and head in a three,

33
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.410
five to the eight rather and bash a baby on the head and cause a big Gash.

34
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.050
Have you seen any of those?
I've seen,
yeah.
I just,

35
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.840
cause I used to watch the ones that you,

36
00:02:05.841 --> 00:02:08.110
you know the second life ones where it's just ridiculous.

37
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.100
Like this stuff is crazy.
It's weird.
I didn't even know about this.

38
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:13.290
They dress up in these cartoons.

39
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.030
They have little babies that are dressed up like Spiderman or like Elsa and like

40
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.330
this,
this scene keeps happening over and over again where they have beer,

41
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.050
they get fucked up and then as the baby falls,

42
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.800
the beer bottle bounces off his head and shatters and lands on the ground and

43
00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:31.710
the baby's bleeding.
It happens over and over again.

44
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.950
And so in this one with the minions,
a little baby minions,
they fall,

45
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:38.700
Bam gets caught in the head.
It's the same scene.
Here's the Mickey Mouse.

46
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:40.770
One little babies get fucked up.

47
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.180
They fall beer bottle hits the baby in the head is another one with a little

48
00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:48.570
foxes.
They get fucked up.
Beer bottle hits the kid in the head.

49
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.810
It's always the same shit.
It's a stupid,
it's not just stupid.
It's weird.

50
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.750
It's weird because it's not,

51
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.780
it's not just things happen and it's the same violence scene over and over again

52
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:02.140
and the babies are the ones that are getting brutalized in the,

53
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.720
is it getting hit in the head with beer bottles?
Giant Gash,

54
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:06.940
his blood like what is that?

55
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.400
<v 1>Yeah,
it's almost like that.
What's that?
Yeah,</v>

56
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.720
the youtube crap or that you just to be really popular where they would just

57
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:18.721
edit things together real fast and an end with like like screaming and what was

58
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:19.540
that?

59
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.790
<v 0>But that was user created.</v>

60
00:03:20.791 --> 00:03:23.250
That was a bunch of people like you could see those people doing that.

61
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.120
They just decided to try to talk real fast and cut out all the breaths in

62
00:03:27.121 --> 00:03:30.270
between it and slam it together.
Look,
you have no attention span whatsoever.

63
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.370
<v 1>Now this stuff like in what we're watching now,
I find,
I feel like they're all,</v>

64
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.160
they're all using the same characters,
right?

65
00:03:37.161 --> 00:03:39.740
So it seems like to me it's from a message board.

66
00:03:39.741 --> 00:03:43.340
It's like when we were back in the day on your message board and we would like

67
00:03:43.341 --> 00:03:45.110
make all these videos and stuff like that.

68
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.620
It seems like it's from a group of people that all are doing it,
you know,

69
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.470
collectively like to me it seems like,

70
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.220
like you'll find like a deep four Chan thread in it or something where like,
oh,

71
00:03:55.221 --> 00:03:57.320
I did the baby falling video or something.

72
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.950
<v 0>No,
there's a bunch of different ones man.
I mean there's,</v>

73
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.920
there's this was like with real people,

74
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.390
but the ones that you're talking about with the,
the cartoon ones,

75
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.830
they're being made in other countries.

76
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.920
They're not speaking English in any of them.
It's all like noises and stuff.

77
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.233
And um,

78
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.500
they're generating like if their ad friendly and some of them were approved for

79
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:19.630
ads,
they're generating a tremendous amount of money.

80
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.870
You gotta think about how many hits these fucking things are getting and how

81
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:26.440
many like see if you could pull up one and see how many millions of hits it had.

82
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.250
Yeah,
I just pulled up,
had 5 million,
5 million.
Okay,

83
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.830
so 5 million hits is the business.
All right?

84
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:36.010
If you've got ads on a video for little kids,
that gets 5 million hits,

85
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:38.050
that's a business.
Now if you've got those things in there,

86
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:39.520
generating them by computers,

87
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.490
so you're making hundreds and hundreds of them and you put them all over the

88
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:44.920
Internet and they all have 5 million hits each.

89
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.340
You're talking about a substantial amount of money that you're getting every

90
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:51.100
month and they're just making these things.

91
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:55.210
And then the real fucked up thing is like,
apparently there's some,
again,

92
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.060
I just read the beginning of this and then never read any further into it,

93
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.890
but read it.
Uh,

94
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.600
had a thread apparently where these people were trying to decipher some of the

95
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:08.200
things that are being said and the comments and they think that they're using

96
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:12.040
the comments as like ways we're child trafficking.

97
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:15.220
People can communicate with Jenna.
This is like speculation,

98
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.910
which sounds like wow,
that seems far fetched.

99
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.720
But doesn't child trafficking sound far fetched?
I mean,
you know it's real,
right?

100
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:24.990
Child trafficking sounds crazy farfetched.

101
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.510
Like the idea that someone so evil that they're selling children,
right?

102
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:32.530
Doesn't it?
Well that doesn't it?
Yeah.
So if that is,

103
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:34.750
then why wouldn't it be that they would communicate?

104
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.860
I mean is it more far fetched that they communicate in code in some sort of way

105
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:39.694
in the comments?

106
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.131
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

107
00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:43.500
because they probably wouldn't do it on kid videos would probably do it like

108
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.290
just like any video,
like tractor.

109
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.680
<v 0>It could be videos or something.
I think.
Yeah,
it could be.</v>

110
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:51.020
Maybe they're not that smart.
That's where the trauma Lester's,
right.
But,

111
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.050
but also that like these why these kids are not going to make comments.

112
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.980
So making comments on

113
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.820
<v 1>these videos.
It to me,
again,
I,
it seems like it's a,</v>

114
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:05.360
it's a group of people somewhere and it's making these now the fact that that

115
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:08.420
youtube is letting them sell it as kids,
they need to change.

116
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.820
Youtube needs to change how they have kid videos.

117
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.270
Cat Videos should have a team of people.
You get approved,

118
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.760
then you become an for sure two kits.
That's it.

119
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.570
You can't just upload anything and put the kid to tag on it.

120
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.180
You should not be allowed to have the kid tag kids find out about it.
Yeah.

121
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.610
You give your kid the user response when you give your kid like the iPad and he

122
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:33.110
put it on Youtube.
Kids that should be selected videos only.

123
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:36.130
It's been approved by eyeballs and so on it.

124
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.620
I should not be able to make a kid video.
You know?

125
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.900
That's true and definitely not be able to make kid video where a kid gets hit in

126
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:45.920
the head with a fucking bottle right now.
If that shit was like just on a,

127
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.530
like once someone,
one of us did it and were like,

128
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:51.620
I just made all these stupid videos of kids falling down on the ground and it

129
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:52.940
wasn't for kids,
and then you'll be like,

130
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:56.450
that's just a stupid cartoon that you see on like adult swim or something like

131
00:06:56.451 --> 00:06:58.460
that.
Right.
Four in the morning,
right in there.

132
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.360
You could see something like that on adult swim at four o'clock in the morning,

133
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.890
especially the ones that I have watched,

134
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.930
those stupid ones that could actually be like some sort of a,

135
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.310
an like some thing that,
what's that called?

136
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.750
What's interspliced inside of a show where like a non sequitur video comes in

137
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:19.610
and what's that called?
It's like an adult swim cartoon where you're like,

138
00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:22.880
what the or a commercial or a commercial?
I don't know where.
That's just,

139
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:27.050
it just gets stuck in there where the Mickey Mouse Daddy is drinking with the

140
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:29.090
babies.
The babies fall and gets hit in the head with a bottle.

141
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:30.140
Like what the fuck?

142
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.630
And then you cut to some wolf that's telling you about the past and they're
like,

143
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.530
robot chicken a lot.
Just to real quick set team second thing and be like,
what?

144
00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:40.220
What's that?
What does the word interstition what does that word?
