1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.570
Other things.

2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.660
That's the football thing is an interesting thing cause he was who's obsessed

3
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:06.990
with football and it's one thing that he shared in common with Nixon.

4
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:11.991
And so when they went one time they were going to the airport and he hitched a

5
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:16.680
ride with Nixon and Nixon wanted to talk to him about football.
And he said,

6
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:19.410
let's just not talk about politics when we talk about football.

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.680
And so he talked to my favorite,
the whole ride.
It was,

8
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:25.290
it was in 1968 Pat Buchanan had helped set it up.

9
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.060
They handed out that week they'd become friends.

10
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.010
And so they come to Thompson and like,
all right,

11
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.660
the boss is going to take a plane to Florida.

12
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.550
You can come and talk to him and crazy.
And so later Thompson said later,

13
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:37.200
it was like,
they told me not to talk about anything but football.

14
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.460
But earlier Thompson said like,
I was just really awkward.
Like this fucking guy.

15
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.730
They're both in the back bench of a mercury and so as before secret service.

16
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:48.180
So it's just a cop driving and it's like pappy cannon in the front and it's

17
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.880
Thompson.
And Nixon and they're right here next to each other.

18
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.780
And Thompson's like wedge,
you know,
earlier in the night you'd said that,

19
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.021
you know,

20
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:57.630
the Oakland Raiders had a good shot to beat the packers and Superbowl too.

21
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.430
Can you talk about that?
And he was like,

22
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.790
Dick's is like my good friend Vince Lombardi had told me to watch out for the

23
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:05.850
AFL cause they pass and they can be very effective.

24
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.310
And so Thompson then like remembers that guy.
Um,
um,

25
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.810
Bob Geiger had been a professional quarterback.

26
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.500
He had taken Thompson to his first football game and Thompson said NFL is better

27
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:19.350
than the AFL and Geiger's like,
shut the fuck up,
let's go to a Raiders game.

28
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.280
And they went and 65 and the Raiders won on this beautiful pass,
uh,
Tom Flores,

29
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.060
like beautiful goline pass.
And Nixon was saying the same thing.

30
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.690
And so then at that moment,
at that moment,
Thompson's like,
oh yeah,

31
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:34.800
it was the Miami Guy,
uh,
Miller Miller who'd caught the pass in Nixon,

32
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:38.760
Gus taps and on the knee and goes,
you're right.
And goes all,

33
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:42.420
what a beautiful moment in tops.
It's just like,
what the fuck is going on?

34
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.800
So Nixon,

35
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:47.730
apparently they were talking about like college draft picks and all kinds of

36
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:49.410
crazy shit.
Like Nixon was deep into it.

37
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.620
It was the only moment Thompson said that he knew Nixon wasn't lying.

38
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.860
They can talk about football and that in that instance,

39
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.570
it's fascinating when people,
they're so diametrically opposed to each other,

40
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.060
but they find common ground.
Thompson did a great job of that,

41
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.620
and I think we've lost it today.
I mean,
you have to listen to the other side too.

42
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.080
If you,
if you politically want to beat somebody like pappy cannon,
the one,

43
00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:12.480
it defeat his tactics.
If you wanted to feed him,

44
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.120
you need to know how he's thinking and what he's doing.

45
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.390
And Thompson knew that Bikini was listening to the left to defeat them.

46
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.010
And so Thompson listened to be Keenan.
