1
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.520
Gear for.
So,
um,
next Saturday,

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.790
December 2nd,
there's a big fight.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.210
It's the rematch between Max Holloway and Josie Aldo.

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.150
You also have Alistair Overeem and Francis in Ghana on that card.

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.070
Whoa.
Henry.
So Udo and Sergio Pettis,

6
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.080
Eddie Alvarez,
and just engaging who?

7
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:32.930
Just those four fights,
right.
Their whole leash.

8
00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:36.600
Shit.
Holy Shit.
I know a,

9
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:40.410
I talked about Holloway versus all though before.
Um,

10
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:43.410
what I like about this fight is first of all,

11
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:46.110
the first fight was very good until although,
um,

12
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.380
ran out of gas and Holloway took over.
Um,

13
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.640
all those camp was saying that going into that fight all had a leg injury,

14
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.670
which kind of makes sense because he really didn't throw many leg kicks,

15
00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:59.970
but he also didn't throw very many leg kicks against Frankie Edgar.

16
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.170
I think the strategy for then for that fight though was that he was worried

17
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:05.700
about the takedowns of Frankie Edgar.

18
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:08.220
So he had decided to avoid being taken down.

19
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.570
One of the best ways to do it would be just to avoid kicking and just outbox
him.

20
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:16.560
And he did that very well in that fight and won a pretty clear unanimous

21
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:19.800
decision.
This is going to be a different fighter.

22
00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:22.350
I mean Max Holloway is in his prime.

23
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.000
He beat Aldo the first time around isn't he?

24
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.190
And he's incredibly confident that going to be able to beat all the second time

25
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.990
all go though said that he had this leg injury and it prevented him from

26
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:36.240
throwing leg kicks but that it's better now.

27
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:39.090
And that's one of the reasons why he's excited about fighting Holloway again.

28
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.110
Now if that is the case and if though is in tremendous shape,

29
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:47.910
cause he took this fight on relatively short notice,
he did not get a full two,

30
00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:52.890
three month training camp.
I think it was five weeks out,
maybe more.

31
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.850
I'm sorry if I'm wrong about that.
I'm not looking at it right in front of me.

32
00:01:56.851 --> 00:02:01.200
But I know it wasn't a full camp cause I know it was supposed to be Frankie

33
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.910
Edgar,
Edgar got injured.
So all those steps in.
So we're going to find out,

34
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.720
we're going to find out if all can make the proper adjustments and whether or

35
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:13.560
not the ability to throw leg kicks is going to make a difference because all

36
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:18.330
those leg kicks classically in history have been some of the very best in the

37
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:20.610
game.
If you look at his fight with your Riaa favor,

38
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:23.010
it's one of the very best uses,

39
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.170
uses best use of leg kicks,
maybe in the featherweight division ever.

40
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.470
And just smash Uriah Faber,
his leg to the point where,

41
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.980
I mean it's one of the all time grossest and injuries and MMA.
Uriah,

42
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.450
his left leg was like twice the size of his right leg and how to do a bunch of

43
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:43.590
crazy therapy to recover from him cooling hyperbaric chamber.

44
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.110
And he documented it.
Your eyes.
He's such a cool dude.
He's uh,

45
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.590
I loved that he did this.
He,

46
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.250
he documented a lot of the injury online to show everybody like,

47
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:54.900
look how fucked up my leg is.

48
00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.470
And that's all due at its best is although the same guy now,

49
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:06.091
I mean he's gone through 29 professional MMA fights at the highest level.

50
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:11.110
He's been a champion for a long time.
And you know,
he's had some wars.

51
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:13.630
The second fight with Chad Mendez was a war.

52
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:18.631
Of course he got stopped quick by Conor McGregor or the fight with Max Holloway

53
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:22.720
was a war.
I mean,
he's been through some,
some really tough fights.

54
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:26.710
Does he still have that same level?
You know,
we really don't know.

55
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.140
And we're going to find out,
hopefully we're going to find out from a of an inch.

56
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.270
I mean,
I don't know what kind of camp he was involved in,

57
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:38.830
like how hard he was training rather before he entered into camp for this

58
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.420
championship fight.

59
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.990
I'm hoping that he was in good shape and that's one of the reasons why he was so

60
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:45.100
eager to take the fight.

61
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.740
And we're gonna find out we're going to fly out Saturday night.

62
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:48.550
And that's very interesting.
