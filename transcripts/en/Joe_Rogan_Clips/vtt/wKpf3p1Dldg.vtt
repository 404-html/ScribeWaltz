1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.420
To finish top three in a field at 20 you probably need about 40 to 50,000 Iowans

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.190
to get onboard.
So you say,
Hey,
do you,
do I think I can be present United States?

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.930
The threshold question is this,

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.070
can I get 40 to 50,000 Iowans on board with the idea that them and their family

5
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:20.850
members getting $1,000 a month is a good idea that that would actually help

6
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:21.684
improve their lives?

7
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.851
<v 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:21.851 --> 00:00:24.520
I'm sure it would help improve their lives and I'm sure they would agree with

9
00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:27.820
you.
The question is what are the other thing you see?

10
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.780
I don't think most people are aware that this is coming.

11
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.370
And I think you educating people and explaining all these statistics and seeing

12
00:00:36.371 --> 00:00:37.091
the forecast,

13
00:00:37.091 --> 00:00:40.360
particularly from your position as a serial entrepreneur who has a deep

14
00:00:40.361 --> 00:00:43.750
background in business and you have a deep understanding of this,
you're,

15
00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:46.750
you're helping in a tremendous way by educating people.

16
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.460
But I think most people have,
it may be a logically,

17
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.290
but they have different concerns.

18
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.660
So how do you address these other concerns?
Like,
I bet if you polled people,

19
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.890
but what are the issues?

20
00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:04.840
What are the issues in this upcoming 2020 presidential race that you know who's

21
00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:08.890
going to beat Donald Trump?
How do you do it?
This is like on the democratic side.

22
00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:11.620
The idea is like anyone but Trump,
right?
Yeah.
This is,

23
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.210
I mean they would be so happy if fill in the blank.
Tulsi Gabard you,

24
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.580
whoever.
On the Republican side,

25
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.070
obviously it's Trump unless someone comes along or he goes to jail.
Right.

26
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.560
Those are the two possibilities.
Yeah.

27
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.240
What of the other issues and that you feel that people are really concerned

28
00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:35.320
about that you can perhaps shed some unique light on?

29
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.720
<v 0>Sure,
so the,</v>

30
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:40.450
the three big policy is I'm running on our one the freedom dividend because a

31
00:01:40.451 --> 00:01:43.810
lot of Americans are seeing their paychecks not keep up with their expenses.

32
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.290
Number two is we need to get healthcare off the backs of businesses and families

33
00:01:49.451 --> 00:01:52.600
and move towards a single payer system.
Medicare for all,

34
00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:56.560
because as an entrepreneur,
it makes it harder to hire people.

35
00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:58.420
When you do hire people,
you want to make them.

36
00:01:58.421 --> 00:02:00.400
Contractors are not fulltime employees.

37
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.430
It makes it harder for people to start businesses because they're concerned

38
00:02:03.431 --> 00:02:05.260
about keeping their health care for their families.

39
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.370
So we got to get health care off the backs of businesses and families and try

40
00:02:09.371 --> 00:02:10.930
and make the economy more dynamic.

41
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.800
And we spent twice as much on healthcare as other countries do to worst results.

42
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.110
Like it's right now we're in like the worst of all worlds.

43
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.900
And the third thing is,

44
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.780
and I referenced my wife when I talk about this now,

45
00:02:22.781 --> 00:02:26.110
my wife is at home with our two boys,
six and three,
one of whom is autistic.

46
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.310
And when I say is like what is her work valued at in GDP?

47
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.310
And then people think about and they're like,
I don't know,
and I'm like,

48
00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:38.311
zero GDP like doesn't consider that actual economic contribution.

49
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.030
Uh,
and then I say we have to do is we'd have to actually evolve from GDP as a

50
00:02:43.031 --> 00:02:46.510
measuring stick because it actually doesn't work for us.

51
00:02:46.511 --> 00:02:49.990
It's almost a hundred years old.
We made it up during the Great Depression.

52
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.800
Self driving trucks are going to drive GDP way up,
but it's going to be very,

53
00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:55.870
very bad for many people and communities.

54
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.720
So we have to actually change the measuring sticks to something that would

55
00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:01.600
actually,
our economy work for us make,

56
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:05.320
make it so that the market serves us instead of all us being inputs to the

57
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:07.810
market.
Because if we're all inputs to the market,

58
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:12.730
we lose to robots and AI and hands down and it's not like it doesn't matter if

59
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:14.560
you were like a really conscientious,

60
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.100
hardworking truck driver or like a really lazy sloppy when it doesn't matter.

61
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.760
Like you know,

62
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.680
it doesn't matter if you were like a really diligent radiologist or like,
uh,

63
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:22.763
it doesn't matter.

64
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.930
So we have to shift the market's emphasis to actually fuel our wellbeing and

65
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:32.920
changed from GDP,
which is again,
this archaic measurement we made up to,

66
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.550
to things that would actually correspond to how we're doing things like health,

67
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.390
how childhood success rates,
environmental,
quantify that.
How do you,

68
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:44.980
how would you quantify that in a way that would be translatable to the average

69
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:48.640
voter?
Yeah.
So we have measurements for most of these things.
And,
and again,

70
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:51.880
if you look at our numbers right now,
you'd see,
it's like,
what?

71
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.970
Like how many people listening to this know that America is life expectancy is

72
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:56.880
declining for the last three years.
You know,

73
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.050
that to me would be like a pretty important measurement.

74
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:02.830
But you think that's because of,
is it cause of suicide?

75
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:04.680
Is it because of drug overdoses?

76
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.740
It because of obesity diet?
What is it?
The,

77
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.790
the two causes that people point to the most are that drug overdoses and

78
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:16.120
suicides have overtaken be hickey color deaths as,

79
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.750
as the most frequent deaths in the United States.

80
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.570
I didn't know that suicide was on it unless I knew that drug overdose said,

81
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:26.140
taken obesity with suicides of Ot overtaken obesity as well.

82
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.430
Suicides have overtaken,
uh,
car accidents.
I'm not sure about it.
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:32.140
I meant I'm at car accidents.
I misspoke.

84
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.880
So w w s car accidents used to be number one.
Yeah.

85
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.550
Suicides are higher than car accidents now.
Yeah.

86
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.170
So suicides,
drug overdoses,

87
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.580
and then car accidents or suicides and drug overdoses.
Like,

88
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.090
I think drug overdoses,
the number one,
number one,
and then suicides number two.

89
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.100
Wow.
Uh,

90
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.030
and so that's why life expectancy has declined for the last year and very much

91
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:02.440
likely there's at least some of the number of the suicides are related to

92
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.200
economic disparity.
Oh yeah.
I mean,

93
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:10.201
if you look at the suicide rate in it's particularly pronounced in 50 to 50 year

94
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:15.070
old,
50 to 54 year old white Americans,
which are the population.
And I mean,

95
00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:17.020
you resemble that.
That's me.
Yeah.
That's you,

96
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.460
which resembles the population that right now is,

97
00:05:19.461 --> 00:05:23.410
is reaching a point where they're like,
hey,
my job skills don't have any,
uh,

98
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.030
you know,
like utility and the marketplace.

99
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.750
And then they go home and they just like,
you know,

100
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:31.340
start looking around and being like,
what am I doing?
I mean,
it's,

101
00:05:31.341 --> 00:05:34.120
it's really dark.
It's punitive,
it's punishing.

102
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.310
And we've put our citizens in this situation where we all see ourselves as

103
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:43.000
economic inputs,
what the market says we're worth is what we're worth.

104
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.220
And if we're worth less than it's our fault.
And so the next move is to say,
okay,

105
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:50.830
I guess you know this place.
There's no place for me here.

106
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.600
I don't mean to sound skeptical,

107
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.780
but I just don't believe that $1,000 in a month is going

108
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.240
<v 1>to fix that.
It seems like that would be a good thing.</v>

109
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.060
Certainly not moving in the wrong direction,

110
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:06.590
certainly moving in the right direction,

111
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:11.120
but it seems that there needs to be some sort of a massive rethinking of

112
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.830
civilization itself.

113
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.940
If you're going to have that many things that are going to be automated and that

114
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:21.650
many people that are going to be out of jobs and feeling that the world that

115
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:24.660
they prepared for no longer exists.
Yes.

116
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.830
It seems like we need a step further,
another move,

117
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.570
<v 0>a 100% brother,
and that's one reason why the freedom dividends not like,
uh,
like,</v>

118
00:06:33.571 --> 00:06:35.130
uh,
that doesn't solve the problem.
Right?

119
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.520
The problem is fundamentally one of reconstituting means of structure,

120
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.200
purpose,
and fulfillment in people's lives,
particularly in men's lives.

121
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.890
How do we do that?
Right?

122
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.280
So one important aspect of that is to actually start measuring how we are doing

123
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.970
as a society and saying that's actually where we're trying to go.

124
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.940
<v 1>So instead of using GDP,</v>

125
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.980
using some sort of other quantifiable method of measuring health and happiness

126
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:05.960
and fulfillment.

127
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.590
<v 0>Yes.
Levels of engagement with work,
uh,</v>

128
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.480
mental health.
I mean you can,
we have measurements for that.

129
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.530
We are sophisticated enough to do that.
And then if we say then as president,

130
00:07:17.531 --> 00:07:19.570
I'm going to be up there in 2021 being like,
oh,

131
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:22.270
here's the state of the Union and here's like the data and then we're going to

132
00:07:22.271 --> 00:07:23.140
say you don't want to try and do,

133
00:07:23.141 --> 00:07:26.380
we're actually going to try and move those measurements in the right direction.

134
00:07:26.381 --> 00:07:31.150
So let's try and get drug overdoses down by 50% in two years.

135
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.130
Let's try and get our mental health up a little bit like in,

136
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:38.710
in these ways and then make it so that that person who was at home being like,

137
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:41.830
okay,
like,
you know,
like there's not a job for me.

138
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.700
I'm getting 1000 bucks a month.
That does not solve all my problems.

139
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.020
It takes the edge off,

140
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.340
but then we can hopefully start reconstituting what that person's,

141
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.930
uh,
purpose is in their community,
in their neighborhood.

142
00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:01.150
And so one of the things that I'm going to point out is that if you pump 1000

143
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.860
bucks a month into that neighborhood,

144
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:08.290
it ends up creating a whole new realm of opportunities for the people in that

145
00:08:08.291 --> 00:08:12.100
community.
Like some of that money goes to,
you know,

146
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:17.250
like youth leagues and churches and nonprofits and creates jobs right there in

147
00:08:19.181 --> 00:08:19.781
that community.

148
00:08:19.781 --> 00:08:22.840
One of the examples I use is like if you're in a town in Missouri with 50,000

149
00:08:22.841 --> 00:08:25.180
people,
and let's say you really like to bake,

150
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:29.440
but starting a bakery is a dumb idea because people just do not have money in

151
00:08:29.441 --> 00:08:30.730
that town to buy your big to goods.

152
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:36.270
But then I pumped $60 million a year into that economy and a lot of that just

153
00:08:36.731 --> 00:08:40.510
circulates right there in that town.
Then if I start a bakery,

154
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:44.560
it's a good idea.
And I know if my bakery fails,
I'm not going to die.

155
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.110
I can at least go home and get my dividend.

156
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.910
And then if I go to other people and say,
hey,

157
00:08:48.911 --> 00:08:50.340
you want to like help me out with this,

158
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.330
then they also think it's a better idea than they would have.

159
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.850
So the money is not the solution.

160
00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.120
The money helps set the stage for the solutions.
So does the measurements.

161
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:00.960
So does if you,

162
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.320
cause right now if like you don't even know that your life expectancy is

163
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:07.500
declining and it's kind of hard to solve that problem.
So if you say,
look,

164
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:09.690
this is actually how we measure how we're doing.

165
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.280
And then you go in and say okay like local government,
Ngo,

166
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:17.560
entrepreneur.
Cause right now like our entrepreneurs don't,

167
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.670
none of our entrepreneurs are working on trying to make that dude's life better

168
00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.910
right now.
You know,
it's like that that's not only do so much.

169
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.800
Most entrepreneurs are just trying to succeed.

170
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.990
I mean it's very difficult to start a business,
right?

171
00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:29.910
And then they actually have it work out.

172
00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:33.330
Well the idea that they're going to look out for truck drivers,

173
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.400
it's not realistic,

174
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.020
but it at least we can start moving ourselves in that general direction if we

175
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:43.380
start.
Because as a CEO,
you know this,
you make what you measure,

176
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.130
you're not measuring it,
you have no chance.
If you start measuring it,

177
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:49.770
you at least start to open up the chance.

178
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.840
But what you're saying is the most profound,

179
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:56.430
which is like we need to reconstitute and meaning for many,
many Americans.

180
00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.680
And that's what,
to me the most destructive aspect of that.
You know,
again,

181
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:02.310
like the,

182
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.970
the mental health indicators and like the suicides and the rest of it is like

183
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:10.170
there's a real loss of meaning for many,
many people here in this country.

184
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.170
Well obviously we're talking about a large scale,

185
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:17.820
but if you go back to the time before trucks and truck drivers,

186
00:10:17.821 --> 00:10:21.930
that was not a viable occupation.
It wasn't something people did,

187
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:24.000
but yet they still found a way to occupy their time.

188
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.860
Do you think that there needs to be some sort of an education and some,

189
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:29.961
some sort of a,

190
00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:34.961
a method of explaining to young people in particular that you have to think of

191
00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:40.320
something to do because most of the things that you think you can do won't

192
00:10:40.321 --> 00:10:41.154
exist.

193
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:46.290
So we have to think of what are the other possibilities and be creative and do

194
00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:50.160
something with your life that only a human being can do,

195
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.630
which is a really weird way to think about it because most of the things you

196
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.350
used to be able to thank that a human being could do for a living are now going

197
00:10:58.351 --> 00:11:01.350
to be done by robots.
But I don't think,

198
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.800
I think there's a giant gap between the understanding that you have and the

199
00:11:05.801 --> 00:11:07.410
understanding that the average person has,

200
00:11:07.411 --> 00:11:12.411
and this could be a real problem and trying to expand this platform.

201
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.860
Well,
we have to,
to inform you.
I got to tell you though,

202
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.530
when I say this to people,
they're like,
that makes perfect sense.

203
00:11:18.531 --> 00:11:20.790
It does make perfect sense that that's scary about it.
