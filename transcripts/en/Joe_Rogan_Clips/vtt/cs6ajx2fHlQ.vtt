Greggor greggor I know a guy named Greg or Gregory Gillespie fights in the UFC

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.110
animal.
I haven't kind of,
Gregor probably so savage.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.590
Can I just give one interesting UFC memory for me please?

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.630
I watched the very first UFC one a with,

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.680
I had a trip at the time and we invited a scout troop and it wasn't,

6
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:25.260
it was a comedy troupe.
We trust this boy scouts,

7
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.570
but we invited Neil Patrick Harris over.

8
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:30.330
It was 20 years old at the time he was in town.

9
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.070
We just met him and he came over and soon as the sumo wrestler,

10
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:39.660
God has face kicked in and there's spit a tooth out,
I believe.
He was like,

11
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.620
I'm Outta here.
I gotta get out.
And we made him stay and watch the whole thing.

12
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.450
Good for you.
And that's what made him gay.
While that was,

13
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:51.970
thanks for ruining the story,
Dave,
I don't know if that's true and I don't know,

14
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.700
something happened.
Maybe someone dropped him on his head.
Yeah.

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.190
I don't think he knows.
He looked like he was already as a kid,

16
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.600
something went wrong or right,
depending on if you're his boyfriend.
Yeah.

17
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.080
Imagine it depends if he's a good boyfriend,
right?
Yeah.
Well,
yes,
but I mean,

18
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:14.880
if the husband,
if the guy's really into him,
thank God you watch that fight,

19
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:19.500
that time.
God,
thank God.
Otherwise could have never found chick.

20
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.950
Yep.
Who knows.
Look at these and shit.
Oh God.
