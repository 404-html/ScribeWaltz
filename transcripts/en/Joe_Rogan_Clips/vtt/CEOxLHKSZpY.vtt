1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.190
One of the things I've said about,
uh,

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.400
one of the more bizarre things about today's political climate is that people

3
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:11.130
selectively agree with science.

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.650
It's like when it comes to client climate change,

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.090
like everybody is like pro science,
like science all the way.
Look at the studies.

6
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.960
Yeah.
Even when they don't even understand the studies,
there's a famous,

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.520
and you know,

8
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.000
you get in trouble when you bring up Tucker Carlson because people go,
oh,

9
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:31.390
you're Tucker Carlson Fan.
I'm just as a human being,
I'm not going to made,

10
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.300
he made some very good points with Bill Nye.
He had bill Nye on,

11
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:38.310
they were talking about science and he said,
okay,

12
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:42.270
if human beings are responsible for climate change,
what percentage?

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.470
What are the numbers like?
And Bill Nye really isn't a scientist.

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.490
He's a science.
Um,
you know,
what would your personality,

15
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:54.240
those immediate personality,
he's a guy who's a,
you know,
he's,
um,

16
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.770
a promoter of science,
but not really necessarily scientist.
So He's,
he doesn't,

17
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.120
he doesn't have long term study and research to climate change.

18
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.300
He's just sort of on there in a slightly arrogant way saying things that I agree

19
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:12.270
with.
Like what I agree with is that human beings are responsible,

20
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:15.330
at least in part with climate change.
This is where all the research points to.

21
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.910
Yeah.
But when Tucker Carlson was pressing him on it,

22
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.410
he really didn't have any answers for it.

23
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.270
So it's one of those things where like people on the left will blindly support

24
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:27.150
science in one way.
Is that you or me?
Dang it.
If it's me,

25
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:31.260
I'm gonna be very upset with myself because I don't think it's me.
Um,

26
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.240
but then when it comes to gender,
you watch his show.

27
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:38.260
He's got this wacky show on Netflix.
Yeah.

28
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.870
Where there they're singing songs about gender can be fluid and gender could be

29
00:01:42.871 --> 00:01:45.930
this and this is more than two.
Yeah.
There's more than two genders,

30
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.790
which she didn't use to say.
Yeah.
If you go back to one of us,

31
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.450
<v 1>I did see that there was an older episode where they clearly say that gender is</v>

32
00:01:52.451 --> 00:01:53.284
a binary.

33
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.220
<v 0>Yeah.
This was like way back before all this nuttiness step.
Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.000
So it's influencing people who are in the know,

35
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:05.001
like the people are deciding instead of supporting science and supporting the

36
00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:10.090
research on actual human beings as a biological organism.

37
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.530
Instead we're going with this bizarre politically correct climate which inclines

38
00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:20.560
people to this weird delusional thinking.
And as an outsider,

39
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.710
that's what's interesting to me to watch all this scrambling,

40
00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:25.780
looking at this weirdness.
You know,

41
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.100
<v 1>it's hypocritical.
It definitely is.
And it's,
it's interesting to see,</v>

42
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:30.480
I mean say the march for Science,

43
00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:33.900
I attended that not this past year but the year before.
So people are there.

44
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:37.020
They're super excited about science,
Pro Science,
I think science great.

45
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.530
All this money should go to science and you ask them,
okay,
so you're,

46
00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:44.400
so you're down for climate change being real.
But what about science?

47
00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:45.240
Now by the left,

48
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:47.670
and I asked so many people this while I was there because I was reporting on it

49
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:51.930
for playboy.com and um,
it's amazing.
People get very uncomfortable.

50
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.940
They don't want to,
they don't want to say anything about,

51
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.680
I would consider myself to be a liberal,

52
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:58.800
but definitely liberals don't want to think about themselves being science

53
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.070
deniers.
And when you look at how people talk about gender now and biological sex

54
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.100
differences in the brain,
even biology more generally,

55
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.740
people get very defensive.
They get angry almost,
and they,

56
00:03:09.741 --> 00:03:12.490
if they find it threatening for some reason,
which I don't understand,

57
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:14.350
and that's a big part of my work is to say,

58
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.380
I think we can acknowledge that these facts exist and that biological sciences

59
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.690
legitimate.
That doesn't mean that sexism is okay.

60
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.060
We're not saying that women are inferior or anything like that.

61
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.000
<v 0>Exactly.
That's the big point about all this,
right,</v>

62
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.030
is that we're not saying that anyone's inferior or just not the same thing.

63
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.530
This is what the big problem is.
The tried to say,
I mean,

64
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.570
I certainly think we should all have equal rights,

65
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.890
but we're not equal in terms of what we are.
We're a different,
we're in,

66
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:46.360
it's not that we're not equal,
like one's better.

67
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.990
It's just like saying a wolf is not equal to a cheetah.

68
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.770
They're fucking different things.
Yeah.

69
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.110
And males and females are different things.
Yeah.
And this is,

70
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.520
this is clear when you study us as an organism,
you know,

71
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:04.810
I had a really bizarre conversation once with a guy who's a professor or a

72
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:08.830
former professor and he was trying to deny that there that there's a difference

73
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:12.400
between men and women.
It's crazy.
And one of the things I said,
I said,
okay,

74
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.750
you get a dog.
Uh,
do you ask,
is this a boy dog or a girl dog?

75
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.780
And then he got like real weird.
But this is really no answer to that.
Like it's,

76
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.580
it's a fucking boy dog.
You want a boy dog,
right?
Is it a non-binary doll?

77
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.980
Like what is your dog?

78
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.970
<v 1>All right.
It might change its mind tomorrow as your dog gender fluid.
Yeah.</v>

79
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.580
Like what does gender fluid,
well,

80
00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:35.870
it's this idea that you can be one gender one day and another gender the other

81
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.350
day or it might cycle through the day or Dawson.
Your mix of both.

82
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.280
<v 0>That seems like if it was anything else,</v>

83
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.450
you would have to be fucking crazy.
Right?
It was anything else?
Yeah.

84
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.770
Like if you decided,
well today I'm African.
Yeah.
Tomorrow I'm Chinese,
you know,

85
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.210
today,
uh,
I'm tall tomorrow,
I'm short today,
I'm a Pixie tomorrow I'm a wood Elf

86
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.470
<v 1>like,
but I think everybody is,</v>

87
00:04:57.471 --> 00:04:59.120
we don't have to call it something like gender fluid.

88
00:04:59.121 --> 00:05:01.150
Everyone is a mix of male and female.
Right?

89
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:04.490
Like you will have people that are maybe more typically masculine or more

90
00:05:04.491 --> 00:05:06.760
typically feminine,
but even still there,
there's no,

91
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.730
I don't think there are many people that are 100% not one way or the other not,

92
00:05:10.731 --> 00:05:11.370
well,

93
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.870
<v 0>what does that even mean?
I mean,</v>

94
00:05:12.871 --> 00:05:16.710
people are clearly more masculine than other people,

95
00:05:16.711 --> 00:05:20.160
but does that mean that the people like,
you know,
let's pick a person,
Bill Nye.

96
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.390
Does that mean he's not

97
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.910
<v 1>ma'am,
he's clearly a man.
Exactly.
Yeah.
He's clearly a man.</v>

98
00:05:23.911 --> 00:05:28.230
He's not a Lebron James,
but he's a man.
Yeah.
You know,
there's,
there's,

99
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.940
there's obviously a spectrum.
Yeah.

100
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.090
I almost feel like that way of thinking is more old fashion because this is all

101
00:05:33.091 --> 00:05:34.890
about being progressive and open minded.

102
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.510
But I think if someone is a man but is maybe more female typical to say that

103
00:05:39.511 --> 00:05:43.620
this person has a different category of gender or that they're,
I don't know,

104
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.790
not mail.
To me that's more stereotypical.
You know what I mean?
I think it's,

105
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.280
it's not progressive to say if you are a mix of both,

106
00:05:50.281 --> 00:05:51.390
you must be something different.

107
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.990
<v 0>This is really a mix of both,
right?</v>

108
00:05:53.991 --> 00:05:58.520
You just have a different hormonal profile are different.
It's different

109
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.110
<v 1>body types,
different,
I mean people vary so much that,</v>

110
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.940
I mean I think having some sort of categories to say,

111
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.710
oh,
this is a male and this is a female.
It seems like it's pretty beneficial.

112
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.160
I mean although we vary so widely inside those categories to pretend that those

113
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:21.200
categories don't exist to seem so weird.

114
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:24.740
We would never do that with any other organism and it's a lot of work too.

115
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:29.060
You see these companies going in there trying to be more and with the times I

116
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:29.660
guess in there.

117
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.620
Everything is gender neutral now and I'm thinking all of that money and time is

118
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:37.520
being wasted when I don't think that does anything for,
for women or sexism.

119
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.600
If you changed instead of addressing someone by ladies and gentlemen,

120
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:46.340
you say people is that really gonna stop sexism just makes people mad because

121
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:47.660
then they have to change the way they talk.

122
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.520
I put of a story on Twitter the other day about people that are raising their

123
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:54.470
kids with they and them.
I saw that.
Yeah,

124
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.500
calling them they beat instead of babies.
Fun Times.

125
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.010
The fuck is that like I just,
I think it's coming from,

126
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.940
for some parents it's coming from a good place.

127
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:08.570
Like they obviously want the best for their kids and they don't want to limit

128
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.580
the kid in terms of what they might be interested in.

129
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:14.660
And I think because the media is telling them,
if you let girls play with dolls,

130
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:16.760
that's terrible and they're going to end up,
you know,

131
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.600
not having any sort of prospects when they grow up in terms of their jobs or,

132
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.020
I don't know,
it's such a terrible thing to be female.
Typical nowadays.

133
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.670
But I mean,
like you mentioned,

134
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:27.890
it's biology that's going to dictate what your kids play with.

135
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.830
And then in other cases,
I think it's parents that want to be special.
Well,

136
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:34.760
it's also weird because if your son is trans,

137
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.680
it's totally fine for him to be female.
Typical.
Yeah.
It's celebrated.

138
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.270
Like if you have a trans son and he likes wearing lipstick and short skirts and

139
00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:46.370
prancing around,
then he's fabulous.

140
00:07:46.371 --> 00:07:50.960
Like there was a boy in New York and there was this whole thing about he's the

141
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:54.080
youngest ever drag queen and everybody's going crazy.

142
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:56.200
And people were angry about it.
You know,

143
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.250
some people were angry and saying he's being exploited by his parents,

144
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:04.880
and some people thought it was wonderful that this kid was so expressive when

145
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:08.360
he's so young.
And then other people said,
I had a good point.
They said,
well,

146
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.340
it's very sexualized.

147
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:13.400
Like how is this any different than someone who's in a beauty pageant,

148
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.220
like a Jon Benet Ramsey type situation?
Well,
I think it was,

149
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.780
if it was a little girl,

150
00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:22.010
people would be up in arms and sexist and that it's the patriarchy.

151
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.860
But that little boy,
so I don't know that he's trans.

152
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:29.630
I believe that he just likes to like a man who is a drag queen is just a man.

153
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.370
It's usually gay men who likes to play chess.
You know,

154
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.180
like an extreme form of femininity.
I love drag Queens,

155
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.540
but I think that little boy is likely going to grow up to be a gay boy.

156
00:08:38.541 --> 00:08:41.750
If you have a little boy who says he's a girl and you see a lot of these trans

157
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:44.990
girls,
if they were left alone and they didn't transition,

158
00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:46.610
they would like the research shows.

159
00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:50.420
They would grow up to be gay men is that

160
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.010
I'm 100% for freedom,
right?
So I'm 100% for you being able to

161
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.030
<v 0>do whatever you want to do.</v>

162
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.040
The real question becomes when people are Trans and young,

163
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.280
it's uh,
how much,

164
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:10.860
how much of this is going to pass and how much of this are you going to stop

165
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:14.370
from ever passing because you're going to inject your body fold with hormones.

166
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.300
Like,
are you giving yourself the opportunity just to decide to become a gay man

167
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.710
versus become a woman?
And would you be happier either or?

168
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:27.030
It's very,
very tricky.
You can't even have that conversation now,
right?

169
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:28.840
You can't transphobic,
right.

170
00:09:28.841 --> 00:09:32.310
What it is is homophobic though that you can consider that some of these kids

171
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:37.140
just might be gay children.
But then the,
the gender fluid one,

172
00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:42.141
I was reading this article about this guy who varies by the day and it like in

173
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:45.930
the day,
like he'll have periods of stress,
we'll switch over to a woman.

174
00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:50.550
There was actually a radio lab podcast where they interviewed a person that has

175
00:09:50.551 --> 00:09:52.680
the same issue and um,

176
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:57.830
the person was clearly abnormal in the way they communicated and the way they

177
00:09:58.681 --> 00:09:59.250
thought.

178
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.460
It wasn't like you were dealing with some guy that you would trust with your

179
00:10:02.461 --> 00:10:03.870
taxes.
You know what I mean?

180
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:07.800
It was like the dude was wacky and then now he's a check and now he's back to

181
00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:08.700
being a guy again.

182
00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:13.680
And he actually transitioned in mid conversation like physically.

183
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.360
Now.
I don't know.
I didn't see it because you're just listening,
but he's like,

184
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:23.280
well,
now I'm Peter again.
Now I'm wondering,
you know like what the fuck?
Hi Lindy.

185
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:28.470
Well,
it's,
I don't know how much of that is indulgent.
I mean,
I don't want,

186
00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:33.420
I don't want to say I know how you feel,
but I do want to say,
hey,

187
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:38.310
are you fucking crazy?
Is this,
are we just,
we just indulging crazy people.

188
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.760
I do believe there are people that are trans.

189
00:10:41.761 --> 00:10:46.620
I absolutely believe that there that there are women that really are wired the

190
00:10:46.621 --> 00:10:49.380
wrong way and they should be men and there's men that are wired the wrong.

191
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.830
It only makes sense.
It only makes sense.
Yeah,

192
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.950
but I do also think there's people that are crazy.

193
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.950
There's people that have legit mental illness,

194
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:04.190
they're delusional and they're also very susceptible to influence and very

195
00:11:05.341 --> 00:11:07.380
susceptible to,
you know,

196
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.880
someone persuading them that they are one thing or another thing.
Look,

197
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:17.420
it's those like heaven's gate cult people who cut their balls off and wore the

198
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:21.530
Nike's and decided to kill themselves when the comment was near.
Remember that,

199
00:11:21.531 --> 00:11:24.000
yeah,
that's not normal,
right?

200
00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:27.330
It's not normal for someone to be able to talk you into cutting your balls off

201
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.900
or putting on the purple sneakers or killing yourself when the comments close

202
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.460
because there's a spaceship waiting.

203
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:34.930
It's going to take you to Xenu or wherever the fuck you're going.
Right?

204
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.120
That's not normal either.

205
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:41.010
So we know that people are subject to very irrational behavior under the

206
00:11:41.011 --> 00:11:44.670
influence of other people's suggestions or other people's,
you know,
persuasion.

207
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.400
And this is a thing today where you have to wonder like how many of these people

208
00:11:50.401 --> 00:11:52.260
are legitimately trans?

209
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:56.920
How many of these people are legitimately dealing with like a real mental issue

210
00:11:56.921 --> 00:12:00.490
that's causing them to shift from male to female and back again?

211
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.940
And why is it that we can't ask these questions cause why is it that even this

212
00:12:06.221 --> 00:12:06.941
question right now,

213
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:11.530
I could be accused of being transphobic for asking how many of these people are

214
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.393
ill?

215
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.880
<v 1>Yeah,
well both of us are going to be accused of transphobia after this.
Yeah.</v>

216
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.310
Yeah.
I mean I would agree with that.

217
00:12:17.311 --> 00:12:22.311
I do think that gender dysphoria is a legitimate phenomenon and I do have a lot

218
00:12:22.591 --> 00:12:23.910
of empathy for people who are suffering.

219
00:12:23.911 --> 00:12:26.940
And I think for adults they should be allowed to transition if that's what they

220
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.730
decide to do,
if that's something that will help them feel better.

221
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.890
My issues with the kids,
it's,

222
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.900
I don't think it's appropriate for children to be transitioning.

223
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.520
And I can talk a bit more about why,

224
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.730
but I think in terms of the pathology aspect,
I think for,

225
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.830
because gender is so trendy right now and in the past you might have seen this

226
00:12:43.831 --> 00:12:46.500
kind of pathology manifests in a different way.

227
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.830
But now because everyone is saying genders,
the way to express,
you know,

228
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.620
I think people also see a fever problem in your life.

229
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.570
They think it's gender related.

230
00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:58.500
So say with some of the personality disorder and people like a lot of attention,

231
00:12:58.501 --> 00:13:00.420
they like to,
um,

232
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.020
it's always about them and their identity and their identity shifts a lot.

233
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.100
So this could very well be what it is and now they're being basically rewarded

234
00:13:08.101 --> 00:13:08.830
for that.

235
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:09.970
<v 0>Yeah,
that's the issue,
right?</v>

236
00:13:09.971 --> 00:13:14.971
That you're dealing with incredibly indulgent people which do exist and they

237
00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:18.670
then they find this pathway to massive amounts of attention.
Yeah.
You know,

238
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:19.710
I mean this is,
I,

239
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.100
I had to construct a bit to mock Caitlyn Jenner,

240
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.690
but it was a very complicated bit like I had to figure out how to do this.
Yeah.

241
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.360
I was like,
obviously this is nonsense and foolish,

242
00:13:31.361 --> 00:13:34.060
but I don't want to appear cruel.
So what is a way to do this?

243
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:39.300
So my way was to mock myself mercilessly and which is a kind of true,

244
00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:43.510
like I really do have three daughters and I really do get brutalized in my
house.

245
00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:46.690
Like I really do think they chip away at my man.
No,
it's kind of a joke,

246
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.760
but I mean it really is.
It's all girly in my house.
My fucking house is so girly,

247
00:13:51.761 --> 00:13:55.150
everyone's girly.
They're always talking about girly shit.
It's kind of hilarious.

248
00:13:55.151 --> 00:13:59.770
Yeah.
But the joke was that if my manhood was a mountain of marbles,

249
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.350
every day they take two marbles,
they just take one.

250
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.610
Like you don't even need these.
These are,
what do you care,
cod.

251
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:10.870
And then that I'm not going to go out like Bruce Jenner and that one,

252
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.850
that one day that they,

253
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.940
so I had to concoct this whole thing that they were demons,

254
00:14:15.941 --> 00:14:17.890
which is how they conjured up all that money.

255
00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:21.100
Like how else would they have hundreds of millions of dollars through no

256
00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:22.630
discernible reason.
Yeah.
There's no,

257
00:14:22.631 --> 00:14:27.190
there's no way you could like explain to someone how they made so much money if

258
00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:29.960
they didn't understand our culture.
Yeah,
totally irrational.
Right.

259
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.720
So the idea was that that they did this,

260
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.840
but why did it was I wanted to sort of mock this thing that was happening where

261
00:14:38.621 --> 00:14:41.280
you got to mail Kardashians.
That's what he,
I mean there's,

262
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:46.270
and who doesn't believe in gay marriage?
Who Decides?
He's a woman,

263
00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:49.750
which I firmly believe he's trans.
I'm not,
not denying that at all,

264
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.960
but our obsession with it and rewarding him with ungodly amounts of attention.

265
00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.740
This mother fucker won the gold medal.
Okay.

266
00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:03.770
In the decathlon,
was it the calf on was right?
Yeah.

267
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.110
I mean it was on the cover of Wheaties.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

268
00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:11.111
he was a fucking us superstar athlete and then no attention after that,

269
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.700
he was the whipping boy of the Kardashians on their TV show.
They mocked him.

270
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.060
It's like,
here's this one person with fucking town,
your whole house.

271
00:15:20.061 --> 00:15:22.340
They mock rob a bit fat,

272
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.240
but then they go right to that.

273
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.720
He becomes a woman and now he is the toast of the town.

274
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.210
He wins woman of the fucking year.

275
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:35.480
He's a woman for six months and he wins woman of the year.

276
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.730
He Wins Espn athlete of the year.

277
00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:41.920
He has been an athlete and fucking decades since Nixon was president.
Right.

278
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.790
Or Carter,
who was it?
Either way,
this is madness.

279
00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:47.981
This is,
we're,

280
00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:52.981
we're not treating this in a balanced way where we are rewarding people that

281
00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:57.860
instead of like,
because people are so,
they're,
they're,
they're,

282
00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:03.730
they're so ready to proclaim the progressiveness and so excited about it that

283
00:16:05.361 --> 00:16:08.030
they,
instead of like,

284
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.950
instead of treating them like as an equal,
they,

285
00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.430
they go completely the other way.

286
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:17.080
So they're definitely not prejudiced.

287
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.640
They're definitely not discriminating against them,

288
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:24.970
but they're absolutely inflating what this person is and they're making it a big

289
00:16:26.961 --> 00:16:30.350
giant deal that they're trans.
Like,
it's great to support people.

290
00:16:30.351 --> 00:16:34.190
I would like to live in a world where there's no racism at all.

291
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.640
So you could mock everyone equally.
Yeah.

292
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:40.250
Like this is my big problem with real racism.

293
00:16:40.251 --> 00:16:42.560
There's a lot of dummies in every race,

294
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.620
but you gotta be real careful picking on some dummies.

295
00:16:45.621 --> 00:16:50.600
Like specially if you're a white male,
straight,
white male oppressor.

296
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.650
You guys are the devil nowadays.
Especially if you look like me.
I mean,

297
00:16:54.651 --> 00:16:56.660
I looked like the devil.
So this is a,

298
00:16:56.661 --> 00:17:01.400
this is a real problem with like looking at things in a balanced perspective

299
00:17:01.401 --> 00:17:04.000
cause you're not allowed to,
you're not allowed to.

300
00:17:04.001 --> 00:17:07.040
Like even what you said earlier,
you said gender dysphoria,

301
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.930
you know that's considered transphobic.

302
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.470
<v 1>Yeah.
You can't even say that anymore even though that is a legitimate medical</v>

303
00:17:12.471 --> 00:17:13.530
condition.
Yeah,

304
00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:18.560
it can because some people see it as you pathologizing being the way someone

305
00:17:19.821 --> 00:17:23.540
feels,
I guess,
but in my mind I don't think the issue is pathology.
The pathology,

306
00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:25.880
I think it's fine to acknowledge there are certain things like any,

307
00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.020
any medical condition that causes you distress and impairment.
That's,

308
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.630
that's the definition of a psychiatric diagnosis,

309
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.330
so you should be able to recognize that it's not a bad thing.

310
00:17:35.331 --> 00:17:38.630
I think the bad thing is the stigma that comes along with having a mental

311
00:17:38.631 --> 00:17:41.870
disorder.
So that's what should be fought.
It's the stigma aspect,

312
00:17:41.871 --> 00:17:44.510
not calling something a mental disorder.
If someone's,

313
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.240
if someone's really suffering,
that's not a good thing.

314
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.840
<v 0>No,
no.
It's not a good thing.</v>

315
00:17:48.841 --> 00:17:53.550
And the denial of these conditions and the denial of the science behind these

316
00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:57.060
conditions.
This is the issue with progressive people today,

317
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.960
is that there's certain things with a embrace science and certain things where

318
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:02.700
they deny it and in gender,

319
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.540
gender in particular seems to be so hotly contested,

320
00:18:06.541 --> 00:18:08.220
and I don't know when this happened,

321
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.100
it seems to have happened right in front of our face.
Like it,

322
00:18:11.101 --> 00:18:12.870
it just came out of the ground like,

323
00:18:12.871 --> 00:18:17.390
like a plant that was growing in the cracks that you try to stomp it out and it

324
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.840
won't go away.
I'm wondering,
I'm wondering where they're like,

325
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.680
I didn't see this.
