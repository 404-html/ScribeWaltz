1
00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.650
Her low freak bitches.
Boom.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.040
They got the things false dam and they opened it.
Yeah,
Hook.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.920
He took a chance with dramatic flare,

4
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:13.530
a chance and it didn't really pay off.

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.250
But if it did well now you have to kill time and shit.

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.280
He's got nothing in there.
God.
But he's also the guy that had um,

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.400
Dick Gregory actually on his television show debuted is the Zapruder film,

8
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.670
which is the shot of Kennedy's head getting blown off and going back into the

9
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:39.630
left classic and in what looks like a shot from the front,

10
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.310
it looks like a frontal shot.

11
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.450
It looks like he was actually shot by more than one person if they like.

12
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:48.480
If you look at,
there's various interpretations of the Zapruder film,

13
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.420
but one interpretation that seems to make a lot of sense.

14
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:54.840
He said he was hit from both the front end,
the back to show that he was,

15
00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:56.790
there was multiple people shooting at them.

16
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.430
And if you talk to anyone who was trying to,

17
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.110
if you were looked at that pinch point,

18
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.740
like as they make that corner knee in Dealey Plaza,
like they were like,

19
00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:07.380
well you wouldn't just have one guy with a rifle,

20
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.270
you would make sure you were shooting at them from a,

21
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.040
from a bunch of different locations.

22
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.000
And Geraldo dressed probably news and Geraldo showed the video shoulder here.

23
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.830
Hold on a second.
Here's what's important.

24
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.540
That video was many years after Kennedy's assassination.

25
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.040
Yeah,
like a decade.

26
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.230
So for a decade we had all thought that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and there

27
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:30.030
was only a few people that didn't think he did,

28
00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:32.550
but there was no visual evidence that showed differently.

29
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.930
Haley for sure tell us hot chicks Zapruder film is,
it's,

30
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.290
it always baffled me that when you see him get hit,

31
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.660
it looks like for a couple of frames,
it looks like his head,

32
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.190
half his head disappears and there's just a purple blob.

33
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.630
Like it's a purple blob.
But then when you look at the op to autopsy pictures,

34
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.280
it's just a,
the hole in his head,
he just laying there.
But it looks,

35
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.550
it looks like it blew.
It all was tampered with.
That's what it looks.

36
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.200
It doesn't look like the film was tampered with,

37
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:04.950
but the autopsy photographs were most likely tampered with and this was a big

38
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:08.820
part of the contention that David Liftin had when he wrote the book best

39
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:11.660
evidence because there's two different,
let's watch this,

40
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.920
we'll see that it's a perpetual offer.
Two frames.

41
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.440
It's spray the bullets hitting his head,
his heads.

42
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.630
When you hit something with a bullet,
there's a spray.
It looks like his,

43
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.960
his whole face just flies off and they're just,
well they say that his,

44
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:29.961
his peace and his head flew off and she crawled to on the back to try to put his

45
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:33.210
head back.
Notion is a human being done?
No,
she didn't.
No,
she didn't.

46
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.630
Well that's what they did not say that.
That's not what happened.

47
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.270
She was trying to get the fuck out of that limousine because people were

48
00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:41.280
shooting and they blew her husband's head off.

49
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:44.680
She wasn't going for any piece of meat.
That's,
I heard that now she tried.

50
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.430
She was reaching
people say crazy shit like that.
Does not.

51
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.000
She was getting the fuck.
Did she ever talk about power?
We're talking about,

52
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.780
I know she never talked to him for that.

53
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.740
You know she Sakyo Nassis right afterwards.

54
00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:00.910
She married one of the bridges people.
She could fine,

55
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.130
but don't you think with that autopsy they,
they,

56
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:05.170
it's your president that just got assassinated.

57
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:09.520
So you're going to want to make him look the best politics.
Look at the video,

58
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.190
the supporter from what does that mean?
Explain,

59
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.450
because this is something that I would really see.

60
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.650
I've read different books on this shit and I've watched 10 or 15 balls
mentoring.

61
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.571
Yeah.
Well,

62
00:03:17.571 --> 00:03:21.520
one of the big things is there's a giant difference between the account and the

63
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:23.830
autopsy.
What,
what they said,

64
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.940
their description of the body and the wounds in Dallas versus their description

65
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:31.120
in the wounds in Bethesda,
Maryland,
two very different autopsies.

66
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.860
One of them that shows an entrance wound on the neck shows he got shot from the

67
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:39.940
front and an exit wound or an entrance wound on his neck and another one that

68
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:44.910
was changed to a tracheotomy scar.
So there's a discrepancy.
He grabs his neck.

69
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.090
It like he got hit,

70
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.930
he holds his neck maybe a second or two before his brain's blowout.
Right?

71
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.740
And when he's holding his neck like this on one autopsy,

72
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.710
on one account of the body,
that's an entrance wound from a bullet.

73
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.140
That's the Dallas one,
but on another one,

74
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.990
see if you see him when he's going around the corner.

75
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.880
He's already holding his neck.
Let's see how he's holding his neck like he,

76
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.480
he reached up and grabbed himself and he's looking down and right around he

77
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:14.410
passes the pole in his head blows off.
Watch this right here.

78
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.083
<v 1>Boom.</v>

79
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.500
<v 0>I don't see anything.
I hang on a second.
Oh No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Yeah,
bitch,</v>

80
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.850
get out the way.
This isn't super strong,
Sean.

81
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.720
The CEO's head disappears,
right?
They're like,
what is that?
It's like a,

82
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.720
it's just a flap of bone and meet it opened his head light out.
So watch,
look,

83
00:04:32.721 --> 00:04:36.440
she ain't go in searching for a piece of hair and she's trying to get the fuck

84
00:04:36.441 --> 00:04:41.240
off of that.
Well,
we don't know.
Limousine service guy right behind you,

85
00:04:41.241 --> 00:04:44.150
bro.
That's a secret service guy was climbed up at the back of the car and he's

86
00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:48.540
reaching for her to help her.
Oh my God,
what a horrible.
So,

87
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.880
but the problem was nobody had seen that until 10 years after the assassination.

88
00:04:52.881 --> 00:04:56.000
So when they watch it,
they go,
oh my God,
his head goes back into the left.

89
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.780
That was like that Hicks joke that he kept talking about back into the lab,

90
00:04:59.781 --> 00:05:02.870
back into the left.
I mean his,
he got shot.

91
00:05:02.871 --> 00:05:06.140
It looked like he was getting shot from the front and it hit the right side of

92
00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:07.730
his head and his head goes back into the left.

93
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.010
But there's also some spray that appears to be either going forward,

94
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:14.660
it could be an impact sprayer,
the bullet from the front,

95
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.590
or it could be that he got shot with two different bullets at the same time.

96
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.090
There's,
there's,
there's,
it's very possible that he,

97
00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:22.760
he got hit from the front and the back.

98
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.870
It's basically very hard to tell what happened with one angle.
Right.
Well,

99
00:05:26.871 --> 00:05:28.490
you know for sure he got shot in the head.
Yeah.

100
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.860
And you know that eat his head blew apart.

101
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.640
What's crazy to me at all after all these years,
we don't know for a fact.

102
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.440
No they can't.
There's no way they can notice.
Came out and toss it again.

103
00:05:39.441 --> 00:05:41.060
Watch this again.
Now Watch.
Watch.

104
00:05:41.061 --> 00:05:45.280
It's hard to tell if this is an impact spray or if it's an exit.

105
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.390
Where's his head at?
His head is right there.
It's like an impact right there.

106
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:53.210
Hey man,
but could be,
it could be an impact spray from the front meanwhile.

107
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

108
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.930
<v 0>It very well could be that.
It's an spray too,</v>

109
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.050
but the thing is his head goes back into the left.
But here's the question.

110
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.560
Does it go back to the left from the momentum of getting hit in the head with a

111
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:10.910
bullet or is it a spasm from a dying body like your,

112
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:14.270
your body locks up and it just throws itself into a convulsion.

113
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.130
That's possible too.
I mean,

114
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:19.310
a lot of crazy shit happens when you get shot in the fucking head.

115
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.370
He was a real cocksman too.
I bet he was,
but I don't think that had anything go.

116
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.660
You don't think I'm just saying be Harvey Oswald acted alone.

117
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.780
I do not think Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.
I do not.

118
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.250
I do not think that it's even,
uh,
even reasonable to assume that he act alone.

119
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.120
There's way,
way too many people that had invested in interest in killing him.

120
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.150
Like the Cubans,
like every,
there was a lot of people,

121
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.310
there was a lot of people that wanted him dead.

122
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.390
And it depends on what varying version of the story you're willing to buy into.

123
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.250
But what is possible,
and this is one thing that people don't want to consider,

124
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:56.210
they think either Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone or it's some wacky tinfoil hat

125
00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:59.480
conspiracy.
I say neither.
I say it might be both.

126
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.880
I say Lee Harvey Oswald could have been in on it.
He seemed like a right,

127
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.710
like a gullible guy and a lot of ways,
right.
He'd been to Russia.

128
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.440
You've been rushed too,
but he lived in Russia,
was married to a Russian woman,

129
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.880
right.
Lee Harvey Oswald was most certainly at least in cahoots with the FBI.

130
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.430
He definitely,
yes.
He,
well,

131
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:19.880
he definitely did some things for other organizations.
Uh,

132
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.730
and brought over during the Cold War,

133
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.470
a Russian wife lived over in Russia and then got back in the United States and

134
00:07:27.471 --> 00:07:29.600
brought over is Russia.
We did also go to Cuba,
right?

135
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:32.040
Didn't he spend time in Cuba?
Believe?
I believe he did.
I don't,

136
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.190
I don't remember that.
But I know for a fact he lived in Russia,

137
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.470
communist production,
but he was part of a,
a Cuban movement,

138
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:43.790
like a liberty for Cuba.
Cuba spent time in Kilby might have,

139
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.400
he didn't go to Cuba.
Okay,
well Jamie,
you'll find it.
But the,

140
00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:51.230
but the bottom line is he easily could have been working for the government and

141
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:54.440
he easily could have been a part of the plan and he easily could have been a guy

142
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.920
that they fell.
Yeah,
they set him up because he still alive.
No,

143
00:07:58.921 --> 00:08:03.140
we got shot by Jack Ruby like a couple of days after he shot Kennedy or
allegedly

144
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.970
tied evac and cancer in jail.
Not only that,

145
00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:12.530
Jack Ruby was a mob guy that was deeply beholden to all these different groups.

146
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.470
And you know,
which is very weird,
right?
Why?

147
00:08:15.471 --> 00:08:20.471
Why would Jack Ruby a mob guy kill meet Harvey Oswald in broad daylight while

148
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.170
he's being escorted?
Like what?
What would they,
they were like,
well,

149
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:26.340
he felt so bad for Jackie.
That doesn't make any sense.

150
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.490
The JFK story is vast.

151
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.810
It would take you fucking 25 hours.
People have written books on it.
I mean,

152
00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:39.230
it's so deep.
Everybody wanted JFK dead.

153
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:43.940
The CII wanted them to get the Emmy season in Cuba and the Soviet Union,

154
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.100
so he wasn't killing oil.
Want to know that everybody wanted him dead.

155
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.810
So he's trying to change the world.

156
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.860
He visited embassies in Cuba and the Soviet Union to plot has escaped before

157
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.500
assassinating John F.
Kennedy.
I think he was in on it.
That's what I think.

158
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.130
For sure.
Yeah.
Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone,

159
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:05.700
but I do believe he was in on it and I bet he didn't pull the trigger.

160
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.550
I bet a bunch of other people pull the trigger and I bet he was the,

161
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.860
he was the guy they set up command.
Yeah,

162
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:15.450
because up there like Dallas Howard hunt is,
yes.

163
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.040
<v 2>The Howard hunt was in the CIA.</v>

164
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.030
He was part of a Watergate.
He's,

165
00:09:22.031 --> 00:09:26.320
he's very big in the CIA on his deathbed.
He says that,

166
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.540
uh,
there was all the,
the assassins from operation 40 operations,

167
00:09:31.541 --> 00:09:33.910
40 was a unit that,
that um,

168
00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:38.020
they put together to assassinate Fidel Castro,
all these international killers.

169
00:09:38.021 --> 00:09:42.610
It's just like,
uh,
like the murder incorporated operation 40 it,
yeah,

170
00:09:42.611 --> 00:09:47.500
exactly.
All these,
these,
uh,
snipers and killers,
uh,

171
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:52.320
anti Castro,
Cubans,
you know,
there were exiled there.

172
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.410
They all got together.
They tried to kill Fidel Castro.
Bay of Pigs failed.

173
00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:02.090
Um,
uh,
because JFK,
part of the reason was because,
uh,

174
00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.890
JFK didn't,
uh,
um,
he,
uh,

175
00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.070
he didn't want any air support.
He didn't want to be any part.

176
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.430
He didn't want any part of Bay of pigs.

177
00:10:10.431 --> 00:10:13.510
So the CIA felt like they got abandoned by JFK.

178
00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.810
JFK fires the head of the CIA.
So right there,

179
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.410
there was a big riff between the Cin,
JFK.

180
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:25.360
The mob hated JFK too,
because they were supposed to protect them.
Bob,

181
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:29.140
Robert Kennedy and JFK.
But because their dad was a mobster,

182
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.790
so they thought they were going to be protected.

183
00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:35.170
So the mom spent all this money to get JFK n and then he's turning on him and,

184
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.470
and,
and Robert Kennedy,
his brother,
he's the attorney general.

185
00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:41.260
He's going after the mob.
So they're like,
okay,
we got to stop these months.

186
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.110
So when you look,
when you look really,
really look into it,

187
00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:46.690
a lot of people wanted him dead.
Big Oil wanted him dead.

188
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:51.100
They killed them in Texas.
Lyndon B Johnson,
Lyndon B Johnson,

189
00:10:51.101 --> 00:10:54.490
the vice president was about to be indicted for two murders.

190
00:10:55.510 --> 00:11:00.310
He had the,
you know how,
how,
uh,
he stopped that.
JFK got assassinated.

191
00:11:00.311 --> 00:11:02.290
He becomes president.
He pardons himself.

192
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.540
<v 0>It was a crazy time,
different place.</v>

193
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.270
Not a lot on his death bed.

194
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.950
Said operation for the Bulimia,

195
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:22.000
depression 40 were all there.
They were all there to watch the big event.

196
00:11:22.001 --> 00:11:24.650
They all collaborate.
He says it's on his deathbed and here's even,

197
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:27.600
he was there as a bomb.
He was one of the bumps.
We were all watching.

198
00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.000
There's a photograph of him.
There's was a photograph of him from the arrest.

199
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.780
They arrested a bunch of Hobos.
I said getting off a plane,
rock killers.

200
00:11:34.781 --> 00:11:35.860
They were all assassins.

201
00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.580
They were and they've identified some of the guys who were on that,

202
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.780
on that train.
One of them was a fucking,
the the actor,

203
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.090
the fuck's his name.
Woody Harrelson.
Harrelson.
Where he house.

204
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.440
His Dad was the assassin.
Dad was an assassin,

205
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:55.330
like legitimate in a sense and crazy and e on his death bed.

206
00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:00.330
You can watch this at the library on Youtube.
[inaudible]
hunt.

207
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.200
He said he was,
he was bench warming.
He was,

208
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.300
there was a lot just in case something went wrong.

209
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.490
There was a bunch of people there.
He was getting shot.

210
00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:14.020
He was getting lit up from all sorts of the Hobos were undercover cops?

211
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:15.950
No,
no.
The whole boat or

212
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.600
at least one of the Hobos had been identified as a known as as done.

213
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.440
Not just the hour,
but there's other guys that have like,

214
00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:26.110
people have broken down the photos of the Hobos and they said that,

215
00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:29.720
that this guy is that guy.
This guy's an assassin.
Like what they weighed it,

216
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.190
it seems like they had done was they had planned to kill Kennedy and they

217
00:12:33.191 --> 00:12:36.280
planned to do it in Dallas for some reason and they brought in a bunch of

218
00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:38.830
different people to do it.
Now here's where it gets really squirrely.

219
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.580
When you find out how many people who are witnesses who testified that they were

220
00:12:42.581 --> 00:12:46.750
there at the shooting wound up dying and really fucked up ways.

221
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.970
They wound up dying by murder.

222
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:52.360
They wound up dying and weird car accidents where they're fucking break lines

223
00:12:52.361 --> 00:12:56.290
were cut.
There was a ton of them.
So many of them that they,
someone,

224
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.850
I think it might've been lifting as well.

225
00:12:57.851 --> 00:13:00.130
David lifted the same guy who wrote best evidence.

226
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:04.570
They had some calculation on what the odds are of all these people meeting

227
00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:08.700
violent demises inside of two years.
And it was crazy,
bro.

228
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.970
See if you could find that young.
Jamie got the plug from final p.
Um,
no.

229
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:14.940
How many people see if the,
the,

230
00:13:14.941 --> 00:13:18.130
the amount of people who witnessed the Kennedy assassination,

231
00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:21.310
who wound up dying under mysterious circumstances,
crazy shit.

232
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.630
Astronauts,
aliens to one.
It's like a millions to one.

233
00:13:25.631 --> 00:13:28.930
Like if you look at how many people died and what are the odds of them all like

234
00:13:28.931 --> 00:13:33.910
getting murdered or killed in suicide,
suicide.
We are weird suicides,
you know,

235
00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:37.990
like hang themselves on a fucking coat rack.
Like weird shit.
Yeah,
Jay,

236
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:42.000
the JFK story is deep as fuck.
They killed that guy,
buddy.

237
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.820
Everybody collaborated.
They all agreed we need to get rid of this guy.
See,

238
00:13:45.821 --> 00:13:48.780
I'm surprised more guys as they get older than them,
their deathbed.

239
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.420
Don't tell the truth.
Nobody cares.
Here's the thing.

240
00:13:51.421 --> 00:13:55.810
By then there is also plenty of fake stories.
All they have to do,
look at it.

241
00:13:55.811 --> 00:13:56.590
Here we go.
Here.

242
00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.850
Look at this 101,000 trillion to one.

243
00:14:00.851 --> 00:14:03.970
Some have claimed that a large number of witness and event of died mysterious

244
00:14:03.971 --> 00:14:07.690
circumstances Sunday Times reported that the odds against these witnesses being

245
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:09.730
dead by February,

246
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.000
1967 or 100,000 trillion to one whoa

247
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:18.190
admitted he had made a careless journalistic mistake in his book,

248
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:23.250
a crossfire author Jim marrs provides a list of 103 people he claimed died in

249
00:14:23.831 --> 00:14:27.070
mysterious circumstances between 63 and 76 in reality,

250
00:14:27.071 --> 00:14:28.900
most of these people died of natural causes.

251
00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.420
Some of these people did die in accidents.

252
00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:33.670
Others were murdered or committed suicide.
However,

253
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:38.560
these people rarely had information that would have been important in helping

254
00:14:38.561 --> 00:14:42.670
advance that.
That sounds like an editorialization.
I want to know who's writing.

255
00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:43.271
I think about it.

256
00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:46.390
If you're going to pull off an assassination and then you're all going to go as

257
00:14:46.391 --> 00:14:49.450
a group,
let's kill everybody around them.
Doesn't matter.
That's hard to do.

258
00:14:49.451 --> 00:14:52.190
That doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
I don't have to.
I'm looking at that.
Right.

259
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:57.200
What I'm saying is what that guy wrote is an editorialization like that might be

260
00:14:57.201 --> 00:14:59.210
correct,
but it might be wrong too.

261
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.080
He's making an assumption and he's writing this gas based on that assumption.

262
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:07.340
Wow.
I mean,
I dunno how you'd like,
okay,
so you've got all those witnesses.

263
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:08.870
That's how fucking,
that's really hard.

264
00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:11.090
Now you've got to organize all those murders.
Good luck.

265
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.930
All these different people that were witnesses.
Look at this.
Get,

266
00:15:14.931 --> 00:15:18.380
make that a little larger,
Jamie.
So I could read this shit.
Look at this.

267
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.070
They all die pretty spaced out that a lot of times you're talking to these,
oh,

268
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:23.930
these are all Kennedy's that were whacked.
Yeah.
Yeah.

269
00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:27.140
Well everybody hates the Kennedys,
man.
They were,
they started out kill him again.

270
00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.620
I started out as drug runners.
They were running moonshine.

271
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.910
That's how they started.
That's where they made their money.
Joe Kennedy

272
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.880
and JFK and,
and,
and uh,
the rest of his sons,

273
00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:40.190
they started trying to change the world for real.
And they're like,

274
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:44.030
what are you doing happening?
Everybody want to,
JFK died.
They knew.

275
00:15:44.031 --> 00:15:48.550
They joked around about how they knew what they were trying to do is,
you know,

276
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.770
put their lives in jeopardy.
You know,
what's really interesting?
Robertson,

277
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.520
the way his son died on that plane.
You look into that.
Holy Shot.

278
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:58.040
That guy was coked up,
man.
He's coked up and he didn't know what he was doing.

279
00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:01.460
He was driving into the fog.
You have to be really good.
You got to look into,

280
00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:04.340
I did.
Did you really?
Yeah.
Do you think?
Did he died?

281
00:16:04.341 --> 00:16:07.250
He died with cocaine in his system and he didn't know how to drive the plot of

282
00:16:07.251 --> 00:16:11.390
shady shit to people.
People could fish body.
They found a plain,

283
00:16:11.391 --> 00:16:14.840
they found his body when people had a rash over a hundred murder,

284
00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:16.700
suicides and mysterious deaths.

285
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:21.410
The strange fate of those who saw Kennedy shot for sure live.
He saw it.

286
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.450
See,
I'd have to,
I'd have to read all these different,

287
00:16:24.451 --> 00:16:27.630
you're organized is killed by a karate job.
What's coming out?
Sign out.

288
00:16:27.631 --> 00:16:30.580
I'm a patsy.
I'm a patsy.
I'm being set up pop,
pop,
pop,

289
00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:35.360
and then Jack Ruby shoots him on TV and this is Jim Khan was killed by a karate

290
00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:38.480
chop to the throat as the emergency shout there,
Jack Ruby killing.

291
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.100
That's what makes raises mind where I go.
Why would Jack Ruby killed so much

292
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:48.440
and then just keep his mouth shut and go to jail?
What the fuck is that about?

293
00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:52.970
That?
That's the part that I think is really super expert on JFK.

294
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.650
You know more than I do,
but I spent a lot of time on JFK as well.
I just,

295
00:16:57.651 --> 00:16:59.240
you just,
you know,
I just let you talk,

296
00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:02.480
but I know a lot about that and there's so much,

297
00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.520
there's people that these people that know way more than me,

298
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:08.180
only read a few people's books.
The guy that blows me away the most about JFK,

299
00:17:08.181 --> 00:17:10.430
who knows that he studies all the players.

300
00:17:10.431 --> 00:17:13.250
All the mob guys involved is a guy named ride Dawson.

301
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.630
He's fucking JFK encyclopedia.
Dude.
He knows.

302
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.850
It's so deep.
It's like game of Thrones times 10 yeah.

303
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.700
It's hard to tell who's right.

304
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:26.660
It isn't just JFK be Harvey Oswald and maybe a couple other assassins.

305
00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.710
It's so goddamn deep.
Do you could spend a life,

306
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.180
a lifetime just studying and all the names and how they're all connected.

307
00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:36.890
It's crazy.
It's super fast.

308
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:47.020
<v 3>Okay.</v>
