1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.440
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.250
<v 1>I much more like Brock because I remember when Frank Mir describe rock on top of</v>

3
00:00:06.251 --> 00:00:06.641
him.
He was like,

4
00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:10.110
it was like a car that was slowly and been onto him and he couldn't push it off

5
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:12.570
and you're like,
you know,
imagine a bears on you.

6
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.660
You're just like sitting there like,
dude,

7
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.050
it's got my shoulder blade and it's just knowing that my shoulder blade and I'm,

8
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.420
I know I'm going to die.
Nothing you can do.
Holy Fuck.
Do you think you would,

9
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.200
the adrenaline would kick in where you wouldn't feel the pain or do you think it

10
00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:24.700
would be the most horrible fucking,

11
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.740
<v 0>he definitely wouldn't feel it.
You'd feel it.
It would hurt,</v>

12
00:00:27.741 --> 00:00:32.741
but you would be so terrified of death and you'd be so overwhelmed with all

13
00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:37.790
these fucking neurochemicals to be flying through your synapses.

14
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.030
You'd be out of your mind.
You feel like the pressure that it's happening.

15
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.640
You had,
you had there,
there'd be so much adrenaline.

16
00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:51.860
You'd be in another dimension before you knew it.
That's probably,

17
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.280
that seems like the worst way to die.

18
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.120
There's a guy who got bit real bad and came back and had a video.

19
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.190
He did a selfie and talked about what happened.
He was just walking,

20
00:01:03.191 --> 00:01:06.550
hiking down a trail,
scouting and he came across to um,

21
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.170
female grizzly and her cubs,
which is the worst scenario.

22
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.160
A male grizzly doesn't really,

23
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.160
unless he's really old and it's really late in the season.

24
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:16.930
Usually they'll just get the fuck away from you,

25
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.790
but the females will fuck you up.

26
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.710
And this female fucked him up and tore his scalp right off of his skull and he

27
00:01:23.711 --> 00:01:26.170
had it like packed down with a baseball hat,

28
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.560
like try to try to hold it in place and his arm snapped and he had big bite

29
00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:35.500
marks in his arm.
But this guy was like a Montana dude,

30
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.520
like the Montana tough.
So he's like,
well vitals are intact.

31
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.960
It might be broken.
I don't know what's going on up there.

32
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.140
Cold Shit.

33
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.350
Fucking yoga teacher and ally.
Okay.
Do you

34
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.010
see,
oh my God.
Looked down his head.

35
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.460
The grizzly with two cubs.
Ha You Kiki.
You barely see,

36
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:04.050
but the right side of his ear,

37
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.880
his head is basically ripped apart.
I'll save my watch though.

38
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.030
He put the hat on to make himself like,
you know my Christ.

39
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.160
Fucking kidding.

40
00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:19.161
Yet she never got my daddy's watch drove himself to a hospital after walking

41
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:22.310
three miles to his car.
That's a fucking man.
I'll,

42
00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:26.100
I'll be damned if I'm not going to get the gosh darn best Facebook live video

43
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:30.810
out of this.
Literally all look at the size of the hole in it's,
Oh my God,
mother,

44
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.990
Fuck.
He's smiling in the picture because he's a fucking Montana dude.

45
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:34.920
There are different humans.

46
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:39.921
Do you remember the famous the bear with the karate suit guy and he just fucking

47
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.780
knocks out the lady
specials?
You have a joke about that.

48
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.510
He remembers that.
He's the barrier.

49
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.630
Tears his bitch apart.
It's horrible.

50
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:59.620
And the other guy with the karate uniforms tribe
decided out of nowhere.

51
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:03.610
Yes,
sure.
He just decided out of nowhere that he's going to fuck that lady up

52
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.020
and nobody feels bad because you put a fucking party.

53
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:12.880
Had I met bear trying to do man,
that ain't working.
Yeah,
that's simple.

54
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.960
Simple as that.
Um,
I'm scared of animals do it and now that I have a kid too,

55
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:19.150
like I'm getting my,
here it is.
This is the video.

56
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.680
Gutterati and bed sits down.
Oh,
this is fine.

57
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.810
Who's this bitch?

58
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.180
The size of the thing.

59
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:37.540
Like look at the power in it when it grabs her launch.

60
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.620
Imagine how terrified she must've been and everyone's slapping it,

61
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.050
bitch slapping it.
The host is even getting in there.

62
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.270
Why would the host get in there?
Are you crazy

63
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.320
dudes wrestling with a bear
that is Russian.
He's that good.

64
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.770
Ticketek that guy has to be rushed and look at the power in his fucking gay
teen.

65
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.450
He's almost got the bear.
He's almost got the bear out.
Jesus Christ.

66
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:04.150
This is so crazy in the bear.
Still holding onto that person.

67
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.380
Pass fucking that personnel also,
not even the hardest day of her life in Russia.

68
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.430
Oh my God.
She mean she must've got fucked up by that bear dude.

69
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.020
I mean really fucked up.

70
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.080
The bear didn't use great technique to get out of the gear teeth,

71
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.280
but we just kind of powered out of it.

72
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.620
The only thing that saved her life is that that bear had a muzzle on.

73
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.200
I love that he looks at her like she said something offensive bullies,

74
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.980
you can't predict.
And that's a brown bear that's similar to a grizzly bear.

75
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.920
Probably the Russian version of a brown bear.

76
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.790
They'd have big ass bears over there.
Yeah.
Fuck that dude.
Fuck bears,
dude.
I've,

77
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.740
I saw a real grizzly bear in the wild and it wasn't that far away.

78
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:45.700
There was like 30 40 yards and looked me in the eyes and I remember thinking,

79
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.850
Whoa,
that's a different look.
He went,
Oh shit.

80
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:52.330
That's Joe Rowe wasn't even a big one.
It was only like a six foot tall grizzly,

81
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:55.080
which is not a big grizzly,
but it looked to me,
it looked it,

82
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.760
they look through you like,
what am I gonna do?
Am I gonna eat you?

83
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.250
What am I doing?
Is this safe to safe?
They have to lay low.
The brain's calculate.

84
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.320
Do you have a weapon on you or you have two shotguns and two bows and arrows,

85
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.040
but still,
I'd probably take a while to shotguns and one bone arrow.
I got Sean.

86
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.030
You got my test?
Yeah.
Yes,
it would take a while.
Yeah,
it's not,

87
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.220
it's not that easy.
It's a big animal.

88
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.710
Even a six foot one is probably probably 300 pounds.
I mean,

89
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.350
it's a big animal,
but it's the way they look at you.
That's different.
Like I've,

90
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.500
I've seen black bears in the wild.
They look at you like,
what are you,

91
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.430
what's going on over here?
What's happening?
Grizzlies look right through you.

92
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.500
They look right through you.
It's a weird look.

93
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.490
It's a weird like dead look like there's no fear of you at all.

94
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:41.020
Like what do I do here?

95
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.330
They just trying to figure out whether or not you're a meal.

96
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.420
You're just wandering.

97
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.520
Imagine being a 300 pound animal that just has to wander around looking for shit

98
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:52.930
to eat.
Welcome to the life of big jail.
I swear to you,
I was gonna say,

99
00:05:52.931 --> 00:05:57.380
can you please stop describing wild animals dimensions.
I've been in life.

100
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.200
I mean,
this is a fucking crazy bear.

101
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:02.390
Like you see this thing come in and run because it will eat.

102
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:04.700
You are human beings.
Hundred pounds.

103
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.010
That's coming at you.
All you can do is put it down,
put it in his gut,

104
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:14.190
their misery.
I said,
animal 300 pounds that is hungry,
imaginary,

105
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.740
no stores.

106
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.100
Looking for hunters to the slipping people at limps.

107
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.420
It just like a,
well,
we,
um,
I was with my friend Jen,

108
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.280
she's a guide and she smacked a fucking tree with this stick.

109
00:06:32.281 --> 00:06:37.200
She picked up the stick and crack this fucking tree and screamed and I screamed

110
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.200
and we cocked our shotguns and that thing took off.

111
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.700
<v 2>Okay.</v>
