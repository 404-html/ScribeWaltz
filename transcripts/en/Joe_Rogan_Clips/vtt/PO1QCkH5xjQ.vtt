WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.800
Where a little fucking high ride.
We're going to get through it.

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:05.581
I'm so bummed.

3
00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:08.390
I was thinking about going to Hawaii the other day and then his fucking,

4
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.400
you know happened.
I'm like,
of all the times I was there I,

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.180
oh you were there when it happened.
It was in Lanai.

6
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.780
I was on one of the other islands.
Did you feel the earthquake?
No,

7
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:17.760
I didn't feel it.
It's,
you know,

8
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.410
it's separated by quite a lot is a lot of water and the way the big earthquake

9
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:24.900
happened actually after the plane took off,

10
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.350
so we were in the air when the big one hit.
Oh yeah.

11
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:29.910
Which it's apparently a big one.

12
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:34.410
Like a five nine I think was even more than that.
Was it six Oh,

13
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.250
oh right.
They had a big one and then they had a fucking really big one.

14
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.580
I'm five nine it's big.
I think the way it works,

15
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.830
I'm sure someone will correct me here.

16
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.660
I think the way it works is a five six is like really powerful,
but a five,

17
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:52.740
seven is twice as powerful than a five.
Eight is twice as powerful as that.

18
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.600
So when you get up to seven,
like that's some world changing shit.

19
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.560
It's actually 6.9 my God.
That's insane.
Oh my God.

20
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.460
Can you imagine being on the God?
Who was that powerful?
That's so big.

21
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:10.050
That's such a big earthquake,
man.
Did you see the um,
I put it up.

22
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:10.861
It's so funny,
Dude.

23
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:14.220
You put up anything that's from CNN and people wanted to put her up from a

24
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:19.020
verifiable source.
Not Cnn.
CNN.
It's bullshit.
It's a video.

25
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:23.830
You fucking asshole.
It's a video of lava eating a car.
My stake,

26
00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:26.030
CNN faked it.
Blessed.

27
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.470
But I'd like to say I like the secret closest fab diets at CNN.

28
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.440
It's not full of shit.
And then I'll go to their website.

29
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.640
Stupid to people are so goofy.

30
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.800
They're so goofy with this fake new shit.
It's lava.
It ate a car.

31
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.940
It happened.
Do you see the video?
Yeah,
the white,

32
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.390
the white car pull this shit up.
I think it's called that.

33
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:50.430
That cards forever going to be in rock.

34
00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:52.650
So like when we all died and like the future,

35
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:54.770
like people can like find this card and the wheels.

36
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.230
It's broken down to the bare elements at this point.

37
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.010
I'm assuming it just got completely melted.
I wonder.

38
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.110
They say that stuff is 2000 degrees and it's so hot,

39
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.420
but it's molten rock.
So like if it didn't burn through your feet or I give you,

40
00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:14.670
if you weren't flammable at all for some strange reason,

41
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:17.910
you could actually walk on it.
Yeah.
And I'm like what?

42
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.210
I thought you would just sink in it but no,

43
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.050
and apparently it's cooling like right out of after it gets out of the surface.

44
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.440
Oh this is so crazy.
This is like a monster.

45
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.530
So we're watching this lava flow on Hawaii's big island.

46
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.350
I like how Jamie went with CBS news flipped sooner.

47
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.230
Brew folk the Food News.
Actually Brandon Clement got the video.
Oh powerful.

48
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:42.000
Brendan Clement.
But this guy,

49
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:45.060
whoever he is a bad motherfucker cause look what he was next to.

50
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.380
He was filming this.
I mean he was near this thing.

51
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.610
Oh my God.
Like,
imagine being on that street and staying,

52
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.290
what kind of a crazy fuck you have to be to be on that street and stay.

53
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.930
And then it's 6.9 hits during all this.
That's so big.

54
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.030
That's such a crazy earthquake.
But they live on a volcano.
I mean,

55
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.720
it's one of the reasons why a lot of people don't want to live on the big
island.

56
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.290
So shit like this.
Yeah,
that splatter one's crazy.

57
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.500
There's a fissure in this neighborhood.

58
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.110
There's a subdivision out there and it's something is states,

59
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:23.500
I forget what it is,
but they're fucking neighborhood.
Do the,
the,

60
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.000
the ground opened up in their neighborhood.
I mean,
if you lived,

61
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.250
you know,
thousands of years ago,

62
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.890
this would be an angry God coming to attack your village.

63
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.160
Could you imagine if normal days you're in Hawaii,

64
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.740
you're in one of the most beautiful places on the planet.

65
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.550
You're just chilling and the sun is perfect.
And you'd see in the ocean,

66
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:45.970
you hear the seagulls and you see dolphins and shit,

67
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.680
and then the ground opens up and hell starts pouring out,

68
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.780
eats your house each,
your Mustang fuck.

69
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:57.810
And they were talking about it today on the news of like,

70
00:03:57.811 --> 00:04:01.780
there's nothing we can do is nothing that I can't pour water on it.
Nope,

71
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.750
can't do shit.
You're not going to stop it.
It's too big.
