1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.470
Another thing that's alarming to me is the redefining of terms like sexism and

2
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:07.890
racism or sexism against men.
It's impossible.

3
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:09.920
Racism against White People's impossible,
right?

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.260
This redefining as these prejudices only exist if you're coming from a position

5
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:19.650
of power.
That's really weird.
And it also,

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.670
it opens up the door to treating people as an other,

7
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.120
literally the people that are the victims of racism are now using racism against

8
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:34.170
other people and feeling justified because of it and it,

9
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:38.130
and having a bunch of people that will agree with them that this is in fact not

10
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:38.940
racism.

11
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.020
And this is pushing back on white privilege and saying all these different weird

12
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:47.850
things that you know,
and,
and they feel really comfortable in saying these open,

13
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.320
racist,

14
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.210
generalizing things about white people or about white men or about,

15
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.700
you know,
fill in the blank.
But whatever group that you're a,

16
00:00:56.701 --> 00:01:00.690
you're attacking and it's,
it's really strange.
It's really strange to see.

17
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.660
But again,
it makes sense if you look at the different games.
Yeah.

18
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:07.620
So if you're on university and you think you're playing the truth game and

19
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:09.990
philosophers are great at this,
they're always unpacking terms.

20
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.240
And so you might try to define racism ever or any sort of ism and you a common

21
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:15.691
sense view.

22
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:20.100
It would be an expression of hostility or resentment or limitation on a group

23
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:24.300
based on their identity.
Um,
but that's if you're playing the truth seeking game,

24
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.050
if you're playing the politics game or the warfare game,
um,

25
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.970
you want to define the terms to give your side maximum advantage.

26
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.930
So there's a wonderful social psychologist named Phil Tetlock at Penn,

27
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:40.550
at Wharton,
and,
and he talks about these different mindsets we get into.

28
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.610
And one of them,
he calls the intuitive prosecutor.
So if,
if I'm,

29
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:49.611
if my goal as a scholar is to prosecute my enemies and maximally convict them

30
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.320
and I am always trying to defend,
you know,

31
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:55.890
seven different identity groups against the straight white men,
they're the,

32
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.910
they're the accused.

33
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.920
I want to define my terms to make it maximally easy to convict.

34
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.430
And so I am going to say racism and microaggressions.

35
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.460
It doesn't matter what the intent was,
all that matters is the impact.

36
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:14.820
All that matters about the person felt that way.
As long as someone's offended,

37
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.500
I get to charge you with a crime.
So,
uh,
and also on racism,
um,

38
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.230
you can say as,
as you know,

39
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.560
a lot of kids are learning in high school that these days racism is prejudice

40
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.790
plus power.

41
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.330
So by definition a black person or a gay person or whatever and he cannot be

42
00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:37.020
racist or whatever other term because they don't have power regardless of their

43
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:41.520
social class actually being taught.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So their professors are,

44
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:43.720
this is coming out of their mouth.
Well just saying,

45
00:02:43.721 --> 00:02:47.270
so this is taught in a number of high schools,
uh,

46
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.840
at my nephews went to Andover,
uh,
they learned this offensive thing.

47
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.670
It'd be teaching children.

48
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.180
It's not just that it's offensive and obviously hypocritical.

49
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.290
It's that it's crippling.
Yes.
I mean you imagine,
can you,
so look,
you've got,

50
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.143
you've got kids,
right?
You have two,

51
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.330
two daughters and three cause you have three daughters.

52
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.310
Can you imagine giving your daughter's a cloak of invulnerability where you say

53
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.030
you put this on now you get to attack others,

54
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.140
but no one can touch you.
Like this is going to warp their development,

55
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:21.190
power corrupts and even moral,
a rhetorical power corrupts as well.

56
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.110
How is this being taught though?
I mean how,

57
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:27.770
how is this becomes accepted as a part of a curriculum?
So,
um,

58
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.570
because the goal is not truth,
the goal is victory over racism let's say.

59
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.130
And so if that's the case,

60
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:38.131
you're going to focus on educating kids about their white privilege and um,

61
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.890
making end.
So that's what a lot of these privilege exercises are.

62
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.150
You line kids up by their privilege and you and your,
your goal is to make the,

63
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.280
the straight white boys feel bad about their privilege and therefore talk less,

64
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:52.510
take up less space,

65
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.280
<v 1>their privilege.</v>

66
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.300
This is what we were talking about earlier about the goal is no racism.

67
00:03:56.301 --> 00:03:59.180
The privilege only exists if there's racism.

68
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.220
Like instead of concentrating on the privilege that it only exists if people do

69
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.110
preferentially treat certain,
the preferential treatment towards certain races.

70
00:04:09.111 --> 00:04:12.260
If that doesn't exist at all,
then white privilege doesn't exist.

71
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.990
<v 0>Well,
I'm actually,
I'm not sure I'd agree with you on that.
So we have also,
well,</v>

72
00:04:15.991 --> 00:04:20.640
so we had a funny episode last night and so my wife and I were out in La.

73
00:04:20.641 --> 00:04:24.840
We were invited to the Golden Globes by,
by a friend.
And so we're here in la.

74
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.120
So we,
we,
um,
uh,

75
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.660
we go to bed in the hotel room and at two in the morning,

76
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.440
the guys pounding on the door saying,
come on,
let me in.
It's me,
it's me.

77
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.680
And you know,
I wake up and I go to the door and I,
and I say,

78
00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:42.030
wrong room and he can't hear me.
So I opened the door a crack and to show him,

79
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.300
you know,
like,
look,
I don't know,
I don't know who you are and you know,

80
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:49.440
some drunk,
some drunk guy.
And uh,
and I said,
you know,
you've got the wrong room.

81
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.950
And I went back to bed and breakfast this morning.
My wife says,

82
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.090
why didn't you open the door?
Like,
how could you have done that?
I said,
you know,

83
00:04:57.091 --> 00:04:59.130
we're in a nice hotel.
I mean what's,
you know,
what's going to happen?

84
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.660
And she made it clear like a woman would never have done that.
Like you as a man,

85
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.780
you have the ability to go out in the world and engage with in a certain way

86
00:05:06.781 --> 00:05:09.270
that I don't have as one.
I,
that's a great example.

87
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.010
So there is a kind of male privilege.
Sure exists.
Even if there's no sexism.

88
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.170
<v 1>Yeah,
that's an interesting,
that's an interesting example.
Um,
that's a,</v>

89
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.680
that's a sexism one,
but that's also a physical danger one.
Yeah,
that's it.

90
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.951
There's a,

91
00:05:22.951 --> 00:05:27.600
there is a difference between just the way women have to go out into the world

92
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.170
being vulnerable and also being the target of,

93
00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:36.000
of just a male sexual attention.

94
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.180
A very different thing.
It's an aggressive person.
Dangerous thing.

95
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.850
<v 0>Yeah.
But I,
I think you could say the same thing about race in this way.
So,
um,</v>

96
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.150
cause there's racism though.
Well,
okay.
Okay.
You're right.
If,

97
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.840
if there was absolute zero racism anywhere,

98
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.280
but whenever going to get to that.

99
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.610
<v 1>But,
but the thing that we're worried about is the racism.</v>

100
00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.070
So like if you worried if someone's,
if

101
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.450
<v 0>you say you have white privilege,</v>

102
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.280
well that only exists if you are being dealt with in a racist manner.

103
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.460
So if you're a black person and there is racism that's being directed towards

104
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:12.530
you and it's not being direct towards me,
then you can say,

105
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:16.250
well I have white privilege,
but if there's no racism directed towards anybody,

106
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:20.960
that doesn't exist anymore.
So the issue is racism.
Yes.
Right.
Okay.
But so look,

107
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.980
I think it's,

108
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.880
it's helpful to always try to look at it from the other person's point of view.

109
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.220
I want to listen to their arguments and stuff.
For example,

110
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.070
when you and I go into any social encounter,

111
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.220
it never occurs to me that something,
you know,

112
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:36.920
something's going to come up and someone's going to call me a Kike,
let's say.

113
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.780
Right?
Yeah.
Cause I'm,
I'm Jewish and it just,

114
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:42.290
it just never crosses my mind that someone's going to humiliate me because I'm

115
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:47.090
Jewish.
Um,
um,
but if you're black,
even if you're in a very tolerant society,

116
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.180
at some point someone is going to make an assumption,
it might not be.

117
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.450
It might be.
So all I'm saying is you and I don't,

118
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.870
there are certain things we don't have to think about and that whereas if we

119
00:06:56.871 --> 00:06:59.830
were black or other identities or visibly gay or you know,

120
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.920
there would be the risk of spoiling of a social interaction.

121
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:07.550
So I'm totally comfortable saying we should be telling our kids about this,

122
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.830
but what follows from it?
What follows from it?

123
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.810
Should we therefore be telling kids?
Okay,
so you know,
um,
you know,

124
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.230
judge people based on their appearance,
um,

125
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.280
be suspicious of people based on their race and gender.
That's where,

126
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.650
that's where I get off the bus,
the bus.
That's where I say,

127
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:26.000
now we're really hurting kids.

128
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.720
We should be turning down the moralism and we're turning it up.
Right?

129
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.310
But what I'm getting at is pointing at someone and saying,

130
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:38.660
you have white privilege.
If they are not racist,
you're,
you're,
you're,

131
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.590
you're giving this person,
you're,
you're putting these PR,

132
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.540
this person in a category that really only exists in the face of racism where

133
00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:49.430
the real problem is racism.
Yes.

134
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.100
With the male female thing is a very different way.

135
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:55.640
That male privilege I think is way more slippery and wave cause it's

136
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:56.870
biologically based.

137
00:07:56.871 --> 00:08:01.700
There's a creepiness to men and then there is as much as a nice guy as I'm sure

138
00:08:01.701 --> 00:08:06.020
you are,
and I try very hard to be a nice guy.
No,
just kidding.

139
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.150
But every woman's encountered creeps.
Yes.
It's inevitable because it's,
there's a,

140
00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:14.660
a game being played this pursuing of sexual pleasure or of,
of,

141
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:19.280
of sexual encounters.
This doesn't exist or it shouldn't exist with races.
Yeah.

142
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:20.740
The just the,

143
00:08:20.741 --> 00:08:25.741
the real problem in my eyes is racism and if we could figure out a way to just

144
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:29.460
complete,
obviously it's not going to let people are flawed.
They're,

145
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.290
they're going to be,

146
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.860
until there's some sort of new way that we interface with each other that

147
00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:38.060
eliminates lies and deception and allows each other to completely understand

148
00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:40.940
each other's feelings and appreciate them,
which may happen some day,

149
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:43.880
probably technologically driven until that happens,

150
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:48.020
there's going to be a certain amount of it,
but the real enemy is racism.

151
00:08:48.021 --> 00:08:52.040
It's not white people just getting lucky.
Yeah.
Okay.

152
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.240
But I would say not that we shouldn't acknowledge it.
Yeah.
So you,

153
00:08:56.241 --> 00:08:59.530
you said earlier about how definitions change.

154
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.070
So we are evolving as a society.

155
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:05.460
We're getting less sexist and racist and so our threshold for what counts as

156
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:08.520
sexist and racist going down,
that's a good thing that should happen.
Right?
Um,

157
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.150
but I think what we need to call attention to is that when you,

158
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:14.940
if you lower the threshold faster than the reality changes,

159
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.620
then you make progress.
But yet people feel worse and worse.
And so,
um,

160
00:09:19.621 --> 00:09:23.140
and so I think that's part of what's happening on campus.
That makes sense.
The,

161
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.230
the progress.
So the,
the,

162
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.990
the loudest protest tend to happen at the most progressive schools.

163
00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:32.520
It's places like Middlebury.
And Yale and Berkeley.
Um,
and you know,

164
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.880
so I think that we are,
we are,

165
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.660
if you bring in a diverse student body and we're all trying to diversify,

166
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:40.231
we're all in.

167
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:43.950
Every school I know of is trying very hard to create a very diverse student
body.

168
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:48.060
So if we do that and we bring people in and we give them a common humanity

169
00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:52.200
approach,
it's going to work great.
Diversity.
If you handle it well,

170
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.910
it can confirm many benefits,
but if you handle it wrong,

171
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.230
if you try to make people see race and other groups more and you attach moral

172
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:04.380
valence as to it and you give them a lot of the stuff that they get in the

173
00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:04.951
grievance studies,

174
00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:07.380
of course they're going to be angry and of course they're going to feel that

175
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:08.214
people hate them.

176
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.790
It's a terrible thing to bring people into a university and to teach them,

177
00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:15.540
you know what this institution is white supremacist people have implicit bias

178
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:18.390
against you.
Wherever you go,
people are going to hate you.
Like,
no,

179
00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:21.420
this is a really bad thing to do to create an open,
trusting,
inclusive,

180
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:22.254
diverse environment.

181
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:22.771
<v 1>Right?</v>

182
00:10:22.771 --> 00:10:27.630
The right thing to do would be to emphasize how foolish racism really is and

183
00:10:27.631 --> 00:10:30.060
about how damaging it is,
not just to our culture,

184
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:33.360
but to you as an individual to look at people in that way and not open your

185
00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:35.100
heart and your mind to all these different races.

186
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:40.490
And I think one of the worst examples of modern racism that's gone on checked is

187
00:10:41.461 --> 00:10:46.461
what's going on at Harvard with Asian students or Asian students are instead of,

188
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.350
instead of being completely neutral in terms of how they approach all these

189
00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:52.891
races,

190
00:10:52.891 --> 00:10:56.940
Asian students actually have to try harder to get into Harvard and there because

191
00:10:56.941 --> 00:10:59.280
there's so many of them and they're doing so well,

192
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.090
they're being punished for excelling,
which is really racist.

193
00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.280
It's racist against the people that are doing the best,
which is really crazy.

194
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:12.900
And there are minority,
which is even more crazy.
And because of their culture,

195
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:17.901
because they're so hard working and they're not in general than the not the type

196
00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:21.840
to be really loud and protests these things.
Right.

197
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:25.530
It's gone on and he targeted to the point where now they've had to have a class

198
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:26.090
action lawsuit.
