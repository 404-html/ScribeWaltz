1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.151
Did you see that video,

2
00:00:01.151 --> 00:00:05.080
that old man putting the ice on the ground and then pretending you fell?

3
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.680
Oh that's,
yeah.
Allegedly brilliant.
Allegedly.
Allegedly.

4
00:00:08.681 --> 00:00:11.410
There's no allegedly for that.
It's amazing.

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.960
It's amazing to watch cause he didn't know there was a security camera there.

6
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.040
Tried to collect.
Yeah.
There's a lot of people that do that man.

7
00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:19.690
I've seen videos of people doing it at the mall.

8
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.300
They'll like throw a drink down and then slide down on the drink.

9
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.740
<v 1>We had a guy do at one side and a movie theater I worked at and we had it on</v>

10
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:26.551
video off so,

11
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:29.220
and we just showed them the video and then he left and never heard anything

12
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:31.620
about it.
But he was bitching up a storm like he was hurt.

13
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.200
<v 0>Watch sky scarves.
Hilarious.
So he's walking.</v>

14
00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:38.650
He looks around chuck some ice on the ground.
Who Bit of an ice stand?

15
00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:42.640
No big deal.
I'm just going to go over here and la Di da Di da.
Okay,
I love this.

16
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.180
Watch this.
He looks around and make sure no one's looking.
Oh,

17
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.660
even felt like a bitch.
I was like holding his strip.

18
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:54.310
Most ridiculous look at that silly,
silly,

19
00:00:54.311 --> 00:00:55.240
silly man.

20
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.100
The thing about those guys is like anybody that does that kind of shit,

21
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.260
I think the cops,
all they have to do is go,
sure,

22
00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:03.430
what's your social security number?

23
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.510
And then they look up all the shit that he's also done.
Like you don't,

24
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.310
that ain't just a little bit of a scam.

25
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.530
<v 1>That's a guy who's been scam and it's like in Russia and stuff or other</v>

26
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:16.960
countries where everyone's doing the insurance scams.

27
00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:20.020
And so to the point where everybody has to have dash cams on their car.

28
00:01:20.021 --> 00:01:23.950
Now there's a lot of that just triggered a story I heard over the weekend.

29
00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:25.250
There was a knot.
It's,

30
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.160
I think this is a story happening in Houston where the cops broke into a house

31
00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:33.480
where they had heard that there was there,
they think they had a warrant.
Uh,

32
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.600
report was that neighbors had called in black tar heroin sales or something like

33
00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:41.500
that at this house.
So they broke in without knocking.

34
00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:45.350
It was like a no knock warrant.
Uh,
the guys at 57 in the house here,

35
00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:49.300
summer break into his house,
gets a shotgun,
shoots one of the cops,

36
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.750
they kill him.
His wife was like,
what the fuck's going on?

37
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.130
She goes to try to grab the other cops gun that had just fallen.
She gets shot.

38
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.840
Two people are dead and it didn't find any heroine.
Oh Geez.

39
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.590
There's like some weed in there or something like that.
And some people are like,

40
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.280
they didn't have a history of doing much from what I read.

41
00:02:09.281 --> 00:02:11.320
That's why I thought of it.
Cause they look back with these guys.

42
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.760
Do they have an arrest history or anything?

43
00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:15.210
And it wasn't anything that they'd found.
At least when I read about it.

44
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.760
<v 0>Do you remember the one where there was a mayor outside of Washington DC and he,</v>

45
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.653
uh,

46
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.660
they were using his house as an address and it was something with the mail

47
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:28.340
delivery guy was running weed.

48
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.230
And so the mail delivery guy would come by and uh,

49
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.330
the package was addressed to him,

50
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.350
but he would just keep the package cause he knew that this was this guy's house.

51
00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:42.560
It was on his route and that way,
you know,
as the package came in,

52
00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:45.190
the mail would be his to deliver,
but instead of delivering it,

53
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.920
he would hold onto it.
So they break into the mayor's house?
No,

54
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:49.580
you know the whole,

55
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.410
the soldier shoot his fucking dogs chewed his dog and he had like one of my dog,

56
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:58.610
like Marshall.
She's like a super duper sweet dog.
He's a yellow lab,

57
00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:01.120
which is real similar.
I think it was a yellow lab,

58
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.100
might've been golden retriever.
Either way.

59
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:07.090
They fucking shot at least one of his dogs had they not know it was the mayor's

60
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:09.490
house.
You think that would be like,
like on a list?

61
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.600
They didn't Google shit or maybe they did.

62
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.330
Maybe they thought fucking the mayor's a drug dealer.

63
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.260
Maybe they're really thought that,
but that kind of shit is dark man.

64
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:24.160
We just go shoot a golden retriever.
Come on.
You're not a pussy.

65
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.800
And I know you're going in there because you think that this is a real drug

66
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:29.470
running operation because the cops just got bad information.
Right?

67
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.740
But you're not a pussy.
You don't have to shoot a fucking Labrador stop.

68
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:36.280
You think that things going to bite you will when it does shoot it then so I'm

69
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:40.240
going to buy you the fuck out of here.
That's a weird power trip.
Shit thing.

70
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.480
You shoot all dog.
No.
Look,
if a guy's got a wolf and it's off the chain,

71
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:44.770
it's running at you.
Yeah,
shoot it.

72
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.680
But you breaking into some guy's house and then you shoot his fucking dog.

73
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:49.600
What if you're wrong?
Like you are a lot.

74
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.080
You cool with shooting someone's fucking dog in front of their kids.

75
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.800
That's what happened to the,
the mayor of this town,
the fucking mayor.

76
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.450
I bet the guy was a mail carrier.

77
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:05.080
Just thought it was cute to use the mayor's address,
get all the wheat delivered.

78
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.910
Maybe he didn't maybe voted for his opponent.
