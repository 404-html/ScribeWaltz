1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.840
Aliens where I thought it was like people who have gone on tonight show and they

2
00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:07.320
had their sleeves rolled up and you know,
you ever us,
here's the crazy thing,

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:12.030
folks like that.
I enjoyed watching that,
but it never seemed like me.
I couldn't,

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.780
I couldn't see myself doing it.
People got to stop doing that.

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.150
They got to stop doing that.
Like,
like why are you doing a,

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.540
you're tonight show set and your Cobell is not even,

7
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.600
they block is so fucking disrespectful.

8
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.940
They block shoot these things.
Like it's,

9
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.800
they'll do like 10 comedians at a time and he's not even there.

10
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:38.760
And they like throw to it as if,
you know,
like he's,

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
it's the rudest thing I've ever heard and the fact that comedians still go on

12
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:49.030
the show and would still do it is insane of it.
Wow.
I didn't know that's it.

13
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.930
That's insane to me.
So how many they do in Iran?

14
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.310
I heard like 10 I could get the number wrong,
but he's not there.
It's not,

15
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.030
you know,

16
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.840
you're just doing like this show in front of this audience in the studio and

17
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:02.540
pretends to throw the air and your nose.

18
00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:06.200
You like you're there and it's like this thing that's like,
there's nothing,

19
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.810
they're not,
well,
it's again man,
like,
but it's on,

20
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.800
it's on us as much as it's like,
you know,
of course they're going to do that.

21
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.780
They're going to do that to any,
you know,

22
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.340
any John Rowe of entertainment that would allow such a thing to happen,

23
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.210
they will do it to you.
Right.
You know,
they're not going to do Rihanna is doing,

24
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:29.040
uh,
these,
these things are so controlling.
Like it's the same set.

25
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:30.430
You come out in front of same curtain.

26
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.230
People put on the same outfit that they didn't wear yesterday and would never

27
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:35.460
wear again tomorrow.

28
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.230
And they come out and they pretend to be a comedian from 1993.

29
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.930
And so who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?

30
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.800
What are you fucking doing for a set to get passed around to a couple of agents

31
00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:55.070
that want to come see you?
That who,
yes,

32
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.440
I was talking to Bill Vaughn about this.
We were talking,
he knew it.

33
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.280
We were talking about like,
whether it's worth it being on one of those shows.

34
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.900
Oh No,
it's never,
it's never worth it.
It's never worth it.
Capturing yourself,

35
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:11.850
not as yourself.
It's a waste of your time.
Used to be worth something.

36
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.580
This is why it's confusing because there was no venues before.

37
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:18.120
So when Johnny Carson would have you on the tonight show,
yeah,
yeah,
no,

38
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.120
and that was a listener.
It's served its purpose.

39
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.490
It was very important at the time.

40
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.640
It was an outlet where there weren't a lot of outlets and now those types of

41
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.300
Kafka we doing it like,
especially unless it's like,
well,
you know what that said,

42
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.320
you know,
Kimmel built,
he built like a,

43
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:42.321
a club like to and has like the audience travel from the studio to the club and

44
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:45.810
the comedians would do it there and it's like,
oh,
that's like an effort.

45
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.470
You know what I mean?
Like an effort to create this space.
So,
yeah,

46
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:52.320
it was like a space,
a separate studio that like,
you know,

47
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:53.340
I believe there's still don't,

48
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.980
I don't know if I've seen like a chemical set stand up set recently,
but uh,
but,

49
00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:00.130
but there was like an effort,
you know,

50
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:04.120
I've always really appreciated that about like,
like come on like,

51
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.240
you know,
at least try like,

52
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.300
I dunno just tr there are too many options for comedians to go through the same

53
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:17.530
filter of capturing themselves in a way that's not authentic to them.

54
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:21.190
So you're saying that if I go on called bear,
I should do it with my shirt off.

55
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.790
If you want to have your shirt off as a purpose,
you know what I mean?
Like,

56
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.980
like you should,
you should do it.

57
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.210
You would deal of regular set in the belly room.
Yeah.
All right,

58
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.530
cool.
Well,
I mean,
because it's like,
you know,

59
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.080
if standup is art,
right?
If it's,
if it is an art form,

60
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.100
then it's supposed to be like the medium is supposed to come to the artists,

61
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.260
not the other way around.
You know,
because even even on those same shows,

62
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.820
you know,
if you see a live music performance,
like the stagings different,

63
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.190
it's specific to the audience,
you know,
and,

64
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:01.000
and the context of a show and a black production and you have this space,

65
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.300
they fill it in a way that makes sense to the artist and then it's like stand

66
00:04:07.501 --> 00:04:08.980
up.
And it was just like,

67
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:13.410
you could just go through a slide show of just the exact same think,
you know?

68
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.570
<v 1>Well,
I guess when a musical artists gets on Cole Bear,
one of those shows,</v>

69
00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:19.160
they're already kind of famous,
right?

70
00:04:19.161 --> 00:04:22.430
They already have an album out and when a standup gets on those shows,

71
00:04:22.431 --> 00:04:26.210
they're trying to get seen.
Like maybe you don't have a special yet.

72
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.020
Maybe you're just,
you showcased and they picked a few people.

73
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.550
You've done any of it yet.
I don't do any of those specific reason.

74
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.910
Yeah,
I liked it.

75
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.500
<v 0>I remember one time like,
uh,
I,</v>

76
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.600
I was going to do Letterman while Letterman was on Letterman and I remember

77
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.890
sending a,
uh,
uh,
set in or whatever and uh,
they respond.

78
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:52.350
I was like,
okay,
you know,
we could do it,

79
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.560
but could he do his jokes in the more traditional setup punchline format?

80
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.760
And I remember just like emailing back,
well,
I'll just do it when I'm famous.

81
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.720
<v 1>Okay,</v>

82
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.770
<v 0>well I'm just not going to listen to this bullshit.
No.
People,
they change.</v>

83
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.820
That's the other thing they change again.
Compare yourself to a musician.

84
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.570
Imagine you're a musician going on and they're like,
we like the song,

85
00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:22.770
but could the bridge come first and then you do the,
you will be like,

86
00:05:22.771 --> 00:05:27.330
go fuck yourself.
Right?
Comedians allow,
like,

87
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.600
you can't say pop tart if you say pop.
Exactly.

88
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:32.700
Comedians allow a lot of shit.

89
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.900
<v 1>The pastry.
Can you say a pastry like,
but that doesn't make any sense.</v>

90
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.140
We just tried to hit the road.

91
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.530
Derive toaster strudel is a spot that's trying to hit the roads,
right?
No Man.

92
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.530
Do you,
man,
why?
I wouldn't do it.

93
00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:49.070
Even back in the day,
it didn't make any sense to me.
There would go,

94
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.840
you should put together a five minute set for the tonight show and I'd be like,

95
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.080
I don't want to do it.
And they're like,
you should do it.
Like it's,

96
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:59.090
it's good exposure is like the fucking nineties right.

97
00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:01.190
When it actually probably meant something and I was like,
I don't,

98
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.950
I don't see it happening.
I'm not doing,
hey,

99
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.950
it's not stand up.
You're,
you're,
you're,
you're taking a little piece of it.

100
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.620
Stand up.

101
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.620
Like a short set is 15 minutes and if 15 minutes I might cover two concepts,

102
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.690
you know,
because I need time.

103
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.280
I go over things like I get thorough of,
I'm,
if I'm talking about a subject,

104
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.530
I get involved in that subject.
I want to,

105
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.100
I want to bring people on a journey and I also want to be able to set them up.

106
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:32.060
I want to be able to explain how I think about things so that by the time I get

107
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:35.570
to something controversial,
they already have a sense of how I approach things.

108
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.510
You can't do that.
And five minutes in five minutes.

109
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:43.511
You just got to just get into it and it's a very condensed,

110
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.180
homogenized version of who you really are.
Man.
It just do it.

111
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.360
<v 0>Just do a late night spot with a five minute set up.
Then leave</v>

112
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.500
<v 1>justice set up.
Yeah.
Just to set up is shake.
Yeah.</v>

113
00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.390
I remember I saw Louis Do one,
Louis C K did one,

114
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.220
one of those Letterman or tonight show or something like that and I was like

115
00:07:05.221 --> 00:07:10.130
God,
like he shouldn't even do this.
Cause it's,
it's not,
it's such a,

116
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.360
not a good representation of what he's capable.

117
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.780
<v 0>Well some people are like Jerry Seinfeld should do.
Yeah.</v>

118
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.070
That he should absolutely do that.
Yeah.
He could do it.
When he does.
He does.

119
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.900
I love Jerry's a tonight show sets.
Yeah.

120
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.890
And his like his makes sense.
Yeah.
It makes sense.
It makes sense.

121
00:07:29.891 --> 00:07:33.850
It's like perfect for and it's like,
it translates very,
very well.

122
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.500
But when I watch those shows

123
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.250
<v 1>today,
I'm like,
why are they still a thing when I see a late night show?</v>

124
00:07:39.251 --> 00:07:42.430
And no disrespect to anybody who hosts a late night show.
But to me it's like,

125
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:47.800
it's like they took a boat and try to turn it into a plane.
Oh,
they're like,

126
00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:52.030
hey man,
it's 2018 but let's pretend it's not.
But I,

127
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.450
we'll be right back with the commercial.
Hey,
we're going to have commercials.

128
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.790
You're going to do commercials in the thing.

129
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.840
But today everybody watches HBO and Netflix.
Like,
what am I doing here?

130
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.610
Sitting through a fucking commercial?

131
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.010
<v 0>I get,
it may be weird like,
cause I actually,</v>

132
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.720
I enjoy advertising to do.
Yeah.
I like a lot,

133
00:08:13.721 --> 00:08:18.721
I'll stare at like billboards or watch commercials of Watch,

134
00:08:19.451 --> 00:08:23.860
like,
oh,
because I do think it,
it speaks to what,

135
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:25.293
uh,

136
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:30.250
like America thinks we are as a culture.
Right?

137
00:08:30.251 --> 00:08:30.740
And you know what I mean?

138
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.960
It speaks to what they think is appealing and what they think is going to work.

139
00:08:34.961 --> 00:08:38.950
And so in a sense,
it's like in a way,
in the same sense,

140
00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:43.300
like you can gauge a lot from a person by the types of questions they ask you.

141
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:43.991
You know,

142
00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:47.260
you can gauge a lot from like even a climate by the type of commercials,

143
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:50.440
what they feel is because they're trying to appeal to everybody.

144
00:08:50.441 --> 00:08:51.490
So this is what they're saying.

145
00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:54.950
This is what we think everybody is thinking right now.
You know,

146
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.650
know or how everyone feels or what they want.
And,
uh,
but I,
I love,
uh,

147
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.170
like I'll watch it and even like the tonight show and those,
um,
these things,

148
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:08.670
I mean,
look,
you know,
anything in function at its best is fun.

149
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:11.640
It's just,
you know,
the,

150
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.790
where it hits a wall and just what we're saying about comedy and what we're

151
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:15.511
saying about a lot of things.

152
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:19.050
It's like when a thing tries to be something that it's not right.
You know,

153
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:22.920
when it feels like they're just these late night shows when they're just doing

154
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.090
fun things that they think are fun and interesting.
I love,
Ya know,

155
00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.040
Kimmel always every year.

156
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:33.330
It does like the parents to tell the kids that know Halloween that they ate all

157
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:36.180
the Halloween candy and the kids' reactions and stuff like that.

158
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.350
I eat that stuff up.
I love that you want to be like,
it's so sketchy,
but fun.
But,

159
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:44.580
but like when it,
you know,
when shows pretend to be,
you know,

160
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.610
1989 it's just like when comedians pretending to be of a different era,

161
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.660
pretend to it,
it just feels false.
And I think that's where you check out.

162
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.370
<v 1>Yeah.
It's just unnecessary at this point,
you know,</v>

163
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.320
because of the Internet,
you just have too many other venues.
Yeah.

164
00:10:03.321 --> 00:10:07.220
Well it's a lot of options.
Yeah.
A lot of options.
Yeah.
And the vent,

165
00:10:07.221 --> 00:10:09.650
like watching things on the Internet,
it's so much more satisfying.

166
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.980
It's like watching a comic on a podcast.
You're going to get his chance,

167
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.080
chance to see who the fuck they really are instead of some weird set in front of

168
00:10:18.111 --> 00:10:21.230
some audiences that got shipped in from Burbank and they got applause signs and

169
00:10:21.231 --> 00:10:25.760
everything.
It's very surreal when you go to a live taping and you watch that.

170
00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:26.810
It's really surreal.

171
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.660
<v 0>Oh,
it's very like,
and I'll sit it,</v>

172
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.380
I have like,
you know,

173
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.580
it's always what I have weird uh,

174
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:42.320
late night cause I like I'm bad at being like the,

175
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.430
you know,
celebrity type of thing.

176
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.450
Like I'm just in it and just like looking at it and when the crowd is giving an

177
00:10:50.451 --> 00:10:54.340
unnatural reaction to things is just like,
what do you,

178
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.520
<v 1>right.
You too introspective.
You're not going to just dive in fake.
I'm like,
hey,</v>

179
00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.570
hey bro,
what are we doing?

180
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.600
What is this like?
What are you,
is this rewarding for you?

181
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:14.770
Applaud side everybody.
What are we doing?
The uncomfortable moment?

182
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.600
This is where we'll be right back.
Thank you.
We'll be right back.

183
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.830
That we'll be right back.
Shit.
It's like,
where are you going?

184
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:28.030
You promised they put shut those commercials in later.

185
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.990
Just keep rolling.
Fuck.
Are we doing for you right back.
