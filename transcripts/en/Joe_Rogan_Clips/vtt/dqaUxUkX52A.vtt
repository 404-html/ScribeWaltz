WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
She takes care of the chickens though.
Um,
yeah,
sometimes you know,
um,

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.170
we have a guide that we hired to take care of the chicken sometimes like,

3
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:09.090
especially when we're not there.
Yeah.
He'll,

4
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:10.890
he'll handle certain things like you have to,

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.070
chickens are a little bit of effort.
You know,
you've got to clean up the cage.

6
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:17.700
You've got to collect the eggs every day.
We had some squirrels stealing eggs.

7
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.800
We had a real issue with that.

8
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.560
I've got a squirrel that I have to hose out of our chicken coop.
Yeah.

9
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.440
Well Marshall took care of that.
Marshall,

10
00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:27.840
the Fox squirrels.

11
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:31.830
Dude Marshall is the sweetest dog of all time and less your squirrel then.

12
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.840
He's the devil.
I mean,

13
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.560
I never seen a dog so term and to kill a squirrel.
It's crazy.

14
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.140
He goes out now and he looks for them.

15
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:43.500
He runs to the chicken coop and then he circles the chicken coop.

16
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.740
Look and see where these motherfuckers are getting there and see if anybody's

17
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:50.130
around there,
see if anybody slipping.
But,
uh,
I was on the road,

18
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:53.700
my wife sent me a picture of Marshall with a squirrel in his mouth.

19
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.050
And she's so happy because she doesn't like squirrels cause the squirrels are

20
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.410
fucking up all the,
they steal all the chicken food.
I like,

21
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.400
I like squirrels.
I think they're cute.
So like for me,
I'm like,
so what?

22
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.980
They steal the chicken food,
get,
make more chicken food.

23
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.270
But then they start stealing the eggs.
And I was like,
Oh,

24
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.150
you push up and he can't steal my food.
That's my food.

25
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.440
You can't steal the eggs.
Let me find this fun.
Our chickens are family members.

26
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.200
Yeah,
they are right.
Yeah.
I came home when it was like,

27
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:25.480
you remember it was like 120 and all the trees were dying.
Yeah.
And uh,

28
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.170
I walked in and Leanne had the chickens in the house.
She's like,

29
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:30.660
they can't be out there.
It's too fucking hot.
Yeah.
And they do,

30
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:34.800
they have to be out there.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
He's all happy.

31
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.930
This is,
this is ingrained in his DNA.
Oh,
100% is matress soft.

32
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.730
So he doesn't like,
he's like,

33
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.330
I want to bring it back to you fully intact so that you can't,

34
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.150
so that if you need this,
is that blood on his chest?
Uh,
yeah.
That's blood.

35
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.180
Yeah.
Well he brings things to you always.
Cause he's a retriever.

36
00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:58.890
So like he has a little box of stuffed toys that he has in the house and he's

37
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:03.090
the only dog that I've ever had that doesn't mangle every toy you give them.

38
00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:06.510
Cause I've had pit bulls and mastiffs and you give them a toy and they just,

39
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.480
they just start tearing her apart.
He just carries him around.
He carries around.

40
00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:13.170
He brings to you.
So like when I see him in the morning,
I'm like,

41
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:15.950
good morning sir.
Good morning.
And he's wagging,

42
00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:19.500
his tail is happy and the first thing he does is run over to his pilot toys,

43
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.410
grabs one and comes over with it.
Brings you a president.
Yeah,
he,

44
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.560
well he has it in his mouth.
He always,
he's a retriever.

45
00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:26.910
Like if you see retrievers running,

46
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.060
a lot of times they're carrying their leash in their mouth as they're running.

47
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.450
They love to hold on to things in their mouth.
It's weird.

48
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.310
Does he dive in underwater?
Oh,
he fucking swims like a motherfucker.
Dude.

49
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.690
That dog is always in the water.
He just,

50
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.970
he will die from the deep end of the book.

51
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:45.120
Like if the kids are playing in the pool,
he and I'll let him out the door.

52
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.220
He runs to the pool,

53
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.030
stands on the edge and then leaps into the water splashes.

54
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.120
How loves it because he dive underwater though a little bit.

55
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.290
That's what we used to have a,

56
00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:58.680
I used to have a black lab and you could throw one of those rings under water

57
00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:01.690
and she to the bottom grab it and pull it up.
Oh,
he doesn't do that.
Oh,

58
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:04.090
I guarantee you he will.
I guarantee you he will.

59
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.900
I bet he would if I taught them how to do it,
but he swims like it's instinctual.

60
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:12.430
Those fucking dogs.
My my bull mastiff,
I cannot get her in the pool.
Really?

61
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.180
She looks at me like,
like,
like you're trying to pitch anal sex to your wife.

62
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:20.320
She's like,
come on.
We both know how this is going to go.

63
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:24.310
No one's going to be happy.
Yeah.
Johnny Cash.
And people always ask me,
um,

64
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.630
to have pictures of my other dogs.
They're actually both passed away now.

65
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.400
I had to put them both down.

66
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.460
Both your bull mastiffs where there and stiff and the English,

67
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.850
the English bulldog,
she mixed.
They were,
uh,

68
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.960
they were both 13 in years old and um,

69
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.490
Johnny couldn't walk anymore.
It was,
it was a really rough,

70
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.920
the last few days of his life.
Um,
I would,
uh,

71
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.120
try to bring him in for dinner and when I would try to bring him in,

72
00:03:56.121 --> 00:04:00.800
he literally couldn't make it.
It was a small yard where he was at,

73
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.280
but we're talking about like,
you know,
15 yards.

74
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.460
He couldn't make it 15 yards to the house.

75
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.770
He would like take a couple steps in.

76
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:13.940
His body would shake and he'd take a couple of steps and he was just sleeping

77
00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:18.620
all day and he was also having a really hard time shifting and he would

78
00:04:18.621 --> 00:04:20.000
occasionally shit in the house.

79
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.660
Like he couldn't hold his bowels and he couldn't go outside when he wanted to

80
00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:25.970
look at,
you'd see them trying,
but his,

81
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.380
his body was so old from mastiff,
13 years old,

82
00:04:30.381 --> 00:04:31.490
his crazy old,

83
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.700
like a lot of them die at like eight or nine and he was 13 and he was sweet,

84
00:04:37.431 --> 00:04:42.140
sweet dog up until the end.
But he just,
he was,
you know,

85
00:04:42.141 --> 00:04:45.860
he was suffering.
It was,
it was hard.

86
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.720
It's hard when you know them when they're a puppy and then 10 years later,

87
00:04:50.721 --> 00:04:55.490
like you're kind of the same and they're not mad,
they're gone.
You know,

88
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.240
it's like,

89
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.300
I think about that with Marshall Cause he's only a year and a half and he's so

90
00:04:59.301 --> 00:05:01.070
full of life and he's so fun.

91
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.450
He's so silly and playful and happy and Mike,
man,

92
00:05:05.451 --> 00:05:08.540
there's going to be a day where Marshall's,
this old,
old,

93
00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:13.370
old dog and I'm going to have to put him down to,
you know,
it was depressing.

94
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.090
And the other one,
Brutus does she boot,
you know,
English bulldog mix.

95
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.420
He was better than Johnny for a long time.
Still,

96
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.500
I've known for the last two years that they didn't have much time left.
You know,

97
00:05:24.501 --> 00:05:26.480
they were,
they were both struggling hard,

98
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.790
but Brutus took a real hard turn over the last few months where,

99
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.730
um,
he wouldn't even come in.
Like I tried to get him to come in my car,

100
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.573
buddy,
you want to eat?

101
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.970
I try to put a little food in front of his face and he would try to stand up and

102
00:05:40.971 --> 00:05:45.880
his legs would be shaking.
And
it's just so hard,

103
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:49.320
man.
It's so hard watching them fade away,
you know?
And,

104
00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:53.060
and then also watching them suffer,
you know,
a lot of the last,

105
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.600
the last days where you have to decide where,
you know,

106
00:05:56.601 --> 00:06:00.580
me and my had to have conversations like,
look,
we have to do something like this.

107
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.930
Like one day we're going to come home,
it's going to be a dead dog.

108
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.440
And it's not like they're having a good time.
Like this is a,

109
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.150
this is a horrible suffering.
Slow demise.

110
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.960
So did you have someone come to the house?
When did you take them?
Yeah,

111
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.480
it was rough,
dude.
That's rough.
Yeah.

112
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.530
Priscilla seven and I,
I mean I got her when I first started doing this.

113
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.540
Maybe she one 40.
That's a big dog.
He's had five knee surgeries.

114
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.500
Oh my God,
Dude.
Yeah.
That's fucking expensive too.
Oh yeah,
no,

115
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.090
I do have an idea.
Yeah.
I had a,
um,

116
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.840
a female pit bull that had two ACL reconstructions.
She had her,

117
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:45.940
both of her back legs done.
Yeah.
She blew one out.
I got it fixed.

118
00:06:45.941 --> 00:06:49.880
She blew the other one out.
I had to get that fixed to a dog.

119
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.910
They shave the bone down.
They don't like reconstruct it where they add like a,

120
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.400
another ligament.
They shave the bone down so it doesn't,

121
00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:03.401
so it like sits on the it differently so it locks in place so it doesn't pop off

122
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:08.120
and,
and,
and go like at a,
at a socket or whatever the fuck it is.

123
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.800
But yeah,
that's fucking,
it's like 10 grand a pop.
Right.
Oh,

124
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.420
it was a w.
I mean,
I'm not going to tell everyone how much,

125
00:07:16.421 --> 00:07:18.370
cause I would stop liking me in a minute.
They'd be like,

126
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.550
what kind of fucking Hollywood it or you'd argue you just kill the dog like
that.

127
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.270
But she got one ACL and then we fixed it.
Then the,

128
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.900
then while this one's healing,
it's turning good.
The other ACL goes out.

129
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.030
So we fixed that one.
We're like,
all right,
we're done.

130
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.500
And then as this one ceiling,
this one goes out again and they're like an aspen.

131
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.460
They're like,
do you want to put it down?
And I'm like,
no man,
I,
I'm fucking,

132
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.910
it was like five grand a pop I think.
And then,
and then it's,

133
00:07:42.911 --> 00:07:44.530
it even adds up more because then they're like,

134
00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:47.740
we should keep her here while this,
while she's healing to do it.

135
00:07:47.741 --> 00:07:51.640
And then Peter diamonds.
Yeah.
And then they realize they're doing this one,

136
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.690
that something's wrong with her kneecap.
And then they realize she's got,

137
00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:59.320
you know,
it's overbreeding in her and her breed that her kneecaps are about it.

138
00:07:59.321 --> 00:08:00.370
