1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.090
Cause like what right now could be the number one fight for Khabib I believe is

2
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:08.430
Tony Ferguson.
I think that's a big fight.
Giant fight.

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.630
I'm real excited about that.
I liked that.
I heard,
I heard rumors.
Um,

4
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:16.590
and I was spoken to Dustin of that whole Tony and Khabib,

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.190
Dustin and Connor is fight each other.
I heard that too.

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.050
But here's the cynical part of me.

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.710
I know that Nate Diaz was supposed to be fighting Dustin,

8
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:28.230
but Dustin had a pull out with a hip injury.

9
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:31.530
So I'm like okay well how bad is his hip injury and when is that going to heal

10
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:32.580
up?
You know,

11
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:35.820
and is it going to heal up or is it going to like be a reoccurring thing?

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.650
And them saying that Dustin is going to step in and he's going to fight Conor,

13
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.450
that is a good fight.

14
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.400
But does that make Nate Diaz go what and does that make neat Nate Diaz come back

15
00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:50.660
to the,
the,
to the bargaining table and then they have like,

16
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.580
cause that's the big money fight.
Big money.
If I was a promoter,

17
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm not a promoter.
If I was a promoter,
I'd be like,
Nate,
what are we going to do?

18
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.600
You got to get weed.
We've got a good girls.
Do you want a new bike?

19
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.620
But the fuck like I did.
What are we gonna do this?

20
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.980
We didn't have a girl delivered.
We got a new life.

21
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.491
Like for real,

22
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:15.000
like if you wanted to make money and that's what I presumed they all want to do.

23
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.310
And the reason why they want to have Brock Lesnar fight DC,

24
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:19.320
it's because they want to make a shit ton of money.
Right?
Yeah.

25
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.790
Nay Mother fucking Diaz.
You want to make money?

26
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.930
You call Nate mother fucking ds.
Go Party with them.

27
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.150
Become as good friend.
Lighten them up.
Give him what he wants.

28
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.820
Give him a lot of money.
That's a good fight.
I mean we saw it twice.
You know?

29
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.150
It's not just a good fight.

30
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.180
It's a gigantic like fan friendly spectical of an experience.

31
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.170
Nate Diaz doesn't take any bullshit.
You can't trash talk him.

32
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.310
It doesn't work.
Yeah,
exactly.
I'm working works the opposite way.

33
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.150
It works the opposite way.
Like when Connor Shit talk Nate.
Nate was like,

34
00:01:57.151 --> 00:02:01.350
fuck you.
And it was like,
what?
Like it didn't work.
I ain't gonna lie,
man.
I,

35
00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:04.500
one of my favorite Nate fights was him and him and cowboy.
Oh,

36
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.350
that was a great fight,
right?
He got in cowboys head.
He did.

37
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.090
There was a good lesson for cowboy though.

38
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.210
An important fight for him in terms of the path of his career.

39
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.210
He grew something from that.
Yeah,
but that,
that third round,
Nate standing,

40
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:22.320
if flipping into bird,
how good the cowboy look against Mike Perry.
Holy Shit.

41
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.430
It's a new cowboy.
He looked different,
man.
Look different.

42
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:30.900
Just everything looks smooth and just like a God damn execution.

43
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:34.020
I heard rumors of that too.
I had a room like a cowboy and Connor,

44
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.830
that's a fight that I would make.
I would make that fight.
That's,
that's,

45
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.400
that's how fucking exciting fight.
And that's also a big sell.

46
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.000
You could sell the shit out of that fight.
That's a big fight.
Ooh.

47
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.270
But Connor,
or excuse me,
cowboys not been fighting at 55.
You know,

48
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.850
he's been doing majority of his fights.
Um,

49
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.190
that's another hundred 65 pounds.
Yeah.

50
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.150
How many fights did he fought til he's fought Mazda?
All those are all seventies.

51
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.340
You know,
they all 70 fights.
Yeah.
Perry.
Yeah.

52
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.000
There are of those three,
it was in another one.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
the on Edwards.

53
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.200
Yeah.
So that's um,
those are all seventies.
Yeah.
Yeah.

54
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:15.910
I don't think he's fought 55 in quite a while.

55
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.150
I think he could still make it though.
It's not a big 70.
You know,

56
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.000
he's talking about going back to 55 getting say something to you and you know,

57
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.090
and if they do have a 65 pound weight class and he can,

58
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.400
if he sits for it,
she,
it,
I,
I'm just,
I'm,

59
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.600
there's a lot of great fights and 65 cowboy and Kevin,
the dude,

60
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:41.700
anybody in Kevin Lee,
Kevin leads a beast,
man.
He's something special.
Yeah.

61
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.450
I think Kevin Lee is one of those dudes.

62
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:46.240
You don't see him fight for six months and then he gets in there and you got a

63
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:49.360
whole different animal in front of you.
You've got to go out with new skills,

64
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.170
new momentum,
new experience.
He's just,
he gets,
he's just in that,

65
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.460
I think it's 25 right now.
He's in that peak prime learning,

66
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:01.600
growing confidence part of his career.
You know,
where he's just,

67
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.370
he's just a monster right now.
