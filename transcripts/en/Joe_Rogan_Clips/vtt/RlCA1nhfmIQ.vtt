1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.650
And she went to bring her ring in.
She found out was fake downtown to Trump.

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.860
Trump gave someone fake diamond cufflinks.
Who was that?

3
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:10.260
Somebody does all someone in business.

4
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:12.840
He gave him a pair of diamond cufflinks and he went and looked and they were

5
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:15.510
fucking CCS.
If that's the case,
if he did that to you,

6
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:19.100
that guy's ready to fuck you.
He's,
he's about to make something.
Go down.

7
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.823
Mueller,

8
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.330
Mueller got steam and right now fucking fake diamonds.

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.800
You don't respect me with to Trump.
Oh,

10
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.780
I don't respect Gil job is fake diamond cufflinks for years.
Oh my God.

11
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:36.390
He's hilarious.
He's hilarious.

12
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.250
Do they shrink his hands for those pictures on purpose?
No,

13
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.660
cause his hands aren't little.
Everybody was caused his hands little.

14
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.360
There's something he does with his hands that make them look little.

15
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.230
It's like he does a lot of stuff like this.
It's like he brings,

16
00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:51.600
could just be little in proportion to his head,

17
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:55.870
which is gigantic and getting bigger.
Apparently poor.
He's,

18
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.830
he's going down now.
I mean when they raided his,
uh,
his attorney's offices,

19
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.330
here's the thing that to,
in order to get all that stuff pass through,

20
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:05.380
Republicans have to agree to that.
Yeah.

21
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.080
Like there's like in order to like actual Republicans and people that should be,

22
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:13.560
his supporters had to be a part of that.
I read that everyone that's signed,

23
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:17.100
it was an appointee of his administration.
He's in trouble.

24
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.970
They're reading your lawyers office.
You are so fucked.

25
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.600
And if it all goes down that he winds up getting in trouble.
Not even for Russia,

26
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.670
but for paying off a chick that he had sex with.

27
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.530
Imagine it's a porn chick that takes this whole thing down.
Listen man,
I need,
Oh,

28
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:33.090
Justin Martin,
Dale and apology.

29
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.710
He was saying that she's the Monica Lewinsky for this administration.
Oh,
come on.

30
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.620
No Way.
He's going to brush this off.
It's going to be nothing.

31
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.920
Nobody cares because everybody knows.
They know he did it.
So it's not,

32
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:46.080
it's not even a question of whether he did it right,

33
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.900
but it's a matter of whether or not it's legal.

34
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.920
The camp you had to campaign finance violation.
If the lawyer,
yeah,

35
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.800
that's a campaign finance pen.

36
00:01:54.801 --> 00:01:58.620
Then meeting to knowing about the payout is like obstruct admitting to

37
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:00.240
obstruction.
It's like a whole lot there.

38
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.070
When he talked about it in that interview,

39
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.060
when someone caught him getting onto his plane and he acknowledged the the

40
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:09.990
lawsuits,
whoops,
just he fucks up,
man.

41
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.130
He doesn't know how to shut the fuck up and not only that,

42
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:17.250
his whole life has been about not shutting the fuck up about saying whatever you

43
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:17.610
want.

44
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.070
Like that's his instincts and all sudden you put them in this position like you

45
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.270
saw an ability.
What's that?
I want you to be a totally different thing.

46
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:25.980
Now I want you to be presidential.
Yeah.

47
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.860
You've always trying to pick fights with Joe Biden on Twitter.

48
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.350
You're not going to change a 70 year old billionaire.

49
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.660
You're not going to change that guy.

50
00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:37.450
He's been told yes a thousand times a day for last 40 years.

51
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.670
Do you think's going to happen with him?

52
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.250
Do you think they're going to kick him out?

53
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.790
Like what do you think's going to happen?
I think it's not going to,
I think it's,

54
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.910
I just don't see how he can make it through for you.
I don't know.

55
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.690
It's the only thing.
One year.
Yeah.
It's been here in a very,
very bad,

56
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.920
it's very bad.
