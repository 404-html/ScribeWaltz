1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.620
Add of these leaders and actually look at what they believe and what they

2
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:09.240
believe.
Some of them is extremely disturbing,
especially when it comes to Jews.

3
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.800
So I write this column and I'm like pilloried for it by the left,

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.650
one of the leaders of the women's march,
this woman Bob Bland,

5
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:21.420
wrote this letter to the New York Times where she calls me,
um,
who was amazing.

6
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.970
I want to find what it was.
Oh,

7
00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:26.610
she calls me an apologist for the status quo,

8
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:31.140
racist ideology and the white nationalist patriarchy because you responded to

9
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:35.880
someone because I said
is a man who called Judaism,

10
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.570
who calls juice termites,
who calls Judaism a gutter religion,

11
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.630
who says that we should burn in ovens.
And who by the way,

12
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.610
is a misogynist homophobe also the leaders of the women's March or associating

13
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:51.810
with this guy and had the nation of Islam security protecting them.
I mean,

14
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:56.790
this is like the most sort of retrograde hate group and yet for calling them
out,

15
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.700
I was called all of these things.
Now that's floors.

16
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.730
It's a deep question.

17
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:07.731
I think that part of it is the fact that in intersectional leftwing politics,

18
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.520
Jews have been whitewashed.

19
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.670
Jews are viewed as sort of the white privileged power and part of the white

20
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:21.990
patriarchy and less they genuflect and say,
actually,

21
00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:24.110
no,
we,
you know,
we uh,

22
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.060
pour our privilege and all of the other things that you're supposed to say.

23
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.700
And there's a blindness to the fact.
Right?

24
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.390
And there's a blindness to the fact that first of all,
not all Jews are white.

25
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.690
Half of the Jews in the state of Israel,
for example,

26
00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:41.160
are Arab and from Arab countries that they were kicked out of a 1948.
I mean,

27
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:45.960
the idea that Jews are white is this canard.
Although I'm an Ashkenazi Jew,
I'm,

28
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.070
my family is from eastern Europe.
I have white skin,
but I don't think of,

29
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.430
and I have white privilege,
but I don't think of myself as white person.

30
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:56.910
I think of myself as a Jew first and foremost.
So it's a complicated identity.

31
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.780
But I think that it's sort of a,
it's whitewashed by these people.

32
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:05.400
And I think that antisemitism just isn't taken seriously and doesn't rate

33
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.630
because people perceive Jews as having privilege and power in this country,

34
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:11.070
which largely they do.

35
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.690
But the fact is is that the actual statistics show that more hate crimes were

36
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:19.710
committed against Jews in the past year.
Then any other minority group,

37
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.360
the FBI's like sounding the alarm every other day in crown heights and in other

38
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:27.660
parts of Brooklyn,
random Jews who looked Jewish,
right,

39
00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:31.560
who are Hasidic Jews are just beaten up for being Jewish.

40
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.570
And yet everyone's ignoring that because they're the imperfect victim.
Well,

41
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:40.160
they're also very isolated.
They're very,
they,
they're,

42
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.980
they have their own tribe.
They stick with them,
they look different,

43
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.910
they dress different.
Sure.
But imagine if any other minority groups,
someone,

44
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.810
I mean,
we're outraged when we see at least I am.
And you are,

45
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:56.190
when we see a police officer assaulting someone,

46
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.130
you know what I'm saying,
is a young black person,
they don't make a big deal

47
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.810
<v 1>to go into the public about it.</v>

48
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.490
They keep it almost insulated inside their environment and their,

49
00:03:05.491 --> 00:03:09.020
their community.
There's also,
what I was going to say is they,

50
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.160
these people that are,
that you,

51
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.710
you do hear saying antisemitic things.

52
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.980
They're equating American Jews living in America with the policies of Israel and

53
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:24.130
what Israel is doing with Palestine and that somehow if you're an American Jew,

54
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.720
even if you're not even political,

55
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.070
you're somehow or another complicit with atrocities that are going on between

56
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.210
the Jewish people and the Palestinians.
Right?
Conflict.
Any kind of conflict,

57
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.310
and this makes it,

58
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.100
it reinforces their idea about you being apart of this.

59
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.510
<v 0>Right,
but they group,
yes,</v>

60
00:03:42.511 --> 00:03:46.780
but they also straw man it and say criticism of Israel is an antisemitic.
Yes.

61
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.620
No one's saying the criticism isn't of Israel's antisemetic.

62
00:03:49.621 --> 00:03:54.240
I criticize Israel all the time,
but there's an obsession on the state of Israel.

63
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.700
Like if you were an alien that landed from outer space,

64
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.960
you would think that the greatest oppressor in the world is this tiny state

65
00:04:00.961 --> 00:04:02.220
that's the size of New Jersey.

66
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.640
These people say nothing about the Gen ed generally about the genocide of Weger

67
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.330
Muslims in China.
They say nothing about any number of even aware that,

68
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.640
oh,
there's a genocide going on,

69
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.460
carried out by the government of China against Weger Muslims.

70
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.010
They're literally being put into concentration camps.

71
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.440
This is literally a first I've heard of this.

72
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.900
So Weger is spelled you I.
G.
H.
U.
R,

73
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.140
whereas a,

74
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.400
what is a good thing to read about the New York Times we've reported on it.

75
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.761
It's a,

76
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:37.761
it's an enormous story and it's like the fact that that's getting no,

77
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.530
that you don't know about it.
Yeah.

78
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.360
And that people obsessively talk about the state of Israel is,

79
00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:48.780
if it's the,
and by the way,
the state of Israel does lots of things wrong,

80
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.280
but the idea that it's among the worst human rights tragedies of our time.

81
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.620
Are you kidding me?
It's insanity.
Okay.

82
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.110
<v 1>I don't know the reality of what is going on in Gaza.</v>

83
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.440
I don't know what is happening with Israel and Palestine.

84
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.230
I don't know what we're going to be the person that talks about this,

85
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.240
but what I do,
what I do know from people that have gone there,

86
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.810
like Abby Martin who came back with some pretty horrific stories,

87
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.030
I think there's a lot of terrible shit going on.

88
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.140
There's a lot of awful violence and there's a lot of despair on the side of the

89
00:05:22.141 --> 00:05:26.430
Palestinians and I don't,
I don't know who's to blame for that,

90
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.190
but many people blame the Israelis.

91
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.750
They blame the Israelis for treating the Palestinians as if they're in this one

92
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:35.780
area of the world is essentially a large prison.

93
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.880
<v 0>Well,
lots to say about this,</v>

94
00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:42.510
but I think one of the main problems that we have in the way that Israel is

95
00:05:42.511 --> 00:05:47.511
covered is that if you have a camera lens and you're only looking at a tiny

96
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.810
piece of land,
right?
You're only looking at Israel proper,
the West Bank and Gaza,

97
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.970
right?
Israel to some extent is the Goliath in that situation.

98
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.640
But if you zoom out your camera just a little,

99
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.030
you see that Israel is literally surrounded on all sides by genocidal regimes,

100
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.500
like in the form of Hamas in Gaza,

101
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.710
whose charter blames the Jews for fomenting the French revolutions,

102
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.800
the Russian revolutions,

103
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.880
both world wars and says that it wants to kill all the Jews.
That's what,

104
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.750
that's the government of Gaza right now.
I spoke to a mother,
um,

105
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.130
who fled Gaza recently.
Okay.
And her family's house was just destroyed.

106
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.690
Who is it destroyed by?
Hamas,
not Israel.
You never hear those stories.

107
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.530
So I'm just saying it is a very complicated

108
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.990
politics,

109
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.230
but when you see people obsessive really focusing on this one state and the

110
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:49.871
crimes of this one state to the exclusion of actual dictatorships in the world

111
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.100
who are killing their own people,
you have to be suspicious of that.

112
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.630
<v 1>You do have to be suspicious and you do have to be aware of their position in</v>

113
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:04.550
the world surrounded by Arab states.
You,
you do have to realize that they are,

114
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.720
you know,
they're,
they're alone out there.
You also,

115
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.840
I do wonder what is the motivation for so many people focusing on Jews?

116
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.170
What is it like?
What do you think it is as a Jewish person?

117
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.760
What do you think the motivation for this kind of racism and discrimination

118
00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:25.310
against Jews and why is it tolerated?
Why?

119
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.020
Why can someone like Louis Farrakhan tweet that Jews are termites and his

120
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:30.980
Twitter account stays up?

121
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.340
<v 0>Well,
it's the oldest hatred in the world,
right?
A lot of it sound what it is.
No,</v>

122
00:07:35.341 --> 00:07:39.180
no,
no.
You're asking me why is it still with us?
It's like the mystery of history.

123
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.130
Like that is,
that is deep.

124
00:07:41.131 --> 00:07:44.250
I mean that is something that goes back to the new testament.

125
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.150
The Jews were blamed in the book of John and mark.
I mean,

126
00:07:48.151 --> 00:07:52.020
we could go to Matthew for the death of Jesus.

127
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.280
Their role in that story,
at least according to some of the books,

128
00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.070
is that they convinced the most powerful empire at the time,

129
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.900
the Roman Empire in the form of the Governor of Judea,

130
00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:06.270
Pontus pilot to kill the son of God.

131
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:12.170
That becomes sort of a template for the antisemetic conspiracy theory.

132
00:08:12.631 --> 00:08:15.630
There's,
there's a confusion about what antisemitism is,
right?

133
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.040
It's not just a hate.

134
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.820
It's not just like this hate of a group racist perceived themselves as punching

135
00:08:20.821 --> 00:08:25.080
down against a group that's lesser antisemites perceive themselves as punching

136
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:30.110
up against the secret cabal of Wiley operators who secretly control the levers

137
00:08:31.111 --> 00:08:34.290
of power.
That is the canard of antisemitism.

138
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.330
And that begins with this group that's able somehow to get the Roman Empire to

139
00:08:39.331 --> 00:08:44.160
kill Jesus.
Now,
the Catholic Church disavows this in 1965,
uh,
which was,

140
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.950
you know,
an enormous historical event.

141
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:51.570
But that template is still there and you see it play out right in who?

142
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.840
Who led us into the war in Iraq.
Ah,
it was the Jews of the bush.

143
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.100
You can see it play itself out all over the place.

144
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.270
And right now in the demonology of current contemporary antisemitism,

145
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.360
Israel has sort of been made into the Jew among the nations.

146
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.740
You're not allowed to say anymore.
It's like the old school antisemitism,
right?

147
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:13.380
Like I grew up in a place where there were some country clubs where Jews

148
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:17.460
couldn't go into them.
That frankly,
that's not dangerous.

149
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.270
What's dangerous is the kind of antisemitism that says,
you know,

150
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:24.480
this one state in the world of all of the almost 200 states,

151
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.700
that's the one that doesn't have the right to exist.

152
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.650
That's the one that should be dismantled.

153
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.310
That's actually dangerous to Jewish lives right now.
It is.
Um,

154
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:37.140
it's an unusual group in that it is both a religion and a tribe.
Yes.

155
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.340
It makes us very hard to understand in the contemporary landscape because we are

156
00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:43.620
not just a religion.
There's nothing else like it.

157
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:48.450
Cause most Jews that I know do not practice Judaism.
Right.
And yet they,

158
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.560
yes,
because we were a people hood before we were a religion.

159
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.290
Religion is a very contemporary,

160
00:09:55.291 --> 00:10:00.090
modern thing that Jews are sort of slotted into and it makes us easier to

161
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:04.860
understand.
But then are are sort of national identity or peoplehood.

162
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.570
Our tribalism is left out and that's an essential part of who the Jews are.

163
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.930
My friend Ari Shaffir,
who's a fantastic stand up comedian.

164
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:15.030
He's a rabid atheists,

165
00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:20.031
but he's also very Jewish and he has a new hour that he's working on right now

166
00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:24.660
that he's gonna film called Jew.
Really?
I want to see it.
Yeah,

167
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.710
but he's,
you know,
he's a perfect example,
but that's all tribe.

168
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.360
It's not just a religion,

169
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.700
but it's also because the Jewish religion itself,
the emphasis,

170
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.860
the emphasis is not on what you believe the emphasis is on deeds.

171
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.540
It almost doesn't matter what you believe.

172
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.230
It matters that you follow Hallah,
Huh?

173
00:10:46.231 --> 00:10:49.860
Which is Jewish law and matters your deeds.
It matters all these things.

174
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.040
So it's possible to be a good Jew and not really think about God that much,

175
00:10:55.261 --> 00:10:56.760
which is very strange.
I understand.

176
00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:01.850
To Christian ears or you go full Ben Shapiro or he's both a good Jew and very

177
00:11:02.941 --> 00:11:06.810
much like follows the whole deal.
We were thought as little deal the whole deal.

178
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.880
Um,
why do you said,
I think,
sorry,
can I say one more please,
please.

179
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:16.190
I just find it like kind of astonishing the blindness to this because imagine a

180
00:11:17.251 --> 00:11:21.030
leader of the women's March said something like,
you know,

181
00:11:21.031 --> 00:11:25.530
I think Louis Ck is the greatest comedian of all time,
even though I disavow x,
y,

182
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:26.520
and z thing that he did.

183
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.390
How fast till that person was kicked out of the leadership of the women's March,

184
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.230
it would be like minutes,
hours.
Yes.

185
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:39.750
I think there's certain things that get people outraged and other much worse

186
00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:43.290
things that do not.
And I'm fascinated by why that is.

187
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:48.690
Do you think that if it was a white person that had this opinion about the Jews

188
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.270
that it would be more scrutinized?

189
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.300
I think that it is much easier to antisemitism when it comes in the form of

190
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:56.640
Richard Spencer.
Yes.

191
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:01.270
Because then there's liberal consensus right.

192
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.590
About him.
He's bad.
You have a green light to criticize.
Yeah.
It's very,

193
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.800
it is much harder when,
when an ant.
Exactly.

194
00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:13.300
It's much harder when someone like Ilhan Omar,
the new freshman senator,

195
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.740
uh,
sorry,
not senator,

196
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:17.950
the new freshman congresswoman from Minnesota who's like this incredible

197
00:12:17.951 --> 00:12:21.250
American dream story comes here at 12 years old,
refugee from Somalia,

198
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:26.050
wears a hijab,
is a mother,
is the first woman of color representing Minnesota.

199
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:30.760
Like obviously I want to cheer her.
That's my reaction to her.

200
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:36.160
And yet she has this tweet that she refused to apologize is four where she says,

201
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.990
Israel has hypnotize the world.

202
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.430
May Allah awaken the world to the evil doings of Israel.
I'm sorry,

203
00:12:42.431 --> 00:12:46.120
that's a classically antisemetic trope.
Even if she said it unwittingly,

204
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.830
and by this point she should have known she should educate herself.
So it's very,

205
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:53.720
it's much harder to criticize that,
but it's,

206
00:12:53.721 --> 00:12:57.580
it's an untenable position to say that you can't criticize someone for their

207
00:12:57.581 --> 00:13:01.390
ideas because of their identity.
Like a road to nowhere.

208
00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.010
That is a very vague thing to say.
You should be incredibly specific.

209
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.930
Have you want to say it's evil.

210
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:12.310
You should say what's evil and then open that up to some sort of a discussion or

211
00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:14.920
debate,
but as,
but as scribing,

212
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:19.950
supernatural evil powers to a state is very much recalling classic antisemetic

213
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.350
canards right.
So that,
I really wrote a piece about this today.

214
00:13:26.351 --> 00:13:30.820
Trying to like explain that to people because she went on CNN saying,

215
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.490
I don't know how Jewish Americans could be offended by this,

216
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.570
which I think is incredible.
What do you think if,
I mean,

217
00:13:37.571 --> 00:13:41.890
if you want to be objective as step outside of your Jewish identity,

218
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.920
what do you think is wrong with how Israel is dealing with the Palestinian

219
00:13:47.501 --> 00:13:52.420
situation?
Because this is the big criticism of Israel.

220
00:13:52.421 --> 00:13:56.770
The only criticism really that's the big one.
The big one is Gaza and Palestine.

221
00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.070
So what do you think they're doing wrong?
Palestine meaning the West Bank?
Yes.

222
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:05.470
Well,
I would say what the untenable position that they're in is that they are

223
00:14:05.471 --> 00:14:09.760
occupying another people.
That is what is going on in the West Bank.

224
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:12.580
And I've been there many times,
met with many Palestinians.

225
00:14:12.581 --> 00:14:17.290
I've really educated myself on this.
The problem is is that,

226
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.580
and by the way,
it's not all a Palestine.
There's the Sre,
all the Westbank,

227
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.000
there's areas a,
B,
and c.
It's a really Glick.
We'd have to pull up a map.

228
00:14:25.001 --> 00:14:26.200
It's a pretty complicated thing.

229
00:14:26.201 --> 00:14:30.990
There are places where it's much more autonomous and the PA's in charge and it,

230
00:14:30.991 --> 00:14:33.040
it really varies depending on the area,

231
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:37.060
so the big criticism right is that they're occupying and other people and that

232
00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:42.061
is corrosive to the state of Israel sort of morally like to to occupying other

233
00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:44.590
people.
On the other hand,

234
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.550
what happens if they pull out of the West Bank tomorrow?
Right?

235
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:53.540
I'm for a two state solution ultimately ending the occupation,
but if I'm real,

236
00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:56.270
I have to be honest about what that would look like.

237
00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:00.350
What would it look like in Gaza is that now you have a terrorist statelet right

238
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:02.720
at the border which is ruled by Hamas.

239
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:07.250
It is quite likely that that very same thing could happen in the West Bank.

240
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.040
Now let's say actually we actually should pull up the map.
Let's,

241
00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:14.900
let's say Israel does that then like the whole of Israel proper is something

242
00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:18.950
like we have to looks two miles wide.

243
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.410
We actually,
yeah,
we should look at the,

244
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:27.190
the distance between like tool Carrum where like the end of the West Bank and

245
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:30.020
Natanya or Tel Aviv and you see how small that is.

246
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.810
I mean it's hard to even conceive of it if you were in charge of protecting the

247
00:15:35.811 --> 00:15:40.070
security of the people who live in places,
which by the way,

248
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.860
10 years ago when in the year after high school when I was living there,

249
00:15:42.861 --> 00:15:46.790
there were suicide bombings blowing up in cafes around the corner from where I

250
00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:51.200
lived.
Or You gonna subject those people to that risk.

251
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.740
I mean that's the,
that's the actual question facing the government of Israel,

252
00:15:55.741 --> 00:15:59.340
which by the way,
I'm extremely critical of,
and if I lived in Israel,

253
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:02.130
I'd be voting,
you know,
center left in Israel for sure.

254
00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.660
But that is what they're facing.

255
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:08.340
And then if you zoom out and you pull up a map of all of the countries around
it,

256
00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:09.660
<v 2>okay.</v>

257
00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.830
<v 0>I just want like,
look,</v>

258
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.410
<v 2>sorry.</v>

259
00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:13.831
<v 0>No,
it's okay.</v>

260
00:16:13.831 --> 00:16:17.760
Actually the one you were on was good because it showed if you zoomed out,

261
00:16:17.761 --> 00:16:22.520
it had everything.
So you have Egypt there,
then you have Jordan,

262
00:16:22.521 --> 00:16:26.030
which is teetering.
Then you have Siri venue of Lebanon and his balls on the,

263
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.510
the southern border of Lebanon,
which is constantly,
which you know,

264
00:16:29.511 --> 00:16:32.720
so that's the real thing.

265
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:37.220
So when people talk about this fantasy of why can't it just look like America,

266
00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:40.610
why can't there just be a democratic one state solution?
First of all,

267
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.180
no one there wants it.
They pull people constantly.
But the second thing is like,

268
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.770
it's not really what that's gonna look like if we dismantle the state of Israel

269
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.860
or is it going to look like enormous bloodshed.

270
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.280
The likes of which we see in a lot of these countries surrounding it.

271
00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:00.880
Like someone once said to me that if you want to know the word for,

272
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.600
you know,
a Jew without a military,
it's the CDS.
Okay.
It's these edis.

273
00:17:05.601 --> 00:17:09.290
It's the people.
It's the minorities in the Middle East who have been absolutely

274
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.070
destroyed and overrun.
And this is like,
it's,

275
00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.040
I don't think when Americans talk about this part of the world,

276
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.160
they fully appreciate the sort of absolutely painful and hard decisions and the

277
00:17:23.311 --> 00:17:26.850
grappling with violence really.

278
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.620
You know what happened to Jamal?

279
00:17:28.621 --> 00:17:32.460
Cause Shogi and that Saudi embassy that's like normative for this part of the

280
00:17:32.461 --> 00:17:33.294
world.

281
00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:38.340
So the fact that Israel has somehow with all of its flaws managed to eke out a

282
00:17:38.341 --> 00:17:40.410
western style liberal democracy.

283
00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:44.820
Frankly the only place where you and I would feel happy and comfortable living.

284
00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.920
Like why are we never talking about that?

285
00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.940
Well I think it's very for people to find the forum,

286
00:17:50.941 --> 00:17:53.060
to discuss it the way you just did and to,

287
00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:58.120
to really lay it out in cold stark reality.

288
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.940
What is the solution?
What is the solution?

289
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.460
I mean is this is magic.

290
00:18:05.461 --> 00:18:10.410
The solution right now is to do everything possible to build up the Palestinian

291
00:18:10.411 --> 00:18:14.550
economy too for Israel to build relationships.
Like right now,

292
00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:17.520
it has a very,
very positive relationships with Egypt,

293
00:18:17.521 --> 00:18:20.910
which it gave back the Sinai,
which had had one in the six day,
six day war,

294
00:18:20.911 --> 00:18:24.240
I believe,
gave it back to Egypt for a cold piece,
which it's had.

295
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.480
It has a good relationship of all things.

296
00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:30.720
Who would have thought with Saudi Arabia because of their common enemy you're
on.

297
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:35.970
I mean,
things shift.
They're rapidly.
Um,
but,
but as for the Palestinians,

298
00:18:35.971 --> 00:18:39.990
the solution is to build up the economy,
make life better,

299
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:45.210
and support people in movements inside the West Bank that are genuinely

300
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:50.070
nonviolent.
And those people exist.
It's just frankly,

301
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:54.660
oftentimes they're murdered by groups like Hamas and their bodies are dragged

302
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:55.494
through the streets.

303
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.950
If you're accused of being an Israeli collaborator in the West Bank,

304
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:04.050
you know what happens to you?
You're lynched.
No one talks about that.
No,

305
00:19:04.051 --> 00:19:05.190
no one does talk about that.

306
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:10.760
Would you be open to discussing this in this sort of a form with that woman from

307
00:19:11.011 --> 00:19:14.670
the women's March?
Uh,
sure.

308
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.730
Do you think she would do something like that?
I don't know.
I'd be open to it.

309
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.660
Do you think that people like her have ever had a conversation with someone like

310
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:22.770
you who could lay it out?

311
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.850
I know because I think that first of all,

312
00:19:26.851 --> 00:19:30.780
many people who talk about this issue have sort of export aid,

313
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:36.420
American domestic politics to a foreign region of the world.

314
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:40.470
Like in a way that this is talked about a lot.
It's like the oppressor,

315
00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:43.740
the oppressed,
the white,
the black.
No,
that's not what's going on.

316
00:19:43.741 --> 00:19:47.610
I don't think people understand when they talk about Israeli Jews that half of

317
00:19:47.611 --> 00:19:51.870
them are Middle Eastern,
like half of Israeli Jews are Arab,

318
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.080
you know,
there's no appreciation of that reality.

319
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.380
They think that Israel was just founded,
you know,

320
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.550
to save the remnant of the Jews who weren't destroyed in the Holocaust.
And yeah,

321
00:20:02.551 --> 00:20:05.190
it helped for those who survived.

322
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.710
But then once the state of Israel was established,

323
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.900
there was a mass exodus of the Jews from all of the Arab countries where they

324
00:20:12.901 --> 00:20:16.830
had been living as second class citizens where they are either self deported

325
00:20:16.831 --> 00:20:19.560
because they were living at as second class citizens or they were expelled.

326
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.540
Again,
that exodus,
that deportation never talked about.

327
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.580
I'd be happy to talk about this with someone from the women's March.
What is the,

328
00:20:29.581 --> 00:20:32.190
what is the response currently like what,

329
00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:37.230
what is the current position that most people are taking about that woman and

330
00:20:37.231 --> 00:20:40.110
about the woman's march in general because of these things,

331
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.090
because of these antiques,
antisemitic statements.

332
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.240
I think a lot of people in the past few weeks,

333
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:49.180
thanks in part to Meghan Mccain had five minutes on the view with Tamika Mallory

334
00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:53.260
and Bob Land and she did an amazing job grilling them on them.
The view,

335
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.680
the view that it was,
what's changed.
It's amazing.
I know.

336
00:20:56.681 --> 00:20:58.690
But she did an amazing job because,

337
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:03.930
because frankly because their image was so powerful in the same way that the

338
00:21:04.151 --> 00:21:06.190
image of the Lincoln memorial was so powerful,

339
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.580
journalists just sort of accepted it and didn't interrogate that,

340
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.270
who doesn't want to support that?

341
00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:16.200
But it's our job to be skeptical and criticized.

342
00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:20.590
So I think finally a lot of people woke up to it.
Um,
but again,

343
00:21:20.591 --> 00:21:22.840
I wrote that column in August,

344
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.930
2017 and it took until now everything in that column is the thing people are

345
00:21:25.931 --> 00:21:26.680
talking about.

346
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.550
There was also an amazing 10,000 word expos a and tablet magazine and Jewish

347
00:21:30.551 --> 00:21:32.740
Online magazine that did a lot of that work.

348
00:21:32.741 --> 00:21:37.580
So I think it did reach a tipping point.
The thing that is,
um,

349
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:42.280
I see a lot of my friends on the left who are Jewish grappling with is that they

350
00:21:42.281 --> 00:21:47.281
so desperately want to be a part of these movements that they're willing to sort

351
00:21:47.591 --> 00:21:52.330
of check their identity at the door in order to gain entry.

352
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:57.910
And my thing is any progressive movement that's asking you to check your Jewish

353
00:21:57.911 --> 00:22:00.460
identity at the door,
your full Jewish identity,

354
00:22:00.461 --> 00:22:03.820
which is acknowledging that we're not just a faith,
but we're at people.

355
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.050
We're not just people that like have matzah ball soup or something bigger than

356
00:22:08.051 --> 00:22:12.040
that.
That's not a space I want to be a part of.
They would never ask that.

357
00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:15.970
If any other group,
why us?
Why,

358
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:19.870
why do they ask that?
That that,
that's what the real question.
I really think,

359
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:22.960
well,
no,
I think a lot of it goes back to what I was saying before,

360
00:22:22.961 --> 00:22:27.460
which is this misunderstanding.
If you see the world in an intersectional way,

361
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.230
okay.
Not As intersectionality was originally meant to be,

362
00:22:32.231 --> 00:22:33.580
but how it functions in the world.

363
00:22:33.581 --> 00:22:38.560
It functions as a caste system and the higher you are on the victim scale,

364
00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.290
at least on the left,
and it's reverse on the right,
right on the right,

365
00:22:41.291 --> 00:22:44.920
it's like white cis gendered men are at the top on the left there at the bottom

366
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:47.320
and the Jews or somewhere close down to there,

367
00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:51.330
at least in the way that the left the left,
I mean this part of the left,

368
00:22:51.331 --> 00:22:53.620
we're talking about the fringe at least for now,

369
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:58.240
perceive the Jews to be the woke left.
Yeah.
The Jews are not,

370
00:22:58.241 --> 00:22:59.170
the Jews don't rate,

371
00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:03.790
the Jews don't have a place in that victim scale because they've achieved so

372
00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:08.320
much success because they can pass as white because of any number of things.

373
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.410
And so I think that that's a huge reason for it,

374
00:23:11.411 --> 00:23:16.411
which is a huge reason why I think intersectionality is a dead end and why we

375
00:23:16.511 --> 00:23:20.860
need to be talking about ideas and not identity.
Right.
Like that.

376
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:25.240
That is the thing about America that is so amazing.
And like,

377
00:23:25.241 --> 00:23:29.560
I know it sounds cheesy,
but I really feel it that makes us so special.

378
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.670
We are not a country based on blood and soil.

379
00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:38.860
We are a country whose national common identity is based on ascribing to a

380
00:23:38.861 --> 00:23:41.800
common set of ideas.
That is what we're about.

381
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:46.090
And so any politics that's insisting from the left or the right that no,

382
00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:50.470
actually what we are is this warring set of groups competing for scarce

383
00:23:50.471 --> 00:23:55.180
resources.
Absolutely not.
To me,
those kinds of politics are unamerican.
