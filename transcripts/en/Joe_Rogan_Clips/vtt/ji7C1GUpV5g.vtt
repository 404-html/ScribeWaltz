00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.640
But if it was on medium,
if someone said like,

2
00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:06.060
look at these dummies with their terrible fucking recipes,

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.800
it would still be almost as interesting.

4
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:12.110
But it's flavored by you're allowed to mock them because it should have.

5
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.220
<v 1>But,
but it's,
it's almost like they're uneducated.
You know,</v>

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.280
vox ran an article claiming that people who hold alt right views are like 11

7
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.400
million or some huge number and that's just like,
it's absurd.

8
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.430
That's not 11 million American.
Well,

9
00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:30.220
you defined outright as being some sort of a white supremacist.

10
00:00:30.221 --> 00:00:32.080
I will quote the associated,
okay.
Associated Press.

11
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.000
The AAP guidelines are that alt-right means white nationalist,

12
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.930
a desire.
Can I ask you this?
Who had to find that?
How does it,
why are they,

13
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:45.450
because Richard Spencer is the man who popularized the term.
Yeah.

14
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.170
So he,
he's not the one who coined it,

15
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.710
but he popularized it and he is a white nationalist.
Right.
So I mean,
you know,

16
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.110
if you want to be a part of his movement,

17
00:00:53.111 --> 00:00:55.810
there are certain things that are attached to it.
And uh,
other,

18
00:00:55.811 --> 00:01:00.640
other alt right people have written huge things about what it is.
So the AP said,

19
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.310
these are our guidelines and I'll,
I'll defer to the Associated Press.

20
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:06.550
I have a lot of respect for them.
There you go.
You know,
so if,

21
00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:10.930
if there's a news organizations,
there was a Willamette weekly.
This is,
this is,

22
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.000
it's,
it's,
it.
Got It man.
I just really,
I,
I worked for vice,
I was actually,

23
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.040
uh,
I'm one of the key reasons vice news exists and I look back on it now.

24
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.140
It makes me kind of sad how they've written some of these,

25
00:01:23.141 --> 00:01:24.490
most of these such ridiculous articles.

26
00:01:24.491 --> 00:01:27.040
I'm really proud of a lot of stuff they've done.
But I,
I quit.

27
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.990
I quit when I got an offer from fusion and fusion is,
it was an ABC,

28
00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:35.620
Univision joint venture.
When I,
when I started there,
they said,

29
00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:36.520
we won't be partisan.

30
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.700
For some reason they decided to go far left and start pushing,
you know,

31
00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:42.520
a lot of things that I thought were wrong.
They,
uh,

32
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.310
told me to in effect lie right.
So the,
the,

33
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:50.860
the thing I'm bring up is I just have such disdain for these,

34
00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:55.861
these news organizations and how they use definitions that suit their needs to

35
00:01:56.471 --> 00:01:59.520
get the clicks.
They want your altar right today,
you're not outright tomorrows.

36
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.790
Yeah.
Right.

37
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.360
<v 0>The,
the,
the click thing is an issue.
An issue.
Right.
Um,</v>

38
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.020
how much of an issue is that journalists are essentially fighting for their

39
00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:12.820
lives because newspaper is almost dead.
Yeah.
It's online.

40
00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:15.760
Publications are trying,
they're trying to get subscriptions.

41
00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:19.810
Like I subscribe to several different news online public aid that used to be

42
00:02:19.811 --> 00:02:23.470
newspapers,
but the last time I picked up an actual newspaper,

43
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.140
it's so much so that I felt like I had a joke about reading something in the

44
00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:32.220
paper and uh,
like turning the page.

45
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.000
I almost felt like I'm a liar for doing a joke about turning the page of a
paper.

46
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.310
I don't remember the last time I fucking did that.

47
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.270
Everything I've read is either on a tablet or on a laptop or

48
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.660
<v 1>do you know,
do you know what the Gal Man Amnesia effect is?
No.</v>

49
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.250
When you're an expert in MMA,
you're like,
one of the foremost experts.

50
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.480
Have you ever read a news article about MMA that was so wrong?
Okay,

51
00:02:55.481 --> 00:02:57.520
so that same newspaper,
you're reading it,

52
00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.560
you see that store and you laugh how wrong it could be.

53
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:01.900
You turn the page and there's a story about Syria and you go,
I didn't know that.

54
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.290
Why would you forget how wrong they were?

55
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:08.850
But the reason I bring this up is the analogy is that you turn the page.
Yeah,

56
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:09.970
nobody does it.
