1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.990
It's how,

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.390
<v 1>how comfortable is it when it gets in through their ears?
Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.340
Like is it getting an easy or is it like,
oh,
this guy's on?
No,
yeah,
yeah.
I'll,

4
00:00:10.341 --> 00:00:11.310
I'll bring on a guest,

5
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.510
I'll hear the guest say something and I just cringe because I anticipate the

6
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:17.490
comments and it's like,
dude,

7
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:21.660
you're about to get crushed by the weight of the world.
Will you?

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.670
Well,
you quiet somebody.
No,
I mean if I have to,
uh,

9
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:29.070
try not to,
if I have to correct them,

10
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.830
like if they're saying something that I know to be inaccurate,

11
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.690
if it's in my wheelhouse,

12
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.960
like sometimes people say something and I'll just say that's not,

13
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.660
that's not true.
Here's why that's not true.
You know,

14
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:44.310
I've had people say some goofy shit and it just happens to be something I know a

15
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:48.510
lot about and then I have to stop it.
Yeah.
Okay.
That makes,
that makes sense.

16
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.920
Cause,
but for the most part,
I want people to just be themselves.

17
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.010
I got to figure out how to get you to be yourself.

18
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.250
That's what a lot of this is comfortable make you realize that.

19
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.710
I just want you to do great.
I want everybody to do great.

20
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.970
Are you ever intimidated by gas?
Yeah.
By their intellect.
Yeah.

21
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.840
Like Elon Musk was intimidating talking to him cause you realize what a champ

22
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:13.980
you are.
Oh yeah,
I'm a fucking dummy man.

23
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.540
But like talking to this guy,
I'm like,
I'm a fucking chimp.
Here's a question.

24
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.030
You just kind of like a champ.

25
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.940
I got to go to Mars.
Huh?
Cool wants smokes weed.

26
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.700
Yeah.
A cut of that.

27
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.530
Like your Chin is motherfuckers making electric cars,
you know,

28
00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:43.910
sending rockets into space.
He's drilling holes under the ground.

29
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.410
You had to dumb them down with Megan solar cities.

30
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.960
<v 0>We didn't even,
didn't even work,
but so here's my take on it.
Right.</v>

31
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.400
I'm watching Musk.
Right.

32
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.180
And he basically is opening up to you about how he's not happy.
Yeah,

33
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.980
right.
There's this moment where he's like,

34
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.980
I think he said something to spend of you one want to be me.
Yeah.

35
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.290
You said this was his exact words.
He wouldn't want to be mean.

36
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.220
You wouldn't want to be me.
So that means he doesn't want to be him.

37
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.260
I think on some level he doesn't want to be him.
Right?
Yeah.
And

38
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.440
he's so with these guys that we admire because they're so brilliant and they

39
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:22.850
have all these brilliant ideas and we're,

40
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:26.540
we're putting this matrix of we're all in this success matrix on some level,

41
00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:30.650
right.
Where it's like get things done good.
Don't they can get things on bad.

42
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.860
Right.
I wonder if

43
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.600
if he's chimp ish in that he's potentially wasting his life being upset or

44
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.410
miserable when he could be focusing on things that would give them joy.
I just,

45
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.460
that being a is that being a fucking chimp is being so smart that you don't even

46
00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:57.350
try to just be happy and focus on your happiness.

47
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.310
I don't necessarily think he's unhappy,

48
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.930
<v 1>but I do think that he puts himself into situations where the amount of stress</v>

49
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:07.600
that he absorbs is almost unfathomable.

50
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.370
Like when he was trying to get the Tesla model three production re scheduled

51
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:15.910
ramped up and he was sleeping on the floor of the factory and working literally

52
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:20.260
working like 1920 hours a day.
That that's untenable.

53
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:22.150
You can only do that for short periods of time.
Right.

54
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.600
But I think that what I was saying about Kanye West's applies to him tenfold.

55
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.600
He's,

56
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.580
he's got a power output that's extraordinarily different than the average
person.

57
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.590
And that's one of the things he was talking about when he was young.

58
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.170
I mean you could probably put him on some sort of a,

59
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.340
I don't know what the super genius spectrum is like,
like what is,

60
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.420
you know what's,
what's Albert Einstein,
right?
What's,
what's this guy?

61
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:48.940
What's that guy?
He's in there somewhere.

62
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.870
Crazy realm of the way your brain works.

63
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:57.400
Like I think the brains are like all other body parts.

64
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.600
Some people born with little tiny dicks and some people got giant hogs and

65
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:02.770
that's just a fact.

66
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.120
And I think that has a giant hot of a brain

67
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.340
and it just works better.
It just,

68
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.840
it just is operating on a level that you and I can't,
we can't comprehend.

69
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.180
But I never invented a God damn thing in my life.

70
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.490
But I'm driving around in Elon Musk's car,

71
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.970
you know that motherfucker made a car and that's like some shitty does on the

72
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:29.210
side.
You know his car thing is like after he invented paypal and,

73
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.960
and he's,
by the way,
while he's doing the car,

74
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.140
he shoot rockets into space and drilling holes into the ground.

75
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.800
He's trying to move traffic on ground,
trying to fuck it.

76
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.400
He's making so are cities like he's,

77
00:04:40.401 --> 00:04:45.401
he's hooking up Australia with these massive solar panel power battery plants.

78
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.520
Fucking fix their energy needs.
He's,
he's on another level.

79
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.840
No doubt.
On another level it's a different thing,
but so is he happy jail?

80
00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.310
I don't know.
And that's a nice guy that was hanging around with him.

81
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:04.960
He seems happy.
Yeah.
I mean,
yeah,
there was,
what is happy,
right?

82
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.600
Is it,
is he happy in bursts when,
well,

83
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.560
I guarantee you when I saw him and he was shooting his fucking flame thrower and

84
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:15.910
my,
my four,
Yay.
He was happy.
You're four.
Yay.
Yeah.
Right out here,
man.

85
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.430
Right out here.
He had a fucking flame thrower.

86
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:21.070
He was tapping that bitch when he walked into the door.

87
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.810
He's unboxing it in the middle of this hallway out here.
Yeah.
Got Flames.

88
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.840
There's a picture of him standing in front of the Freak party sign blown flames

89
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:32.830
out.
15 freely.

90
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.210
Fucking guy's a maniac.
Look at the smile on his face.

91
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.590
You can't tell him he's not happy,
Bro.
Look at that smile.
He's happy as fuck.

92
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.570
It's cause he's a kid,
man.
Yeah.
We're in a lot of ways.
There's this,

93
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.030
there's this fucking guy,
I forget his name is doctor a wrap,

94
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.150
a pie or something like that.
He's like,
it's French consulting.

95
00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:56.380
He's like some fucking genius and he's like decoded cultures,
right?
And uh,

96
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.220
every culture echoed in he people

97
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.900
<v 0>hire him to consult.
Right.
And like America's code is a,</v>

98
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.850
it's a,
the verb is to do and the time is now.
Right.

99
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.230
And we're just kids at the end of the day.
Right.
It's like everything.

100
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.420
We love big tits in America.
Right.

101
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.570
Most popular plastic surgery is big tits and like France,

102
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:18.590
most popular project surgeries,
getting tits for reduced,
right.

103
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.230
Everything about them is like precision and like the food on the plate,

104
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.860
they're most popular plastics.
That's what I was talking to my buddy,

105
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:25.840
and that's what he said and mean.

106
00:06:25.841 --> 00:06:28.070
Maybe it's changed to like lips or something more common now,

107
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:30.440
but maybe the one that you have to go under or dark one.

108
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.230
Don't fuck with your lips,
ladies.
I like it when they get a little lips.

109
00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:33.580
If they haven't.
