1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.710
The joe rogan experience.
Cool stuff.
Ooh,
this is a five round or two,
right?

2
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.320
Yeah,
man,
that's a weird argument,
right?

3
00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:16.321
Like what do you like when they changed the main events to five rounds?

4
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.080
Not just world title fights,
but main events too.
Yeah.

5
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.210
People like it rounds the better.
Yeah.
You have more five round fights.

6
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.700
Definitely get you thinking,
look,
you'll,

7
00:00:27.701 --> 00:00:31.360
you'll figure out who the fuck is the best fighter because oftentimes things

8
00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:35.950
start getting weird around the fourth round.
But fighters make the argument,

9
00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:37.270
and I've heard this argument before,

10
00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:40.650
like you only have so many five round fights in your body.
Yeah.

11
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.060
And when you're using them up on these,
uh,

12
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.480
fights where you're trying to get to a world title,

13
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.070
like by the time you get there,

14
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:51.970
those fourth and fifth rounds or they're taking a toll on you and it could,

15
00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:54.910
we could potentially see guys with a shorter careers because of that.
Yeah.

16
00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:57.190
When also thinking about what goes into a camp for a five round fight.

17
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.760
I mean it's five rounds harder for eight weeks,
10 weeks,

18
00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:03.880
and you're starting to get into,
I had this camp for a five round fight.

19
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.250
So the camp itself is harder to,
and you only,
you know,

20
00:01:06.251 --> 00:01:08.710
you only have so many those in.
Yeah,
yeah.
There's no,

21
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.260
there's no arguing that it's like a boxing,
you know,

22
00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:14.700
it used to be 15 rounds and they went,
you know those last three?
Yeah.

23
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.260
Really a killer.
Well,
I think it was that duck do Kim.
That was the fight,
right?

24
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.410
Ray?
Boom,
boom man.
See what water fight that was.

25
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.540
And that was another weight cut issue.
Yup.

26
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.240
That was back when they used to make them wait in the day of the fight.
Yeah.
Ooh,

27
00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:28.240
front kick to the face.
Yeah.

28
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.430
Referee committed to dead.
He really is.
He did.
God Damn.

29
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.150
Which referee was that?
I that,
that I don't man,
I don't remember his name.

30
00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:41.940
And I know he took his life.
Oh Man.
He got suicide to the body.
Oh.
Oh,

31
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.440
Jeremy Stephens with a right knee left knee.
Oh Man.

32
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.030
Rose like Chevy stole something from him.
Jeremy.

33
00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:53.080
It's rose hay makers.
He ticked,
he tagged him with that right hand.

34
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.670
Who the fuck is more savage than Jeremy Stephens?
Not many.
Oh,
switch elbow.

35
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.020
That by choice.
Nice.
Looked like a jab,
then turned it over

36
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.020
and a leg kick for strong leg kick by choice.

37
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.550
What put a lot of people would hesitate at this point to throw that many lake

38
00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:14.470
kicks when the guy's got a right hand like that.
And he's not hesitating.
No.

39
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.510
He's really prepared well to avoid it and to counter make them pay and that

40
00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:25.230
long,
long stiff jab of his helps to get a little the reach advantage as well.

41
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.100
Jeremy.
I think Jeremy's five,
eight and a half inch and a half

42
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.680
<v 1>taller,
maybe two inches tall.</v>

43
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.893
Boom.

44
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.490
<v 0>Oh,
beautiful timing with that right hand.
Snapped his head back.</v>

45
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.300
Ooh.
Nice Jab to there,
Jeremy.
Jeremy getting that timing down.
Choice.

46
00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:49.390
Taking it well though.
Yup.
Well he took it well and that cub Swanson,

47
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.780
he took it hard leg kick there too.

48
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.420
Now he's tied.
Starting to turn a little bit of walking him down.

49
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.920
He's walking him down,
switching legs and looking for those big shots thrown,

50
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.010
thrown some offspeed punches to close the distance.

51
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.490
<v 2>Okay.</v>

52
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.580
<v 0>I think a couple of checklists would be good for them.</v>

53
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:11.480
Choice coming in once again with that head straight up.

54
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.290
But Steven's just loves walking forward,
man.
But he's such a fucking animal.
Yeah.

55
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.130
I mean he just loves these firefights that the opportunity to test.

56
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:27.040
Who's the tougher guy and especially at one 45

57
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.160
<v 3>oh right.</v>

58
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.010
<v 0>Might be it.
I was good.
Good.
Leaping shot.
Staying with the left hand.</v>

59
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.210
<v 3>Oh,
Don Donald.</v>

60
00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:45.150
That's done.
Oh my God.
Wow.

61
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.180
What a fuck you right here is an animal.
Oh,

62
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.380
broke that guy's back and go.
That guy's fucked.
Who is that guy?

63
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.210
<v 0>Dad.
Oh,
imaginable.
He's playing it off.
Oh Man.</v>

64
00:03:59.211 --> 00:04:03.260
That's beautiful.
Whew.
What a fight too.
Huh?

65
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.480
But as soon as that tide turned,

66
00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:08.310
as soon as he felt like I can walk through these punches,
it was over.
Yeah.

67
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.100
Fucking animal guy is a savage.
He's such a savage.

68
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.930
Jeremy.
Steve.
It's great stuff,
man.
Fuck.
That was awesome.

69
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.860
Ooh.
And he could do that to anybody.
That's the thing.

70
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.410
He takes it so well and his,

71
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.800
that attitude that he's got that fucking ferocious attitude.

72
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.300
Now here's what's really impressive.

73
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.840
When you think about choice war with Cub Swanson,

74
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.000
and you think Jeremy Stevens just smashed him inside of two is impressively that

75
00:04:38.001 --> 00:04:41.170
he got front kicked in the face,
kinda.
It was almost like a crescent kick.

76
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:45.320
It took it on the side.
Boom,
right hand boom,

77
00:04:45.321 --> 00:04:48.400
snapped him back with that one.
That was the beginning of the weekend.

78
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.560
That was the,
the the head snap or that was it.
And that one over the top.

79
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.760
He caught him right on the temple and his legs going,
boom.
Look at that.

80
00:04:55.761 --> 00:04:59.960
Jesus Christ.
Here's the one.
That's the big one.
Oh my goodness.

81
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.870
Boom.
That was great.
Boom.
Good job.
Fuck.

82
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.980
Hell yeah.
Good stuff,
man.
That's good fucking fight.

83
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.670
Well Boys,
Steven's always going to be that guy.

84
00:05:13.671 --> 00:05:16.400
Didn't do that task big over rent right hand.

85
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.473
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

86
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.400
okay.
