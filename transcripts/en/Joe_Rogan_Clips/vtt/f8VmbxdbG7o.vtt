1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.540
Did you get a Tesla?
Are you just driving around?
Oh God.
One telling me.

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.500
How do you like it?
I had to get one.
I told you long Moscow,

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.090
get one guy did my podcast.
I almost solid.
I'm a man of my word.

4
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.000
Uh,
it's a fucking spaceship.

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.780
It's the weirdest thing I've ever driven in my life.
It doesn't even make sense.

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.790
It's not even,
not even,

7
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.750
there's not a single car that I've ever driven that's even close to his fast.

8
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.180
Nothing like my Porsche is so slow.
I have a gt three Rs.

9
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:35.130
It has 518 horsepower.
It weighs 300 pounds.
It sounds like a dragon.

10
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.550
And that Tesla would leave it in the dust.
I mean,

11
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:43.470
leave it in the dust like zero to 62 seconds quicker.

12
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.960
It's fucking insane.
And out of a no ludicrous.
Oh yeah,
I did.

13
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:50.470
I put it in chill mode for a little while.

14
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.180
But you could drive chill with ludicrous mode.
Always available.

15
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:57.570
You don't have to keep switching back.
And ludicrous mode is just crazy crap.

16
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.350
Like the fastest and any kills your battery.
Well,
it kills your battery quicker.

17
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.880
But the thrust that you get is a rollercoaster ride.
It's insane.

18
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.490
I mean you can't believe how fast it is.
It doesn't even,

19
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:11.430
it literally doesn't make sense.
It doesn't seem right.

20
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.760
It seems like like it's punching its way through a wormhole.

21
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.210
Use an alien technology.
Meanwhile I posted,

22
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:22.350
it seems like a something Bob Lozar snuck out of area 51 I get all these

23
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:27.060
messages from people.
Bob was our has been debunked.
That's controlled opposition.

24
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.640
That's a fake story.
It's fake news bro.
They got you with the Bob Lozar story.

25
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.650
Do you like all the tech in it?
And I mean that's,

26
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.980
that's saying it's too much almost because it's this giant screen.

27
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.800
Like I had a dim at whey the fuck down cause I was just looking at it like

28
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:44.940
you're so pretty.
Pretty.
It's so pretty.
My dream car,

29
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:47.100
it's very comfortable.
Super comfortable.

30
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.120
Now do you have a supercharged station at your house yet or do your thing on the

31
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:54.270
wall at my house that I could plug it into?
It's on a supercharger.

32
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:57.060
It takes like eight hours,
10 hours or more.
And how many miles?

33
00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:58.200
But I'm going to get one of those.

34
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.880
I'm going to get one of those fast charger in the house.
He goes allegedly,

35
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.260
and I mean allegedly 311 miles.
You have the fuel that put the,

36
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:11.810
here's the problem.
I drive like a moron.
So it's not going that far.
Did you get,

37
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.500
is there a few option for that model and like are you all,

38
00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:17.880
I mean I think there's a fuel add on that gives you an exterior like,
oh,

39
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.770
that's an option.
Like I thought you meant a fuel like gasoline.
Yeah,

40
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.840
I know.
What are you talk some models,
not Tesla.
Okay.

41
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.560
You're just making shit up bro.
Some,
some,
uh,
I think it which car it is,

42
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.090
four wheeled electric cars to pay extra for like one gallon of gas.

43
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.230
So like if you ever lose your battery,
I have heard of that.
Yeah.
What was that?

44
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:42.720
I thought Tesla had that.
No,
no,
no,
no.

45
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:45.770
There was like a Prius.

46
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.850
Prius is our mixed,
they're hybrids.
Prayas is use gasoline,

47
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:55.140
but a very stingy amount of gasoline.
They run partially on electric motors.

48
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.660
So do a,
the Acura Nsx,

49
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.890
the ACURA NSX has two electric motors,
but I think you don't ever charge it.

50
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.900
I think the electric motors are powered by the gasoline engine and electricity

51
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:09.010
in the car.
If I remember right,

52
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.750
that's supposed to be the motherfucker like the Acura Nsx is supposed to be the

53
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:17.710
car that people are underlooked under looking for whatever reason.

54
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.870
It just doesn't get the love that it deserves.

55
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:23.520
And apparently the 2019 models even more insane.
Right.

56
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.970
I can't wait to the day where like your garage floor is like a wireless charging

57
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:28.270
mat.

58
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.840
You just pull right up into that Matt or they would never would be because it's

59
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:34.940
rubber.
Well there I'm sure they'll find a way because it's like there's a,

60
00:03:34.941 --> 00:03:36.040
there's,
there's like a view,

61
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.810
if you take her phone and put it on a wireless charger,

62
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:40.540
there's like a little room that if you don't,
you don't have to touch it.

63
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.050
Like maybe that's the whole reason why you're safe from getting hit by
lightning,

64
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:45.220
bro.
Yeah,
I like that.

65
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:48.520
The rubber protects you from electric park though a little thing comes down to

66
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:50.650
the ground,
like a little switch.

67
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.130
That thing falls out while you're driving a little bone,

68
00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:55.270
wax your car over or did they give the streets?

69
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.630
Like if somehow like if you were riding on the highway and if you'd want to fuel

70
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:00.640
up that you can like fuel up using the road,

71
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.560
they might pay like a fee or something.

72
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.980
But really ideally it would be great if solar panels had gotten so powerful they

73
00:04:08.671 --> 00:04:09.930
could charge it just with the sun.

74
00:04:09.931 --> 00:04:13.830
Especially because southern California is always fucking sunny except for today,

75
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.750
but it's a matter of time.
The cars,
the future.
That's what it is.
It really is.

76
00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:22.020
Look,
I'm a giant fan of American muscle cars there.

77
00:04:22.021 --> 00:04:25.740
My all time favorite cars in terms of like to drive to hear the rumble of the

78
00:04:25.741 --> 00:04:28.350
engine and that I love them.
I love them.

79
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.710
Maybe I'm some crazy old dude from the fucking eighties it's still loves 1960s

80
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:37.320
and muscle cars.
Maybe I don't care.
I love him,

81
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.100
but that fucking cars,
that future,
that Tesla's the future.

82
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.480
Like when you drive it,
you realize,
Oh,
other cars are stupid.
Is that,

83
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.620
that's that new world,

84
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.340
new crazy rocket thing today shooting rockets out in his backyard.

85
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.203
Is that his house?

86
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.140
Is there anything that you don't like on that or something that kind of bugs
you,

87
00:04:55.141 --> 00:04:57.730
you,
that you wish was like,
Oh I don't,
you know,
I don't like have,

88
00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.560
there's no door handles,
you know?
No,
no,
no,
nothing.
You just got to figure it out.

89
00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:05.700
It just takes a little while to figure out what all different buttons do and how

90
00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:09.750
to,
how to get things to happen.
But it's really well thought out.
It's a look.

91
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.810
He's a legit genius,
you know,

92
00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:16.380
and what he's doing is unprecedented and you know,

93
00:05:16.381 --> 00:05:18.840
this is going to sound like I'm kissing his ass cause I liked him because he did

94
00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:22.410
the podcast and then I became friends with them.
No,
he's important.

95
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.560
The guys got ideas that are of a magnitude that dummies,

96
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.990
like you and me are never going to come up with any of those ideas ever.

97
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.410
If we lived a thousand lives,
we would never figure out space x.

98
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.430
It's just not in our wheelhouse.
We would never make a fucking electric car.

99
00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:39.660
We never make one of those things.

100
00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:42.090
Never got that Tesla roadster that's going to come out.

101
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.280
That goes zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds and looks like like a space ship,

102
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.380
like a like a race car spaceship from the future.
And we're not doing that dude.

103
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.260
We need people like that.
Those guys are super important.
This guy is a,

104
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.030
he's like a,
a culture,

105
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.510
like a legit culture changer and he got him to smoke weed.
Jesus you want to do,

106
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.440
is the ad blocker a bus to,

107
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.990
I'm looking forward to the new Toyota Super Man.

108
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.830
Super skying up dude.
The new one looks dope,
pat.

109
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.320
So this is the space x rocket.
So space.
What does it say at the top?

110
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.030
It says,

111
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.800
built a stainless steel rocket ship in Texas that looks like liquid silver and

112
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:28.940
might launch in February,
didn't it?
What year?
What Day is this?
Uh,
article.

113
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.610
January 11th.
A couple weeks?
Yeah.
Okay.
It fell over.
Yeah,

114
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.440
I know that they've been doing stuff more with it,
but I just,
how cool it looks.

115
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.390
It looks like it fell on the ground while I was standing there.
Yeah.

116
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.630
It got blown over in the wind.
Yeah.

117
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.210
It looks like a drawing for a rocket from the 19 hundreds I don't know if he did

118
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:51.500
it on purpose,
but it looks just like,
it looks like a fucking movie.

119
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:56.030
Like buck Rogers.
That's a book.

120
00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:58.580
Rogers rocky.
Right.
It looks dope though.

121
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.050
Roger's dude that driving that car really feels like the future.

122
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.940
And did you get the best model or
of course you did,
but uh,
yeah,

123
00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:12.830
I got the model s p 100 ds.
What it's called.
I just paid off my car.

124
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:15.200
I might just sell and get one of those.

125
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.540
You have to have a place to park it that has a little charge port.

126
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.120
A power outlet.
I don't think you'd probably convert it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

127
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.930
I think there's a couple of superchargers in Burbank and yet there's one across

128
00:07:26.931 --> 00:07:28.910
the street,
but it's always taken.
I don't know what the,

129
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.970
you know what's weird man pass and by gas stations and going,

130
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.410
I'm never gonna use you with this.

131
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.800
I'm never pulling in there unless I want a soda.
Look at that thing.

132
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.840
That's why zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds and I'm telling you,
man,

133
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:46.430
that's not an unrealistic number.
620 miles.
Yes.
Wait,
when's this come out?

134
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.450
A couple of years.
It's going to be awhile.
Uh,

135
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:55.910
I'm going to get 100% I'll buy your old one.
This is such a dope car,
man.

136
00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:57.950
It doesn't even make sense.
Why does it not have a side mirror?

137
00:07:57.951 --> 00:08:02.100
It's got no side mirrors as cameras.
Fuck the rendering of it.

138
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:06.620
Shut your mouth.
I tell you,
God damn side mirror you sons of bitches.

139
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:11.270
I love my camera.
Camera's on my car.
I don't even use my side mirrors.

140
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:14.990
It's so much better having that look at that thing.
How much is that?

141
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.830
620 mile.
I Dunno.
Probably stupid.
Expensive.
Look how pretty it is.

142
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:23.550
It's too pretty to be cheap.
I got fucking sick.
That thing looks,
look at it.

143
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.780
I mean it's like the ultimate sports car,
like that looks like a,

144
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.420
that easily could be a new nine 11 like from that angle particularly and then

145
00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:36.020
the roof comes off.
It's like gamer seats.
Look at this game.
Receipts right there.

146
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.070
Well not only that,
but,
well that's what racing seats,

147
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.330
but that's why they were racing seats first and then we came gamer.

148
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.770
She when the steering wheel's wonky steering wheels like a,
like an f one,

149
00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:48.810
like a Formula One car.
See it.
Oh it's like square.
Yeah.

150
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.570
It's like grab it by the handles.

151
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.520
Maybe they want to make sure that you don't do this kind of shit like,
ew,

152
00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.060
this is so fast.
You probably need to hold onto it in a different way.

153
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.550
Dude,
I'm telling you that the car that I,
that I got beautiful.

154
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.160
I've never experienced anything like that before.
And you don't think it's real.

155
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.950
You don't think a car can do that?
Doesn't make any sense.

156
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.660
Why did you wonder if $45,000

157
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.160
damn chop that chat on my gosh.

158
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.520
Plus the five thousand fifty thousand to up two 50 yeah.

159
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.180
It's probably gonna sell out in five seconds to to pay it.
Every,

160
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.010
every dickhead in Hollywood will have one.
Look at me.

161
00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:30.830
I'm environmentally conscious,
but still sucks.

162
00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.710
Like I'm gonna be talking about open shirt to Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.
