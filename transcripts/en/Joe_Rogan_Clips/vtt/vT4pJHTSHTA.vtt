1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.861
Hmm.
Well that,

2
00:00:00.861 --> 00:00:04.890
that has huge implications for MMA cause that's the big debate right now.

3
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:09.540
How long should someone get suspended for and for how long,
you know,

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.470
how long afterwards should they be considered enhanced?
Yeah.
You know,

5
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.360
like they're giving people some pretty significant suspensions now for steroids,

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.400
like two years.
But you know,

7
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:24.030
there's this Jon Jones case and I'm sure you're aware of,
do you wear this?
Yeah.

8
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.720
Where he's testing positive for the metabolite,

9
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.530
for the longterm metabolite,
for a very small dose.

10
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:36.440
He's never tested positive for a short term metabolite.
Which testosterone?
No,

11
00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:41.010
it's not testosterone.
It's um,
what is the stuff Terrana ball.
Yeah.

12
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.060
And essentially it's tainted supplement and it's not,

13
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.170
it doesn't have any performance enhancing benefit in terms of like the,
the,

14
00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:51.270
the amount of the dosage that he's tested positive for,

15
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.170
but it's lingering in his system because the protocols for,
um,

16
00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.270
the weather ability rather to detect these metabolites has increased rapidly.

17
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.190
And over the last year it's just unbelievably more sensitive to the point where,

18
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:08.000
you know,
they're detecting these infant testimony,

19
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.470
small levels of these metabolites.

20
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:13.740
And there's also seems to be some sort of a pulsing effect when your body

21
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:17.400
releases these infant testimony,
small metabolites and then doesn't,

22
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.190
so you'll test negative and then the next week you'll test positive,

23
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.410
but only for the longterm metabolite,

24
00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:25.770
which is an indication that there's no real administration of the performance

25
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:29.370
enhancing drug.
Yeah.
So it's real.
It's,
it's in everybody's mad.

26
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.870
There's so many athletes that are mad about it.
And from what you're saying,

27
00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:38.490
and for this study that Doctor Rhonda Patrick highlighted,
it's,
you know,
it's,

28
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.980
it's especially for SOS willingly taken something,
seats.

29
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.290
There's a lot of those like once a doper always a doper type of things.

30
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.450
There is that.
Yeah.
But she,

31
00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:52.260
the Jon Jones situation is very tricky because she's so good and he's so

32
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:55.470
dominant that people just assume that he's been doing something his whole career

33
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.280
and when you catch them,
they're like,
Aha.
That's the reason why he's so good.

34
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.600
Yeah.
It,
it may be,
but it also might be,
he's got phenomenal genetics.

35
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:08.310
He has two brothers.
He was just the,
the best of the guys who are taking drugs.

36
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.180
That's a different situation because that's a sport where at least in the time

37
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:14.850
period where he was competing,
everyone was doing something.
Yeah,

38
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.830
100% they had to go meet.
All the UFC is like that.
It's not right that it's not.

39
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.350
It's not.
It can't be.
They're too strict.

40
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.840
The side is knocking on doors at six o'clock in the morning,

41
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.010
pee in this cup and you,
you do hear about positive tests,

42
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:33.660
but the amount of positive test versus the negative tests is overwhelming way

43
00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:37.110
more guys are not doing something.
It used to be the opposite.

44
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.570
It used to be in the nineties everyone was doing something.

45
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.860
We were just talking about this on the fight companion podcast that a big issue

46
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.940
is grappling.

47
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.920
Grappling competitions are overrun with steroid users because no one's testing

48
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.610
and these,
I mean it's the smell test is off the fucking charts.

49
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:58.290
You're looking at these guys,
they're just ridiculous.
Just jacked,
low body fat,

50
00:02:58.291 --> 00:03:01.810
super high mass and their training Jujitsu all the time too.

51
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.250
So you would think it would be very hard for them to maintain muscle mass,

52
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:10.810
as well as be able to train the way they're training with technique and drills

53
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:14.210
and cardio.
And it's very difficult to maintain muscle.
Any,

54
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.530
any concurrent strength,
endurance training scenario.
Very difficult,

55
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:18.251
very difficult.

56
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:23.251
So there's a real issue with some of these guys competing this way and then

57
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.020
trying to transition into MMA.
