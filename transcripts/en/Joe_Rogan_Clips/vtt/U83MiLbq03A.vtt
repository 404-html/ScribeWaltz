1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.890
Fight Derrick Lewis Francis,

2
00:00:01.891 --> 00:00:06.450
which we thought there's gonna be fireworks or Paul Daley Mvp last night.

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.120
Not you man.
Fuck you.
How to call Paul Daily.
You know what?

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.560
I'm a wrestler now.
Dude was crazy.
It was.
It was,
it was horrible.
It wasn't good.

5
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:20.370
But it was better than Francis versus Derek.
I don't know.
It was,

6
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:25.260
there was moments of action.
Yeah,
there was.
There was able to take down.
Oh yeah.

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.460
Which is not going to be Peter Kim down.
Yeah,
but it's not as a shit show.

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.780
It's not good for MVPs.
Imagine with Tyron Woodley would do to MVP.

9
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.320
Imagine we don't have to worry.
It doesn't have to worry about it.

10
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.830
Cause he didn't know any Mcdonald though.
But a real Fitch,

11
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.190
Fitch.
But,
well John Fitch though,
he's got to be able to grab a hold of them.

12
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.460
The thing about Paul dailies,

13
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.670
he fucking threatens a shit out of you with that power.

14
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.180
He's got the scariest lefthand and the sport best left end sport.
Yeah,

15
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:53.910
100% he scares the shit out of you with that power.

16
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:55.740
You got to mind your p's and q's.

17
00:00:55.741 --> 00:01:00.480
But what I like about page is that I've always said that one day we're going to

18
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:04.050
see a guy who's a point fighter who learns how to do other shit cause those guys

19
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:06.330
are impossible to hit because their whole thing.

20
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:09.570
It's lunging in lunging at lunch.
Wonderboy boy,
a little bit,
right?

21
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.500
Wonderboy a little bit,
but he's more of a kickboxing a point fighter.
Phenomenal.

22
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.240
Kickboxer I mean nominal but,

23
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.420
but what will you see from MVP is like one of the best fighters that's ever even

24
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:22.710
attempted to fight and it doesn't get touched.

25
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:27.711
He's so good because we get championships monster with real against Raymond

26
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.201
Daniels.

27
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:30.750
You should see the two of them fight like Raymond Daniels was another one who

28
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:35.610
was a legit worldclass point fighter and MVPs on defeat him professional boxing.

29
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.610
But the file is,
he fight.

30
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.420
Nobody's what's still the re the first real fight she had was last night against

31
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:45.770
daily and there was some holes.
There were some holes that were exposed to,

32
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:49.410
it was way too easy for dealing with Cannon Hill.
That's true.
He's held.

33
00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:53.820
It was only fights way too easy for daily to take him down,
not that daily dozen.

34
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:56.370
His next fight,
it's going to be tough.
What was Chris?
Yeah,
really tough,

35
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:59.340
but what's crazy is a daily was talking so much shit on John Fitch.

36
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:01.210
After John Fish took him down to daily's,

37
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.500
all he does is talk shit about guys wrestling and then he took it down.

38
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:06.780
I was like,
I literally,
I was like,
what is happening?
Right.

39
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:10.020
And I was get frustrated.
I guess.
I was like,
what is happening?
Right?

40
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.810
What's happening right here?
Miles.
Jury's already busted up.

41
00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:15.160
We're not even paying attention.
God.
Well,

42
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.790
you got to talk about fucking Paul Daley.
It was unbelievable.

43
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.530
I didn't realize how big a MVP was.
I didn't know.
He's 63 so tall for this,

44
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.490
for that division and also like uses it.
Here's three bid fish.

45
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.850
His reaches insane.
He does sneaky shit too.
He did it.

46
00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:33.390
It's like these sneaky right hand.
Did he hit him with,

47
00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:35.460
he tried to hit him with a hook kick at one point in time.

48
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.090
He landed that front kick.
Yeah,
he's a beast man.

49
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.660
If he gets his wrestling,
takedown defense on point.
I mean,

50
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:46.920
he's a phenomenal athlete,
but the thing,
he has a gift though it is a big enough,

51
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.730
but the thing that he did,
he goes to London,
shoot fighters,
great God damn gym.

52
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.650
The thing that he's missing,
you know,
I mean,
is it just the wrestling,

53
00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:57.600
takedown defense just to take down defense?

54
00:02:57.601 --> 00:03:01.320
Like if he could take a page out of style,
book style,
been on down.

55
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.200
I'm not too worried about him fighting grappler.
He's hard to take down.

56
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.470
Very tough take down and you're coming in,
you're going to pay it.
Yeah.

57
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.700
He's so God damn technical.
He might be the most tactical strikers in the sport.

58
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.630
I watched him in glory the other day.
I was,
uh,

59
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.270
working out watching some old glory fights with style.
Ben,

60
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:21.740
when he fought a Jason Wellness.
His movement,

61
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.850
he's spending class mean wellness is a world champion.
