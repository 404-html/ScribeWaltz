00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.080
Well,
Susan,
pseudonym gear for,
well,
you know,
it's,

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.100
it's really interesting when it comes to data when it comes to diet because you

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.791
know,
the,

4
00:00:09.791 --> 00:00:14.190
the whole throw the baby out with the bath bath water thing or one of the

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.050
studies that I've read pretty recently,
it was about um,

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.780
the amount of people that suffered ill health consequences that ate red meat

7
00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:25.140
five days per week versus people who didn't.

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.830
But what they didn't take into account was what the people ate with the red meat

9
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.010
when they drank soda.
Whether what,
how did you get your form of red meat?

10
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.780
Was it grass fed beef?

11
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.020
Was it bison or wild game or was it a burger from Wendy's with fries and a sugar

12
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:41.320
been and all the,
the,

13
00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:45.330
the bullshit that people eat along with the food and that you,
you literally,

14
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.710
and people would cite these things as being evidence that something is negative

15
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:51.510
for you,
that red meat is negative for you,

16
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.200
but you're not taking into consideration all the things that we're eating with

17
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:59.040
that red meat.
So these studies that come out like that there are,
so they're,

18
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:02.160
they're really annoying because it's like you have to,

19
00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:05.040
you usually he talked to people about it.
You have to like sit down with them.

20
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:09.720
Okay,
sit down.
Okay,
this is a long process.
Yeah.

21
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.820
Like try to try to figure out what is the cause of these issues.

22
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.060
When you're talking about a lifetime of abuse,

23
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.660
you're talking about like all sorts of different health consequences of a

24
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:24.540
variety of different foods and you're attributing it all to one part of your

25
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:27.410
diet and that's very difficult to do unless you,

26
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.870
you've isolated everything else and done a bunch of different studies where
okay,

27
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.310
I ate nothing but fruits and vegetables and I eat really healthy and I read meet

28
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.520
five days a week or I nothing but shit and fries and buns and pasta and I didn't

29
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:46.230
eat red meat at all and now here's the result.

30
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.490
<v 1>Right.
You're making a really good point.</v>

31
00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:53.491
And that is the combination of how these different foods are interacting in our

32
00:01:53.891 --> 00:01:56.440
bodies.
Extremely important.

33
00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:59.860
Like we talked about the refined sugar and saturated fat Combo.
Well,
you know,

34
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.780
the,
the,
the read me and even just,
you know,
a protein like itself,

35
00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:05.460
like,
you know,

36
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.130
essential amino acids that are coming from animal protein itself and how that is

37
00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:12.730
interacting with,
you know,
eating,
eating a terrible diet like refined sugar,

38
00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:16.480
which is causing damage to ourselves.
You know,
also exercise.

39
00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:21.340
And this is something really,
um,
the,
the,
the protein,
uh,

40
00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:23.050
exercise things seems to be really key.

41
00:02:23.051 --> 00:02:27.490
But there was a recent study that was published that was the largest study

42
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.580
observational study done so far looking at um,

43
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.550
protein intake and all cause mortality and cancer mortality.

44
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.950
And it found like a lot of other studies that higher protein consumption,

45
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.120
um,
higher meat,

46
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.590
protein consumption from meat was associated with a higher all cause mortality

47
00:02:44.591 --> 00:02:48.690
in a higher cancer mortality.
But then when the data was sub analyzed and,
and,

48
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.750
and other unhealthy style factors will looked at.
So,
so,
um,
if,

49
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.780
if someone had one other unhealthy lifestyle factor being either obesity,

50
00:02:57.851 --> 00:03:02.620
smoking,
excessive alcohol consumption or being sedentary,
then they had a higher,

51
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.880
they were,

52
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.740
had a higher all cause mortality in a higher cancer mortality if they meet.

53
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.840
But guess what,
if they had zero,
none of those other unhealthy lifestyle factors,

54
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.861
they didn't have,

55
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:15.790
they had the same aisle all cause mortality and cancer related mortality that

56
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.560
they're not eating meat,
meat eater it's had.

57
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.690
So I think that really highlights the importance of other lifestyle factors.

58
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:25.810
Other foods,
you know,
that's really important when we're at,

59
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:27.530
when we're looking at these observational studies,

60
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.900
<v 0>when you were talking about saturated fat and the negative consequences of</v>

61
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:35.580
eating refined sugar with saturated fat,
is there a negative,
um,
uh,

62
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.660
corresponding negative consequence?
Like if you had a,

63
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.390
if you had negative or if you had,
um,
uh,
an,
uh,

64
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.160
a dye that didn't have any saturated fat in it,
but you ate refined sugar,

65
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.690
like say if you eat a vegan diet,
does saturated or does um,

66
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.610
refined sugar have less of an impact

67
00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.360
<v 1>of eating?
So,
so the refined sugars,
the LDL,
it's an issue with fat.</v>

68
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.550
Yeah,
I think eight.
Yes.

69
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.990
So the LDL will go down if you're eating a Vegan diet diet,

70
00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:10.770
and even though you're still eating cookies or some whatever,
begin stuff,

71
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.650
<v 0>fine.
Sugar's probably like less dangerous to someone.
On a Vegan Diet.
Does that?</v>

72
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.380
<v 1>Yes,
I think so.
And,
and the thing,
the thing with that is,
is that if you look at,</v>

73
00:04:19.381 --> 00:04:20.790
but if you look at refined sugar,

74
00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:23.760
also refined sugar is associated with heart disease risk.

75
00:04:23.761 --> 00:04:26.100
In fact it's like one of the,
and there was a big,

76
00:04:26.101 --> 00:04:29.880
big study like 400,000 different individuals looked at refined shirt,

77
00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:32.700
people that had the highest up refined sugar intake.
But again,
saturated fats,

78
00:04:32.701 --> 00:04:34.040
a confounding factor there,
right,

79
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.860
had like a four times higher risk of getting a heart,
having a heart attack.

80
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.340
But it's,
it's perfect.
You illustrated it perfectly.
And that is,

81
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.460
and that's where I think a lot of these guidelines like the American heart

82
00:04:44.461 --> 00:04:47.610
association come from.
If you are on a population level,

83
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.060
if you say to someone reduce your saturated fat intake,

84
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.160
you're going to lower the LDL risk.

85
00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:57.330
And regardless of all the other stuff they're doing,
you know,
it,
it probably,

86
00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:59.760
well on a population level,
lower their heart disease risk,

87
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.760
but on an individual level,
like someone like you and I,

88
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.950
we don't eat all that other stuff.
You know,

89
00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:09.120
we were very health conscious and do all these things.
You and I,

90
00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:12.790
if we stopped our saturated fat intake,
likely,
you know,

91
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.290
for me I guess my jeans are a little different but likely wouldn't have the same

92
00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:21.270
effect.
So if you were to take that same population to people and say,
okay,

93
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.760
eat your saturated fat,
but take out the refined sugar,

94
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.700
we may see the same thing where the,

95
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.780
where the heart disease risk goes down just like it does.
Men with saturated fat.

96
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.010
In fact,
there've been studies where replacement foods have done,
have looked at,

97
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.990
um,
replacement foods for saturated fat.

98
00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:40.100
And if you replace saturated fat with refined sugar,
it does not,
um,

99
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.930
lower the risk of a heart disease.

100
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.520
So basically that's,
that's kind of a proof of principle there.

101
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.260
But I do think that it's,
it's,

102
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.040
it's an important point and it's something that the American Heart Association

103
00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:57.120
there,
they're now starting to at least mentioned the small dense LDL.

104
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.360
So I think that moving in that direction is good because it means that possibly

105
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:05.840
then,
you know,
over the next decade we're going to start to see,
okay,

106
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:08.120
now we got to start.
It's not just the LDL.

107
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.590
<v 0>I'm confused about something you just said.</v>

108
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.730
You said if you replace saturated fat with refined sugar,

109
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.400
<v 1>if you replace the saturated fat with refined sugar,
eat,
if you,
sorry,</v>

110
00:06:18.401 --> 00:06:21.470
refined carbohydrates,
which I usually think of as refined sugar,

111
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.130
refined carbohydrates.
Um,
it does not.

112
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.150
So the idea is of saturated fat was so bad.
If you replaced,

113
00:06:28.151 --> 00:06:31.000
if you took the saturated fat and replace it with a refined carbohydrate,

114
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.060
it would lower the risk of heart disease.
And it does.
It doesn't,

115
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.390
it doesn't lower the risk.
All right,
so,
so basically,

116
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.850
<v 0>so it's not the saturated fats,</v>

117
00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:43.230
the saturated fat along with refined sugar that has some sort of a negative

118
00:06:43.231 --> 00:06:44.430
synergistic effect.

119
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.180
<v 1>That's what,
that's what the data in aggregation,
looking at the clinical trials,</v>

120
00:06:48.181 --> 00:06:49.350
looking at the mechanism,

121
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.740
looking at the observational studies and look and understanding the interaction

122
00:06:52.741 --> 00:06:54.120
of all these foods together.

123
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.100
<v 0>When the American Heart Association puts out sort of a blanket statement like</v>

124
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:00.740
that.
Yeah.
A lot of people take it as fact.

125
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.570
And then what my research has shown my reading rather,

126
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:06.800
I shouldn't say research,
I'm a dummy,

127
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.370
but the the people that I've read who have criticized this,

128
00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:12.020
there are actually scientists and researchers,

129
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.680
they have a huge issue with that statement.
They think that this is just,

130
00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:16.730
it's too simplistic.

131
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.650
It's not taking into account all the various nuances in genetics,
diet,
ancestry,

132
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:22.910
all the different factors.

133
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.110
But people read that and it's sort of like this cookie cutter approach and then

134
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:28.550
they paired it out to everybody else.

135
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.280
<v 1>Yeah,
it's true.
I mean that's,
that's exactly what happens.</v>

136
00:07:32.281 --> 00:07:36.630
And that same thing goes with,
with the protein and it being bad as well.

137
00:07:36.631 --> 00:07:39.480
And there's all sorts of nuances and the combination of the protein with the,

138
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.560
with the bad diet and also the exercise,
which is one of the,

139
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:44.580
one of the things with the,

140
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:49.020
with the protein is that it increases IGF one and IGF one is a growth factor and

141
00:07:49.021 --> 00:07:53.010
it can allow B cells that are damaged that should otherwise die,
not die.

142
00:07:53.011 --> 00:07:56.550
And so it can allow us precancerous cells to form a tumor.
And that's,

143
00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.940
we know that from mechanistic studies and you know that's,

144
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.480
that's kind of a big part of the,
the,

145
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:06.360
the eating protein essential amino acids specifically or what does it do do
this.

146
00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:07.770
And they are,
they're found an animal protein.

147
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.600
And that sort of the big argument there,

148
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:14.990
but there's also this whole argument where if you are one exercising the IGF one

149
00:08:15.601 --> 00:08:17.910
goes into your brain,
it's been shown across the blood brain barrier.

150
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:21.660
It goes into your brain and also on your muscle where it grows new neurons in

151
00:08:21.661 --> 00:08:23.310
the brain and actually repairs damaged,

152
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.190
damaged muscle tissue and helps grow muscle tissue,

153
00:08:26.191 --> 00:08:30.880
which is also an a predictor of,
of all cause mortality.
So you know,
the x,

154
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.640
again,
the exercise comes in there.

155
00:08:32.641 --> 00:08:36.180
And then also the fact that if you're eating a good diet and you're not,

156
00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.970
you're not causing as much damage to happen in the first place,

157
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.630
then those growth factors being there aren't as big of a deal because you don't

158
00:08:42.631 --> 00:08:45.900
have all these damaged cells from all this refined sugar you're eating that can

159
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:50.310
basically become cancerous cells.
So that's kind of,
you know,

160
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.040
with that study of the observational study that looked at people that were

161
00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:55.890
eating me,
if they didn't have any of those unhealthy lifestyle factors,

162
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:59.070
guess what?
They're all cause mortality and cancer mortality was the same as the

163
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:03.510
vegetarians.
And I think that's kind of highlighting that,
that,
that issue,

164
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:03.870
you know.
