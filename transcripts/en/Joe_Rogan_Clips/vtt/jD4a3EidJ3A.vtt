00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.680
When you discussed the cosmos,

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.710
maybe the single most intriguing possibility to us as human beings is what other

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.490
intelligent life,
if any,
is out there.

4
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:16.170
And how interesting is that to you because you spent so much time studying the

5
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:18.780
fundamental particles of the universe itself.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.080
How interested are you in the possibility of other intelligent life forms or

7
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:28.230
have you just like put that out into the,

8
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:33.231
it's just so ridiculously unlikely or so far away from us that we're probably

9
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:34.950
never going to make contact.

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
So there's this Seti program looking at to see where they can see signals from

11
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.080
listening to civilizations.

12
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.210
The problem there from my perspective is that although they might be out there,

13
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.160
they've got to have a real headstart on us before you receive them and they

14
00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:58.000
might have done so.
But then,
I dunno,
is he actually vi?

15
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.050
He goes to John Who's my Armenian Connie and who looked also for these ring

16
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.110
shaped things and looked at them in a different way from the Polish people.

17
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.410
But um,
we seem to have seen something there.

18
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:15.411
But we wrote a paper in which we speculated on beings from the previous Ian

19
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.870
communicating with us.

20
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.160
And the advantage there is that you're looking at the really advanced

21
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:25.360
civilizations,
really very energy.

22
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.620
See billions of years ago that they,

23
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.650
their universe disappeared and then had to come back to a big bank.

24
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:39.960
State signals could come through somehow or another,
those signals,
Romain.

25
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:44.290
It's conceivable it,
I agree it's pretty far fetched,
but you know who knows what.

26
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.520
So how many billions of years are,

27
00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:51.000
you're talking about like the big bang 14 billion.
Yes.

28
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.650
But you see that's way,
way at the beginning in a sense.

29
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:57.180
Or it's three quarters of the way through.

30
00:01:57.181 --> 00:02:00.410
And in another sense it depends on how you draw the picture,
right?

31
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.750
In a sense of interestingness or in the conformal picture.

32
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.010
We are already three quarters of the way through.
So 14 billion to now.

33
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:13.520
So we have how much content is years.

34
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.880
You see the trouble is it's a cheat to cheat the year count.

35
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.840
It's as much as you like.
It depends on the on,
on something else.

36
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.540
The mass has to fade out.

37
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:29.541
And how you measure the time it becomes problematic and it's either infinity you

38
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:30.451
see,

39
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:35.451
which isn't much use or you might have a different definitions of time,

40
00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:37.620
which depending on what particle you're using,

41
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:38.970
it's your clocks and things like that.

42
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.260
So are you essentially saying that it's entirely possible that we are the

43
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.000
furthest in terms of our technological achievement and our understanding of the

44
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:51.220
universe itself?
It's possible that we're at the front of the line.

45
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.240
There might be some other intelligent life forms in the universe,

46
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.520
but they might be behind us.
Well,
they would have been mean.

47
00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:00.190
I'm not saying they got through,
you say,

48
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:02.470
well maybe they have techniques for getting through,
but that's,

49
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.780
that's a bit hard to imagine.
But um,
maybe information from them,

50
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.910
McGee it through and maybe you mean from the previous els?
Yes.

51
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.660
They might have got through like somehow or another survived.
Yes.

52
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.130
But it would have to be in the form of photons or something.
Yeah.
No it's not.

53
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.950
I'm talking about ridiculous speculate.
Sure.

54
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.230
In coding information to photons.
Yes.
Yes.
Wow.
It's conceivable.

55
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.590
I don't want to say that I,
I see it happening or anything,

56
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:34.591
but it's not under the question that they could develop some technology which

57
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:36.400
would get information,

58
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:41.401
which might be them in some sense a across in the form of photons.

59
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.220
But you're not optimistic about current intelligent life somewhere in the

60
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:49.210
universe.
Not too optimistic.
Just because,

61
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.273
um,

62
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.330
well maybe it took us a long time to get going because the dinosaurs were there

63
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:58.990
for a while and somebody might've gotten in there earlier and they're different

64
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:03.220
planets and they could've got there quite ahead of us.
It's,
it's conceivable.

65
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:07.960
I'm not going to rule it out.
I just not terribly optimistic about it.
No,

66
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:10.720
I think it's worth doing.
It's worth looking.
Yes,

67
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:13.610
but it's not something that you're really not sure I'm expecting.
It's not,

68
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.440
it's not so much.
I'd be curious certainly,
but I'm not expecting it,
I guess.

69
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:22.710
Is it just because of the overall lack of real evidence and it's just not an

70
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:27.370
attractive thing for you to pursue?
It's quite attractive.

71
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.660
It's short.
You know,

72
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.460
I've just been doing other things and I don't know there's enough to do in the

73
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:34.294
world.

74
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.110
I had some really come to terms that very hugely,

75
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:44.920
so I know there's this activity.
I'd be interested to see if any kind of,

76
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.873
you know,
if this,

77
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.220
there was this thing that came past that some people speculated was sent there

78
00:04:50.221 --> 00:04:52.600
by a different intelligence,

79
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.520
which came quite close in our solar system.
Oh,
that was that strange looking,

80
00:04:57.521 --> 00:05:00.340
this trailer shape.
Yes,
that's right.
Yeah.
I mean,

81
00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:04.600
I don't see any real reason to believe it's a alien specific because of the way

82
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:09.160
it was traveling though was the idea was something that I was curious about it.

83
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.640
See,

84
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.140
people did suggest it might be something sent by an alien civilization waste.

85
00:05:14.141 --> 00:05:18.850
So it's worth,
even if one could make connect with it in some way,

86
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.520
but I don't know.
I guess it's too far away now.
Well,

87
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.330
it's another thing that's so uniquely fascinating for us,

88
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.010
the concept of sale of another,
of another life form out there.
Oh,
sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
