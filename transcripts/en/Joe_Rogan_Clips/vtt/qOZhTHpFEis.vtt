1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.800
The joe rogan experience.
Yeah,
you,
you,
you become,
you,

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:08.580
you don't trust in the way you view things anymore.
You're boxed in.

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.850
It's very dangerous to be committed to something you know,
is not true.

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.440
It also shows it a lot too because when he got these geniuses who spent their

5
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:19.530
entire lives doing too in this stuff and astrophysics,

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.700
you're telling me that they're part of the scheme to,
and they believe that it's,

7
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.520
you know,
this is 100% of the problem.
100%.

8
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.770
It's adopting an idea too soon.
That's 100% of the idea because once you,

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.460
once you adopt that idea and then you hang on to it,
now you're fucked.

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.340
Like big foot mat.
Big Foot was a big one for me.
I was,

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.570
I was convinced I was real with you.
How long ago was this?

12
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.520
A couple of weeks now when I
not when I know to you.
Um,

13
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.670
yeah man,
when I did this TV show,
that's when I totally let it go.

14
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.230
I'd kind of let it go before then,

15
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:57.231
but Duncan and I actually went to the Pacific northwest and we went to hang out

16
00:00:57.331 --> 00:01:00.330
with like real big foot experts.
It was searching for big foot all the time.

17
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.740
When you say real big foot at x,
what you mean con artists?
No,

18
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.070
it's not that way.

19
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.030
I described him as unfuckable white dudes who have nothing to do.
There's just,

20
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.960
they're just a bunch of fellows.
We decided to call ourself a rap band.

21
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.450
We're going to call ourselves a UFW D fuckable white.

22
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.820
You didn't find in out there in Pacific fighting shit,
fat camp spots.

23
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.980
A lot of spent shells and beer cans laying around.
You're better than that Joe.

24
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.330
No,
this is what I found out.

25
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.200
People want to believe in things and once you want to believe in something

26
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.630
instead of looking at it objectively and going,
wow,

27
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:38.631
I'm not sure you like automatically go towards any information that would point

28
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:42.210
to the fact that the thing is real,
not to the whole body of information.

29
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.210
Look well how crazy these people when you meet the people that believe in

30
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.480
bigfoot,
the blends that have seen it,
the ones that had claimed to scene it,

31
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.310
almost all of 'em were clearly lying in a law in a little like out of it let it

32
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:56.670
was one lane spectrum maybe.
Yeah,
but it just,

33
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.870
some people are just liars.
They can't help it.

34
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:03.000
They make stories up to make themselves feel better.

35
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.070
Like they just crazy and you,
you,

36
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:07.650
you can't really say it to their face cause you don't really know.

37
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.420
But sometimes it just gets ridiculous.

38
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.560
And this one lady was one of the only ones that didn't seem like that.

39
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.310
This one lady was telling me a story about how she was going through the woods

40
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.110
and she saw some big thing that was standing up and it was like seven feet tall

41
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.130
and it was moving through the woods and uh,
she saw this thing and she was like,

42
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.570
oh my God,
it's an ape.

43
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.320
And then she realized it was big foot and she saw it for a few steps and then it

44
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:32.154
was gone.

45
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.220
At the time I was fascinated at the time I was like,
maybe she really did see it,

46
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.640
but now I know for a fact,
an absolute fact that where she lived,

47
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.650
there's a lot of black bears and black bears will often walk on their hind legs.

48
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.640
They'll walk like big foot.
They really do.
There's many,
many,
many,
many videos.

49
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.460
I've seen it with my own two eyes.

50
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.730
I saw a bear walked for several,
like six,
seven,

51
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.620
maybe even 10 steps on its hind legs roaring at another bear.

52
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:08.050
And they were going to fight with each other and they fought with Joe standing

53
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:12.550
up.
They went after each other dope.
But dude,
he walked towards him like that.

54
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.820
Look at that does look like they do that.
So that bear,

55
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.090
this is a bear that had injured pause and sometimes they'll get their pod bid

56
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:22.834
off in a fight.

57
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.680
They Duke it out with each other or maybe they get caught in a trap.
You know,

58
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:30.160
some fucking assholes.
It set traps out there for the forced to walk like that.

59
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.200
They buy back their own foot off to get out of a trap then that's real man.
They,

60
00:03:34.201 --> 00:03:36.010
they,
they get wolves that way.

61
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.080
They catch them and traps [inaudible] traps are scary shit.
But these animals,

62
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.520
you know when they get a hurt paw they'll walk on their back legs like big foot.

63
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.080
So she probably saw some shit moving through the woods.
Like community shit.

64
00:03:49.081 --> 00:03:52.180
Yeah Dude,
they just stand there.
That's terrifying.
I know.

65
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.400
And they can walk like that.
That's terrifying.

66
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:58.780
But it's clearly not a fucking big fight.
You Moron.
No,
no,
no.

67
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.590
See you say that.
But Dude,
I'm telling you when you're in the Pacific northwest,

68
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:07.420
you cannot see 15 yards in front of you.
Dunkin and I were talking about it,

69
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.800
cause you know we had a hang out up there and go wandering through the woods

70
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:13.960
where like if there was something right there,

71
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.110
like five trees away and then it moved into the back,

72
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:21.370
how long would it take for disappeared through steps.
Three steps.
It's so dense,

73
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:24.790
dude.
It's like a Q tip box.
You know,
you get q-tips out of a box.

74
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.290
So many of them,
this is no gaps in between these trees.

75
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.180
Have you been to the Pacific northwest?

76
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.350
I'm the rain forest and I've ever been in there.
I mean I was drunk,

77
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.870
drove through it.
It's amazing.
It's amazing.
And here's the other thing about it.

78
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:40.540
It's all pine needles so that you don't even make any noise.

79
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.040
But I would see a standing figure like that in,
in my educated Bray.
And I go,

80
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.780
oh that's a fucking giant bear.
No,

81
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:50.020
because you'd be looking at a hill like a hundred yards away.

82
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.780
And he would see this thing walk through the tree standing up.
And you'd be like,

83
00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:54.490
what in the fuck was that?
And then it's gone.

84
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.820
So then your imagination starts running wild and your imagination starts filling

85
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.560
in the blanks.
I don't think it's a coincidence.
The higher none for sure.

86
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:05.320
Your high,
well then I'd probably think you're in Seattle,
man.
Okay,

87
00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:07.870
then why would you not be high?
But you're eating mushrooms.

88
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.090
Your highest fuck all on shrooms.

89
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.330
Everybody up there on terms and that's a walking Brown Unicorn.

90
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.680
You're walking down this road in the forest and you see something that's in the

91
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:21.370
woods and you see it briefly a hundred yards away for three or four steps.

92
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.190
Your brain starts filling in the blanks and you get excited.

93
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:28.750
You saw fucking big foot and I will go to my grave knowing what I saw that day

94
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.130
and everybody wants to be special,

95
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.980
so everybody wants to pretend he saw a giant monkey in the woods,

96
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.420
but when you really talk to them,

97
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.400
that was the only lady I knew that wasn't lying to me.
She saw something she has.

98
00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:42.910
She thought it was big for shit.
It was standing.
If I had a guess,

99
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.800
if I had some money to bet,
I would bet almost 100% what she saw was a bear.

100
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.590
You did the show and after coming back from that show you like,

101
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:53.650
you know what big foot's bullshit and it's the same feeling I got talking to

102
00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:57.040
everybody.
Psychic readers,
same feeling.

103
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.870
Got talking to UFO experts.
Same feeling.
I got to,

104
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:03.230
everybody wants to believe everybody wants to do you a full I can.

105
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.450
Flux with the Ufo makes sense to me.
This,

106
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:08.660
there's so many kind of sure you x factors there.

107
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:12.350
I can buy a u f so it could be real.
It could be real big flood.
Come on.

108
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.400
Here's the thing about big foot.

109
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:17.810
The reason why it's so attractive is because it used to be a real animal.

110
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.140
100% it was a thing called gigantic [inaudible].

111
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.150
They didn't know about gigantic Pythagoras until I believe it was the 1920s they

112
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:31.151
found a tooth of this primate in an apothecary shop in China and they were like,

113
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:34.790
what the fuck is this it?
Yeah.

114
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:37.310
They were selling it and someone found another tooth and they said,
oh,

115
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:37.671
there's another,

116
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:41.240
and the the primatologist who check it out that that was a real animal cod.
Yeah.

117
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.360
Tog
eight foot tall,

118
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.450
gigantic orangutan looking thing.
It still doesn't look like a human.

119
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.940
And they rang Tang family.
No,
no,
no dude,
it doesn't,
well,

120
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:55.540
big foot's supposed to look like that.
Oh really?
Supposed to look like.
Yeah.

121
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.870
It's not supposed to be where you're human was like a hero.

122
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.330
There's a photo of a man standing next to a proportionate man.

123
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.050
The average size man standing next to which I can't go pick his statue.

124
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.200
See if you could find that in there.
I know it's in there.

125
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.290
Pick up this [inaudible].
Yeah,
that's it.
That was how big it was.

126
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.600
So that was a real animal.

127
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.660
100% now they're not 100% sure that it walked on two legs,

128
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.280
but they're pretty sure.
And the reason why is the shape of the teeth,

129
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.130
that animals that walk on their hind legs,

130
00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:31.370
animals that walk upright have a different shape to their jaw.

131
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.530
So that's what they've found.

132
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.640
It looks like you found a job bone and they found some teeth and they found it

133
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.870
like all on the same site,

134
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.210
and then they realize that they're dealing with a totally different animal.

135
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.640
He was around how long ago?
10,000 years ago.

136
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.230
So this thing existed somewhere in the neighborhood of,
I think that's right.

137
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.280
Wait a minute,
that might be wrong.

138
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.360
I think I'm thinking of the Flores man was the hobbit man,

139
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.900
the little three foot tall dude.
That dude was like 10 14,000 years ago.

140
00:07:56.901 --> 00:07:59.000
That was really soon.
Yeah.
Like really recently.

141
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:01.520
Definitely lived alongside people.
This might be 100,000.

142
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.440
What makes it attractive though is where that thing lived is exactly where all

143
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:14.051
the animals cam across the Bering land bridge that connected Asia to North

144
00:08:14.151 --> 00:08:18.380
America.
So this Bering land bridge was where they think everything came across.

145
00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:19.980
Short face bear,
even people.

146
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:30.090
Okay.
