1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.770
Where are wounded society and where am it's dysfunctionality is now becoming a

2
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:09.260
parent,
you know,
through the political situations.
I mean,
I,

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.920
I am baffled by,
uh,
you know,

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.180
a government,
a president who basically likes to hurt people.
I mean,

5
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.770
that seems to be,
it.
It's this culture of cruelty,
cruelty that has been,

6
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.150
that has been created and,
uh,

7
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.160
well particularly if he feels slighted,
you know,

8
00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:32.660
he wants to come back at you extra hard.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it,

9
00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:36.570
it's a reflection of probably of his childhood trauma.
I mean,

10
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:39.600
I think his father was very abusive.
Now he's,

11
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:44.460
it's his chance to get revenge,
you know?
And I mean,
he's the guy who,

12
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:47.230
Kim,
what's that?
When you love to take him for a trip?

13
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.020
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.360
<v 0>You know,
I don't think it would do any good,
really.</v>

15
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.670
I don't think it would do when they could.
Why not?

16
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.050
Cause I don't think there's a moral,
I don't think there's a core there.
You know,

17
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.420
my,
uh,
I mean,
I would certainly,
I don't think it would help him.

18
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.640
The Cure.
And Daryl,
I've worst work,
most with Said told me,
you know,

19
00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:10.370
there are two kinds of people I will not give Iowasca too.

20
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.870
One is sociopath's and the other is schizophrenia.

21
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.100
Trump is a sociopath,
you know,

22
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:20.460
he has no interior.

23
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:24.380
He's never had a reflective moment in his life.
That's,

24
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.040
that's what concerns me.
It's all external.
You know,

25
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.590
he's like pure Id.
You know,

26
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:33.200
he is a a six year old,

27
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.580
<v 1>an angry six year old.</v>

28
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.030
If we met him at 16 would you have hope for his future or do you,

29
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.360
I mean when as a person beyond reproach or beyond help.
Like what,

30
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:46.200
what is the year?

31
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.750
So we have this idea in our minds that when a certain age is reached that a

32
00:01:50.751 --> 00:01:54.670
person is just firmly established and there's no more growth.
Yeah.
You know,

33
00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:57.880
you see someone who's a 60 year old fool that's a dying fool.

34
00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:01.600
He's going to be a full till his last day on this planet.
Why is that though?

35
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.630
Why don't we just assume that someone lives a certain life,

36
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.020
has a certain amount of time here that the,
they're not going to learn.

37
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.520
Is it just because of our own past experiences with these types of people or are

38
00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:15.680
we imposing a limitation on their growth?
I,

39
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.300
I'm very curious about that because we do do that.

40
00:02:19.301 --> 00:02:21.740
We assume that if someone fucks up and they're 20,
we'll there,

41
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:23.860
they'll get better.
They'll,
they're going to evolve.

42
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.860
If they fuck up when they're 70,
were like,
that guy's a goner.

43
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.640
<v 0>Well,
we make that assumption.
Yeah.
You know,
and it may not be true.
I mean,</v>

44
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:35.770
it's not fair.
I don't think the way it's not fair.
Um,
I mean,

45
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.850
especially now what we're learning.
Um,

46
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.400
the other thing that psychedelics do that is kind of a new thing that we're

47
00:02:42.401 --> 00:02:44.890
learning is neuroplasticity.
Yes.

48
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.660
It actually reorganizes connections in the brain.
You know,

49
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.690
siliciden does this and presumably the others,
the others do too.

50
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.650
Some of the [inaudible] means do it.
Um,
so that's a new thing.

51
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.220
You know,
you can actually change the,

52
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.020
the con activity of these systems.

53
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.690
That's probably not fair to say.
I mean,
I mean,
my friend who came with me,
he,

54
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.540
he made a point when we were discussing this,
he says,
you know,

55
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.470
you shouldn't hate Trump.
You know,
he's used to that.

56
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.320
You should love Trump.
I said,

57
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.200
it's real hard for me to love Trump,
but,

58
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.860
but I think the point that he's making is that he is,

59
00:03:27.861 --> 00:03:31.520
Trump is not the cause of it.
In some way.
He's the,

60
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.140
he's the symptom of,
of what's happening and he's,
he's the disruptor,

61
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.180
but the disruption is happening anyway.
And,
and so in some ways,

62
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.930
maybe we should be grateful to Trump because he's,
he's making,
you know,
he's,

63
00:03:45.931 --> 00:03:48.660
he's making it so in everybody's face that,

64
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.980
that people are questioning everything and that's,

65
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.800
that's a good thing because the system,
it can't last,
you know,

66
00:03:57.801 --> 00:04:02.801
so there's going to be a transition that's going to be pretty rough and Trump is

67
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.150
just part of that.
Not In any conscious way.
He's as much the victim of,

68
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.250
of the Times as anybody else.
And expectation that has,

69
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.560
the president has his finger on the nuclear button and a few other inconvenient

70
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.200
things.
Otherwise,
he would just be dismissed.
You know,

71
00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:22.730
it was an old cranky old

72
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.080
<v 1>guy.
The television,
he was fun before this,</v>

73
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.880
I guess.
Yeah.
I mean,
before this he was your fired,
you know,
he was the,

74
00:04:31.881 --> 00:04:36.170
the rich guy with his name on the big buildings.
Right.
He was a caricature,

75
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.560
you know,
he wasn't,
it wasn't what he is now.

76
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.230
What he is now is he's show,

77
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.130
he's exploited this vulnerability and the political system that we essentially a

78
00:04:47.131 --> 00:04:51.010
popularity contest that choose our rulers.
And the idea of that,

79
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.350
and at first was to pick the best one based on public perception,

80
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.630
but that's not what it is anymore.

81
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.900
Now it's like we are so jaded as to how well this system works and as to what

82
00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:07.520
significant and important about it.
And we just want our guy to win.

83
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.320
Now it's our guy and Hillary,
Hillary represented the bureaucrats.

84
00:05:12.321 --> 00:05:16.070
She represented the red tape and the career politicians,
the one,

85
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.540
the proven liars,

86
00:05:17.541 --> 00:05:22.040
the ones who were starting these Clinton foundations and making hundreds of

87
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.950
millions of dollars and giving these speeches and making hundreds of thousands

88
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.950
dollars talking to bankers but won't release any of the transcripts.
And Hey,

89
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.980
now if we got to drain the swamp and this guy was our guy to drain the swamp for

90
00:05:33.021 --> 00:05:35.740
the people that voted for him,
you know,
and this is,
um,

91
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.090
and then he came on and it turns out he is,

92
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.770
the swamp is in escapable system is completely broken.
I don't think,

93
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.040
I mean I certainly don't think if we elected Hillary,

94
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.720
<v 0>it would all be good.
It would still be a mass.
But,
uh,</v>

95
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.790
but the problem with Trump is,
you know,

96
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.990
he's immune to facts for one thing and the I,

97
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.520
the man is obviously diluted,
possibly demented,

98
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.060
certainly a social path.
I mean,
and,

99
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.380
and very impulsive.
And this is not,
you need,
you know,

100
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.450
this is not the person you need to be leading the western world because,

101
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.370
because he's not reflective.
He's not.
It's all response.

102
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.570
You know,
this is,
this is the petulant six year old aspect of it.

103
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.480
He sees something and he reacts immediately.

104
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:30.740
There's no thought that intervenes and he's often said that about his business

105
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:34.580
deals.
He doesn't plan things.
He just goes on.
It's not that great a businessman.

106
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:37.280
If you look back on,
if you look at his business deals,

107
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:41.840
that's the same with this Korea thing.
I mean if he can pull that off,

108
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.430
more power to him but I'll bet you it's not going to go anywhere.

109
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.460
Cause you know Kim Jong noon and the Chinese who are behind it,

110
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.640
they are very smart and they,

111
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.260
they basically realized this guy is a buffoon and they will be able to make a

112
00:06:59.261 --> 00:07:04.000
show on the world stage but they won't give up anything and people are already

113
00:07:04.001 --> 00:07:07.600
saying this.
What did he actually come away with?
Nothing.

114
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.950
Some vague mumblings about denuclearization we've had that before.

115
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.150
<v 1>Well it was unprecedented to see the leader of North Korea and South Korea meet</v>

116
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.400
at the DMZ and shake hands and trap was traveled.
That was on precedent.

117
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.330
That was pretty fascinating.
That was pretty fast.

118
00:07:22.331 --> 00:07:27.130
I think that's progress in some way and maybe his lunacy needs leads to

119
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.700
inadvertent progress or,
I mean maybe it's some sort of a,

120
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:36.270
I mean is people are many things he can't be entirely foolish.

121
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.040
There's probably a method to is Matt,
he never lost all of his money.

122
00:07:41.041 --> 00:07:45.070
You know what I'm saying?
I mean he really has been at least marginally success.

123
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.630
Pretty early.
Success has gone bankrupt a few times.

124
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.200
But the point is that this is a guy that um,

125
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.980
he's probably pretty complex as much as he is crazy.

126
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.660
It's probably also pretty complex.

127
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.160
Some of that might benefit us because we have this fucked up system that's

128
00:08:02.161 --> 00:08:05.650
undeniably fucked up.
It says right.
It's just a terrible idea though.

129
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.850
And it was an idea that was constructed,
you know,

130
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.180
in 1776 when it made sense back then it was the low,

131
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:16.830
a great solution to the problems of the times.
But we don't live in those times.

132
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.950
No,
we don't live in those times.
Equally complicated times.

133
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.200
<v 0>And also we didn't have the media situation that we have now.</v>

134
00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:29.090
I mean this,
this is also part of the problem,
you know,

135
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:32.120
with the social media and everything,
it's true.

136
00:08:32.121 --> 00:08:36.070
There's [inaudible] of fake news out there being produced on both.

137
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:40.360
You cannot tell.
So you've,
you've got the Trump,
uh,

138
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.650
you know,
reality distortion field,
right.

139
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:48.690
Which is reinforced by his really no pretense about ignoring what's real.

140
00:08:51.301 --> 00:08:54.920
You know,
like this whole controversy about,

141
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.260
about the immigration and splitting up families will say,
well,

142
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:01.250
we're just enforcing the law,
but in fact,
you know,

143
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.630
at the stroke of a pen he could change that.

144
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:08.370
And we didn't enforce it that way before,
but so he's changed that,
you know,

145
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.880
<v 1>it's just,
just change.
Just caved in and now he's,
yeah,
he just,</v>

146
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.340
the families together supposedly nice.

147
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.410
It least that he's doing that like listening to public opinion and the outcry

148
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:22.070
has reached him and he's reacted.
Yeah,

149
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.740
<v 0>but this is my car.
It's not that he cares about these children or a,
or,
you know,</v>

150
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.190
how many people has he already traumatized as a result of this?

151
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:36.690
But yeah,
I'm glad he changed it,
but I'm sure that was a cynical decision.

152
00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:41.070
Has Advisors said,
look,
look,
Donald,
you know you're about to go to a,

153
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.700
if I have to go to a rally in Duluth,
I honestly think it's coming from,

154
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:48.930
those folks are not going to like this.
I think it's coming from his wife.

155
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:53.710
This is going around today.
This is a jacket she wore to a,
Oh,

156
00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.220
what she say?
It says,
I really don't care.
Do you?
Yeah.

157
00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:02.170
And this was to a meeting of day like immigration.
Yeah.
Kids.
The kids.

158
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:02.970
Yeah.

159
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:03.870
<v 1>What is that?
Is that,</v>

160
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:07.410
but is that some fashion jacket that she wore to that event?

161
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:12.590
What a stupid fucking thing to where I really don't care.
Do you?
Yeah,

162
00:10:12.591 --> 00:10:15.990
I care.
Yeah,
I do care.
But what are we talking about?

163
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.930
What an bizarre open ended question.

164
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.400
I really don't care about what the tone deaf fitness of these people,

165
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.330
they have no sensitivity shoots.
How?

166
00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:30.690
Look critic though of separating children from their families and she actually

167
00:10:30.691 --> 00:10:34.260
made a surprise visit to the Mexican border today to check on it.

168
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.700
See what's going on.
Good for her.
Good.
Well,
she's an immigrant.
I mean,

169
00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:41.250
this is the irony of the whole thing.
She barely speaks English.

170
00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:46.200
The whole thing is so bizarre is that his own wife is a fucking immigrant.

171
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:50.610
I mean,
clearly the whole thing is crazy.
It's,
it's really strange.

172
00:10:50.611 --> 00:10:54.690
But that jacket,
right?
This is what,
this is the sign of the simulation.

173
00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:56.130
If you considered the simulation theory.

174
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:02.450
<v 0>Yes.
Real might be real.
I mean,</v>

175
00:11:02.451 --> 00:11:07.040
sometimes I do wonder,
I mean,
it's like,
it's like reality.

176
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.700
Whatever we choose to call it is becoming so weird.

177
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.740
I often ask myself,

178
00:11:13.741 --> 00:11:17.910
who is writing this shit and can't they give me a better writer?
