Hello Freak bitches.
That whole system.
You've never been divorced,
right?

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.220
I have.
You know,
as soon as you enter it,

3
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:12.720
you see right away that the whole thing is stacked against us and it's,
this is,

4
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:16.290
you know,
it's just look into it.
If you don't believe me,

5
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.970
I mean you have to basically friends and I went to a mile this divorce,

6
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:25.020
I mean my ex wife was as as easy on me as you could be,

7
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.341
but nonetheless,

8
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:30.420
I ended up paying a lot more child support than she really deserved.
And very,

9
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:33.630
but not a lot.
I mean,
but it was a lot of men.
Oh,
in fact,

10
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:36.390
you would do have a friend just happened to I think,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

11
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:39.840
You go into these courtrooms and it's basically down to a judge as to a friend

12
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:41.870
who has to pay alimony for the rest of his life.
Yeah.

13
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.320
He was married for 12 years.

14
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:47.070
He's been divorced for 14 he still has to pay his ex wife.

15
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.260
He's married to a new woman.
He has a new family.

16
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.950
He didn't even have kids with this woman.
He has to pay her forever and forever.

17
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.040
Imagine if till she dies.
Imagine if they had kids.
He'd fucked her so hard.

18
00:00:56.041 --> 00:01:00.030
She can't work anymore forever.
How about that?

19
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.600
[inaudible] that's a crazy lot to say about that,
but yeah,
but uh,

20
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.570
that's a crazy law and they have,
when there's kids involved,
right?
Forget it.

21
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:08.790
That that's a very sexist law by the way,

22
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.000
because that's law is implying that this woman is incapable of making it on her

23
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.710
own.
Thank you.
By definition,

24
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:17.550
it's antifeminist antifeminist and it is sexist and it's patriarchal.

25
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.550
It's totally patriarchal.
Women who support it,

26
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.250
they're supporting it because they don't like men.
I mean,

27
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:25.870
that literally would lose what it is.
Who knows?
I don't know about,
listen,

28
00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:27.090
if you're supporting a woman,

29
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.060
never having to work again because she married a guy for a certain amount of

30
00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:32.610
time,
like relationships come and go.

31
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:34.920
People get tired of each other and people have the right to change.

32
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.040
You shouldn't be financially obligated to take care of someone for the rest of

33
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:41.880
their life just because you were married at one point in time.
That's crazy.

34
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.631
Completely agree with you.

35
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:47.220
Especially in today's Day and age where my friend is 54 I think he is now.

36
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.540
He could live to be a hundred so what the fuck he's got to pay for her for

37
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:55.770
another 46 years.
That's insanity.
Phenomenal.
Yeah,
but again,
that's,

38
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.270
I agree with you completely,
but what you said just then about it being sexist,

39
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:04.800
it is.
That's a radical concept that hasn't even,
I think,

40
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:07.410
registered with most people and if many people heard it,

41
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:10.440
they would think you are a sexist yourself for saying it,
but you know what?

42
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.440
It is inescapable that that's what's going on that says I'm against men is very

43
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:17.920
common.
It's sexism against women too.

44
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.000
That's what we're also saying and that's the radical part of this,
right?

45
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.480
It's actually patriarchal in the most fundamental sense,

46
00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:28.080
which is that the court is saying that the man should be the provider.

47
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.940
I'm going to tell you a story.
There's a woman in Florida who was,

48
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.630
is a bit in my act and I'm doing now.
It's a true story.

49
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.480
There's a woman in Florida was a cop.
She was 25 years old.

50
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:41.130
She pretended to be a high school student and she's attractive woman,

51
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.420
made friends with this boy.

52
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:45.970
He thought it was his girlfriend and she talked him into selling her pot and

53
00:02:45.971 --> 00:02:46.804
then she arrested him.

54
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.160
That only works when you have a 17 year old boy and a 25 year old woman.

55
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.060
If you had a 25 year old man throwing dick,
your 17 year old daughter,

56
00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:00.070
and then he gets her to sell him pot and then

57
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.701
<v 1>he arrests.</v>

58
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:04.690
Or there would be people lining the fucking street with torches to kill that
guy.

59
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.240
But people are sexist against boys.

60
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:10.720
They fill that boy should just keep it in his pants.
That boy should know better.

61
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.730
And you know as well as I know when you're 17 years old,
you are uh,

62
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.770
baffled bag of hormones with a boner just running through the world trying to

63
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:22.630
figure out what the fuck's going on and you're 12 months away from being an

64
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:24.040
adult.
It's chaos.

65
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:28.390
It's craziness to end to think that this young boy cause should be able to think

66
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:32.560
clearly in that moment while there's 25 year old woman has manipulating him is

67
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:36.670
insane.
But they allowed it.
And this kid has a felony on his fucking record

68
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.510
<v 0>right now.
Yup.
This is,</v>

69
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.920
this is the root of the issue with feminism.

70
00:03:42.921 --> 00:03:45.440
That is current feminism.
It's its current incarnation.

71
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.390
I am a feminist by the way.
How dare you can define that.
Leave now,
sir.
Uh,

72
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.640
but how much is being egalitarian?
Yeah,

73
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.740
well that's okay.
I'm not that either.

74
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.230
I'm not an egalitarian,
but,
um,
you're not,
no.
Oh,
hold on.
Too many topics at once.

75
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.890
Jesus Christ.
We go off a lot of branches here.
I know.
It's,
I love it.
Um,

76
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.151
where was I going?
Oh,

77
00:04:08.151 --> 00:04:11.030
this is what you did was you identified and I think actually we,

78
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.210
I talked about this the first time I was here,
which is that,
you know,

79
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.971
this is what's,

80
00:04:13.971 --> 00:04:18.971
to me at the heart of this is the appalling irony at the heart of contemporary

81
00:04:21.321 --> 00:04:25.370
feminism as practice by self-defined feminists.
Okay.
Many,

82
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.820
not all guys.
I'm not general.
I'm not saying all feminists are like this,

83
00:04:28.821 --> 00:04:31.520
but I'd say it's certainly it's the dominant strain right now,

84
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.150
which is that it is at its heart patriarchal,

85
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.100
which it treats women as vulnerable,
weak,

86
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.730
powerless,
incapable of making their own way in this world and uh,

87
00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:49.220
treats men as the not just forget about the men.
Forget about how they treat men.

88
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.220
It's how they treat women that's sexist.

89
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.480
It says that they need protection from the state,

90
00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.100
which is run by usually men,
but it's also this other institution or you know,

91
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.340
college presidents need to protect these women from 19 year old boys who want to

92
00:05:06.471 --> 00:05:08.000
have sex with them.
Same thing.

93
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.470
They're constantly calling for women to be protected by these institutions.

94
00:05:12.471 --> 00:05:16.670
The state by men.
It is patriarchal and sexist right at the,

95
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:17.563
at the heart of it.

96
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.500
And same thing with family court and divorce law and all that stuff.

97
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.370
That's how they get treated.

98
00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:27.371
They get treated like they're the ones who need to be taken care of by a man.

99
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.690
It is,
it's like 1950s sexism.
It's like madmen sexism.

100
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.630
That's what,
that's what most feminists are calling for now.

101
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.090
<v 1>Well,
I disagree when you talking about child rearing because I think that</v>

102
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.580
<v 0>child support is,</v>

103
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.430
<v 1>should be absolutely mandatory and it's very important.</v>

104
00:05:46.431 --> 00:05:50.030
And if a woman is the only one raising the kids on their own,

105
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.970
not only does she need the money for food and housing,

106
00:05:52.971 --> 00:05:56.600
but also probably for someone to babysit her kids.
There's a lot,

107
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.580
a lot of factors involved and totally agree.

108
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.210
And if the man's not in the scene like yeah,
he owes money.
Yeah,

109
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.150
for sure.
He has a responsibility.
And as a father,
at the very least,

110
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.030
that's,
you should,
what you should be doing is contributing financially.

111
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.030
I totally agree.
I totally agree.
But not oppose.
My problem is alimony.

112
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.710
Alimony's weird.
Yeah.
That makes no sense at all.
It's weird.
Well,
it's,

113
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.440
I don't think it's a bad thing if someone like say,
how about this?
Say,
um,

114
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.433
let's turn around.

115
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.530
Say you had a wife who was wealthy and she was taking care of you while you're

116
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.000
going through school and she promised that she was going to fund you all the way

117
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:37.160
through your phd program.
She was going to give you money.

118
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:39.380
So you didn't have to worry about anything but your education.

119
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.320
And then once you got out,
then you guys could share income.

120
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.220
But somewhere along the way she decided she was done with you and then you're

121
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:48.560
fucked.
But during the middle of this program that you have to pay for,

122
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.310
I don't think it's unreasonable to say that she should give you until you can

123
00:06:53.311 --> 00:06:57.770
figure your own system out so you don't have to quit your phd program and go get

124
00:06:57.771 --> 00:07:01.820
a job somewhere and get an apartment and a car.
I don't think that's,

125
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.250
that's it.
I don't think that's unreasonable.

126
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.210
What's unreasonable is saying that because you guys were together for a certain

127
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:10.720
amount of time,
she has to pay you for the rest of your life.
Sure.

128
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.960
That's insanity.
Sure.
And that's current.
That's real.
I agree.
That's the second.

129
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.010
<v 0>But should that be legal though?
So that'd be legally enforced.</v>

130
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.220
Should courts be deciding how long the alimony is paid?
Yeah,
that's crazy.

131
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.740
That's the key.
I don't know.
How has that happened?
Like what?

132
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.690
What's the motivation behind that for the courts to succumb to give into,

133
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.280
just explained it to you.
It's sexism,
it's patriarchy.
It's,
and the feminists are,

134
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.210
are playing along with it.
That's it.
It's this like,
yeah,

135
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.330
it's this idea that women can't make words though.
I mean isn't the courts,

136
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.150
aren't there?
Are a lot of men fall in those courts?
D I mean,

137
00:07:43.151 --> 00:07:46.420
why are they allowing all this stuff and most of them think basically like

138
00:07:46.421 --> 00:07:49.690
feminists or at least they,
they are expected to behave and make decisions.

139
00:07:49.691 --> 00:07:52.450
Like feminists,
feminism has become dominant in that way.

140
00:07:52.451 --> 00:07:57.110
In our culture going on for decades,
laws have existed long before feminism.

141
00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:01.300
So prevalent article,
that's my point.
It went from sexist patriarchy,
those laws.

142
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.240
Oh,
I see what you're saying.

143
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.120
So feminism is basically continuing that stuff in its name.

144
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.270
Matching up the definition.
Let me say really loud and clear.

145
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:15.220
There have always been feminists who hate this stuff as much as that you and I

146
00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:17.920
do.
Camille Paglia many,
right?

147
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.190
And they have been loud and clear about this for a long,

148
00:08:21.191 --> 00:08:23.800
long time and I love them.
And they're my heroes.
And I've learned from them,

149
00:08:23.801 --> 00:08:27.050
and this is,
I've learned these things from them.
Okay.
Um,

150
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.600
but the ones who really are powerful and dominant in the media,

151
00:08:31.601 --> 00:08:33.490
the ones we hear from the public intellectuals,

152
00:08:33.491 --> 00:08:35.470
the academics and government leaders,

153
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.670
the people who end up in the White House,
you know,

154
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.080
Obama's staff in HHS,
health and human services,
and the Department of Education,

155
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.850
it became very clear to me that all the sexual assault laws and rules that came

156
00:08:48.851 --> 00:08:50.290
out of there,
they were,

157
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.830
they were coming right out of colleges and they were really of that they were of

158
00:08:53.831 --> 00:08:55.920
the sort of college feminist movement.

159
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.360
They were the ones who set that letter in 2011 that made it basically mandatory

160
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.060
for colleges to set up these kangaroo courts for sexual abuse,

161
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.220
sexual assault cases,
all the nonsense.

162
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:08.280
You and I talked about here a couple years ago.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah,

163
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:12.930
I got anybody interested review those or earlier podcasts about your college,

164
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.590
about oxide as many colleges.
Yeah.
But you know,
there's a whole backlash now,

165
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:18.160
right?
There's a huge,
it's all turning back.

166
00:09:18.161 --> 00:09:22.170
And I knew he was going to happen right now.
They're completely being decimated.

167
00:09:22.171 --> 00:09:25.230
There's hundreds,
maybe even thousands of men who are suing in court,

168
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:27.690
and many of them are winning right now for good reason,

169
00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:30.810
because there was no due process because they weren't allowed to,
you know,

170
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.270
ask questions.
Poor boy,

171
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.290
the mattress boy or that girl put a fucking mattress on her back,

172
00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.730
drags around campus,

173
00:09:38.731 --> 00:09:42.900
and then took her graduation speech with a mattress.

174
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.230
They went on stage with a mattress.
I mean,
the whole thing was so fucking crazy.

175
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.500
Oh yeah.
My uh,
yeah.
This is fantastic.

176
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:52.710
Sex worker activist named Christine Pereira isn't Vegas.

177
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.940
She said she tweeted something like,
when that happened,
he said,
fuck you,

178
00:09:56.941 --> 00:09:59.190
mattress girl.
For those of us who've really been raped,

179
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.910
you're a fucking disgrace.
Ooh.
She went off.
It was something like that.
Yeah,

180
00:10:02.911 --> 00:10:06.610
and it was,
yeah,
but that girl seems pretty crazy.
That mattress girl.
Yeah.

181
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.120
That was an extreme example.
Then boys suing that school,

182
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.890
they're all suing and many of them are winning and I don't know what happened in

183
00:10:13.891 --> 00:10:16.380
those cases.
I don't need to know what happened in mattress girl for sure.

184
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.780
For sure.
I know that there's all kinds of evidence,
so sure.

185
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.570
Looks like it didn't happen the way she said it did.
Yeah,
no,
for sure.

186
00:10:21.571 --> 00:10:24.220
And I never will.
We will never know.
You can't know.

187
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:28.680
But what we do know for absolute sure is that there's been terrible or no due

188
00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:31.710
process in those cases.
Right.
And so that's the problem.

189
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:36.240
I mean that basically the accuser gets to win every time.

190
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.380
Imagine if that was our legal system writ large.
Right.
Joe,

191
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:43.380
you stole $1 million from yesterday.
All right.
Put Him in jail.
Right?

192
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.260
That's basically what's happening.
Exactly.
Okay.
Yeah.
Well,

193
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.480
I mean it got so crazy that even rolling stone printed a false rape case that

194
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.690
that gang rape case and Uva k staunching,

195
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.780
which is just how did a company that's been in the journalism business as long

196
00:11:00.871 --> 00:11:04.260
as they've been,
how did they fuck that up?
Yeah,
that was,

197
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.250
that was the turning point.

198
00:11:05.251 --> 00:11:07.530
I think when that came out that it was completely made up.

199
00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:10.530
I think since then it's,
it started to turn.

200
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.640
So that's good that things like that happen so that you realize why it's

201
00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:18.450
important to have checks and balances and that people had reaffirms this idea of

202
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:23.270
real journalism is important to have your facts in order to have checks and,

203
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.310
and,
and double check things and make sure,
you know,

204
00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:28.500
what the fuck you're printing.
I think it's good for society.

205
00:11:28.501 --> 00:11:32.100
I think it's terrible for John Doe all the John Doe's out there,

206
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.580
all those men who were accused and expelled and had their names ruined and their

207
00:11:35.581 --> 00:11:39.410
careers ruined,
right.
College careers destroyed and all that stuff,
right?
I think,

208
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.970
but yes,
you,
but also,
even if you're exonerated,

209
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.070
the emotional turmoil that you go through,

210
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.800
there's no way they can reward you for that.
There are,

211
00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:50.550
or compensate you for that rather.
So that,
but that is part of that whole thing,

212
00:11:50.551 --> 00:11:51.301
as I said before,

213
00:11:51.301 --> 00:11:56.301
is part of this sort of ironic feminist patriarchy.

214
00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:00.400
Yeah.
Ideology,
right.
Which is,
you know,
we need protection.
We can't,

215
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.290
we can't cause it because we can't say no to men.
We can't stop them by saying,

216
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:09.090
no,
we need,
you know,
w we,
we need help just there.
We need to do,

217
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.290
we need the college president to save us or the cops or someone.
It's,

218
00:12:12.291 --> 00:12:14.260
it's an incredible,
um,

219
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.890
well then there's this also this thing where two people are drinking and if the

220
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.200
two people are drinking,
the girl is getting raped.
There you go.
Same thing.

221
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.370
The guy's not getting rid of.

222
00:12:23.371 --> 00:12:27.010
The women are incapable of controlling themselves when they're drunk.

223
00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.940
It's sexist as hell.
Exactly.
Because the man's drunk too.
But it doesn't,

224
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.320
if somehow or another,
it doesn't matter,

225
00:12:32.321 --> 00:12:35.830
even if they're both like sending texts back and forth.
Do you have condoms?

226
00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:39.610
Like the Occidental Kitchen,
patriarchal women,
our children,

227
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.810
their daughters need to be taken care of by dad.
And the sons are men.
Yeah.

228
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.960
Even though they're just same age and they're boys.
Yeah.
Yeah.

229
00:12:46.961 --> 00:12:51.220
They have full agency.
Yeah.
And the women,
the women are daughters.
Yeah.

230
00:12:51.221 --> 00:12:52.680
It is sexist.
It's incredible.

231
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.623
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

232
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:02.570
[inaudible]
yeah.
