00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.140
Like what I take advice on whether or not an episode of game of Thrones is good

3
00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:09.030
from three people I thought were knuckleheads.

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.390
Like what if there's like three judges for TV shows?

5
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:16.600
Like well the game of Thrones finale,
you know,
I gave it an a 100 you know,

6
00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:21.500
let's go to these judges dump.
We decided it gets a 40 no fucking way,
right?

7
00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:23.610
And you go to school the next day like dude,

8
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:28.380
you hear fucking game of Thrones final got a 40 bro.
He lost it.

9
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:30.700
Got a little ridiculous at the shut your mouth

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.960
is.
Ask a couple questions.
I loved it.

11
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.870
Remember when they first escaped the white walkers?
Didn't like the water,

12
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:43.890
have something to do with it.

13
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.950
I just got on a boat and it's for some reason they can't get in water,
right?

14
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:49.630
That's the thing,
right?
Right there ice.

15
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.390
You spoiler alert in the fucking boiler at something.

16
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:58.590
Don't do something about the water.
They can't hang it.

17
00:00:58.591 --> 00:00:59.580
There was a few holes.

18
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.780
When who the fuck tied those chains around that dragon and dragged it up who

19
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:08.370
went scuba diving and and tied that dragon up?

20
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:11.250
You'd probably have to assume who had the wrong.

21
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:13.500
They're not that strong because those dudes are fucking them up.

22
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.430
They're not that strong.

23
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.700
Who's carrying those gigantic chains down there underwater?

24
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.060
Tie Up the dragon and drag it up.
Who's doing it?
Well,

25
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:23.370
they're all dead so they probably don't give a shit on the corner.

26
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.070
They couldn't go through the water.
They can't get into water.
He's right.

27
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.170
So how did they do it?
They call the big hole.
I'll accept the drag,
the accepted.

28
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.960
Very good point to drag and I can accept.

29
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.610
That's a very legitimate points when they hit the water that I don't remember.

30
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.310
I don't like water,
but they don't like it.

31
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:41.220
But to know ties to drag him from getting to ships.

32
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.070
So islands like a keep him from going to an island.

33
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:46.440
That's why these other guys are like,
fuck this.
I'm going to an island.

34
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.400
I'm going to wait on the iron island.
Right.

35
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.560
Is it possible that just slowing the things down?
They,

36
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.420
they cannot get into water for some reason.

37
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:58.380
They established that several times and then all of a sudden they cut.

38
00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:01.430
They don't,
they don't show how they tied this Goddamn.
Yeah.

39
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.390
Dragon up with the chain.

40
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.890
It's like one of those chains that you hold navy ships to port,
you know,

41
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.120
and who typed them up?
They just cut to them,
dragging them out.

42
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.240
Watching that dragon get pulled out.
I can suspend a little.
I can,

43
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.720
I can live with the inconsistency of the dead people dragging the dragon out of

44
00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:21.920
the ice water.
I can go want consistency.
I can live with that.
But I'm,

45
00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:24.840
I'm with him.
I didn't even notice that when I watched the show.

46
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.840
I didn't need that.
They went in the water and I love game of Thrones.
Ma'Am.

47
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.070
I haven't missed shut up.
That just got me fucked up.
Yeah,
they fucked up.

48
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.890
It's a big hole.
You're right.
Big.
Hello.
Goddammit.
You're right.

49
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.560
Maybe like in the last,
uh,
episodes,

50
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:40.830
they'll show how the fuck they tied that dragon up.

51
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.950
Stupid whole.
Yeah.
And did anyone catch it?

52
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.860
Do they say,
fuck it,
let's do it anyway.
What is,

53
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.080
we're led to believe that these,

54
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.060
these different kingdoms like king's landing and all that are like,

55
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.320
like for like countries away.
But man,

56
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.780
they are traveling to damn quick.

57
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.420
They get from one city to the next city there at the wall and then they meet and

58
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.760
at the snow come on in The Bahamas and then the walking over mountains like,

59
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:13.210
dude,
this can take months.
She said it's almost like,

60
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.800
it's almost like that whole kingdom is like,
like Redondo Beach,

61
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.820
West Hollywood,
north Hollywood,
Compton.

62
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.100
Do you know what I mean?
When you're talking 20 minutes?

63
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.690
Mike Perry was supposed to be Mike Perry versus a Tiago Alvarez.

64
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.210
He could get out of Florida.
Right?
Is that what he said?

65
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.260
He couldn't get out of Florida others?
Is that what happened?

66
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.250
He was stuck in Florida and my parents that we came up early,

67
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.500
so I don't want to hear that shit.
Is that really what happened?

68
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:43.540
I believe so.
Yeah.
That's terrible.

69
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.810
Do you ever think like when they show the army's walking through like fucking no

70
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:51.680
man's land,
like who's carrying the fucking food and where?
Where's the water at?

71
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.640
Hey Bro,
you're fucking my high.
When are they taking shit?

72
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.710
I always think that the budget is taking shit.
That's a good point.
Like where,

73
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.120
what kind of sewage system did they,

74
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:06.121
how bad and just walking across deserts and shot shitting in ancient Rome.

75
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:09.550
The dude's taking pisses in every scene in the background.

76
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.820
There was a big issue in ancient Rome.
Like they,

77
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.320
people got diseases cause they would shit in the streets.

78
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.150
It's let's talk about that.
Let's bring that in.

79
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.620
Make and more realistic to see more shit.
You're right man.

80
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.320
We'll see food like come on you like explain how these fuckers are eating.

81
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:26.290
I'd love to see Khaleesi dropping a deuce off the side of that fucking castle.

82
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:28.600
Have great with that.
That'd be great.
Oh Man.

83
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.380
Maybe the queen maybe like she's shots.

84
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.240
Those shots were those tight shots where they show Khaleesi on the tracking.

85
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.510
I don't remember the Superman TV show.

86
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.950
She's the mother of dragons.
You don't think she knows how to ride a dragon.

87
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.400
I was barely going and she's like holding on.

88
00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:50.380
Somebody's watching you in a Jujitsu match.
Like,
oh,
come on man.

89
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:51.920
He'd strangle that guy with his leg.

90
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.770
She got to fall off the dragon every now and someone almost want it to a drag.

91
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.160
Oh No,
that was the Harry Potter ride fall off.

92
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.550
She's got to fall off one or two once or twice.
Come on,
man.

93
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:04.860
She's just like barely grip.

94
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:08.560
I do hate those shots when they go to her riding the drag it,
it drives me nuts.

95
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.730
I know like some John Wayne shows are both gay for each other cause I thought

96
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:15.730
that was the most awesome.
I love the show.
Don't get me wrong.
I love it.

97
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.250
I love it.
What'd she was riding that dragon?

98
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.730
I was standing up cheering because it looks green screen.

99
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.130
I can drag it to look better without it.
Kind of weird.
They're all,

100
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:28.230
the rulers are women,
but what kind of some feminist shit.
Murder.

101
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.610
Just keep that murder come and I'm happy.
Look,
look,
I'll fake that Louis,
dude.

102
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.280
Come on man.
Yeah,
it's terrible.
Hold it out of that dragon.

103
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.120
Do you know how many spikes would be inside of her pussy?
Right there?
Yeah.

104
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:40.443
I mean,

105
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.680
where is it safe to stick your box?

106
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.820
You're going to ride that thing between spikes between look at the size of the

107
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:50.390
spikes.
Yeah.
Look how gross they are.

108
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.820
It's scary and pointy by disease marketing group strength.

109
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:55.680
Let's be incredible.

110
00:05:55.681 --> 00:05:59.120
It's never show her training does your grip strengths out of this world.

111
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.910
She should have like a rock climbing wall in her castle.

112
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.890
Maybe she takes on the spikes and she puts it down in her pussy,
just lamps,

113
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.270
all of it,
and that's how she goes the whole time.

114
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.740
She just has a spot she could lock in like a ball and socket joint.

115
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.910
I was this another really bad one.
Dragon's way bigger than that.
Like,
yeah,

116
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:17.744
the dragon's way.

117
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.320
Way bigger than hate the way she's holding it in your [inaudible] spiders and

118
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:25.130
right when they show the drag and sometimes it looks tremendous.
Huge.
Yeah.

119
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:27.820
This is episode that's like a Moray Eel,
right?

120
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.070
It might be smaller than it might be younger.
Oh,
that might've been earlier days.

121
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.300
Oh,
you're right.
You're right.
You're right.
You're right.
Again,
it was a big year.

122
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.910
Right?
Okay.
I'm wrong.
Did she used it to kill a bunch of people?
Men.

123
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.110
Some people know some of the last episodes.
Didn't she get out of the chain?

124
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.260
Look how big it was there.
Oh my God.
That's a full grown drag.
Okay.

125
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.020
Hold on a second.
Look at that thing.
Dude.
That's bad.

126
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.980
And moving to the dragon is amazing.
I know that motherfucker CGI,
but when that,

127
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.920
when that White Walker through that spear,
I was like,

128
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:58.670
when it missed this the first time I felt good.
I know.

129
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:05.010
I feel like it's alive leave versus got me with the Dragon Johnson versus Borg

130
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:09.890
again.
Who was a virus though,
right?
They kept him out and he's missed weed a lot.

131
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.390
Oh,
he's Ms. Wade a lot.
Ray Borg is miss wait several times.

132
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.510
And,
uh,
I don't know if he got sick while he was cutting weight,

133
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:22.250
if other people around him,
but it's just,
you know,
got you can't,

134
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:27.080
boy,
that's a big opportunity to get sick for and it can happen for sure.

135
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:31.060
But yeah,
I guess they have to do it again.

136
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.580
They already trained for it.
We'll,

137
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.640
we'll let one of the judges gave it one 18 to one 10 for Canelo Adelaide.

138
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.610
Yeah.
Adelaide Bird Adelai bird did.

139
00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:46.960
That wasn't about her record in the UFC.
Terrible.

140
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.430
One 18 and one 10 for Canelo had they bird.

141
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.310
That's so crazy that a woman or a man,
she's a woman.
She's very nice lady.

142
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.810
Wow.
Isn't that fucking bad?
She's going to get torch for that now.

143
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.050
That's terrible.
Oh,
she stays offline and they have no,

144
00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:04.150
but they have no accountability.
It doesn't matter.
The ties him,

145
00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:07.300
nothing happens to them.
They just keep right on being fucking horrible.

146
00:08:07.301 --> 00:08:11.500
That that's terrible.
Yeah,
it's not good.
I better pissed jeans.

147
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.390
There was one woman who got,

148
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:19.530
she got in serious trouble for several really bad decisions and she wound up

149
00:08:20.471 --> 00:08:23.380
retiring because it was like people were threatening her life.

150
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.143
<v 1>Okay.</v>

151
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.680
<v 0>Mike Perry is a bad motherfucker.
He scary.</v>

152
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.330
It's hard to see that Jake Ellenberger fight if,

153
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.840
I dunno,
a casino owner or whoever is running like the gambling,

154
00:08:39.841 --> 00:08:43.640
the guy at the top of,
he wanted to but just say in a different,
yeah.

155
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:45.390
If he wanted to rig it,
would you go after?

156
00:08:45.391 --> 00:08:48.060
How would you do go after the judges or the fighter?
I got your explanation.

157
00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:50.720
Two explanation for the game of Thrones thing.
Okay.

158
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.760
Multiple tweets have come that said that they can't swim,

159
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.630
but they can go and water just sink to the bottom.
Oh,
so they sacrificed them.

160
00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.220
Yeah,
but who is carrying those chains?

161
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:02.310
They're not strong enough to carry those strings.
Those chains were gigantic.

162
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.180
Steel is saying,
come on this kid,
I don't want to get hundreds of them.

163
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:08.780
They just sink,
but wait a,

164
00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:11.510
didn't they drag the dragon and they're strong enough to drag the dragon out.

165
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.400
Why are they strong enough to take the chains in doing a lot of,

166
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:15.330
it doesn't make any sense.

167
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.530
There's still less holes now or whoever to put them down there is still done.

168
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.990
It makes sense.
He just sacrifice him,
let him stay at the bottom of the water.

169
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.820
They can't get out.
That doesn't make sense.
So they're just walking.
Just walk.

170
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.500
How you can just walk out or it'd be the chain them up.

171
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.680
Even if you had cranes and all this shit,
the chain that thing up,

172
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.550
you'd have to have James Cameron down there with that little submarine trying to

173
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:39.210
scope it out for awhile.
Tried done that shit up like the titanic.

174
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.310
Keith Peterson,
another excellent refereeing.
That would be way harder.
Titanic.

175
00:09:44.311 --> 00:09:46.960
A dead body.
No,
it wouldn't be hard than the titanic.

176
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.820
Titanic's like miles deep into the water at 13,000 feet down.
Yes.

177
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:00.930
<v 2>Okay.</v>
