1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.730
Owner of there or not.
I met a burner.
Hello.

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.090
I can fit my boner in there too,
which is good.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.470
Most burner phones come with boners

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.700
the burner phone.
You get a boner and then,
yeah,
uh,
yeah,

5
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:21.480
I,
it's,
it's a great,
it's a great vehicle.
Like I said,
my kids love it.

6
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.460
Mugsy and scooter and sluggo and that you got it because he can't track you with

7
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:29.790
it.
And also they can't,
let me ask you this.
This is a tough one.

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.000
I want to ask you to conspiracy one's,
but this one's a tough one.

9
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.970
Michael Hastings,
you know his case.
Do you know the story?
Yeah.
Yeah.

10
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.800
What do you think happened there?
Well,
let's,
let's explain what happened.
What,

11
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.670
who he was,
he was a journalist.
He was embedded in,

12
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.040
was it in Iraq during the,
um,

13
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.120
during the war he was writing a story for the role for rolling stone.

14
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.460
And he was writing about which general was it done?

15
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.130
Um,
crystal.
Crystal.
Crystal.
Yeah.

16
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.120
So he wrote this story and apparently while this happened,

17
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:10.560
the Iceland volcano went off.
So they,
they suspended air travel.

18
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.120
So he was stuck there far longer than he was supposed to be and people got

19
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:17.190
comfortable with this guy being around.
Right.

20
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.890
And so they behave the way they behave.
They made some jokes about things.
Yeah.

21
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.370
He apparently made some jokes about Obama.

22
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.360
This guy put this,
Michael Hastings put all this stuff in rolling stone.
Um,

23
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.950
it wound up being a huge scandal.

24
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.820
Mcchrystal had to step down and there was a lot of people that hated that guy

25
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.790
and a lot of people loved McChrystal and he was a highly respected general.

26
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.360
Yeah,
absolutely.

27
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.560
He had a step down from his position and next thing you know,

28
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.540
x amount of time later,

29
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.730
this guy drives his car 150 miles an hour into a tree.

30
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.690
It blows up.
The engine goes flying in the whole deal.
Uh,

31
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.230
the conspiracy theory was that there was a way,

32
00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:06.520
cause he had a brand new Mercedes,

33
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.670
there was a way that they could take over the controls of your vehicle,

34
00:02:12.461 --> 00:02:17.100
the acceleration,
the braking steering,
and they could do all this remotely.

35
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.650
If they put something in your car,
like we were talking about,

36
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.600
if you could get ahold of this television,

37
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.820
you could turn that television to a receiver.
Right.

38
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.860
Do you think that is possible that someone could have gotten a hold of his car

39
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.900
and made him suicide himself?
Uh,
two points to it.

40
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.380
Uh,
one is,
is it possible that you can take control of a vehicle,

41
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.420
a modern vehicle?
Yes.
Not right now.
Not the woody,
not woody.
Yes,

42
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:47.400
we call it.
Um,
but,
uh,
uh,
so yes,
it's absolutely possible that you can take,

43
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.260
there's no two ways about salvation steering everything.
Yeah.
If you've got,

44
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.340
and,
and,
um,
and I mean,
think about people should think about,

45
00:02:56.341 --> 00:02:57.150
they think about the,

46
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.150
the Onstar or think about the ability for your car to send data to the,

47
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:06.310
to the vehicle manufacturer,
right?
Right.
To tell them you know,

48
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.140
what's going on with your vehicle.
Um,
that's a,
that's a handshake operation,

49
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:14.280
right?
Once you do that,
that that means there's an exchange of information.

50
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.240
What does that mean?
Well,
that means you can access,

51
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:18.310
can you access that information?
Sure.
Of course you can.

52
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.880
Does that mean you can then take physical controls short?
That's it's,
it's,

53
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.780
it's just another iteration of the exchange of information,
right.

54
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.180
Software can take control of physical systems and so that,
yeah.

55
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.620
So the first part is yes.

56
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.190
Is it possible that that car could have been taken over?
Sure.

57
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.500
Do I think that's what's happened?
I have no idea.
I really don't.
Of course,
but,

58
00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:44.620
um,
it's,
it's,
it's certainly a possibility.
I mean,

59
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.230
when I hear people talk about,
you know,
certain conspiracy theories,

60
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.710
I looked at it and go,
there's just no fucking way that can happen.
Like what one,

61
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.810
one d say no fucking war.
Uh,
actually no,

62
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.310
I have a hard time thinking of one.
Um,
uh,

63
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.660
I liked that the theory that with every burner phone you get a boner.
That's,
uh,

64
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.100
I just,
I can't imagine that could happen,
but it sounds good.

65
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.770
I think I'm misunderstood.

66
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.100
What I'm saying is you get the burner phone because you have a boner already

67
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.410
trying to get rid of that.
Oh,
I didn't see the owner.
Now I get a,
yeah,

68
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.360
I got the priorities wrong.
Okay.
So,
uh,

69
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.590
until you secretary to get a burner phone to meet her at the old

70
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.710
hotel.
How,
Oh man,
just like Jeff.
