1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.060
Yeah.
What did you think about all that stuff getting leaked?

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.370
Well Louise,
you know,
stop stand up at a really good point about that.

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.040
But what does he say,
Doug?
You were saying like,
look,

4
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:14.100
if this was a movie and if you took that movie and filmed it in the movie

5
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:17.850
theater and then put it online,
you'd be,
you'd go to jail.
You're a criminal,

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.930
you're stealing,
you're exposing your,
you're ruining his work.
Yes.

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.470
But they think they can ruin his work cause he jerked off in front of some

8
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:27.360
people.
I don't even know if it's that,

9
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.680
I don't even know if the person that lake it like was a Louis Hater sometimes he

10
00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:32.730
was a fan.
They were laughing hard.
Yes.

11
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.260
It's like they had to phone in their table.
I was at,
it wasn't governors,

12
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:40.650
it was the brokerage,
which is the same owners few years ago.

13
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.110
And I'm up there doing my shit and working on a new hour.

14
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.300
I looked on and the kid about 56 row,
I see him,
I see the red light.

15
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.940
Yeah.
And he's got his head down.
So I come down off the stage.

16
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:55.800
He doesn't even hear me.
And I grabbed the phone out of his hand.
Ah,
deleted.
I go,

17
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:58.690
dude,
you came out because you're a fan of mine.
Right.
I go,
the problem,

18
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.150
I explained it to him and the whole crowd.

19
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.710
The problem with this is if you put this shit online,
I'm working on news,

20
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.240
that's old material.
You're burning my shit.

21
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.210
You get it to all the other fans that listen to it for sure.

22
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:13.110
And also it's not fair because these bits are never done.

23
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.520
Like if you want to release it half baked,

24
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.230
like when when you first start working on a bit,
you have a premise,

25
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:22.050
you got kind of an idea where it's gone course.
Yeah.

26
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:25.580
And then it eventually becomes a bit that you would put on a special,
right?
Yeah.

27
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.210
And they'd get it halfway or a quarter in that and it'll look shitty and it's

28
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.750
all if it's done,
if you're doing a bit that's complete.
Yeah.
They,

29
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:36.930
it becomes old without some of the things that people were saying about Louie,

30
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:39.450
that the material's sloppy.
It's not like his old stuff.
Yeah.

31
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:42.750
He's working shit on the old stuff you saw when it was done.

32
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.830
Like if you came to the store and saw him working on a set like a few years
back,

33
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:48.330
you would see the same kind of stuff.

34
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.300
I got a couple of comments like that when I put my last special out there.
Like,

35
00:01:51.301 --> 00:01:54.390
well he's doing the same stuff.
I well you came out to see me eight,

36
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:57.840
10 months ago when I was working on it.
Yeah,
it's,
it's,
it's uh,

37
00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:00.090
something in process.
They don't understand though.

38
00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:03.930
Cause it seems like when you're onstage and you can't went up to toppy buggin

39
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.660
hit and it seems like you're doing something that they can do.

40
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.290
You're just talking,
oh I know you just talk and I could talk.
He's like,

41
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:12.630
there's no other art form like that where it's just talking.

42
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:16.650
That's exactly right.
Nobody yells at a concert,
nobody should go that fucking,

43
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:20.440
you know,
I could play bass better.
That jerk off.
I May,
but it stand up.

44
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.230
So
people have,
you know,

45
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:27.630
because people have made their friends laugh.

46
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.200
I think Seinfeld saw it in a book years ago because you know you make your

47
00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:32.034
friends laugh,

48
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.070
everybody's made their friends laugh with a comic and I and you like all the I

49
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:35.610
can do.

50
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.520
I call people out when they look bored with me or they had their arms folded.

51
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.270
I go do it.
You've got that smug look on your face.
I know you could do this too,

52
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:45.860
but you'd rather work at the fucking mattress factory 80 hours a week and making

53
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.010
fucking $400 there's people out there working at the mattress factory right now

54
00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:53.640
listening to this going,
man,
fuck you nuke Dick.
Go fuck them.
Whoa.
Hey,

55
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.750
how about you just ignore the guy that's a $2,000 for a mattress.
You can weird.

56
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.390
Well,
I know like a mattress.
How much can I pay you to make a mattress?

57
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.530
I don't know.
What am I getting it from?
Comedy Palace in San Diego.

58
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.110
I have to pay you a lot of money to build me a mattress

59
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.800
but keep,
but you said

60
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.490
you have to pay for the phone.
Ditch it all together.
Get the fuck Outta here.

61
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:21.820
You can make it a mattress.
Be Easy places.
I get farm laying all over the house.

62
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.060
Start with my wife's boobs.
Oh,
come on Joe.

63
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.150
Where'd he get this coffee?
It's fucking delicious.
Good.
Where?

64
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:34.870
I think this is black rifle.
Black rifle off that name.
It's a racist.
Oh,

65
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:38.810
it's not gun metal.
It's a company of veterans.

66
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.460
That makes sense.
You got coffee equals veteran owned.

67
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.550
Fuck yeah.
Matt flags veteran on to confess your own company.
I get a flag.

68
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:49.420
They sent me a,

69
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.230
when I did the Afghanistan USL think guy sent me a flag that they used in
battle.

70
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.190
Nice.
You have it folded up and I had it hanging,

71
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:00.580
but then I made a gym out of my fucking whatever.
So I don't know where it is.

72
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.860
Wow.
We should probably find it.
I should probably put it back up.

73
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.310
So I brought that up.
Don't worry about it.
Um,
the Louis C K set,

74
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.520
you know,
was very similar in my opinion,

75
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.280
to all the shit that he did before he got in trouble.
But very slowly,

76
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.410
very similar.
Same kind of material,
the same way he does things.
I mean,

77
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.770
people forget that this is a guy who went on Saturday night live and did a joke

78
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.320
about pedophilia,
pedophiles and about,
you know,

79
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:28.720
maybe we should like let them get away with it so they don't kill your kids.

80
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.920
I mean there's,
it's fucked up.
It's a fucked up bit.

81
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.450
But he was the darling of the left back then and so then he allowed to get away

82
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:40.330
with that if he tried to do that same material.

83
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:42.400
If he hadn't done that then and instead did that,

84
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:46.030
now people would be fucking horrified.
What is it Joe,

85
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:50.980
about offending women or today's feminist?

86
00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:53.110
What they're,
they are at the,
in my opinion,

87
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.960
all this political correctness that we hate so much down they are at the core,

88
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.920
but,
well,
p did the,
I say this,
the,
the Zeitgeists of the times,

89
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:07.330
it's like a fat chicks emotion.
Well,
very sensitive.

90
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.670
You can't,
you can't cross them.

91
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.150
But it's also because people are realizing now that they can make an impact.

92
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.810
Like one of the things that I read because he's doing this thing in Pittsburgh.

93
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.770
He was doing the Improv in Pittsburgh and this lady who wrote the article wrote

94
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:24.340
that he's making people put their cell phones in bags.
Much like comedians,

95
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:27.260
Dave Chappelle and Joe Rogan do.
She used my name to,

96
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.610
I've done it before but I only did it when I was filling with my Netflix
special,

97
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.700
so I didn't want people putting the material out or right before I was releasing

98
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:36.940
the special and then afterwards I decided it was too much of a pain in the ass,

99
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.360
but the only reason why I was doing it,

100
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.680
w w it had nothing to do with this.
She said because they know words can offend.

101
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.050
They don't want the consequences.
Well,
I'm going to put it on Netflix anyways.

102
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.980
It's going to be out to the public.
It's offensive.
It's good.

103
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.340
If you're looking to get offended,
go watch Netflix special.

104
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:59.150
There's plenty in there for you,
but I need to be able to do it correctly.

105
00:05:59.151 --> 00:05:59.830
Like I'm,
I'm,

106
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.830
I want to work it out so that it has the maximum amount of laughs with a minimum

107
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:09.260
amount of people getting it the wrong way.
Right.
So this,

108
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.400
it's all about wording and sitting upright and listening to it and go,

109
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.010
maybe there's a better way and you can't do that if somebody releases your shit.

110
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:19.670
And so these people that don't know comedy and they're saying this like you have

111
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:23.630
no idea what the process is like,
you just don't.
And if you,
if you do,

112
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.010
you would respect it and appreciate it.

113
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.730
And the people that are comics that don't respect and appreciate the process,

114
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.850
like that's where we are now.

115
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.320
But it's just because people can make an impact.

116
00:06:34.321 --> 00:06:37.250
It can have a reaction just like the people yelling at her,
you know,

117
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:39.140
that that she said,
she said,

118
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.370
oh my grandmother would be rolling over in her grave up say day in them,

119
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.610
say in them,
they're just trying to get a reaction from you.

120
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:47.840
They're just trying to push buttons.

121
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.860
They're just knowing that they can say something and they can have some sort of

122
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:55.520
an impact.
We're going to get Louis C K band from here.
You know,

123
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.190
we're going to get nick depalo kicked out of this club.

124
00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.300
You can't come to this club.

125
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:01.820
You've talked negatively about women and women's empowerment,

126
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.410
and that's dangerous to girls.
