Hello Freak bitches.
What,
what about protein?
When you were,
um,

2
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.970
being a Vegan,
what did you,
uh,
did you use like pea protein or a hemp protein?

3
00:00:09.971 --> 00:00:14.530
Like what kind of protein from him?
Because um,
uh,
they test for,

4
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.990
for,
for weed and they said sometimes,
I don't know.
I didn't want it to,

5
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.430
I didn't want to take the chance.
I didn't,

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.380
I'm not well versed on what is and what is not.

7
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.010
I know some honest shit that doesn't test positive done.

8
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.960
So I could do whatever I want,
but I don't know why they would say that.

9
00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:32.770
Because most if you get good hamp,
it's not my,
I guess that's the thing is good.

10
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.540
That's what they said.
They seen him,

11
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.070
they said flax seeds can make your tests positive.
Yeah.
Well,
you know,

12
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.920
poppy seeds can make this test positive for heroin.
I'm not crazy.
Yeah.

13
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.400
Like people have tested positive on those random drug test to give people their

14
00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:49.450
jobs from having a poppy seed Bagel.
Mama,
you're shooting heroin.

15
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.950
Why me in the fucking Bagel Sandwich?
But anyway,

16
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.650
the NFL like they need to,
um,
uh,

17
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.230
let,
let guys use a weed for oh pain.
Oh for sure.

18
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.093
It's ridiculous.

19
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.020
Well definitely CBDS for sure cause it's not even [inaudible] CBD is just an oil

20
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:11.190
that comes from a,

21
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.310
comes from hemp plant that's not psychoactive.
My rent.

22
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.300
It's really good for you too.

23
00:01:16.301 --> 00:01:19.860
It was super good for inflammation and joint pain and things along those lines.

24
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:22.920
Matter of fact,
when I had my,
um,
we actually,
we are some right here.

25
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.400
I'll sit right here.
That's what it is.
Yeah.
This is a Charlotte's web.

26
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.650
This is actually one of my sponsors now.
They make a hemp oil.
I,
yeah,

27
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:34.710
I didn't mean to apply.
I'm going to do it.
It's actually on this podcast.

28
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:36.060
I have to do a sponsor about it.

29
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:40.260
But stuff is great and you just take it and it's drops.

30
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.380
It's good for you.
A negative effects.
When I had my back surgery and um,

31
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.150
2014 at 13.
And uh,
what did you have done?

32
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.120
L Five s one.
I had a discectomy.
Dissectomy yeah.

33
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.400
Um,
they,
uh,
they prescribed Percocet.
Right.

34
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.780
And Percocet.
I used to,
I used to take him for everything else.

35
00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:06.200
They used to make me gag and throw up every single time I took him.

36
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.370
And so really any painkiller that was heavily,
heavily sedate you,

37
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:11.270
I would always like throw up.

38
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.510
And they told me that if you like have a gag reflex too much that you could
read,

39
00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:21.400
I could have really slipped my disc.
Really.
So for like two days,

40
00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:24.190
I was just like in pain after the surgery and my dad was like,
man,

41
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.690
go get some weed or always,
I'm gonna go get you some weed.
I was like,
wow,

42
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:31.990
her pot.
He's like,
yeah man.
So he went to the,
and lucky that I was in la,

43
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:36.990
I got it.
And it had to dispense her.
And so,
uh,
got some and uh,

44
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.030
it helps immediately and I was like,

45
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:44.000
there's no way that they shouldn't be okay.
It's totally be lyrical events.

46
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.190
We're being [inaudible] being fucked,
you know?
I mean,

47
00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:50.940
it's slowly but surely it's starting to become legal recreationally.

48
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:52.950
It's legal now in California recreationally.

49
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.040
But the federal government is still resisting it because of the influence of the

50
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:59.980
pharmaceutical companies and also a bunch of other people that like the prison

51
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:03.190
guard unions,
they don't want it to be legal cause they,

52
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:05.920
they would have less people to arrest.
It's kind of fucked up.
Yeah.
No,

53
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.040
the prison industrial complex is a real thing.

54
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.990
They're making money off people being in cages.

55
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:14.280
It's like there people are human batteries and you get money off of them.

56
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.350
It is the matrix.
It really is.
It's like a very low level version of the matrix.

57
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.040
But it's terrifying if that logic with all the science that's in place about

58
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:27.430
what's dangerous and what's not.
They're prescribing Percocet.
So like here Fella,

59
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.010
take these.
It makes no sense.
You young strapping buck.

60
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:32.470
Why don't you take some shit that might get you hooked to have this,

61
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.620
they have this,
this waiver we have to sign.
So there's this,
um,

62
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.880
it just painkiller called Toradol,
Indiana for right.
Yeah.
It's awful.

63
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:43.770
But I took it a lot because we scrapped that shit to my dog.
Yeah,

64
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.650
she's great with dog.
Got Bit so like,
so for Toyota we have to,

65
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.250
we have to sign this waiver that says you're kind of just giving up your,

66
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:52.630
it's not,
we're not responsible for it,

67
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.490
but like they'll let us take that but they won't let us smoke weed and they're

68
00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:01.350
abandoned dudes that smoke weed and they're suspended dude's as claims,
right.

69
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.690
He retired because of even just,
um,
I think his name's Josh Gordon.

70
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:06.220
He played receiver for the browns.

71
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.180
He's one of the best young receivers I've seen in a long time.
But he,

72
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.050
they banned him for a year cause he tested positive.

73
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:13.990
That's two or three times and it's like you're throwing away,

74
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:17.290
I mean like granted he needs to be smarter but like you're throwing away an

75
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:20.910
entire mass career because of weed.
Like it's not crack.
It's not coke.

76
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:21.491
You know what I'm saying?

77
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:25.570
It's like it's trying to send a message to the youth to stay away from the

78
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:28.930
illegal drugs.
He's reg Reagan all over again.

79
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.980
You trying to rule off of fear.
It's fear,
man.
Like not based on reality.

80
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.510
The reality is if you were to legalize drugs,
period,

81
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.720
you can regulate it and that way you can do it in a controlled environment.

82
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.100
And that way you don't have all of this.

83
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.760
I mean that's what they do with the Prohibition of alcohol.
Right.
Legalize it.

84
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.580
Well,
that's also what they're doing right now with a opiate pills.

85
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.820
I mean oxycontin's are now illegal.
They can be prescribed.

86
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.340
You just have to have a doctor that prescribes it.
It's ridiculous.

87
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.940
It is pretty crazy.
Well,

88
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.830
it's really crazy when people realize that marijuana helps pain relief as much,

89
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:01.330
if not better than all that stuff.

90
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.420
And it doesn't have any of the addictive properties.
And if you do,

91
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.840
there have been people that have said that it's addictive and there's some

92
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.120
studies that pointed that in certain individuals,

93
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.990
but I would state that those people are probably addicted to fucking everything.

94
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.690
I couldn't,
I just don't call it physically.

95
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:20.380
I don't get how marijuana is addictive.
It just doesn't make any sense.

96
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.960
I've smoked pot every day for years and then I'll take like a month off and

97
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.480
nothing,
not an acre.
Not a pain.
Not a,
no shakes,
no nothing.

98
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.630
You just don't have it.
It's like,

99
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.910
drink orange juice then don't drink large shoes.
No,
it's really nothing there.

100
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.380
Nothing happens.
I'll get it,
man.
I was,
I'm,
I'm not like a heavy smoker like that,

101
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.150
but like,
I'm like a,
uh,
I had on a Saturday night when I ain't going nowhere,

102
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.190
I'm all set up my pipe and my,
and my sack,
and I'm going to watch a great movie.

103
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.960
Why not fall asleep?
Yeah.
What the fuck is wrong with that?
I don't get it,
man.

104
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.680
And meanwhile,
you can get percocets or get drunk as hell and ruin your liver.

105
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.663
Yeah.

106
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.040
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
