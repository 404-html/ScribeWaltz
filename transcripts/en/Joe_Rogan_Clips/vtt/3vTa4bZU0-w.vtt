1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.850
The joe rogan experience.
Jamie's giving me the Nah,
sure.
Look,

2
00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:10.080
yes.
You and Joey Diaz talking about doing a show in in New York.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.440
Where do you man?
Oh,
okay.
You don't talk about it.
Yeah,

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.200
no need to find one here.
I got a joint Diaz story.

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.940
We're going to do a show with me and Joey and Eol motherfucking Romero and he's

6
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:25.500
going to talk to him if he gets confused and in Spanish because Joey's from
Cuba.

7
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.800
Dude,
are you kidding me?
[inaudible] going to translate.
He was Joe.

8
00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:32.490
It's totally Joey's idea.
Joey says,
bro up and talking to them.

9
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:36.030
I love this fucking guy.
We'd have an amazing podcast.
You wouldn't be,

10
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.630
you prone the questions Adam,
if shit gets,
we'd,
I come to him when in Spanish.

11
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:43.970
We'll understand each other better to proline ideas.
What Joey said,
he said,
uh,

12
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.880
he goes,

13
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.800
tell him that I want to be on his podcast because he has love for Cuba in under,

14
00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:53.220
he understands Cuban love.
Love.
It was like that.

15
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:56.540
All that shit that he was doing a Luke Rockhold after he knocked him out was a

16
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.200
tense up that's in town.
Give me a few minutes.
You just knocked me into fricking.

17
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.213
That's intense.

18
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.530
The gimme a fucking second to get my wits about me and then kiss me on the lips

19
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:08.700
or wherever the fuck you want to do it.

20
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.050
His ability to just be calm and then explode.

21
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.010
It's very terrifying.
It's only helped by him telling you he loves you.

22
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.580
He's,
he's worked terrified.
They never,

23
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.960
it's scary cause he's such a nice guy outside dude.
He is the nicest car.

24
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.500
He's very friendly.
You remember the champ though was like,
oh yeah.

25
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:31.410
That's what you do.
You're Whitaker.
You know Whitaker is a monster man.

26
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.060
Gotta go back to that Tim Kennedy fight though.
Man.
Dot.
About stool gate.
Yeah.

27
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:40.320
That Tim Kennedy fight was crazy.
It was like,
look,
I know what you're doing.

28
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:44.370
It's very slick.
This is very smart.
I mean this is Angelo.

29
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:47.820
Dundee did that to Muhammad Ali when he fought Henry Cooper in London.

30
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.530
He got crack on the left hook.

31
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.580
Henry Cooper dropped him and he was in real trouble.
They cut the glove,
baby.

32
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.030
Cut that glove,
baby.
We got to get the other pair.
Oh,

33
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:59.910
it's out there in the dressing room.
Be Right back.
It's all fair in love.

34
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:03.840
And they go,
oh man.
Yeah,
it ain't the right way to do it.
But you got to,

35
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.870
you got to realize that this guy had gone through the whole amateur wrestling

36
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:09.210
system as a representative of Cuba.
What?

37
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.920
Matt Brown and I did a podcast last week and Matt Brown spat.

38
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.130
He's a great guy and fascinating dude,
man.

39
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.670
Intense smart motherfucker.
Peptide people get a chance to,
he did he die.

40
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.780
He died and they brought him back.
Yeah.
You know,

41
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:28.650
we talked about that you and court McGee both have this white creepy thing to

42
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:31.920
you because you both crossed over to the other side and you don't give a fuck.

43
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:36.450
How was it who?
Both guys,
man,
you've got to beat them.
They don't beat each other.

44
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.120
Literally have to take it on.
Beat themselves rather.
Yeah.
I mean,

45
00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:42.300
Matt Brown a beaten himself like he's,
he's a human.
What's he doing now?

46
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.080
He is going to fight Carlos condit all that's right.
He's coming back from war.

47
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.790
He ended,
he ended on that dope ass knocked out of Diego.

48
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.240
The elbow maybe behind the air,
but all's fair a little bit.

49
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.270
And then I thought he was going to ride off into the sunset and now he's

50
00:02:57.271 --> 00:03:00.340
fighting Carlos condit.
So he was explaining about his camp that he did in Cuba.

51
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.540
It's amazing story.
Amazing.
He spent like six weeks in cab brown.
Yes.

52
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.770
His wife Susan Cuba,

53
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.970
his white ass was in Cuba with the wrestling team for six fucking weeks for one

54
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:11.080
of the camps.
One of his fights,

55
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:14.350
he boxed in Cuba and Cuban boxers and he wrestled.

56
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.650
He lived in a Cuban fighters house.

57
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.580
They had them there and they fed which fight was it that he said?

58
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.750
I try to remember which fight,
if you pull up,
pull up his record.

59
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.540
It was fairly recently,
fairly recently doing that.
He's a bad motherfucker,
dude.

60
00:03:30.541 --> 00:03:34.120
Bad motherfucker.
I'm not,
I'm not good at that.
Like I don't want anyone to lose.

61
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:37.680
Like,
I love Yoel Romero and I love Luke,
but I've been,

62
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.400
but I,
uh,

63
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.950
I know what those guys feel like when they lose and there's everything on the

64
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:46.030
table.
I know what for Luke,

65
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:49.990
how he changed camps and sometimes that's just you're on a boat and there's

66
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.930
holes and then you think if you pal further away from the original camp,

67
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:55.070
you know,
fill these holes and it doesn't work like that.

68
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.680
So I know by him leaving fresh look,
I mean it might've been a good move for him,

69
00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:00.980
but he fought you all were marrow.

70
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.500
I mean the reality is yellow were marrow is fucking horrifying.

71
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.640
He's horrifying.
Luke can beat him.
Luke can beat him.
Yeah,
he might be able to,

72
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:12.850
but he also might be able to get hit exactly what got hit in that fight every

73
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:17.320
time they fight.
Dude,
you don't know man.
I'm saying,
I don't know.
I've seen,

74
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.420
I've seen a better bs.

75
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.440
I've seen a better version of Luke to me as far as skill wise,
besides Whitaker.

76
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.240
Right now.
He's on another level,
but I look at the roster and to me,

77
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.940
Luke is the most complete middleweight in the world.

78
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.270
I can even seem be in the light heavyweight champion that's been like him.

79
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.920
Some problems besides gfes in there.

80
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.830
There's going to be some issues where those guys,
who knows maybe him going,

81
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:39.550
I mean he's been talking about an inevitable climb to two oh five he might be

82
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:43.600
just like Whitaker and just like,
um,
uh,
who else we're talking about?

83
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.860
Y'all failed Dos Anjos.
Yeah,
it might be.
He might be a better fighter.

84
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.030
Two Oh five he might be so fucking lean.

85
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.200
The problem there is what made Luke so great was that swagger,

86
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:55.660
like the people who were like,
oh,
he's so cocky.
I get that.

87
00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:59.440
I actually want my fighter like that.
I liked how you so arrogant and cocky.

88
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.310
Sometimes people don't gravitate towards it,
but for a guy like Luke,
he just,

89
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.840
he thrived off that and now when I see him,
I,
you know,

90
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.310
when a is Latin in the branch fight,
I didn't see it as much.

91
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:11.080
I thought there that fight was a little suspect,

92
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:14.500
not taking anything away from branch,
but that should have been easier for Luke.

93
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:17.890
And I see the Yoel Romero fight and it just,
that killer instinct wasn't there.

94
00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:20.350
He's very,
I know you have five rounds,
but he would let,

95
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.730
Yo will explode and reset when you reset.
You got to go when you've got to go.

96
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.510
Branch might not have the best results inside the octagon,

97
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.130
but when it comes to technical skill,
he's a super high level fighter.
His,

98
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.200
his skill level and his capabilities,

99
00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:37.810
I don't think if matched up to all of his performances.

100
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.080
And you saw that when he's attacking Luke,
he's fucking good man.

101
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.660
He put him in real.
I'm not saying he's not.
Oh,
he's very,

102
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:45.250
I'm not saying that it's ground game is very good,

103
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:49.650
but it makes Luke's win even more impressive for sure.
With branches.

104
00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:51.980
Never in world series of fighting.
He Kinda,
you know,

105
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.330
became light heavyweight champion middleweight champion.
He's a monster,
right?

106
00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:58.730
Yeah.
In the UFC.
He just,
he hasn't found his groove yet,
right?
He did.

107
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.390
And he never has right now I don't,
you know,
a lot its level of competition.

108
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.721
You know,

109
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:06.400
his first fight in UFC was boring and then he'd get Luke Rockhold which snow

110
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.240
walk in the park.
So I do think Dave branch's a monster Henzel Gracie black belt,

111
00:06:10.241 --> 00:06:14.660
second vert round in the UFC and correct Gerald Harris payload with that crazy

112
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:18.070
slam from the GAA.
Have a good career.
But yeah man.
Yeah that was,

113
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.240
that was crazy.
Gerald Harris is a powerful man.
Monster.
I'm,

114
00:06:22.241 --> 00:06:25.520
I'm just saying w with Luke it was this swag or what he thought he was the best

115
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:28.160
in the world and was in Strikeforce is when he got to the UFC when he was

116
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:30.030
champion.
Right.
And then in the Biz being fight,

117
00:06:30.031 --> 00:06:33.020
he gets clipped with that left hook and he has problems with the left,

118
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.680
the left side for him.
So you know,
Bisbing lands that knocks him out,

119
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:38.540
that short notice fight.
He thought he was going to walk through them.

120
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.830
They take that long layoff and he's,
he's trying to be a male model and you know,

121
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:43.880
arguing with the UFC,

122
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:47.030
it's just an in somewhere along the lines that he lost a little bit of swag when

123
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:50.000
he gets that back.
We're in good form.
Well um,

124
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:55.070
I'm curious to see what his journey with Henry Hoofed where that comes up cause

125
00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:58.370
they've been,
how about how long have you been together now?
Like a year.

126
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.610
Maybe a year.
Yeah.
He moved out there.
Henry's an interesting coach,
man.

127
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.820
He's a fucking one or a bad guy.
He's a very powerful guy.

128
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.490
He doesn't have his DC and Cain Velasquez.
Right.
It could be right.

129
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.900
And Josh Thompson in this,

130
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:15.740
these monsters you're surrounded by just these monsters Susie training with and

131
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:19.270
how has he addressed that left side where it keeps getting hit.
You know which,

132
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.990
what put them out.
You will has left two labs.
Two left.
That upper cut.

133
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.740
Oh was like a free for all.
Like mark.
Got It.
Get a little closer.

134
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.730
You got to get a little closer.
That would have been hard to get all your marrow.

135
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.000
Just fucking think about is hitting as hard as you can.
Yeah,
you'll,

136
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.350
you'll run mill smash.
He's punching the humanist hard as they can.

137
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.430
I didn't think it was a bad stoppage because he had his head up when he went

138
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:45.890
down and you've got to give one guy a chance to hit.

139
00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:48.920
I'm now looking at it after the fact.
You Go,
man,

140
00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:51.320
I wish you didn't get hit with that upper cut.
The fight was already over,

141
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.910
but in the moment,
in real time,
it doesn't happen.
I'm talking shit.

142
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.380
Did I,
I hear you.
Unless you ran out four to 40 and again.
Oh,

143
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.390
I think it's a perfect stoppage.
I mean,
I think the first one,

144
00:08:02.391 --> 00:08:06.360
you don't really stop it yet.
You got to see what's going on.
That's flat fucker.

145
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.730
You don't know.
You never know.
I hear you right.

146
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.060
That one you kind of know you kind of,
but after the fact we're saying that.
Yeah.

147
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:22.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>
