1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.120
Oh,
everybody like you,
you know,
you look good by the way.
Thanks.
Does a could not.

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.370
Lennox has seen me since I was 147 pounds.
Really?

3
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:12.240
You were 147 pounds at one point in time.
That was when I first started boxing.

4
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:15.140
I was one 47 how old were you?
15 oh,
okay.

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.100
I met him probably when I was 16 Oh really?
Yeah.

6
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.380
You guys have known each other that long.
Yeah,
I know his parents.
Yeah.
Wow.

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.690
And his and his mom and his brothers.
Every,
wow.
It goes back,
we're deep creek.

8
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.390
You don't realize that.
It was like,
you know,
I see him as a big star now.

9
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:35.230
I seen the movies and commercials rescuing people,
you know what I mean?

10
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.260
I'm like,
Yo,
this is the kid,
you know,
at least he's grown up.
He's like literally,

11
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.060
literally just selling mix tapes in the nineties he was already world champ and

12
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.480
I'd be playing the mix tape.
Yo Send me that and I'm like,
I just made it.

13
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.380
He's like,
I'll give you 20 bucks.
I'm like,
you just made $100 million.

14
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:56.490
Can you give me 100 bucks?
Yeah.
Well,
you know,

15
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:57.990
everybody was making tapes back then.

16
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.670
Those days when people are aggressively trying to sell tapes on the streets.

17
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.610
I wasn't even trying to sell it.
I was just playing it in my car and he was like,

18
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.610
Yo.
So he got,
he had the new shit going on,
you know,
that was,

19
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.840
he had the real shit.
So I had to get a good it,
I didn't,

20
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.790
I didn't have that contact to get the music,
so he had the music context.

21
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.560
A lot of people don't know Russell's a legit Dj.

22
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.840
I reluctantly gave me what's mix tapes.
Reluctantly.
Yeah,
it's a good move.
Um,

23
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.140
when you know,
when you see him wrestling with people on Tmz,

24
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:30.780
you see that shit where the medicine,
what the jewel.
He's trying to

25
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.930
see what happened after.
He didn't throw no punches.
Go good kid.

26
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:39.600
His neck,
if you watch it,
you see,

27
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:43.710
I went for his arm to pull down to get his neck and then the other guy in front

28
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:45.630
of him pulled him down and I couldn't get the neck.

29
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.260
Could you tell us what happened?
I mean explain what happened.

30
00:01:48.261 --> 00:01:51.880
All I seen was a guy walking out and you grab them.
No,
if you're watching it.

31
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.350
Okay,
so here's what happened.
Let me tell you what happens.

32
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.080
I'm there looking at a ring,
right?
Yeah.

33
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.040
And that guy sitting down earlier had checked to see if the door was open.

34
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.760
He went out to spit and now he really,
he thinks the door's open.

35
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.480
So now he thinks he's just going to get up and walk away with this ring.

36
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.780
This is where he makes his little move and then they lock the doors and then I'm

37
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:18.540
standing there,
I'm like,
what's going on?
And I'm like,

38
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:20.550
he takes a swing at my friend's father and then I go,
no,
no.

39
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:22.170
I tried to get his neck and that guy pulls him.

40
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:25.680
You see there's a lot of opportunities yet the neck there.
So no,
but I'm trying.

41
00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:28.320
He's a big strong fucking guy and tonight you got to go over the top.

42
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.660
I will look,
I'm just trying,
but I had three layers on.

43
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.260
I'm not going to jacket a sweatshirt and a long sleeve shirt on.

44
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.240
There is an issue.
And then a,
so then I tried to go for the arm,

45
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:38.640
but everybody sees everybody's in my way.
So I'm like,
give me the arm.

46
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:40.530
Just let me get the eye move,
Dad,
move dad.

47
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.790
That's uncle David and their it guy.
I got the arm at the backward based.

48
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.580
Now we're pushing the arm down and you'll see I locked the rest here.

49
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:55.020
As soon as I locked the army says,
he says,
okay,
I want you to stop some living.

50
00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:58.470
Right there it goes.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah,
I got the rest of the,

51
00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:02.560
see the a little wrist lock,
Steven Seagal style.
And that was my friend.

52
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:07.460
Senpai shall look.
Oh,
there you go.
Rinse locks are legit.
He got up again.
No,
no,

53
00:03:07.461 --> 00:03:09.660
no.
This is just a different angle.
A different,
I want to know what,

54
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.970
how far we was going to make with a ring.
You see,
um,

55
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.940
see that wall where my cousin is hiding?
Yeah.

56
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.980
When he was trying to get out,
he whacked his head against that wall.
Oh No.

57
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.270
And uh,
and he could as he,
her open the thief.
Yeah.

58
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.220
So whatever happened to him,
he got arrested.
He was this in Toronto?

59
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.280
No New York City.
No Shit.
Right in the jewelry district.

60
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.640
So it's fun.
That's like ill planned out move.

61
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:42.460
Do you know that?
They know that people grab things and run away?

62
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.890
Well there's that and he apparently this guy had been coming to the store for

63
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:48.310
six months scoping,
scoping the place out.
Oh that's hilarious.

64
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:52.390
Cocked it up poorly.
That's hilarious.
Yeah.
Just silly.

65
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.570
Do you have to go to quarter or anything?
But I don't know.

66
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.000
I haven't heard anything since.
Do you want,
and I just put them in.

67
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.770
All I was trying to do is hold them there cause right.
All the doors were locked.

68
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.680
I'm like it doesn't make sense again to a scrap but the guy,

69
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.100
if I could just put him in a choke hold or,
or a lock then till the cops come.

70
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.700
But the thing is like you could injure him.
If you enjoy him then they suit you.

71
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.080
Well yeah,
not really.
As ridiculous as it sounds.
It's rough work.

72
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.740
Well Russell is not really a law enforcement officer.
I could see if you had,

73
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:19.750
nobody would have been dangerous for everybody in the store if he was running

74
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:23.980
wild.
True.
Yeah.
So I mean,
look,
he's lucky he didn't crack them.
Yeah.
You know,

75
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.590
I just locked him up and I said,
all right,
as soon as I locked him up,
he goes,

76
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:29.350
okay.
And I go,
okay,
good.
And then he had one knee,

77
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.590
one knee down and one leg up and that kicked that leg out.
So he would,

78
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.670
we'd be blown both knees get rid of his base.
Yes.
Right.

79
00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:39.550
I was trying to move as bay.
Who's the big,
I've got a question.
Okay.

80
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:42.460
Now if the whole thing happened again,
how would you do things different?

81
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.610
I would have told everybody get out of my way so I can get him in a choke.

82
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:50.050
And would you just put them asleep?
Yeah,
just put them to sleep.
Lay him down,

83
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.720
let him down,
talk him in and he went back home.

84
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.460
And obviously you feel good about yourself.

85
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.020
Did you kind of run the whole thing through your mind a couple of times?
Like,
Yo,

86
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.850
this could have happened or what could happen.

87
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.300
I started thinking after if he had a gun or if he had a knife,
but I'm like,

88
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.000
if he had a gun,
he would have pulled it out right away.
Wow.
Yeah.
He's,
you know,

89
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.800
he's not here to surprise you with a gun.
He's here to scare you with the gun.

90
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.740
Well,
if there's all that many dudes on them too,
good luck pulling that gun out.

91
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.890
Yeah.
Yeah.
One of us would've got shot,
but,

92
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:22.050
but probably not food or something that.
