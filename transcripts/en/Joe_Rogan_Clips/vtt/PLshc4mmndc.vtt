1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.060
The joe rogan experience drones.

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.490
<v 2>Well we have to worry about people more than we even have to worry about drones.</v>

3
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.860
Right.
This new shooting in Florida freak me the fuck out again.

4
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.220
Yeah,
it's happening all the time now.
It's horrific.

5
00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:24.270
And the crazy thing is like kids used to joke around about this guy doing that

6
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:28.480
someday.
That was something they joked around about [inaudible].

7
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.780
<v 0>I think that uh,</v>

8
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.110
I think that the way that the news reports it and the way that it's such big

9
00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:36.730
news isn't helping at all.

10
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.410
Because one thing that I've noticed is the whole car ramming thing.

11
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.870
Like that's a new thing,
car ramming where the,

12
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.370
a lot of the things that are happening or people just getting in a truck or a

13
00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:51.160
car and just running people down.

14
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.340
It's a fairly new thing that started with like,
I don't know,

15
00:00:54.341 --> 00:00:57.370
maybe that French one or something like that.
I can't remember the first one.

16
00:00:57.371 --> 00:00:59.880
But since then,
because the report,
you know,
they're just,

17
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.120
they report it and they blow these things up and then bing,
Bang,
boom.
Like,

18
00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:08.950
I feel like going off of the car ramming situation and the growth in car

19
00:01:08.951 --> 00:01:10.090
rammings alone,

20
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.400
that we could sort of see how overly reporting these,
I mean,

21
00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:17.050
I don't know if that's even a thing or if I'm,

22
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.970
what I'm saying is making sense at all,
but

23
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.660
<v 2>I know what you're trying to say.</v>

24
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.390
But the counter to that would be someone had,
what was the,
the,

25
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.100
someone made a really good analogy.

26
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.780
The point being what this is,
is only happening here.

27
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.190
We have to figure out why it's happening here.

28
00:01:39.191 --> 00:01:43.570
So often it rarely happens anywhere else.
But here it happens pretty often.

29
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.200
So what is that?
Is it access to guns?

30
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.510
Is it mental health?
Is it both of those things?
Is it,
um,

31
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.410
it's just far too easy to get guns?

32
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.440
Is it that you're not being monitored in a sense of being talked about and

33
00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:04.990
people don't want to anybody infringing upon their rights?
Right.

34
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.380
But if we just sat down and had a rational conversation with someone to renew a

35
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:14.740
gun license,
you know,

36
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.180
rational conversation with someone who doesn't work for a gun group or anything,

37
00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:24.181
just someone who could just give you a reasonable reason why you should be

38
00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:27.790
suspicious about this person having a firearm.

39
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.380
And he really don't want to do that either though,

40
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.820
because you can't trust people.

41
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.960
It's like you putting people in a position of power to decide who gets the guns

42
00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:37.240
and who doesn't get the guns.
It's all very,

43
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.360
very fucking terrifying and can and confusing

44
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.400
<v 0>let's seems like the Ar 15 is the one that they need to keep an eye on because</v>

45
00:02:45.401 --> 00:02:48.610
all the biggest ones are that.
And it seems to be able to mount out,

46
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.080
mow down a lot of people at once.

47
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.801
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:55.801
Semiautomatic rifles are more effective in those type of mass shooting

49
00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:59.890
situations.
That's why those guys use them.
That's why they use them.
You know,

50
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.670
all sorts of horrific ways.
All we're all around the world.
Right.

51
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.760
That's what they're good at that.
So the question is,

52
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:10.660
are they too lethal for a regular person?
Who's to be carrying around

53
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.180
where you would want to know why a regular person wants to carry him around and

54
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:21.181
then you would realize is that really my right to even ask a regular person why

55
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:22.594
they need it?

56
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.610
I mean if most of these people are law abiding gun owners,

57
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.540
when we freak out that one person who legally bought a gun in this case is a kid

58
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:38.350
who legally bought it.
Does it,
does this horrific thing?

59
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.930
It's a very good question and it's a question we all have to ask ourselves like

60
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.770
how many times does this happen before something happens and is the,

61
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.510
is the answer arming the schools?
That's a fucking terrifying answer.

62
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.550
The putting armed guards at schools,

63
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:58.630
like I saw a story or someone had held up two signs,

64
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.380
which it was like a Instagram thing and so it was the,

65
00:04:03.381 --> 00:04:08.381
the two signs for which one of these signs would make you feel good if you were

66
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.360
like a killer and it shows no weapons,
like a no weapon sign.

67
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.170
And then it also shows a sign with an armed guard saying that the staff is armed

68
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:25.570
and trained.
And you know,
you're looking at the two of those and you're like,

69
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.610
God damn man,
I don't want either one of these fucking things.
I,

70
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.200
I definitely don't want weapons in the schools,

71
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.410
but I don't want them to need weapons in schools.

72
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.710
That's why I don't want it there.
Yeah.
But when they,
you know,

73
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.740
when scenes like this happen,
you have to go,
well how is there a way,

74
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:46.550
I don't know.

75
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.550
I don't know what the way is other than even if you take people's guns away,

76
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.660
God damn,
you're not going to get all of them.
There's too many of them.

77
00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.560
The number of guns that people have today,
I,

78
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.450
I think it out numbers.
Humans.

79
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.020
I think the number of guns like total in this country outnumber humans insanity.

80
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.950
Even if you are for guns,

81
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.410
when the number of things that can kill us outnumber us.

82
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.430
Are we overreacting?
Are we crazy?

83
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:29.431
Are we stockpiling for some fucking terrible collapsed there were all afraid of,

84
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.730
<v 0>is that just start thing?
Cause we're like,
uh,</v>

85
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.130
we were like the last country or whatever you think.

86
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:39.280
Is it like defensive question depute question,

87
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.210
like crazy scared country.

88
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.331
<v 2>Well there's,
you know,</v>

89
00:05:44.331 --> 00:05:49.331
there's different uses for firearms and who are you to say that?

90
00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:54.641
Like recreational shooters who are respectable law abiding people and there's a

91
00:05:56.151 --> 00:05:58.520
lot of them out that are very good people.

92
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.120
They just love to shoot pistols at targets.

93
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.820
They do competitions,
they enjoy it.

94
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.200
They like being proficient with a firearm for their own personal safety and

95
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:12.530
they're having cases,
I think there was a case in shit,

96
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:17.531
I want to say it was in Ohio where some guy was stabbing somebody at a mall in

97
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:23.711
some dude who was at train shooter at one of those shooting competition things.

98
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.950
Shot the guy and killed him when he was running around stabbing people at the

99
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:28.784
mall.

100
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.310
And it was one of those things where no one wanted to play that up in the media

101
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.410
because they thought it was like irresponsible.

102
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.700
It's irresponsible to play up the idea of the rogue vigilante with the pistol.

103
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.570
Yeah,
but,
but that was a real guy.

104
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.240
Like the guys actually like kind of a hero.
Like,

105
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:50.630
if he was a in a Bruce Willis movie,
you'd be fucking pumped.

106
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.670
I think that guy's kind of a hero.

107
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.240
Like he was a normal citizen that happened to have it concealed carry permit.

108
00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.833
Right.

109
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.120
<v 3>Found another similar story I guess from what you're describing in Minnesota was</v>

110
00:07:03.121 --> 00:07:05.670
an off duty cop that stopped somebody that was stabbed,
stabbed 10 people.

111
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.080
<v 2>Yeah.
It was an off duty cop.
That was the what?
The stab one.
So I got that wrong.</v>

112
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.550
It was he who was the firearm instructor one.
Um,
I don't know this,

113
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.170
I might have been another similar story too.
It might've been,

114
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.770
but there was definitely one,
I'm sorry if I fucked that up.
Um,

115
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.650
there was definitely one where the guy was a,
uh,

116
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.670
one of those big NRA shooting competition type characters.

117
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.350
This is a terrible,
terrible tragedy,
tragedy.

118
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.240
And these terrible tragedies seem to keep happening and we don't do anything to

119
00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:41.550
change.
Everybody's worried about,
you know,

120
00:07:41.551 --> 00:07:45.930
their second amendment rights being taken away.
You know,

121
00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:49.290
people worried about law abiding people who would never do anything like this,

122
00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:53.880
worried about their guns getting taken away.
But they,
in all,
all of us,
we have,

123
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.530
we have to figure this out.
This,

124
00:07:55.531 --> 00:07:59.460
this can't just keep going on this way and whatever it is,
whatever's causing it,

125
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.840
whether it's the way people raising people,
the way people are treating people,

126
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.340
uh,
whatever.

127
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.660
Fucking crazy mental imbalances that were not treating in each other,

128
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:13.150
whatever the fuck it is,
whether it's biological,
whatever the fuck it is that,

129
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:18.000
that we just can't keep as a,
as a civilization,
as a,

130
00:08:18.001 --> 00:08:18.834
as a,

131
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.550
a thing that should in its best times be able to get along great with each
other.

132
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:28.590
These little aberrations,
they're horrific aberrations,
but they exist frequently.

133
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.070
There's so many of us.
Yeah.

134
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.430
320 something million people.

135
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:40.140
This is from 2015 more guns and people.
Yeah.
Oh Wow.
Okay.

136
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.280
Oh boy.
Wow.
So the,

137
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:48.290
there's 317 million people in 2013 and 357 million guns.

138
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.980
That's crazy.
But then the people who are gun nuts and be,

139
00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.290
what do you fucking care how many guns I have,
man.
Okay.

140
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.040
I'm a law abiding citizen.
I would never do anything like that.
That guy did.

141
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:07.350
That guy's a piece of shit.
Fuck him.
And their right to their right to,

142
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:10.770
if you're,
if you haven't done anything and you would never do anything,

143
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.590
why would you get lumped in with someone who has,

144
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.620
if you have a truck and you would never dream into plowing into a mall full of

145
00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:20.994
people,

146
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.870
why would you get lumped lumped into the same group as a guy who has a truck who

147
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:28.290
did do that?
Why should you?
It's not fair,

148
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.360
but we stuffed to figure this out.
It just,
there's something wrong.

149
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.140
There's something wrong with his dad that many more things that can kill us than

150
00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:37.650
us.

151
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.850
<v 0>If a guy pointed a gun at a year from across the room,</v>

152
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.160
do you have something in your head plan that you would do?
Oh,

153
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.380
there's nothing you can do.
I would do a bunch of cartwheels and somersaults.

154
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.350
That's always been like sort of my plan.

155
00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:52.400
I feel like if I just do weird movements,
uh,
you could avoid,

156
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:57.400
<v 2>this is almost nothing you can do.
Yeah.
You know,
it's um,</v>

157
00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.010
too terrifying,
terrifying thing.

158
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.450
The ability to just end someone's life with a single movement of your hand

159
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.970
<v 0>and we learned so early on,
I remember,
you know,
duck hunt as a kid,</v>

160
00:10:10.971 --> 00:10:13.130
the Nintendo like tick,
tick,
tick,
tick,
tick,
tick,
tick,

161
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.660
remember that and you had a gun.
It's like we learn so early on.

162
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:23.040
<v 2>Well it's just that people value people so poorly that they would do that.</v>

163
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.270
This is where we have to find like the root of what that is and that sounds,

164
00:10:28.271 --> 00:10:31.120
this sounds very philosophical and hippy dippy,
but

165
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.720
we have to examine what could possibly be inside someone that would make them

166
00:10:38.921 --> 00:10:42.790
want to do something like that.
What would that be?
I don't,

167
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.070
I mean how the fuck does that happen?
How does it,

168
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.280
how were there in the same timeline?

169
00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:52.120
We're not talking about like primitive Roman days or the vikings or anything

170
00:10:52.121 --> 00:10:53.530
crazy we're talking about right now.

171
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.680
How in the same timeline does a guy like you exist alongside someone who could

172
00:10:59.141 --> 00:11:02.560
do that?
There's something wrong.
There's a

173
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:08.150
<v 0>Elsa thing that there's something to be said about like awareness of depression</v>

174
00:11:08.151 --> 00:11:12.290
and psychological disorders for the older generation.

175
00:11:12.291 --> 00:11:16.760
I feel like in the future more people are gonna know about it and take it as a

176
00:11:16.761 --> 00:11:18.920
real thing.
But I still think now there's probably,

177
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.580
there's definitely a lot of stubborn parents out there that ignoring go,

178
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.990
you're not depressed,
get up,
you know,
and all of this.

179
00:11:26.991 --> 00:11:29.840
Cause it's definitely deep rooted,

180
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.170
a lack of structure in their lives.
You know,

181
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:37.760
stuff's gone wrong and they don't have anybody to talk to her.
Anything,
you know,

182
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.740
that's definitely a common thing.

183
00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:44.590
<v 2>100%.
The dissatisfaction with their current state in life,</v>

184
00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:45.970
their physical health,

185
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.960
people have all sorts of undiagnosed mental issues and maybe they don't have

186
00:11:49.961 --> 00:11:53.950
insurance and they can't afford treatment or maybe they just got off of it and

187
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:55.030
they think they're fine.

188
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.570
I mean we know guys who did that who got off of stuff that they weren't supposed

189
00:11:58.571 --> 00:11:59.111
to get off of.

190
00:11:59.111 --> 00:12:02.020
And then they start getting really paranoid and crazy and then someone else to

191
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:02.860
talk them down.

192
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:08.240
<v 0>And one of the things with being depressed like that is,
you know,</v>

193
00:12:08.241 --> 00:12:10.160
and like you said,
if they don't have insurance,

194
00:12:10.161 --> 00:12:11.180
then all of a sudden they're like,

195
00:12:11.181 --> 00:12:15.260
I don't have insurance a little did they know that it's a phone call away to get

196
00:12:15.261 --> 00:12:20.030
like,
you know,
free whatever somehow or help somehow,

197
00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:24.890
but also with the depression makes you not want to do that.
It makes you,

198
00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:29.030
it's part of it is you don't want to sort of find help.

199
00:12:29.031 --> 00:12:30.170
It's hard to reach out.

200
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:35.080
<v 2>Yeah.
You know,
when I find it,
it's interesting.
That is a,</v>

201
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.920
I think avoidable and then maybe we should all like think about this a little

202
00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:42.850
bit.
There's something that happens whenever something takes place,

203
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:48.400
um,
where people like expect a reaction,

204
00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.460
they expect a reaction from you.

205
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:57.330
And there's this tendency to get upset at people that are not showing a reaction

206
00:12:59.681 --> 00:13:02.380
to it.
Like publicly instantaneous.

207
00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:05.530
Like there's a responsibility to show a reaction.

208
00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:09.480
And I've been thinking about this and I was like,
is there,
I don't know,
cause I,

209
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:13.750
I had,
uh,
put something up I think on Twitter,
Instagram,

210
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.490
and someone's about our show in Bakersfield tonight.
And someone said,
hey,

211
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.200
maybe not a great time to promote.
There was a school shooting just saying,

212
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:27.460
or something like that.
I didn't know about it.
I don't think,

213
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.860
um,
maybe I'd heard peripherally that something happened.

214
00:13:32.861 --> 00:13:35.830
Like when I was flipping through Google,
but I didn't know the extent of it.

215
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.690
And then I saw and I was like,
oh my God.
Like,

216
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.343
<v 1>yeah,</v>

217
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.270
<v 2>I mean that is,
um,</v>

218
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.010
it's one of the worst things people can do to people.

219
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.400
It's to like snuff out young life for no reason.

220
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.310
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
it's crazy.
It's becoming so common.

221
00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:04.450
It's becoming common.
And um,
it's like there has to be a way to stop it.

222
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:08.020
It's almost like,
you know,
a way it's,

223
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.430
I feel like people have become so desensitized that like,

224
00:14:12.431 --> 00:14:16.090
it's almost like the new super suicide,
you know,

225
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:20.290
we're very desensitized because if this had happened 20 years ago,

226
00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:22.120
it'd be a gigantic thing.

227
00:14:22.121 --> 00:14:25.480
They would freak people out for days and days and it would be all anybody's

228
00:14:25.481 --> 00:14:29.170
talking about.
So in one sense of,
I did hear about a school,

229
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:34.210
I think maybe I'd seen something about the school getting shut down or
something.

230
00:14:34.211 --> 00:14:35.980
So I'm like,
Oh fuck something to happen.

231
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:43.380
And then going into it later,
the more I looked into it,
the miles like,
Oh God,

232
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.090
like this is just

233
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.850
the most heartbreaking news.
You could ever hear it,
right?

234
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:57.030
Someone decides to go kill kids
story.
You're talking about with a Texas.
Oh,

235
00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.250
okay.
Man,
who opened fire in Texas.
Church shooter was Harold is a Good Samaritan.

236
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.680
Oh,
there was that guy.
There was another guy though.

237
00:15:03.681 --> 00:15:06.200
It must've been the undercover cop cars.
It was the stabbing story.

238
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:11.210
I'm on a conflated them.
I do that on occasion.
Well,

239
00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:14.510
we got to got the story.
Uh,
in two instances,

240
00:15:14.511 --> 00:15:16.970
someone who wasn't supposed to be there with a gun had a gun.

241
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.790
One of them just have to be an undercover cop.

242
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.280
You don't want people to be vigilantes.

243
00:15:22.281 --> 00:15:26.000
You don't want people to be out there fucking Charles Bronson and that.
But

244
00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.100
<v 0>that was performing at a comedy club in Dallas a couple of weeks ago and I was</v>

245
00:15:31.101 --> 00:15:33.020
standing out front near the,
uh,

246
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:37.220
like the hosts booth for a second and they get a phone call and the guy goes,

247
00:15:37.221 --> 00:15:40.100
you know what sir?
I actually don't know.
Let me,
uh,
let me ask my boss.

248
00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:41.540
I've never been asked that before.

249
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.140
And he puts the phone on hold and goes to find the owner,

250
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.160
but like before he does,
I go,
what's that person asking for?
Like,

251
00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:51.530
I was just curious like what he's never been asked.
He goes,

252
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.580
he wants to know if he can bring his gun.
He has a concealed carry license.

253
00:15:55.581 --> 00:16:00.320
I don't know the exact laws here.
I'm like,
no,
don't ask the owner.

254
00:16:00.321 --> 00:16:05.300
He's not allowed to bring his gun and get back to that phone call.
No,
not my eye.

255
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:09.020
Two shows that night.
Like,
you know,
concealed carry.

256
00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:15.150
<v 2>Yeah.
I got a buddy of mine and Kerry's ever or war.
Wow.</v>

257
00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.850
Everywhere.
Manna.
Yeah.

258
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.840
<v 0>Hope I never accidentally make five of them.</v>

259
00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:24.720
<v 2>It's firearms instructor now he's,
he carries everywhere.</v>

260
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.700
He lives in Arizona.
You could do whatever the fuck you want.
And Arizona,
Arizona,

261
00:16:29.701 --> 00:16:30.790
thanks to stay 1800

262
00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.000
<v 0>do you think if I did my cartwheel somersault thing,</v>

263
00:16:33.001 --> 00:16:34.320
it's still be able to get me though?

264
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:38.630
<v 2>Uh,
maybe not.
Maybe not.
You are a clever fellow.</v>

265
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:47.940
<v 4>Yeah.</v>
