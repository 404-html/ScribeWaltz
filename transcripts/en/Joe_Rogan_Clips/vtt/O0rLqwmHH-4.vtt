1
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.880
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.170
So I'm fascinated by your general program,

3
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:10.290
like what you're doing all day with all this stuff.
Like what's,

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.290
what's the current Joe Program?
Well,

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.470
I'm always doing something,
you know.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.660
And in terms of like diet you mean?
Or in terms of like the workout,

7
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.290
what's the Diet?
What's the meditation?
What's the main tenants of your day?
Well,

8
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.780
my workout,
I schedule every Sunday.

9
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.150
I schedule everything that I'm going to do during the week.

10
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.670
And I say I have to do yoga two times this week.

11
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.330
I have to lift weights three times this week.
I have to run twice this week.

12
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.630
And however I fit that in,
I fit that in.
But I owe those things.
Okay.

13
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.460
So I have to get those things in.
The only exceptions are injuries and sickness.

14
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.230
So those,
that,
that's the,
the,
the schedule.
And then on top of that,

15
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.560
uh,
there's other things that I enjoy doing.
Kickboxing,
Jujitsu,

16
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.920
work those in when I can.
Then,
um,
diet.

17
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.180
The Diet is pretty strict in terms of like no bread,

18
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.460
very few carbs,
no sugar,
no bullshit,
like healthy food.

19
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.300
A lot of vegetables.
Lots of meat game meat,
mostly wild game,

20
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.100
and I take vitamin supplements every day.
I take multivitamins,

21
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:17.100
I take probiotics,
I take a vitamin B,

22
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:20.530
12 and D and a lot of different things.
I just,
um,

23
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.790
I do everything that I can to put my body and my brain in a good place so that

24
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.710
I'm keeping my engine smooth.
I'm changing my oil,
I'm changing my spark plugs.

25
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:34.530
I'm making sure that it's operating.
I mean,
it's not going to be perfect,

26
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:39.450
but yeah,
I know that I've done my best to keep it working the best that it can.

27
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.520
That who's the person that advises you on like nutrition because our guy who

28
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.370
taught you how to do it,
how do you do it?
Well,

29
00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:51.120
there's a ton of people that I've used as a resource.
Um,

30
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.490
there's a woman that I have on the podcast on a regular basis.

31
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:56.970
Her name is Doctor Rhonda Patrick,
and she's probably the best resource.

32
00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:59.910
Like I sent her something the other day on some new,

33
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.590
some new study on saturated fats.
Like whenever I,
there's some sort of an issue.

34
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:08.720
There's a new study on cryotherapy or Saunas.
So like,
uh,

35
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.670
the Saunders are incredibly effective.
I don't know if you ever just sauna.

36
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.860
So with the UV rays or what is it?
The um,
what,

37
00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:21.400
what is it called?
Not Ultraviolet.
Infrared.
Thank you.
Right?
Yeah,

38
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.890
we just got one of those Saunas are giant,
you know,

39
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.840
the raising of the body temperature like that and a heat shock proteins,

40
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:29.310
incredibly beneficial to your body.

41
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:32.760
There was a study that they put out recently that showed a 40% decrease in

42
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:37.230
mortality from all causes due to people who take regular sauna.

43
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.420
Like it just literally keeps your body healthier.

44
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.020
Having that massive exposure to heat and the,

45
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:45.930
your body producing these heat shock proteins,
it just,
it,

46
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.760
it reduces inflammation.
It just,

47
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.410
it helps in so many different areas for people and it's just,
you know,

48
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.880
sit down in the hot room.
It's really good for your body.

49
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.240
Regular is how many times a week?
Um,
for Sauna,

50
00:02:57.241 --> 00:03:01.030
I think they were saying four times a week.
Oh,
but I mean,
how hard is that man?

51
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:04.140
Just force yourself to sit in it.
I mean,
if you have it at home and particular,

52
00:03:04.141 --> 00:03:08.110
sure.
I've got your gym.
Just go there and sit in that fucker for 15 minutes.

53
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:11.060
It doesn't take long.
Well,
I mean I have to get all this written up.
I'm going to,

54
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.850
how about this?
I do everything you do.
We make that a special.

55
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:19.840
It's the Judd does Joe's programs.
You have to gear up.

56
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.950
I got a bulk up.
I got,
well I may have already booked up.
Build up like your,

57
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.870
your joints and all that stuff's got to get used to that kind of a pounding.

58
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.920
Yeah,
there's a lot.

59
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.460
Lot of shit is going to be happening if you want to do everything I do,

60
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.310
so I can't just do 12 pounds on a freeway.
You just said you don't want,

61
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.570
I mean it's not even,
you don't,
you're not going to want to do everything.
I do.

62
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.960
Yeah.
Like I have a friend who runs ultra marathons and I just started running

63
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:45.460
recently within the last couple of months.

64
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.680
I'm not running a fucking ultra marathon.
I'm not doing everything.
He,

65
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.470
I'll do everything you do.
I would break.
It would break my feet,
my knees.
Yeah.

66
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.430
You gotta just build up,
you gotta to have time to,
yes.
There's something about,

67
00:03:57.431 --> 00:03:59.650
you know,
when you run TV shows,
it's all freaking day every day.

68
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:01.930
So people will say,
when do you work out?
I'm like,
there's no time.

69
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.960
What am I going to wake up at five in the morning and putting two and a half

70
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:08.140
hours?
Like I drive my kids to school at seven 40.
That's one thing.

71
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:09.640
You don't need two and a half hours.
Yeah.

72
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.120
You could get a great workout and in 40 minutes and that's all you need for the

73
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:14.950
whole day.
100%.
You really can't,

74
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:18.180
especially if you run like I run hills and um,

75
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.820
I can get it done in a half an hour,
like a fucking brutal workout,

76
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:26.520
a two mile brutal hill climbing workout in half hour,
I'm exhausted.
Yeah.

77
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.920
You know,
this idea of time,
like how much time did you put in today?

78
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:34.600
Like you could work out in a bullshit manner for two hours and not get nearly as

79
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:38.620
much done as you can for a half hour.
Hard just running.

80
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.820
We're like interval training.
Yeah,
yeah.
Sprints and then relax,

81
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:44.800
then sprints again.
But uh,

82
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:48.130
I just think being active and doing something on a daily basis,

83
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:51.790
forcing your body to get used to the fact that it's going to constantly being,

84
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.870
be working constantly being under stress,
and then it just,

85
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.690
it gives you more energy.
It's like you,
you have more of a gas tank,

86
00:04:58.691 --> 00:05:02.320
you have more enthusiasm for things.
That's the scary part about Trump.

87
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.410
His theory on exercises.

88
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.770
You only have so much energy per day and he thinks that exercise uses it up.

89
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.690
Yeah.
And so he doesn't ever exercise.

90
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.730
That's got to come back out of it someplace.
Not fucking 70.
I mean,
how was it?

91
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:18.810
And I come back at him already,
but he also,
I mean he's,

92
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.260
he's not mitigating stress.
That's part of it.
Is Your perspective enhancing?

93
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.160
For me the most important thing about,
I don't know,

94
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.850
maybe they're not the most important thing.

95
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:31.630
One of the best things about exercise is that it gives me a perspective,

96
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.520
a better,
a more enhanced perspective.

97
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:36.790
Cause I know I'm not coming at it from a stressful body.

98
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:40.720
Like my body is not tense so I can come at things in a calm way.

99
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:43.660
I've drained all the bullshit out of my interesting.
Yeah.

100
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.020
And Are you doing meditation or what are you doing in that way?

101
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.870
I have a sensory deprivation tank.
Yeah.

102
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.140
So I do most of my meditation in that you do an ultra climb and yeah,

103
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.010
a climb in and I float.
Yeah.
I love that.
That's one of my favorite.

104
00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.290
You ever do it?
Uh,
no.
I can imagine you must,

105
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.900
especially for you because you're working on things all the time.

106
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:05.870
Like if you go in there with an idea,
like I'll go in there with a bit,

107
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:09.890
like I've got this bit that I'm working on right now,
that's kind of complicated.

108
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:10.370
And uh,
uh,

109
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.040
sometimes I'll just be sitting there staring at the wall just thinking about

110
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:16.160
this one bit because I'm trying to figure out how to,
how to structure it.

111
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.900
It's super complicated bit.

112
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.170
And I'll go in that tank and I'll just sit there for an hour.

113
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.260
I'll just try to work out this bit and tried to figure out if there are other

114
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:26.360
angles to it is other ways to come at it.

115
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.140
The only unconfusing thing is when I have an idea in the tank and it seems like

116
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:33.020
I got it.
I got to get out of the tank and then they got to write things down.

117
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.090
And you need a special pad in the packets.

118
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.590
I think I need a voice activated recorder.
I think that's a good idea.
Yeah,

119
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.880
I think that's what I need where I can just talk.
Yeah.
Okay.
So I need the tank.

120
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.200
You need it.
I have the spa.
You have a spa.
Um,

121
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.010
I need a hill to run on hills are good.
I got,
I need more of my Onnit products.

122
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.480
Do you lift weights at all?
Uh,
no.
I,

123
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.700
I have an idea to do a little bit of something just to keep your body strong.

124
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.170
It's like as you get older,

125
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.440
your body atrophies and there's just no way around it,

126
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.160
especially if you're not using it.
And,
yeah,

127
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.170
the only way to keep it from atrophying is to make sure that you put it under

128
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:10.004
stress.

129
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.250
You have to lift weights and it's the only way it keeps your bone density,

130
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:17.390
keeps your tendon strength,
your muscle strength.
There's no other way,
you know?

131
00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:18.530
And otherwise he's getting injuries.

132
00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:22.010
People get back into the reason arm injuries and shit just starts falling apart

133
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:24.710
on you.
See,
I've had no injuries due to not doing anything.

134
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.700
That's how I've been protecting my,
my,
my body.
But yes,
I do know that.

135
00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:29.534
That's the thing to do.

136
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.050
I remember I always heard about Clint Eastwood doing that and I met Clint

137
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.080
Eastwood when he was like 80.
And I know he's like,
he lifts heavy weights.

138
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:41.000
That's his thing.
It's like heavyweights.
And he was a truck at 80.
Yeah.

139
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.770
And so,
uh,
but I don't like,
uh,
lifting things.

140
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.170
I don't even like counting,
counting,
hire a trainer.
Yeah.
You know,

141
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.900
get someone to devise a program.
Yeah.
Have them come to you,
work you out.

142
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.570
You don't have to do shit.
You just show up.
You know,

143
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:02.990
like you could do it in your house.
They show up at 6:00 AM or whenever it is,

144
00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:06.290
and like,
come on John,
I got you for the next 45 minutes.
And you're like,

145
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:08.620
all right,
here we go.
And just make,

146
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.590
when you hate that stuff really is tough when you haven't built your brain to

147
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:13.000
love it.

148
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.510
I've been playing a lot of tennis lately as a way to way great wake up and uh,

149
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.180
but I do know that I need to do it,
but man,

150
00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:23.570
it is when you're like of the mindset that when the trainer comes,

151
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:27.020
you want to punch him in the face.
It's a tough,
it's a tough thing.

152
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:36.460
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
