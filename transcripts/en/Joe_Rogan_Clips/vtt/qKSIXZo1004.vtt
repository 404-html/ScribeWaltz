1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.210
The team,
both Nathan nationwide investigation,

2
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.080
but the Guardian reveals for the first time what really happens at journey's
end.

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.760
Whoa.
That sounds like a m night Shyamalan movie.
Right?

4
00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:14.300
That kill a bunch of homeless people like Satan's involved.

5
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.220
It's like they just moved them away.
What did they say?
Where are they?
Ship them.

6
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.253
<v 1>I don't know.</v>

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.680
<v 0>Looks like this.
Throwing them down in Miami and in La.</v>

8
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.440
<v 2>Oh,
well I lives in Colorado.
In Colorado.</v>

9
00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:39.490
People would hold,
his people would commit crimes.

10
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.480
They figured out what crimes they would get 60 days for.

11
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.860
<v 2>And they would commit that crime,
plead guilty.</v>

13
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.350
Do the 60 days just to get out of the winter

14
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.790
because of those days.
Boldly would give you tobacco.

15
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.400
You were alive,
they would give you tobacco,
but you had to roll it.

16
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.890
That type of shit.

17
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.910
A Boulder County jail in 1991 boulder county jail and some other jail.

18
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.440
We're voted number one and two jails in the country.
Wow.

19
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.810
That people would want to go to those jails.

20
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.930
Then boulder built the new jail and it became fucking commy.

21
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.210
This lamb like aspen Cardenas land.
Yeah.
Like no cigarettes.

22
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:24.970
Everybody had a way.

23
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.550
Uniforms no more staying up till two in the morning when I was around with the

24
00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:33.130
other way.
Boulder County jail the way.
What was good?
The good way up?

25
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.940
Boulder County jail.
It was a paradise.
Well,
what was wrong with that?

26
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.390
<v 0>It got out.
It got out that it was too nice.
Right?
So like I'm telling you,</v>

27
00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:45.170
homeless people would commit a crime to do 60 days.
Can I ask you something guys?

28
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.160
There's a person who's been in jail.
Go ahead.
Would it motivate you more?

29
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.570
This is an honest question.

30
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.920
Would it motivate you more if you were in jail and it was nice and comfortable

31
00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:59.000
in there and you got to relax and calm down or would it motivate you more if

32
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.450
they brought you into some communist type jails?
You described it with everybody.

33
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:05.450
I'd wear uniforms.
There was no cigarettes,
there was no fun.

34
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.920
They eliminated your outside time,
but I did.
I did them both.

35
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.840
What would you think is a person who's been through what would be most effective

36
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.970
in rehabilitating you?

37
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.200
<v 2>I mean that's the idea,
right and rehabilitative right now.
You said to me,</v>

38
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.980
you got to stay this fucking building for six months.

39
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.670
This is going to be a jail.
There's like Pablo Escobar's jail.

40
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.070
It's still jail.

41
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.230
I want you to remember that you can not leave the building for six months.

42
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.270
I will let you go out to the front of the cage one hour a day.

43
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.320
But you got to figure out what you're going to do with the hip at 12 months.

44
00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:51.100
It's a cage.
Yes,
I have more options here.
I can lift weights,

45
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.330
do different parts of my body.
I could shoot pool,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

46
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.650
Boulder was very simple.
Boldly,
you got up,

47
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:02.420
they gave you the letters.
You either took them away,
get it.

48
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.300
Now I want to get my own cars.
So you called home at lunchtime.

49
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.690
Joe Rogan brought me my jeans,
my sneakers,
my tee shirts.

50
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.640
I'm wearing my own clothes.

51
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.170
So now that determine what you were in for a nonviolent and violent.

52
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.820
If you're in London,
violent offender,
the world is yours.

53
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.410
The violent ones,
the ones that get lumped in together.

54
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.420
So now the violent offenders,
uh,

55
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:31.000
depending on what you do as violent,

56
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.810
you go into one sector and that sector,

57
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.670
the longer you're in to have and the more rewards you get from,

58
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.850
if you're in green,
you stay up till 10 and they got cable TV.

59
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.640
If you are red,
you Steptoe 11 and they got cable TV.

60
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:52.530
If you're purple,
you stepped on a one 1:00 AM,
oh my God,
both.

61
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.250
The county jail was tremendous.

62
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.730
So I didn't drink milk.

63
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.220
Milk is big in jail because the body builders like milk.
It's like fucking drugs.

64
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.660
So I would trade you and you my milk for your Koolaid.

65
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.670
All right.

66
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.670
So I was in there drinking fucking Koolaid because I fucking hate them.

67
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.580
Boulder was a paradise compared to other jails.

68
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.580
I don't listen to this Thanksgiving day when I was locked up tax every day.

69
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.400
Yeah,

70
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.320
the guard came in and I'll never forget his name was Ron and he opened up the

71
00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:30.970
south door and there was a phone that,

72
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.450
I think it was anybody who needs to use the phone.
He was the phone.

73
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.920
I figured out,
you know those days you had a press mind,
they got an outside line.

74
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.420
I pressed eighth to see if I get long distance.
Nothing that breast seven,

75
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.610
six not been fired for fucking long business.

76
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.440
I got the call,
my peeps in Jersey for 20 minutes a piece.
You know,

77
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:55.510
you just figure out different days.

78
00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.540
Then they sent you to a place where somebody looks you in the eye and says strip

79
00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:03.750
down and you've got to go take a shower.

80
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.420
And then you come out and they put a finger up your ass to see if that's

81
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:12.150
contraband.
Ooh.
And they,
they give you a tidy whities and orange show,

82
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.660
put like a rubber glove on and then loop different her up.

83
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.820
It doesn't matter at that point I didn't give a fuck you putting a finger up my

84
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:23.080
ass.
It breaks you down as a man,
as much as anything in the world.

85
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.150
That's the first breakdown.
Wow.
The turn you around to let you know they run you,

86
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.070
they're going to stick it up your ass and you go to Esl and that,
those guys,

87
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:36.400
and they're not very nice.
They weren't like the Boulder County jail guys.

88
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:39.790
Those guys would kick your bed and make you get up,

89
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.050
try and get light on the middle of the night and say,
get out of bed.

90
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:47.020
We're going to do a search at two in the morning.

91
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.850
Those people are not nice at all.
Then I got transferred to Summit County jail,

92
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.160
which was a fucking paradise.
Paradise.

93
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.220
Paralyze him bull all day outside TV till two in the morning.

94
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.030
He freezing yourself,
black and white TVs and yourself.

95
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.170
Basic cable.

96
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.000
You could be up all night if you wanted to go to breakfast,
you ate breakfast.

97
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:18.200
If not,
you could sleep through breakfast and we'd eat your breakfast for you.

98
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.560
And then from there they shipped me off to the Department of corrections.

99
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.110
That's where it's the nitty gritty.

100
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.570
If you think black people talking to a movie theater at night,
don't go there.

101
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.780
Don't go that black people talk all night.

102
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.260
It's six or seven floors and I was in there in August with full humidity canyon

103
00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:47.230
city,
Colorado.
Wow.
All right.
With a little window,
you know.

104
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.830
And that was like on the third floor.

105
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:52.640
I couldn't read and in those days they let you out.

106
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.600
You can Ku showers a week and one hour a day.

107
00:06:56.601 --> 00:07:01.601
You went outside after that you would just in a cell by yourself at night or

108
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.770
froze the daytime.

109
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.470
It was like fucking being sweating in a fucking 10 can.

110
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.010
You wouldn't attend Canada the

111
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.260
that way from this name Charles Shit.

112
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.810
There's nothing to showers and then the three meals and then that,

113
00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:28.250
and then the first week is good because you actually get out of your cell to go

114
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:32.810
test.
They tested everything.
Your math,

115
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.770
your English,

116
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.100
they fucking put a bunch of pictures of in front of you and they put you to

117
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:40.130
psychiatry.
They take your blood out,

118
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.180
they do everything and then they assess you and then they have,

119
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:50.120
I took care of all of the dots.
Okay.
There's a bunch of dots.
You have to,

120
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.770
you have to dot your i's like if you have a high school diploma,

121
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.650
you get a point.
If you were working at the time of arrest,

122
00:07:57.651 --> 00:08:01.250
you get a point if you were up to paying rent.

123
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:03.860
So I got a bunch of points for that.
It's so funny out.
