1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
With his arms down right below there.
Jamie on the bottom.
Bottom row.
Yeah.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.300
That guy looks he's having a good time.
But that's a fun dude fucking party.

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.930
Super High.
Why the world needs happy men.

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.650
That's the what kind of fucking article is that?
I mean who wrote that?

5
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:18.450
Some depressed dude,
right about to shoot himself.

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.900
He's got a gun sitting on the desk right next to the laptops.

7
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:23.610
Like why the world needs happy man.

8
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.940
I'm trying to think of it right.
It's like,
yeah,
we'll come back guy.

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.020
That dude's fat.
That's,
Oh Bert wishes he was dead.
His kidney,

10
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.480
dangerous amount of berries.

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.780
Bird fucking loses all this weight.
Every year we do this weight loss thing.

12
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.600
Me Follow along.
You're crazy as to what?

13
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:48.430
The hot yoga and he fucking gains it all back every year.
Yeah.

14
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.530
Every year I saw him at soul cycle with his wife's fuck.
Yeah.
And he just,

15
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.310
I mean that's unbelievable.
He keeps telling me,
cause he sent,

16
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.830
he sent out a mass text test the other day that we have,

17
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.410
there's a group on my phone called the sober October group,

18
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.670
but it is one of the best text message threads ever.
It's ruthless.
Yeah,

19
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.260
it's Segura Ari,
me and Bert and uh,
and look at them.

20
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.680
Something's burning with Bert.
Kreischer that burn is not calories.

21
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.460
That's what's not burning.
No.
Um,
but he sent out this message of the day,

22
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:20.100
like I miss the heart rate monitors.

23
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.390
He's probably all drunk watching,
saving private Ryan.
So sad.

24
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.530
What the fuck am I doing?
Do you guys,
you guys talking without me?

25
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:35.480
What are you doing?
What's going on over there?
Hey guys,
I miss you guys.

26
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.380
I love Birdman.
He goes out,

27
00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:41.090
he'll do a comedy club and then go out and tell everyone where he's going to

28
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.050
drink and then he meets them at the bar.
Takes the shirt off in Ottawa.

29
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.240
It's like 150 degrees below zero.
He drinks with the mall and then leaves.

30
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.910
Love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Then he gets in his tour bus,
right?
I mean,

31
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.330
I don't,
I don't go to the second location,
you know,
I'll,

32
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.450
I'll hang out at the club a little bit,
take pictures of stuff,
but people,

33
00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:04.930
and they have a beer,
but like when people are like,
hey,
you should go to our bar.

34
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.230
Nope.
Yeah,
I've done it in the past.
I used to in the past.

35
00:02:08.231 --> 00:02:12.340
But after a while becomes untenable.
Yeah.
Well you can't,
cause you're,

36
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:17.050
you're playing like 5,000,
10,000 seaters now.
Yeah.
That's a lot of pictures.

37
00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:18.940
You can't,
you're,
I watched,

38
00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:23.380
I watched Jo Koy hanging out with where I'm like,
they're going to kill him.

39
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.600
Like they're going to,
they're going to tear his clothes off.

40
00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:29.450
Like Elvis used to almost get shredded by female nails.
You know,
like,

41
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.440
there's so many people trying to get a selfie with him and he just played a

42
00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:37.180
stadium and he's just outside.
Wow.
Just like,
dude,
just Joe,

43
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.290
just careful security.
Yeah.
He's got,
he's got some people with him for sure.

44
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.340
The tasers and whips.
Yeah.
Different guy.
Different,
uh,
different.

45
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:49.670
He has the,
there's like a lady Taser.
It's not as strong.
And there's like dude,

46
00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:53.390
Taser for the various kinds of fans.
Yeah,
you gotta be careful,

47
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.800
but God bless him.
I mean that's kind of how he got that big.

48
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.480
The thing about Burt's fans is at Burt's fans were all drunk too,
right?

49
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:05.190
So they're probably not even going to know what to do or you don't remember if

50
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.520
they were going to kidnap him.

51
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:09.340
They give it up when they meet him yet the next day they checked their phone

52
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:11.860
like,
oh that's selfies all blurry and shit like yeah.

53
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:14.620
Well your hand was shaking from the dts while you tried to take it.

54
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:18.970
So coming back to town real quick,
give me a self,
your mirror selfie.
Come on.

55
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:23.290
Book tries to dress up my Facebook.
My wife's not talking to me.
Burden a,

56
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:25.600
your jokes in the only thing keeping me going and uh,

57
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.770
the heart's not too strong these days.
The doc doesn't say I have long,

58
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.780
so please don't come around writing this article for vox about why the world

59
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:35.614
needs happen.
Man.

60
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.470
You got three bullets in the chamber of Spanish once every six hours.

61
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.890
Russian rule.
That's one bullet,
not mine.
Boats.
Nah,

62
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.680
not Verne's not Verne's roulette mind with three bullets.
