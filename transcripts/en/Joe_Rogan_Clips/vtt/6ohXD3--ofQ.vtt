Hello Freak bitches that this,

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.700
I wrote a piece about it and national review about this,
you know,
you,

3
00:00:06.701 --> 00:00:09.520
you say that the level of hatred directed toward Trump is warping Trump.

4
00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:12.610
I think that it's also warping some people on my side of the aisle who are,

5
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.960
who are so you know,

6
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.350
interested in the fight that they're less interested in advancing the policies

7
00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:19.990
that I'd like to see achieved.
So I think there's a whole group of people where,

8
00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:22.060
let's say that Trump would just resign tomorrow,
he'd say,
you know what?

9
00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:23.110
I've had it,
screw it.
I'm out.

10
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.560
And Mike Pence becomes president and then Mike Pence proceeds to do all the

11
00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:27.880
things conservatives want them to do.
You know,

12
00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:32.500
we get tax reform and we limit immigration and we do do all of these things.
But,

13
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.230
but he does not tweet about Mika Brzezinski is bloody phase.

14
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.590
I think there's a whole group of people on the right would be pissed that miss

15
00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:41.230
it.
Yeah.
I think that right now,
cause it's fun.

16
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.920
What exactly what they want is somebody who pisses off the left more than beats

17
00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:47.230
the left,
right.
Pisses them off.
If you piss off the left.

18
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.170
I think Obama sort of trolled some of the right into insanity.

19
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.980
I think there are a lot of people on our side where it's like this jerk,
he just,

20
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.960
he keeps saying things just to Piss us off.

21
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.350
And Obama did do some of that and so Trump has kind of a Twitter troll and so he

22
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.210
does the same thing.
We're like,
yeah,
that's awesome.
Like two days ago,

23
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.650
Trump or yesterday,

24
00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:08.350
there was a report that Trump said that he thinks the White House is shabby.

25
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.320
Now I can say is somebody on the conservative right?
My entire life.

26
00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:14.040
If Obama said that,
we would not let him forget that for 1000 years.
Oh,

27
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.490
that the White House is shabby.
I mean,

28
00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:18.850
let's say it's an ass move to say that the people's house is shit.
First of all,

29
00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:21.460
it's a mansion,
right?
Like in second of all,

30
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.750
this is the most iconic building on the face of the planet.
It,
oh,
it's shabby.

31
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.460
How is it chat?
What was he saying?
It was shabby.
He,
he said,

32
00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:31.480
he said they were asking him why he gets his visits,
his golf courses so much.

33
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.180
And he said,
oh because the cause,

34
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.500
cause my golf courses are nicer because the White House a shabby.

35
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.610
But there are people on the right where like fine.
It's funny like you know,

36
00:01:39.611 --> 00:01:40.660
at least he's trolling the left.

37
00:01:40.661 --> 00:01:43.840
At least it's ticking them off and say guys ticking off the left is not a

38
00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:46.490
substitute for defeating the left if you actually care about the feeding the

39
00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:49.600
left.
Like this is one of the things that drives me nuts.
It cause my,
you know,

40
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.040
my life goal has been to promulgate particular ideas,

41
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.250
not just to piss off the left,

42
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.400
but I think that in the fight there are a lot of people who have fallen into the

43
00:01:57.401 --> 00:01:59.860
trap of thinking these two things are identical,
right?
You pissed off the left.

44
00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:03.760
That means you're winning.
It's like no pissing off the left.
Maybe part of it.

45
00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:05.380
But that's not how you win.

46
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.600
You win by saying things that are true and if they get pissed,
they get pissed.

47
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.760
<v 1>Well,
my good friend,</v>

48
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:13.761
Bill Byrd did this piece about Obama back when Obama was mocking Trump and

49
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:18.870
saying the one thing that I am that you'll never be as the president of United

50
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.890
States.
The crowd went nuts.
You remember when he did that?
Yeah.

51
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.040
And Obama was saying this on stage,

52
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:27.510
and you see Trump and the audience boiling was,
you know,
big frog,
double chin,

53
00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:28.980
just sitting there eating at all,

54
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.060
and that fucking stuck in his craw.
Okay.

55
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.761
<v 0>There there's,</v>

56
00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:37.360
there's a whole story that came out from buzzfeed about his interaction with a

57
00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:41.290
guy named Mckay Coppins reporter for buzzfeed in which Mckay was basically like

58
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:43.210
saying to Trump,
like,
you're a joke.
You're not going to run.

59
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.220
I think Trump ran just to,

60
00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:47.830
just because he was sick of people telling him that he wasn't going to be

61
00:02:47.831 --> 00:02:50.920
pressing until,
yeah.
I really think that's,
that's half of what drives him.

62
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.470
That doesn't mean that he cannot do good things.
I hope he does do good things.

63
00:02:53.471 --> 00:02:56.740
He's the president.
I want every president to do things I like,
but you know,

64
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.480
he's going to have to get it under control.

65
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.610
<v 2>Yeah.</v>
