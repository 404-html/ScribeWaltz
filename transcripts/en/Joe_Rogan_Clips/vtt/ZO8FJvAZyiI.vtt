WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.181 --> 00:00:01.980
So we're seeing,
uh,
you know,

2
00:00:01.981 --> 00:00:06.170
if you'd look now at what are the big drivers of,
uh,

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.370
infectious diseases right now in the,
in,
in not only in the US,
but globally,

4
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:15.210
there really some interesting forces.
And a lot of them are social determinants.

5
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:18.360
So a big one is poverty.
That's,
that's a huge one.

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.950
The other big one is political instability in war because it interrupts public

7
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:25.710
health control measures.
So for instance,
Venezuela,

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.690
which was leading public health control and Latin America for decades,

9
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.390
you know,
with the collapse of the economy in,
in the,

10
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:37.380
in the Chavez era now until the Madora area Madora area,

11
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:40.400
we've got a terrible situation where,
uh,

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.060
we've had measles return in a big way.
So huge numbers of cases of measles.

13
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.470
We fed all of the neglected tropical diseases come back,
uh,

14
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.310
as well as malaria,
chagas disease,
leishmaniasis.

15
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.540
So it's really interesting how that is destabilizing the whole region because

16
00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:01.800
now Venezuela has one of the largest diaspora is of people as big as the

17
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:03.840
diaspora coming out of Syria and Iraq.

18
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.130
So now that the diseases are moving into adjacent areas of Brazil and Colombia

19
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:12.020
and Ecuador.
And so it's really,
and that's another big drivers,

20
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.500
political instability.
The third one,
uh,

21
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.900
we think is climate change may be very important.
So,
you know,

22
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.930
why did we see this big a surge of chicken gunyah virus infection in the western

23
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:28.260
hemisphere or Zika?
We don't really understand the forces of that.

24
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.200
And what's going on in southern Europe right now is quite concerning.

25
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.970
We've had malaria returned to Greece,
uh,
after it's been gone for 70 years.

26
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:37.590
Malaria's returned to Italy.

27
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.490
We're seeing schistosomiasis and neglected tropical disease on the island of

28
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:45.070
Corsica.
We've got,
uh,
Danky,
uh,

29
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.410
chicken Gunyah West Nile virus across Italy,
Spain,

30
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.790
Portugal.
So we're trying to understand why that is.

31
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:57.630
And there's some thought that climate change may be a big driver of that.
Now,

32
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:01.910
what other infectious diseases or parasites rather,

33
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.640
do they have vaccines for two,
they have a vaccine for Toxo,

34
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.710
which there's no vaccine for toxoplasmosis.
Um,
there's a,

35
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.430
a prototype malaria vaccine that's,
yeah,
well it's,
it's an,

36
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.930
it's a VA.
There's a malaria vaccine.
It's called Moscow.
Rick's.

37
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:21.330
That's the trade name that was developed,
uh,

38
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:25.620
supported button with a lot of funding from the bill and Melinda Gates

39
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.210
Foundation.
And,
uh,
working in partnership with glaxosmithkline.

40
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.580
And that malaria vaccine now has been approved for use in children by the

41
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:36.600
European medicine agency.

42
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.220
And it's being introduced now in three countries in Africa,
Malawi,
Ghana.

43
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.380
And I forgot the third one.
I think it was tense.

44
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:46.020
Is there an adverse reaction that people have that that's tough.

45
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.450
Cause I know the traditional malaria medication,

46
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.340
I had friends that took it and had horrible nightmares.
Oem Larry M is terrible.

47
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:57.600
Yeah.
Gives you very lurid dreams and yeah know.
And so far,
no.

48
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.910
And there,
when you say children,

49
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:03.790
how old are the children that they're at vaccinating ending with this?
Well,

50
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:08.791
the problem that you get into with malaria is that before six months of age,

51
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:12.910
you have maternal antibodies and board.
You remember the word you're born with,

52
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:16.180
antibodies from your mother.
And those start to wane by six months of age.

53
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.070
So the ones who get hospitalized with measles was what's called cerebral

54
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:21.611
malaria,

55
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:26.500
which is a devastating condition or a severe malaria anemia,

56
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:27.700
which is also a killer.

57
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.900
Are those children between six months of age and five years of age.

58
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:35.200
So those are the ones that we want to protect now.

59
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.740
And it's one of the leading killers of children globally.
Right.

60
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.790
And we don't have the vaccine is sickle cell is connected to a crack,
right?

61
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:47.090
Sickle cell is,
it has something to do with,
uh,

62
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.550
people developing an immunity to malaria.
Yeah,
that's it.

63
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.430
I'm surprised you knew that and it not from Tiffany Haddish who's Tiffany had
it.

64
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:59.320
How dare you?
She's a very funny comedian.
Um,
I'm sure she is,

65
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.360
but she's,
well,
she's told me it's like,
wow,
it's not really immunity,

66
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.050
but it's a natural protection.

67
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:10.051
So individuals who have the sickle cell trait are seem to be partially resistant

68
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:12.514
to malaria.

69
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.090
And that's the thinking why the gene for sickle cell has been preserved in

70
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:23.641
Africa for so long is because it does confer some protection against malaria.

71
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:26.740
So it's a reason for keeping the gene and the gene pool.
Yeah,

72
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:30.070
we were actually discussing it because a friend that I grew up with died from
it.

73
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.380
Um,
so it seems to only exist in African Americans or Africans.

74
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:38.020
Is that correct?
Predominant.
Now there's some other places as well,

75
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:43.021
but predominantly places an African and among African Americans or people whose

76
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:46.450
ancestors came from these tropical climates where they price.
Yeah.

77
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:51.010
So it's pretty,
it's really quite an amazing story.
So,
um,
there's no,

78
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:55.510
no,
no.
Um,
vaccine for toxoplasmosis.

79
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.460
Is there anything on the horizon?

80
00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:59.980
Is there anything we worked on because that's a big one,
right?

81
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.480
It's a real big problem on people with HIV aids for instance.
That's a,

82
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.510
because it reactivates your toxoplasmosis and we even see it in,

83
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.820
I even see it in kids sometimes,
but the thing is activated.
How so?
Well,

84
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.100
what happens is,
um,

85
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.530
it's in some countries up to 30% of people are actually infected with

86
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:20.740
toxoplasma.

87
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.310
And the parasite has the ability to undergo a dormancy state in the body until

88
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.080
your immune system gets compromised,

89
00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:33.280
either because of aids or because if you get some kind of medicine that

90
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:37.420
suppresses your immune system and then it can reactivate it and cause what's

91
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:40.450
called cerebral toxoplasmosis,
which is quite serious.

92
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.330
So most people handle or toxoplasmosis very well,
you know,
you,
you,

93
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.470
you die with it and don't even know you have it.

94
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.050
But in some cases it gets reactivated.

95
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.460
Right now there doesn't seem to be a lot of incentive for developing a

96
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.860
toxoplasmosis most as vaccine.
Although I'd be very interested to,

97
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.320
to work on something like why would they be no incentive?

98
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:04.490
It's such a large scale disease.
It's hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

99
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:05.151
Right?
That's right.

100
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:10.151
And part of the problem is we have almost no information and the actual number

101
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:14.540
of people who have it and how extensive it is.

102
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.010
So we call that disease burden.

103
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:20.750
We don't have good disease burden estimates of toxoplasmosis tested.

104
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.370
I've had a bunch of cats and I'm at feral cats.
Yeah,
you preach and I'm crazy.

105
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.080
A good chance here.
Your are infected,
but as long as your immune system's intact,

106
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.260
then you're okay.
Now,
there is a,
uh,

107
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.740
a related disease that from cats called toxic crisis,

108
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.700
and that's a parasitic worm infection we're finding in the United States among

109
00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:39.710
the poor.
And that's a weren't.

110
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:43.720
So what happens is if you go into poor neighborhoods,
you know,
and,
uh,

111
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.550
you see a lot of feral cats and dogs and poor neighborhoods,

112
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.690
almost a hundred percent of them have this warm in their intestines and they're

113
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:53.000
seeding the environment with eggs in their feces.

114
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:56.090
And the feces are spread all over the poor neighborhoods.

115
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.800
Kids come into contact with them,

116
00:06:57.801 --> 00:07:02.120
and the worm has the ability to migrate through the brain and cerebral toxic

117
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:06.350
crisis.
Um,
and I think it's an important cause of developmental delays.

118
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:10.580
It's one of those neglected diseases in the u s and talk about in the book.

119
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.970
And there's no vaccine for that.
He was no vaccine for.

120
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.770
And we didn't have very little awareness about it.
Wow.
Yeah.

121
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.790
I've never even heard of it until just now.
So this is not rare.
I mean,

122
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.650
in some cases,
you know,
up to 10% of certain populations,
like African,

123
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.320
African Americans living in poverty are infected with it.

124
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.400
And it's primarily pets or does it,
is it rodents as well?

125
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.630
Mostly stray dogs.
And it's not even pets.
It's mostly straight dogs and cats.
And,

126
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.370
and I get,
and this is an example of a neglected tropical disease.
Here's,

127
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.870
here's a disease of up to 10% of African Americans living in poverty in the

128
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:48.890
United States and almost nobody is studying.
Wow.
Right?

129
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.330
And it can affect the way your mind functions.

130
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.300
And it's been linked now to developmental delays.
So,
you know,

131
00:07:56.301 --> 00:07:58.220
everybody wants to know why,
you know,

132
00:07:58.221 --> 00:08:02.300
kids living in poverty have developmental delays and people just assume it's

133
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:05.060
because they live in deprived environments and that sort of thing.

134
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.830
But I think toxic crisis is an important underlying reason for it.
Um,

135
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.160
and this is an example of a neglected disease.
You know,
we,
I mean,

136
00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:17.300
everybody's heard of Ebola,
right?
And everyone's worried about Ebola and,

137
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:20.330
and the truth is he is never going to come to the United States.

138
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.080
Why is it ever going to be,
cause it's too difficult to transmit.
Um,

139
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:26.420
unless you have a complete collapse in the health system.

140
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:29.450
We're never going to have Ebola epidemics in the United States,

141
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.800
but here's a disease of 10% of African Americans living in poverty and no one's

142
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:35.660
heard of it and there's no incentive to study it.

143
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.890
So that's why I'm trying to raise awareness about these poverty related
diseases.

144
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.290
And that's correct.
I mean,

145
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.930
I don't understand why people don't talk about that one.
That one seems insane,

146
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.680
right?
Yeah,
absolutely.
It's a no brainer.
Right?
And then so,
but you know,

147
00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:52.520
it's very hard to get people to care about diseases of poverty.
I mean,

148
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:57.210
and this is one of the striking things about when I wrote the book was,
you know,

149
00:08:57.211 --> 00:09:00.360
I've had a lot of success getting people to care about neglected tropical

150
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:05.361
diseases in Africa and worked with the U S agency for International Development

151
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.380
to support a package of medicines that's now being administered over a billion

152
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:15.000
people annually.
And that,
you know,
it was one of my proudest accomplishments is,

153
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.330
is helping to raise awareness about neglected tropical disease.

154
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:21.570
Like we've been talking about a hook and schistosomiasis in Africa,
Asia,

155
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:22.404
Latin America.

156
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:27.530
But the minute I talk about poverty related diseases in the u s the lights go

157
00:09:27.531 --> 00:09:31.770
up.
Why is it,
I don't know.
I can't,
I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.

158
00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:35.880
I've had so much success getting people to care about NTDs,

159
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:40.850
neglected tropical diseases and poor developing countries.
But you know,

160
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.400
there's been no response to this,
this book.
I mean,
it is a,
um,

161
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.280
and,
and the estimates that I come up on the booker,

162
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:53.100
we have 12 million Americans live in poverty with a neglected tropical disease,

163
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.410
toxic Darius.
This is one of them.

164
00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:58.710
Another one is chagas disease and the list goes on.

165
00:09:58.711 --> 00:10:02.460
And it's been very hard to get people to care about the poor in this country.

166
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.810
That's very strange to me.

167
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:07.380
And I've always said that about the way we treat other countries where we want

168
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:09.540
to send them aid and rebuild these countries.

169
00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:12.300
But we don't do anything about these terrible communities that have been

170
00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:15.600
terrible in this country for decades upon decades.
Right.

171
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:18.390
And so I try to make the point,
the world has changed,
you know,
this,

172
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:23.160
this old norm of global health developed versus developing.
It still exists,

173
00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:27.690
but it's going away where what we're seeing is our general arise,
uh,

174
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.880
and all,
all economies.
I mean,

175
00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:32.670
some African countries have eight or 9% economic growth,

176
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.700
but it's all leaving behind a bottom segment of society.

177
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.610
And so I don't care where you show me poverty,

178
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:43.611
whether it's in Texas or Alabama or Nigeria or Bangladesh.

179
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.540
I will show you these poverty related diseases.
And you know,
I,
I know,

180
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:52.960
um,
uh,
what's her name?
AOC.
Uh,
the congresswoman from New York has,

181
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.800
uh,
talked a little bit about hookworm and Alabama.

182
00:10:55.801 --> 00:10:59.580
So last time I was in Washington I dropped off a copy of the book in our office,

183
00:10:59.581 --> 00:11:02.750
but no response yet.
Well,
she's probably pretty busy too.
Yeah,

184
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.230
she's doing a lot of other stuff.
You had a magic wand and a,

185
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.710
someone said you could do whatever you want to fix this.
What would you do?

186
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.460
So,
um,
I,

187
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:17.010
I did meet with a couple of people on the hill and they asked me that question.

188
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:21.150
What's the magic wand?
And,
um,
there's a couple of things.
One,

189
00:11:21.151 --> 00:11:25.590
we need to actually look for these diseases because the problem is there.
The,

190
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.950
the disease,
they cause a very subtle like developmental delays.

191
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:30.960
So that if you're a,
you know,

192
00:11:30.961 --> 00:11:34.020
a kid who lives in poverty with developmental delays,

193
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:38.790
the pediatrician doesn't even think to do a test for toxic crisis.
So that Wa,

194
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.380
so we need to raise awareness.

195
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.300
We need to go into poor communities across the country and actually take a blood

196
00:11:45.301 --> 00:11:50.100
test and actually measure for the presence of that disease or that parasite.

197
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:53.710
Once you find that disease,
what would you do that?
Well,
it depends the disease.

198
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:55.220
In some cases we have treatments for him.

199
00:11:55.221 --> 00:12:00.221
Like the treatment for toxic crisis is a five day course of a simple pill of how

200
00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:05.190
Ben dissolve and it cures it and it cures it.
So,
yeah,
so that we have,
you know,

201
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.090
we have interventions.
So one,
you know,
doing what I call active surveillance,

202
00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:11.380
looking for these diseases.

203
00:12:11.381 --> 00:12:16.381
The other one is really trying to understand how these diseases are transmitted.

204
00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:20.710
What is it about poor neighborhoods that is facilitating transmission?

205
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.660
I think the third problem is the diagnostic test themselves because they're very

206
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:27.370
complicated tests.
Sometimes,
you know,

207
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:30.840
they are done at the Centers for Disease Control and prevention.
Um,

208
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.900
our lab or National School of Tropical Medicine does a few of them,

209
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.880
but it's not like,
you know,
when you go for a,

210
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.840
you go for blood work and your doctor and you get a little lab slip from quest

211
00:12:40.841 --> 00:12:44.440
diagnostics with the,
you know,
the blood chemistries,
the blood counts,

212
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.660
there's no box there for toxic and chagas disease.
So we need more,

213
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.660
uh,
improved test point of care,
diagnostic tests.

214
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.780
Not just improved tasks but just letting you make it more accessible.
Yeah.

215
00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.460
And so they don't have to send it off to the CDC or to,
you know,

216
00:13:00.461 --> 00:13:03.820
our National School of tropical medicine.
Is there a treatment for Toxo?

217
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.880
There is a treatment for toxoplasmosis.
What is it?
Um,

218
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.910
it's a para method means Sulfa drug.
But it requires a long treatment course.

219
00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.880
How long?
Uh,
I'd have to look up the number of days.

220
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:18.570
I haven't treated a patient with toxoplasmosis in a while,
but,

221
00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.290
and it kills it effectively.
It can.
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh,

222
00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:25.180
I thought it was something you kept for live well,

223
00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:27.110
if you don't get treated right.
Okay.

224
00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.760
And then if you're immune compromised and it comes back then that that's a

225
00:13:30.761 --> 00:13:31.594
problem as well.

226
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.210
So most people that have it really don't even know they have it actually.

227
00:13:37.211 --> 00:13:40.450
And most people who have neglected tropical diseases don't know they have it

228
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.360
either.
So that any,
in Texas for instance,

229
00:13:43.361 --> 00:13:47.050
we have transmission of a parasitic disease called chagas disease.

230
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:51.070
It's a cause of heart disease.
Um,
we,
you know,

231
00:13:51.071 --> 00:13:53.560
our family members of our faculty are,

232
00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:57.910
we're actually able to track down individuals who had donated blood.

233
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.980
Uh,
and the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Authority actually found,
uh,

234
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.160
somebody po people positive for chagas disease.

235
00:14:06.161 --> 00:14:09.970
They are told to go see your primary healthcare provider.
Uh,

236
00:14:09.971 --> 00:14:13.630
and there are unfortunately the primary healthcare providers not educated about

237
00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:17.080
these diseases and they just assume must be a false positive.
So,
you know,

238
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:20.440
our faculty attract them down and we're able to get them into treatment.

239
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:23.230
And what is a treatment for chocolates?
It's,
um,
it's a,

240
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:27.340
an anti parasitic agent called bins nit is all,
and that kills it.

241
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.140
That can kill if you catch it early enough,

242
00:14:29.141 --> 00:14:32.140
but sometimes you don't catch it early.
So if it becomes systemic,
then you have,

243
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.830
then that's why we're trying to develop a therapeutic vaccine for this disease.

244
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.640
But again,
it's a therapeutic vaccine for a poverty related disease.

245
00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:42.490
So it's very tough,
man.

246
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:46.450
So the point is these diseases are widespread among the poor and we just don't

247
00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:51.100
pay attention to them.
That's great.
It's,
and so I think,
you know,
again,

248
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.740
love to hear your thoughts.
I mean,
what is it that,
um,

249
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:59.420
we just turn our backs on the port in this country.
It's,
uh,
it's disturbing.

250
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.470
It's very disturbing as a dismissive attitude and they disproportionately affect

251
00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:06.650
people of color as well,
right?
Because,
um,
you know,

252
00:15:06.651 --> 00:15:11.510
it because it's so linked to poverty.
Well also write slavery.
Yeah.
I mean,

253
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.630
I mean the history of slavery in this country.
Then the,

254
00:15:13.631 --> 00:15:18.320
the history of systemic racism in places where they just literally would not

255
00:15:18.321 --> 00:15:20.660
sell homes to people who are African American.

256
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.900
All these things are connected to the,
the,

257
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.050
the contribution of maintaining these impoverished communities.

258
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.740
And there's been almost no effort whatsoever other than the people living in the

259
00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:32.720
community trying to do better and raise everybody up.

260
00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:38.080
There's been no effort whatsoever by the federal government to step in and try

261
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:43.091
to rehabilitate like a large scale approach to rehabilitating places like the

262
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:48.110
ghettos of Houston or Baltimore or Detroit.
You know,

263
00:15:48.111 --> 00:15:52.910
I thought I knew what poverty living on I was before I moved to Texas in 2011 I

264
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:56.420
was chair of microbiology at George Washington University and I thought,

265
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.190
I thought I knew what poverty looked like.

266
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:01.640
I moved down to the Gulf coast and it's a different animal.
I mean the,

267
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:05.600
the depth and breadth of poverty in the Gulf coast and the southern part of the

268
00:16:05.601 --> 00:16:10.601
United States is just extraordinary and it's been very hard to get people to,

269
00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:15.620
um,
want to really take it on.
And really address these,

270
00:16:15.621 --> 00:16:18.110
these poverty related diseases,
do you think?

271
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.360
What do you think the cause of it is?
I mean,
if you've,

272
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:25.040
you've studied this for quite a while.
What the cause of the neglect?
Yes.

273
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.860
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know what,
you know,

274
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:31.730
is it something about American exceptionalism or something?

275
00:16:31.731 --> 00:16:35.960
Like we just don't want to admit we have poor people.
Uh,
I don't know.
You know,

276
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.440
I wasn't the first to come up,
you know,
to raise this issue about poverty.

277
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.080
When I was in high school or junior high school,

278
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:45.010
I was forced to read a book and at the time I didn't care about it.

279
00:16:45.011 --> 00:16:49.280
It was called the other America.
It was written by,
uh,
uh,

280
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:54.110
fantastic,
um,
social activist named Michael Harrington.
Um,

281
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.320
who was,
uh,
I think someone told me is a very devout Catholic actually.
And so,

282
00:16:57.321 --> 00:17:01.520
and he wrote this book called the other America talks about the hidden poverty

283
00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:02.390
off the road.

284
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.400
And the actual number of people who live in extreme poverty hasn't changed since

285
00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:10.550
that book was written in the early sixties.
That book was helpful was,

286
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:15.530
but help Linden first Kennedy than Lyndon Johnson launched the war on poverty in

287
00:17:15.531 --> 00:17:20.240
1964.
I dusted off that book and it's still,
it's still works today.

288
00:17:20.241 --> 00:17:23.570
And that's how I start out talking about my book blue marble health about that

289
00:17:23.571 --> 00:17:27.510
book the other America by Michael Harrington.
Yeah.
That,

290
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:31.040
that is a very strange thing.

291
00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:34.400
Our acceptance of these communities.
And I mean,

292
00:17:34.401 --> 00:17:37.340
I've always said that if you want to make America a better place,

293
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:43.450
the best thing to do is not invade other countries or intervene.

294
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:48.350
The best thing to do is try to rebuild these impoverished communities.
Yeah.
Well,

295
00:17:48.351 --> 00:17:50.640
Gandhi,
Gandhi,
Gandhi once said,

296
00:17:50.641 --> 00:17:53.730
a civilization as judged by the treatment of its minorities.

297
00:17:53.731 --> 00:17:58.280
And we're not by that criteria.
We're not doing so well.
You know,
the,
um,

298
00:17:58.530 --> 00:17:58.861
we,

299
00:17:58.861 --> 00:18:03.540
our country was visited by the United Nations special repertoire on poverty and

300
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:07.080
into 2017 and his numbers came up with,

301
00:18:07.081 --> 00:18:12.081
we have 19.4 million Americans who live in what's called extreme poverty.

302
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:14.250
That isn't half the U S poverty line.

303
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.240
And roughly around 5 million Americans living on less than $2 a day.

304
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.160
The same benchmark you'd use for global poverty everywhere million.
Yeah.

305
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.690
And,
and guess what,
those probably all having neglected tropical diseases.

306
00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:28.950
Five just,
just like,

307
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.160
just like those living in extreme poverty in Africa and there are 5 million

308
00:18:32.161 --> 00:18:36.420
people living on $14 a week to $2 a day.
Yeah.
That's insane.
Yeah.

309
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:42.480
The University of Michigan Center on poverty is also shown that we have a,

310
00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:46.740
I forget the number,
2.7 million families living on less than $2 a day,

311
00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:49.620
which is probably about the same as the 5 million number.

312
00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.760
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
And again,</v>

313
00:18:52.761 --> 00:18:56.090
this is not a topic that is very popular.
I mean,
when,

314
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.180
when you see presidential debates,
this is,

315
00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.230
<v 0>this is not something that comes out now.
Nobody talks about it.
And again,</v>

316
00:19:01.231 --> 00:19:02.490
even for disease,
I mean,

317
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:07.510
what are the diseases we hear about Ebola and La Diseases like that.

318
00:19:08.401 --> 00:19:12.000
And,
uh,
sometimes some of my frustration I say,
you know,
were,

319
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:16.320
these are imaginary diseases and yet here we've got widespread diseases of the

320
00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:18.600
poor in the u s and the lights go out.

321
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:23.420
<v 1>Do you remember when that woman came back from Africa and she was a nurse and</v>

322
00:19:23.421 --> 00:19:24.950
she had been,
uh,

323
00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.730
some in some connection contacted with Ebola.

324
00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.920
She didn't have it and they wanted a quarantine area.

325
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.730
<v 0>Oh yeah.
And they,</v>

326
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:36.730
they stuck around in some cabin on the airport or something.

327
00:19:36.871 --> 00:19:38.880
Crazy is terrible.
Yeah.
What did you think about that?

328
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:42.270
I just thought it was so cruel.
And uh,
is it just a,

329
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:47.100
an ignorance of how it's transmitted?
How is it transmitted?
Well,
actually Ebola,

330
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:49.500
you know,
it turns out is the opposite of measles.

331
00:19:49.501 --> 00:19:51.780
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known.

332
00:19:51.781 --> 00:19:55.800
It has a reproductive number of 12 to 18.
What that means,

333
00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.890
if a single individual gets measles,
12 to 18,

334
00:19:58.891 --> 00:20:03.180
others get it because the virus hangs around in the environment and it's so

335
00:20:03.181 --> 00:20:06.810
easily transmissible.
Hangs around like if you touch this table.
That's right.

336
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.680
That's right.
Or even in the,
even in the atmosphere.
So I'm,

337
00:20:10.681 --> 00:20:14.250
and that's why you get these really large measles outbreaks like you're seeing

338
00:20:14.251 --> 00:20:16.840
in Washington state.
Um,
and the,

339
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:20.170
and usually those are infants under the age of 12 months,
not yet old enough.

340
00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.610
They vaccinated.
Those are the ones who I end up hospitalized and sick.
The,
um,

341
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.180
Ebola is just the opposite.
He ball is a reproductive number of two or three.

342
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.910
So unless you're taking care of a dead or dying,

343
00:20:32.911 --> 00:20:36.870
he bowled a patient or someone who's recently died cause it's only towards the

344
00:20:36.871 --> 00:20:40.830
end stage of the disease that you really get large numbers of virus particles

345
00:20:40.831 --> 00:20:44.130
and the body,
you're not going to get Ebola.
So,
um,

346
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.350
the reason it's being so hard right now to contain in Democratic Republic of

347
00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:50.380
Congo is not because it's so highly contagious,

348
00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:54.760
it's just that the places is decimated by the collapse and infrastructure

349
00:20:54.761 --> 00:20:58.810
associated with civil war.
So even though we have,
and now when Ebola vaccine,

350
00:20:58.811 --> 00:21:02.770
it's hard to vaccinate everybody.
And how is it transmitted?

351
00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:07.270
Uh,
Ebola by contact with fluids of somebody with,
with the bowl.

352
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:11.110
So it has to get into your tissue,
right?
Oh,

353
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:16.180
what else should we worry about?
You're freaking me out.
Well,

354
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:20.740
the point is a lot of these diseases are solvable if,

355
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.800
if we just put our mind to it.
So one of the things that were even aware of it,

356
00:21:23.801 --> 00:21:26.380
and one of the things I say in the book is if,

357
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:30.400
because these diseases are so widespread among the poor and the g 20 countries,

358
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.340
if we could get the elected,

359
00:21:33.341 --> 00:21:37.660
are the leaders of those g 20 countries together to g 20 summit and say we're

360
00:21:37.661 --> 00:21:41.710
really going to do something about the neglected diseases in our own borders and

361
00:21:41.711 --> 00:21:43.120
I'll include the United States.

362
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.840
We could get rid of two thirds of the world's poverty related neglected diseases

363
00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:48.490
right off the bat.
Wow.

364
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:53.970
So a lot of it is political will or ignorance or lack of awareness and political

365
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:57.850
will.
Well,
it's,
it seems like in this country,

366
00:21:57.851 --> 00:21:59.420
ignorance is a big part of it because a,

367
00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.130
this is something I've thought about many times,
but I,

368
00:22:02.131 --> 00:22:05.110
I didn't know about Chaga to know about a lot of these other diseases you're

369
00:22:05.111 --> 00:22:09.850
describing.
Yeah,
no,
I mean,
so we,
we need to raise awareness about these.

370
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.020
That's why I'm so thrilled.

371
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:14.620
I'm so thrilled to come here because I've just amplified the number of people

372
00:22:14.621 --> 00:22:18.940
who've heard of this concept of blue marble health is the name that I've given a

373
00:22:18.941 --> 00:22:23.470
different name from global health to,
to separate,
separate it from the two.

374
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:24.820
Um,
so,
you know,

375
00:22:24.821 --> 00:22:29.200
coming on here is so powerful in terms of amplifying that message.
