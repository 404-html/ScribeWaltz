WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.340
But yeah,
if it gets hotter there,
fuck too.

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.890
Cause it's just like in the summertime in Houston,

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.920
you know when you're dealing with a hundred percent humidity and it's 115

4
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:11.670
degrees outside,
you can't even explain to people what that feels like.

5
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.210
I'm eating cooked.
There's,
there are places in the world that are going to be,

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.340
they're going to literally cook you by 2050.

7
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:20.250
So cities in India and the Middle East,

8
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.540
you won't be able to go outside during the summer without being a risk of dying

9
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.490
by 20,
50 by 2050.
Like what kind of temperature we're talking about?

10
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.970
Well it's a combination of heat and humidity.
So,
but you know,

11
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:33.750
usually the heat will be like up in the up around one 30 combined with some bad

12
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:36.720
humanity.
Um,
but you know,
they're,
they've already been,

13
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:38.040
we've already broken that threshold.

14
00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:40.810
Like their been temperature records set every year.
But um,

15
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.080
last year broke 130 in Oman I think.

16
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.980
But like the scarier parts or not some of these crazy desert places that have

17
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:48.510
gotten really hot,
it's the cities.

18
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.920
It's like Calcutta has like 12 million people in it and it may not be able to,

19
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:56.280
you may not be able to live there,
um,
in the summer,
in just 30 years.

20
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.340
And then just thinking about where all those people are going and how much

21
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:03.270
that's going to destabilize everything.
You know,
I've talked to people,
uh,

22
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.160
who are terrified about this and I've talked to people who are nonchalant,
um,

23
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:09.550
where,
where do you sit?
Are you,

24
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.620
are you terrified you thinking that you're going to be physically in trouble

25
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:19.590
yourself or do you think that with proper planning and just not being tied to

26
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:22.270
one spot,
you can move to another area?
I mean,
I have,

27
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.030
I have different feelings about it at different times of day because it's that

28
00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:28.960
big a story.
It's like going to affect everything.
I think.
Um,
you know,

29
00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:31.000
I think civilization is not going to collapse.

30
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:35.020
I think there'll be people around even living like kind of rewarding prosperous

31
00:01:35.021 --> 00:01:37.390
lives forever.

32
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.580
And the question is like what shaped those lives take and where there were,

33
00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:45.190
where they are.
So me personally,
you know,

34
00:01:45.191 --> 00:01:48.460
I'm like a relatively well off person who lives in America,

35
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.680
in New York.
I think I'll be able to do okay.

36
00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:57.550
I think my children will be able to do okay.
And when I imagine their future,

37
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.140
I think it's a reflection of all of our kind of like cognitive biases and

38
00:02:02.141 --> 00:02:04.720
emotional reflex is that when I imagine like my daughter's future,

39
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.230
I'm imagining a world that seems a lot like the one that we live in today.

40
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.430
But when I look at the science,
um,
it paints a really,
really bleak picture.

41
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.210
So you know,
the question of like optimism and alarm,

42
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.580
I think it's really all a matter of perspective,
right?

43
00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:20.980
So we're at 1.1 degrees Celsius right now.

44
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.730
I think there's basically no way that we avoid two degrees of warming,

45
00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:29.170
which is like the UN calls,
um,
catastrophic warming.

46
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.830
The island nations of the world call genocide.

47
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.400
And that's when we would be making these cities in the Middle East and livable.

48
00:02:36.401 --> 00:02:39.100
It would mean like some ice sheets would start a permanent collapse,

49
00:02:39.101 --> 00:02:43.880
which could all of the melted eventually bring 260 feet of sea level rise.
Um,

50
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.060
and we're on track for four degrees of warming.

51
00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:51.061
So that would mean $600 trillion and climate damages by the end of the century,

52
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.520
that's twice as much wealth as exist in the world today.

53
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.330
It would mean there'll be parts of the world scientists say where you could be

54
00:02:58.331 --> 00:03:01.840
hit by six simultaneous climate disasters at once.

55
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.690
There'd be at least a few hundred climate refugees.

56
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:07.150
The UN says the low investment is 200 million.

57
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.250
The high end estimate is a billion,

58
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.500
which is as many people as live in north and South America.

59
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:15.940
Compliance topic of resilience,
six simultaneous natural disasters at once.

60
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.370
What does that mean?
Like flooding,
hurricane,
um,
famine,
uh,
you know,

61
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.960
some public health issue,
um,
you know,
like malaria,
uh,

62
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.060
it's like every,
every category of modern life can be affected by this.
And um,

63
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.320
there aren't that many that could be hit by six,

64
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:35.860
but like already right now in Australia,
there was a crazy heat wave.

65
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:38.110
It's like over 120 and lots of Australia.

66
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.560
They're also dealing with like epic floods in other parts of the country.

67
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.190
And that's kind of the problem actually with wildfires in California.

68
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:48.280
It's not just that it's getting hotter,
it's that it's also getting wetter.

69
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.150
So the more rain means more growth means when it gets hot again,

70
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.130
that growth gets baked and then becomes,
you know,
firestarter.
Um,
and that's the,

71
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:59.320
you know,
it's not just,
it's not just a temperature.

72
00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:03.580
It's like higher temperatures mean crazier extremes in all directions.

73
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.770
And um,
you know,
I,
that's why I think sort of looking big picture,

74
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.930
there's not a life on earth that's going to be untouched by this force,

75
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:15.010
like over the decades ahead.

76
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.500
But that's not to say that we're all be destroyed by it either.

77
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:20.740
I think like we will find ways to live and adapt and mitigate.

78
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.550
It's just a question of how much it's going to screw up our politics,

79
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:27.940
how much it's going to change,
the way we think of history.
You know,

80
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:29.770
like I'm an end of,
I'm a nineties kid.

81
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:32.290
I grew up end of history thinking the world was going to get better,

82
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:35.210
the world was going to get richer,
globalization was progress,
et cetera.

83
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.190
What does it mean if like climate change completely eliminates the possibility

84
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:40.150
of economic growth,

85
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.360
which probably won't be the case for the u s but there are huge parts of the

86
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:45.820
world where that is going to be the case if we don't change course now.

87
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.850
So like at the end of the century,
if we don't change course,

88
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.290
the economists studying this,
say global GDP could be at least 20,

89
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.990
possibly 30% smaller than it would be without climate change.

90
00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:58.780
30% is twice as big an impact as the great depression.

91
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.610
How did you get involved in this?

92
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:03.340
How'd you get involved in studying this and what was your perception before you

93
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:06.850
got involved and how did it shift?
So I'm,
I'm a journalist,

94
00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:10.510
I'm an editor mostly actually at New York magazine.
Um,
and you know,

95
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:13.630
I'm interested in the near future.
Like as a result,

96
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:15.370
read a lot of scientific papers,

97
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:18.040
read a lot of like obscure of subreddits and that kind of thing.

98
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.690
And I'm just in 2016 started seeing a lot more of that.

99
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.960
A lot more of the news from science was about climate and a lot more of that

100
00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:27.550
climate news was really scary.

101
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.550
And when I looked around at the other places that like we think of as our

102
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:32.920
competitors,
you know,
newspapers,
TV shows,

103
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.360
I just felt like the scarier end of the spectrum was just not at all being

104
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:37.931
talked about.

105
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:41.920
So most scientists talk about this two degree threshold is like the threshold of

106
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:42.754
catastrophe.

107
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.780
And I think most lay people think that that means that that's kind of a ceiling

108
00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:48.940
for warming.
Like that'll be the worst it could get.

109
00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:52.780
But actually it's functionally the best case scenario.
And we yet,

110
00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:54.520
we hadn't had any storytelling,

111
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:57.710
any discussion around what the world would look like north two degrees.

112
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.640
And I just felt as a journalist I was like,
Holy Shit,
there's a huge story here.

113
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.030
Like the way that this world could be completely transformed by these forces is

114
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:10.430
not something that anybody is writing about in park has,
it's a long story.

115
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.210
But scientists and science journalists were really,
um,

116
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.850
they were really focused on making sure that their messaging was hopeful and

117
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:20.390
optimistic and they were reluctant to talk about their scariest findings.

118
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.130
And so I was terrified by the science.
I looked at it and I was like,

119
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.360
nobody's talking about this.
It's scary.
Got to like spread the word.

120
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.850
And I wrote a big piece in 2017 that was a very focused on worst case scenario.

121
00:06:33.851 --> 00:06:37.400
So I mentioned before,
I think two degrees is about our best case scenario.

122
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.700
Four degrees is where we're on track for now.
This piece was looking at five,
six,

123
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:43.610
eight degrees of warming.
So things were not likely to get this century at least.

124
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.080
And it was a huge phenomenon.
It was read by a bunch of million people,

125
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.140
the biggest story that New York magazine had ever published.
And I just thought,

126
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:51.890
man,
that gets,

127
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.570
there are a lot of people like me out there who have intuitions about climate

128
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.910
suffering and terror but aren't seeing it in the way people are writing about

129
00:07:01.911 --> 00:07:05.750
the story.
So I decided,
you know,
there's,

130
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.490
there's more to say and even beyond like telling the bleak story,

131
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:13.730
telling the really dark,
I'm talking about the really dark possibilities.

132
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:18.080
I just thought there are all these categories of life that we haven't even

133
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:21.290
thought about how it'll impact us.
So we,
we know about sea level rise,

134
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:22.910
but that's like,
as I mentioned before,

135
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.540
that makes you think if you live off the coast you'll be okay.

136
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.120
But the whole planet is going to be touched by this.

137
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:30.800
Some places are going to be hit harder than others.

138
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.640
India is going to be hit by like 29% of all global climate impacts of the

139
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.700
century.
Um,
but everyone's going to be affected in some way.

140
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:40.360
And the way that changes our politics,
the way it changes our pop culture,

141
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.760
the way it changes our psychology,
our mood,
our relationship to history,

142
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:45.590
how we think about the future,
how we think about the past,

143
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.950
what we expect from capitalism,
what we blame capitalism for,

144
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.580
what we expect from technology,
what we think technology can do.

145
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.690
Can Technology Save us?

146
00:07:53.691 --> 00:07:56.810
Can technology entertain us while the Burt world is burning.

147
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.290
These are all these kinds of like humanities questions that I felt really,

148
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.820
really had not been talked about.

149
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:05.180
And so the book does like it's a tour through what the world would look like

150
00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:09.020
between two and four degrees,
but it's also,
which is a kind of hell scape,

151
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.360
but it is also about half of it is about we're going to live here,

152
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:19.070
we're going to survive.
In what form?
What will it mean?
Um,
you know,

153
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.640
myth at the mythological level.
What will it mean at the personal level?

154
00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:25.670
What will it mean the way we think about our kids and their futures and all that

155
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:29.120
stuff.
And um,
you know,
my,
my,

156
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.830
my big picture thinking about it is,
um,
yeah,

157
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:35.000
it's really bleak.
Um,

158
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:39.020
and I think there are some possible ways that we could avert some of these worst

159
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:41.360
case scenarios.
I mean,

160
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.140
there is technology that can suck carbon out of the atmosphere already.

161
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.880
It hasn't been tested at scale.
It's really expensive.
But if we really,

162
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:54.860
if we can over the,
you know,
the next decade or two really like build it,
um,

163
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.230
like global plantations of these carbon capture machines,

164
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.680
then not only can we like stop the problem from moving forward,

165
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:05.070
we could actually reverse it a little bit.
Um,
yeah,
I've seen those before.

166
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:07.770
I've seen the designs for those where they had these enormous,

167
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.960
like a apartment building sized air filter things.
Yeah.

168
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.170
I mean it's basically like only in theory they're there and they do exist in the

169
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:18.750
real world.
But only I had to kind of like an in laboratories.

170
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:20.700
They don't exist at anything like the scale they need to,

171
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:23.810
but there's a guy at Harvard named David Keith who,
um,

172
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.700
has tested his machines.

173
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.540
They're able to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere at a cost of a $100 a

174
00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:35.070
ton,
which would mean we could totally neutralize the entire,
um,

175
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.620
the entire carbon footprint of the global economy.

176
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:38.940
We wouldn't have to change anything.

177
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.410
We could suck out all the extra carbon we're putting into the atmosphere for

178
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.880
cost of $3 trillion a year,
which is a lot of money,

179
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.720
but their estimates for how much we're subsidizing the fossil fuel business that

180
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.610
are as high as $5 trillion a year.

181
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.660
So we just redirected those subsidies to this technology.
In theory,

182
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.950
we could literally solve the problem immediately.
There are other complications.

183
00:09:58.951 --> 00:10:00.720
It's like in order to store the carbon,

184
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:04.650
you need an industry that's two or three times the size of our present oil and

185
00:10:04.651 --> 00:10:05.520
gas industry,
which,

186
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.450
and where that goes and next to who's homes and all that stuff.
It's complicated,

187
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.170
but we have the tools we need.
It's just a matter of deciding to,
um,

188
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.520
put them into practice.
And I think we're pretty like that.

189
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.860
You know,
recent history shows that,
um,
we're not doing that fast enough.

190
00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:26.630
So one of the big,
you know,
points that I'd like,

191
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.510
I'm making the book in that it's six in my head so strongly.
As you know,

192
00:10:30.511 --> 00:10:34.080
we think of climate change is this thing that started in the industrial

193
00:10:34.081 --> 00:10:35.490
evolution like centuries ago.

194
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.600
But half of all the carbon that we've put into the atmosphere and the history of

195
00:10:39.601 --> 00:10:42.780
humanity from the burning of fossil fuels has come in 30 years.

196
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:43.740
The last 30 years,

197
00:10:43.741 --> 00:10:47.340
that's since Al Gore published his first book on warming it since the UN

198
00:10:47.341 --> 00:10:51.120
established their climate change panel.
It's since the premiere of Seinfeld.

199
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.490
So like you and I have lived through the lion's share of all of the damage done

200
00:10:56.491 --> 00:10:59.970
to the climate in all of human history.
Whoa.
Yeah.

201
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.240
And the next 30 years are going to be just as consequential.

202
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.160
So we brought the world from the,

203
00:11:05.161 --> 00:11:10.161
basically a stable climate to the brink of total climate catastrophe in 30

204
00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:15.570
years.
One generation,
we have about one generation to save it.

205
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.170
To me,
that's like,
it makes me uncomfortable to use this language,

206
00:11:19.171 --> 00:11:21.120
but it's basically a theological story.

207
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:25.710
We have the entire fate of the planet in the hands of these two generations.

208
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.260
What happens 50 years from now,

209
00:11:28.261 --> 00:11:33.261
a hundred years from now will entirely be up to the way we act now and what we

210
00:11:33.691 --> 00:11:38.100
do.
And the timescale is so crazy because you have this really compressed,

211
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.610
we must act now to avert these worst case scenarios,
timescale.

212
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.800
But also the impacts will unfold if we don't do anything over millennia.

213
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.170
So like we could have,
you know,

214
00:11:49.171 --> 00:11:53.220
if we really bring into being the total melt of all ice sheets,

215
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.700
that means that eight centuries from now,
12 centuries from now,

216
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.690
people will be dealing with the shit that we're fucking up today.

217
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:07.140
We will be engineering problems for them to be solving 80012001500 years from

218
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:08.680
now.

219
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.680
And that damage will be done if it is done in the next 30 or 50 years.

220
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.000
So we are,
I mean,

221
00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:21.001
we are really writing this epic story about Earth humanity and our future on

222
00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:26.950
this planet in the time of a single lifetime,
a single generation.

223
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.730
And that is on the,
on the one hand,
it's sort of like overwhelming,

224
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.110
but it's also empowering,
you know,
like,
um,

225
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.530
all the climate impacts that I talk about all the climate horrors that are

226
00:12:38.531 --> 00:12:43.360
really terrifying.
If we make them happen,
we will be making them happen.

227
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.680
The main input in the system is how much carbon we put into the atmosphere.

228
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.560
There are feedback loops that people are worried about.

229
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.900
There are things about climate that we can't control,
but at least at this point,

230
00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:58.120
the main driver of future warming is what we do.
And so we could,

231
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.110
if we get to a four degree hellscape with hundreds of millions or a billion

232
00:13:02.111 --> 00:13:05.230
climate refugees,
that'll be because of what we're doing.

233
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:10.060
It's not some system outside of our control.
Even though we're often kind of,

234
00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:12.940
we find it kind of comforting to think that it's outside of our control because

235
00:13:12.941 --> 00:13:14.470
that means we don't have to change it.
