00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.850
Hi Joe and that we're live.
Thanks for doing this.
Appreciate it.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.720
Thanks for having me.

3
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.750
It's a very fortuitous your timing comes right in the middle of this big hubbub

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.650
about um,

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.680
this a native American elder and this young boy with one of those stupid fucking

6
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:17.870
red hat's on.
Yup.

7
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.440
That would you have ever imagined that a slogan like make America great again

8
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:26.730
would be so divisive as somehow or another like that that would be like make

9
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:27.481
America great again.

10
00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:32.250
What sounds like they just want to make things great like no positive,
no.

11
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.900
And a red hat with white letters.

12
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:37.200
Has there ever been a time like that where an object,

13
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.450
like a red hat with white letters was so repulsive to half the country?

14
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.010
Yes.
Well,
I mean some people see it as the equivalent of a white hood.

15
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.840
Wow.
I don't know about that.
I think,
I believe they do

16
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.203
<v 1>wearing it,</v>

17
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.210
wearing it that a 16 year old wearing that hat sort of carries intense moral

18
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:03.770
weight that surely we know that a 16 year old is not aware of all the things,

19
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.910
<v 0>locations of wearing that hat.
Yeah.
But the problem with that is Kanye wears it.</v>

20
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.970
Right?
Fair enough.
It doesn't really work.
I agree.

21
00:01:09.971 --> 00:01:13.390
I'm just saying there are people who really make that argument.
I get it.

22
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.780
I know that people who are paid for their opinions,
well yeah.

23
00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:20.740
Well there's also people that are calling for this child's name and address or

24
00:01:20.741 --> 00:01:23.560
calling to docs him and publicly expose him.

25
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.380
This is a child these 16 is that what he is?

26
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.040
<v 1>He's 16 years old.
And</v>

27
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.330
one of the things that was just so amazing about the whole Brouhaha realm,

28
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.020
I mean it was in a way like this perfect encapsulation of our outrage culture,

29
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.621
right?

30
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:44.360
Because people saw a tiny clip of this video and it was like a roar shock test.

31
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.560
Yeah.

32
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.560
You saw in it this morality play of what would it look to be,

33
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.080
was a group of mostly white kids from Coventry Catholic school.

34
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:55.310
I think it's in Kentucky.

35
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.380
And it looked like at first glance that they were smirking and smug and had

36
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:03.500
these sort of shit eating grins on their faces and that they were surrounding

37
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.350
this older native American man.
And I have to tell you,

38
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.760
I had a visceral reaction to it.
The second I saw it,
like so many other people,

39
00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:13.700
I was like,
this is,
you know,

40
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.290
where we are in our broken culture and they're bullying this guy.

41
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.900
And here's the rise of the,
I had all of those reactions.

42
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.970
The challenge of what it means to be a journalist is to not see people as

43
00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:29.120
signifiers or as stand ins just based on their identity.

44
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.190
And that's what like 94,

45
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.520
95% of the press corps did.

46
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.420
They sort of leapt to the leap to assume that,
you know,

47
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.200
our visceral reaction was accurate when in fact when you actually looked at like

48
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.310
the two hour video of the whole interaction,

49
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:50.510
which also included this group of black Israel lights are Hebrew Israelites,

50
00:02:50.511 --> 00:02:53.000
they called themselves.
It was not that at all.

51
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.480
The native American man had walked up to this group.

52
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.430
The four other guys had been the group beforehand,

53
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.470
calling them crackers,
calling them Satan,
calling the one black kid in the group,

54
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:10.090
things that can't even be said.
So it was just far more complicated.
Um,

55
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.920
and what,
what was really,
really disheartening is that the out,

56
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:19.570
the initial outrage was enough for the mainstream press to report on it.

57
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.900
Like Twitter has kind of become almost an assigning editor for places like the

58
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:29.050
New York Times and the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal.

59
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.600
And then when the actual truth of the thing comes out,

60
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:33.400
when we move past the outrage cycle,

61
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.670
they have to sort of write the followup story to the fake outrage to begin with.

62
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.910
<v 0>I'm defending the fake outrage instead of backing up and saying we made a</v>

63
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:43.720
mistake.

64
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.940
<v 1>Right.
Well some people said that they made a mistake.
That's wonderful.</v>

65
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.280
That's a good sign.
Yes,
it really is.

66
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.260
But one of the things that was so horrifying was that people that are supposed

67
00:03:54.261 --> 00:03:58.340
to be adults,
you know,
people with blue check marks on Twitter.

68
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.420
We're saying things like this is the face of white patriarchy,

69
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.200
the 16 year old kid,
or raise us on set.

70
00:04:06.201 --> 00:04:09.590
Have you ever seen him more punchable face?
Kathy Griffin was saying,

71
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.290
I need names.
Shame him.
Doc's him.

72
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.070
How do these people not understand the implications of that?

73
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.950
So what happened over the weekend was that the,
you know,

74
00:04:18.951 --> 00:04:23.951
sleuthy detectives on Twitter found a kid who they thought was the kid in the

75
00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:26.210
video,
wasn't actually the kid.

76
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.860
So there's the actual kid who was docs.
The family was harassed.

77
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.620
Everything that we now know happens in these outreach cycles.

78
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.370
But then there was another kid who looks suspiciously like him who was not him

79
00:04:37.371 --> 00:04:38.960
at all,
whose family.

80
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.450
There was an amazing and heartbreaking Twitter thread about it,

81
00:04:41.451 --> 00:04:45.170
whose family was in the middle of a family wedding and they dispend their whole

82
00:04:45.171 --> 00:04:49.760
weekend fighting off these mobs who were trying to destroy them.

83
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.550
And it wasn't even the kid in the video.

84
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.890
I mean that is really horrifying to me that that's where we are.

85
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.130
And the fact that adults who should know better or fomenting this and don't see

86
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.970
how thin like the Vin,
like it sounds heavy,

87
00:05:07.971 --> 00:05:12.560
but like the veneer of civilization is like they're taking a pickax to it.

88
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.360
It's just,
I just found the whole thing to be terrifying.

89
00:05:17.361 --> 00:05:18.260
I don't know how you felt.

90
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.511
<v 0>Argument.
Same Way.</v>

91
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:24.511
And I think it's a very unique moment because it's so public and it's so,

92
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.740
it's so prevalent in whether it's Twitter or Facebook,
it's everywhere.

93
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.220
And it sort of embodies everything that's wrong with a lack of nuance and with

94
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:40.660
people taking one side versus the other and sticking with it with not

95
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:45.370
confronting their own personal biases with looking at these things through the

96
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.300
eyes of this is the enemy.
I'm on the good side.
They're on the bad side.

97
00:05:50.301 --> 00:05:52.900
Yes,
let's get them.
And also this,

98
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.260
this distorted idea of what it takes to what it takes to be violent.

99
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.840
Like this idea of this is a punchable person like calling for violence.
You,

100
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:08.210
you're,
you're hearing a lot of this.
Like,

101
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.920
this is one of the things that troubles me so much about the left.
My family,

102
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.690
my parents were hippies.
Um,
you know,

103
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.000
I grew up when I was a little kid,

104
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.710
we lived from age of seven to 11 in San Francisco during the Vietnam War,

105
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.570
while the Vietnam Nam War was ending,

106
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:25.610
I was living in the middle of the hippie world.

107
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.340
I always felt that people on the left,
we're like these well-read,

108
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.020
kind,
compassionate people,

109
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.200
but somewhere along the line within the last few years,

110
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.400
people on the left are calling for violence.
This is very,

111
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.650
this is very confusing to me and it's,

112
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:47.330
it's this frivolous social media call for violence.
It's not an in person,

113
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.610
be their boots on the ground call for,

114
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:52.850
but it's a very strange call for Violence Punch Nazis.

115
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.140
I'm hearing this all the time because it's right because it's,
sorry,
go ahead.

116
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.410
What I'm going to say is what does a Nazi okay is if you mean punch actual Nazis

117
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.690
that are putting Jews in the concentration camps,
I'm with you,

118
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.690
but when you call a guy with a Maga hat on,

119
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.430
he wears one of those red hats and he's just an asshole.
He's a Nazi.
Now,

120
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.270
some guy who maybe he's not that educated,
wants to be a contrarian,

121
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.610
sees all these liberals that are complaining all the time,

122
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.750
so it puts this red hat on and now he's a white supremacist and a Nazi and you

123
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:25.880
want to punch him like,
okay,

124
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.220
<v 1>it is.</v>

125
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:31.220
That's what a lot of people in very high positions of power in this country,

126
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.030
at least in the culture,
actually believe,

127
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.100
and they don't understand the implications of hollowing out words like that.
Yes,

128
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.400
I know this personally,
right?
Cause I'm called alt right.
Um,

129
00:07:42.401 --> 00:07:45.790
I'm called an apologist for rape culture.
I've been called everything.

130
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.930
I'm a centrist.
Okay.
I'm,

131
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:54.420
I'm a Jewish center left on most things person who lives on the upper west side

132
00:07:55.361 --> 00:07:58.570
of Manhattan and you know,
it's super socially liberal,

133
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:03.400
liberal on pretty much any issue you want to choose.
If I'm alt right,
what,

134
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:07.390
what words do we have left for people that actually are that exactly what words

135
00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:12.340
do we have left for people who actually are part of a sort of racist blood and

136
00:08:12.341 --> 00:08:14.950
soil nativism that's rising in this country and around the world,

137
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.980
that should terrify people that are using that language in the sloppiest of

138
00:08:20.351 --> 00:08:23.740
ways.
I really don't think they're seeing the implications of it.

139
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.990
I also think that when,
when you're just,
you know,

140
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.270
your keyboard warrior and you're just tossing this stuff out,

141
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:36.450
so much of it is about signaling to your tribe that you know that this thing is

142
00:08:36.551 --> 00:08:37.390
bad.
Yes.

143
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:42.540
And I really don't think people are understanding the implications of this and I

144
00:08:43.361 --> 00:08:47.590
don't think it's a stretch to imagine something like this happening a week,

145
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.600
two weeks,
a month,
two months from now and someone actually getting killed.
Right?

146
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.740
<v 0>Like Charlottesville.
I mean very,
very similar to what happened this,
this,</v>

147
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:59.430
this kind of,
I mean when that guy drove over those protesters,

148
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.840
the ramping up of the dialogue on both sides of the rhetoric,
the violent talk,

149
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.870
it's so disturbing and so unnecessary,

150
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.300
especially when it's disingenuous.

151
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:12.520
Like calling someone like you outright or me cry.
I'm a,

152
00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:15.570
I get called alt right adjacent.
That's when I hear that one all the time.

153
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.260
I'd go left on everything basically except guns.

154
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.100
There's a few things that I'm like repeal the second amendment.
Yeah.
I mean,

155
00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:29.370
but I,
I do think that there should be some restrictions for gun use.
Just like,

156
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:30.960
I think there should be restrictions for car use.

157
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.590
I actually think there should be testing for guns and you should have to go
look.

158
00:09:35.591 --> 00:09:36.840
Do you have to go through a fucking,

159
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.750
you have to take driver's Ed to get a car license.

160
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.370
How come you don't have to do any,
you know,

161
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:43.800
you don't have to do anything to get a gun like you once.

162
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:45.330
If you're not a criminal,
you just get a gun.

163
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:50.190
Like you don't have to know how to take care of it and clean it and safely

164
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:52.260
handle it.
You don't have to know the ethics of use.

165
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.340
You don't have to know anything.

166
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.420
<v 1>I know it's insane.</v>

167
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.480
I mean at night just spent six weeks in Australia where they had basically what

168
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:04.410
major massacre 20 years ago.
And then,
uh,
I forget who it was.
We could look it up.

169
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:08.100
But you know,
prime minister conservative got rid of guns.
Yes.

170
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.280
Everyone in the country that they think we're insane and psychotic the way that

171
00:10:11.281 --> 00:10:15.720
we live.
Well,
we're definitely weird.
Um,
the thing also,
one other thing that that

172
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.540
jumped out to me about the,
the Catholic school boy incident,

173
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.780
it kind of signifies something broader that's happening,

174
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:29.640
which is the eraser of the individual,
which is just,
I think,

175
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.100
a horrifying problem in our culture.

176
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:37.430
Like what actually happened was a one hour incident on a random afternoon in

177
00:10:38.281 --> 00:10:42.390
January between a group of individuals.
Right.
But instead in our mind,

178
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:47.330
why was everyone there?
It was this boys or were there for the march for life.
Um,

179
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:51.530
I don't know why the Hebrew Israelites were there,
but it's DC,

180
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.180
like they're crazy protesters all the time.
You know,

181
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.510
at the Lincoln memorial and outside of the White House were there for a school

182
00:10:57.511 --> 00:10:57.900
event,

183
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.990
is that what were there for the march for life as part of their school and they

184
00:11:00.991 --> 00:11:03.540
had like been had free time,
I think.

185
00:11:03.541 --> 00:11:06.630
And then we're signing converging at the Lincoln Memorial.

186
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.180
They didn't have a chaperone.
There's no,
no.
I think the teachers,

187
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.590
there was a teacher there and they had asked the teacher at one point in order

188
00:11:13.591 --> 00:11:17.310
to drown out the heckling of the Hebrew Israelites.

189
00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:19.050
I hope I'm getting the name of that group.
Right.

190
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.540
Could we do a school cheer to kind of ignore them?
Um,

191
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:26.100
and they did that and I think they did that with permission from the teachers at

192
00:11:26.101 --> 00:11:29.670
one point.
Early on it was rumored that they were chanting build the wall,

193
00:11:29.671 --> 00:11:33.000
but no one has surfaced any evidence of that whatsoever.

194
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.590
<v 0>Well that's what I heard from the native American elder when he was talking</v>

195
00:11:35.591 --> 00:11:38.710
about it in a village,
in a video.
He said they were chanting out build that.

196
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:38.890
Right.

197
00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:42.100
<v 1>And maybe they were,
I just haven't seen anything.
And I've watched every video.</v>

198
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.710
<v 0>It's totally possible.
They're also 16.
Right.</v>

199
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:48.410
And you're also trying to make their friends laugh and they're assholes and

200
00:11:48.411 --> 00:11:50.030
they're just being silly and stupid.

201
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:54.730
<v 1>Right.
And I have to say as like someone who was a nerd in high school,</v>

202
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I saw the face of the main kid in that still photograph and that video and like

203
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:05.620
the 14 and 15 year old girl in me was like enraged.
Really.

204
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:06.310
Like I was like,

205
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:11.310
I see the face of so many kids who said the nastiest things to me and who

206
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.630
through friends of mine into garbage cans,
like the Blake disgusting bullying.

207
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.170
Was it because you think is you have to get to the next step if you're a jerk?

208
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.700
No,
we was.
It was,
yeah.
Oh for sure.
Just standing there.
It's the hat.

209
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.600
It's the face.
Maybe even still if it's a group,

210
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.260
but he put the,

211
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:35.460
my thing is like your initial reaction to something is not the truth.

212
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:41.230
It's your emotional reaction and anyone who calls themselves a journalist like

213
00:12:41.231 --> 00:12:44.290
your job is to figure out the facts of the case,

214
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:49.500
not to make this into a kind of identitarian morality play and the fact that so

215
00:12:50.681 --> 00:12:55.180
many people in so many publications did just that.

216
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:58.030
And in fact when the real facts surfaced,

217
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.450
just kind of sort of dug their heels in and were basically like,

218
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:06.340
well he's a stand in for the white patriarchy.
What?
That's crazy.

219
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.200
That's crazy.

220
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.380
Like there was an actual buzzfeed writer that said it's the look of white

221
00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:16.000
patriarchy,
his face.
You're really going to put that on a 16 year old would we?

222
00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.420
Like,
it's just,
that's nuts to me.
Well it's cruel.

223
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.380
<v 0>Um,
it's a denial of the individual.
It's very cruel.
When you're 16 years old,</v>

224
00:13:24.381 --> 00:13:27.140
you're basically a baby.
You don't know what the fuck you're doing.

225
00:13:27.141 --> 00:13:29.690
You're incredibly susceptible to the influence of your peers.

226
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.460
You're around a bunch of other boys,

227
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.190
you not around girls cause you don't go to school with girls cause he goes some

228
00:13:34.191 --> 00:13:37.280
wacky religious school,
right.
That this is,
you know,

229
00:13:37.281 --> 00:13:41.000
you want to really be a social justice warrior.
We really want to save the world.

230
00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.190
How about you do something about the Catholic Church?

231
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.590
Everyone wants to go after our Kelly,
which is great,

232
00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.720
but how about the Catholic Church?

233
00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:52.310
How about the number one kid fucking organization of all time?
That's what it is.

234
00:13:52.311 --> 00:13:55.900
And I,
I was raised Catholic.
I know what it is.
Did anything happen?

235
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:58.370
Nothing happened to me.
I got lucky.
But I know people,

236
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.240
I know a bunch of people and know a bunch of people with stories and this is all

237
00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:06.410
over the world.
These kids come from that cult.

238
00:14:06.411 --> 00:14:10.460
Imagine if that was not the Catholic church.
If it was instead Scientology,

239
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.990
we would be getting all these kids are a part of a cult.
They went there.

240
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.680
They are a part of this weird cult that suppresses sexuality amongst its priests

241
00:14:18.681 --> 00:14:23.681
and encourages the placement of these pedophile priests in new places in order

242
00:14:26.901 --> 00:14:31.070
to get away from whatever crime they've committed in the area where they were

243
00:14:31.071 --> 00:14:34.630
initially established.
This is what the Catholic church is,
right,
but,

244
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.880
and they travel all over the place,
but it also is good people.
This is the,

245
00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.340
this is where nuance comes into play.
It's good people.

246
00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.190
There's a bunch of people that are Catholics because they want a better

247
00:14:43.191 --> 00:14:46.670
relationship with,
with God or the universe or love or whatever.

248
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.430
They feel like it's a good moral framework for their children.

249
00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.640
They take them there.
They in the 10 commandments,

250
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:56.780
they believe in this moral structure for society that's laid down by what they

251
00:14:56.781 --> 00:14:59.870
believe is God.
There's great people that are involved in the Catholic church,

252
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.300
but it's also the number one kid fucking organization in the world.

253
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.610
It's those two things,
right?

254
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.640
So these kids are a part of something that's way worse than smirking at a native

255
00:15:10.491 --> 00:15:14.600
American with a drum.
And in my opinion,
being ivory,

256
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:19.430
when I was 16 I was a fool.
I was a dumb person.

257
00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.890
No,
I was bullied.

258
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:26.780
I was little small and I learned martial arts when I was like 15 I mean I'm sure

259
00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:29.040
it was a dick to some people just cause I get away with it.
I don't,

260
00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:33.030
I don't really remember it,
but I'm definitely differently.

261
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.240
People are dicks.
You're trying it out,
you know,

262
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.570
you don't even know how to talk yet.
You basically just learning words.

263
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:44.170
And this kid with this guy beating the drum inches from his face,

264
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.490
he handled it,
I believe way better than I would.
I don't think I would have.

265
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:53.000
I don't see,
I mean,
I don't think so.
No,

266
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:57.410
I don't think so.
No one knows 16 pop pop.
When I was 16 also,
I was competing,

267
00:15:57.411 --> 00:15:59.420
I was doing a lot of martial arts events,

268
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.870
so maybe I would have kept it together better than I'm,

269
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.170
I'm thinking I would have,

270
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:08.330
but I definitely was a fucking idiot and I was 16 you know,

271
00:16:08.331 --> 00:16:12.020
you just don't,
and who knows what's going on van day,
who knows?

272
00:16:12.021 --> 00:16:14.900
Like if you have an anxiety about the future or your girlfriend broke up with

273
00:16:14.901 --> 00:16:19.901
you or you failed the test or what else that is like bouncing around inside your

274
00:16:20.871 --> 00:16:25.760
head,
overwhelming your ability to form reasonable thoughts.
Six.

275
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:29.410
It's assumed by the way that everyone's initial,

276
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.420
not everyone's every liberal.
I know.
Okay.

277
00:16:32.421 --> 00:16:35.810
Everyone on the center and center left and even the center reits reaction to it

278
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:40.370
was accurate that he was a little asshole,
right?
That he's a racist,
homophobic,

279
00:16:40.371 --> 00:16:43.880
transphobic,
hates immigrants,
every single thing.

280
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.360
Does that deserve to be news that a 16 year old kid with those fuse smirked at a

281
00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:54.080
native American elder?
Especially considering what he actually did know.

282
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.240
I don't think that's news.
Not only that,

283
00:16:57.241 --> 00:17:01.370
I think it's strange that we're covering it like it is and because of the

284
00:17:01.371 --> 00:17:02.180
Internet,

285
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:07.070
the fact that we're my timeline on Twitter and on Facebook and on everything.

286
00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.820
This was way bigger news then day,
whatever it is,

287
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:15.821
30 31 of the government shutdown where people are having to get on bread lines

288
00:17:16.311 --> 00:17:19.220
to feed their families.
Right?
Who's the thing is it like,

289
00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.460
but it's people what it's what people want to talk about.

290
00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:26.690
I think there's this idea that there's things that are happening right now like

291
00:17:26.691 --> 00:17:30.530
the government shutdown and then there's things that are happening right now in

292
00:17:30.531 --> 00:17:35.531
terms of our culture shifting and when these things that come up in opposition

293
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:42.050
to what many people believe is a beneficial shift to a more progressive,

294
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.260
more responsible culture.
When these little hiccups,

295
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.140
they get addressed and they get address rapidly.

296
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:52.950
And I think it's because people are aware that things are changing in this

297
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.300
almost like unprecedented way.

298
00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.240
If you look back unprecedented pace,
I agree with you.
Yeah.

299
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.100
Like nothing we've ever,

300
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.340
there's nothing that you could find in the historical record for human beings

301
00:18:05.341 --> 00:18:10.140
has ever been.
What we've experienced over just the past 10 plus years of social,

302
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:10.920
um,

303
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.920
social networks and social media and the ability to spread information very

304
00:18:16.231 --> 00:18:19.740
quickly with a youtube video or a tweet or whatever.
I mean,
these,
these,

305
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:23.130
the way people are exchanging information is,
is very different.

306
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.930
And because of that culture is shifting at a hyperspace speed.

307
00:18:27.931 --> 00:18:30.600
It's just turbocharged for sure.

308
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:35.430
So I think when something comes up that we think is like,
ah,
there's one,

309
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.470
get it.
Exactly.
But it's not logical.
It's like,
it's like road rage.

310
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.380
You know why you get road rage?
One of the reasons,
because you're going fast.

311
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.800
Okay,
you're in a car and you're nervous.
You're,
you're heightened senses.

312
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.060
So anything that happens,

313
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:53.070
it gets magnified like someone's mother fucker in my lane to Hong Kong because

314
00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:56.790
you already jacked up to eight because you're in a car going 60 miles an hour.

315
00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:01.020
Wait,
Twitter does that.
Twitter's doing that.
Social media is doing that.

316
00:19:01.021 --> 00:19:04.110
Life is doing that,
this.
So when something like this comes up,

317
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.030
this rapid pace of change,
which is almost an impossible to keep up with,
right?

318
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.980
With the new cycle and this constant wave of change and information.

319
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.570
So when something comes up,
people are road raging on this kid.
Totally.

320
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.240
That's why we just have to,
I mean,
there's,
there's lots of things to say,

321
00:19:21.241 --> 00:19:21.901
but one thing,

322
00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:26.901
it's just continue to insist on truth and facts and not allowing people to be

323
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.180
stand ins for a group.
You're not a standard for anyone.
You're yourself.

324
00:19:33.181 --> 00:19:37.500
You answer for yourself.
And I just,
I find that trend on both sides really,

325
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:38.220
really scary.
