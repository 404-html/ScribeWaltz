1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
The national headliner to what would normally be headlining somewhere on their

2
00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:06.720
own.
Like there's a cool double,
yeah,
yeah,
it's a cool double bill.
But it's also,

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.640
I want the best guys that I can find that I pay them well to go on in front of

4
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:15.780
me.
I don't,
I don't want it to be a bad show by any stretch of the imagination.

5
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:17.820
So I tried to get the best guys,
but also by that,

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.990
then I'm traveling with the best guys.
So we're having fun.
Like we're,
you know,

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.640
it's,
it's a,
it's a weird group,
like standups.
There's not that many of us,

8
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.510
it's like maybe a thousand of us in the whole country that are like real

9
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:35.090
professional comedians,
maybe 500 headliners and the whole country.
So this,

10
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.840
there's just not that many of us.

11
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.070
And so when we relate to each other and sort of a weird way.
Yeah,

12
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.940
well there's not many of you suck.
When presidents get together,
four of them,

13
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:48.600
they all kind of chummy because they might be opposed,

14
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:51.660
but they all kind of know.
They're the only people who know that stuff,

15
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.310
especially when they're out.
So I just,
when,

16
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.370
when they're out there time and then they can relax and they just look like

17
00:00:56.371 --> 00:01:00.390
they've been sucked dry by a vampire that's,
Oh,
I noticed when the,

18
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:05.391
when Obama welcomed the president elect Trump to the Oval Office for that 90

19
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:08.220
minute meeting that Trump thought was going to last 15 minutes.

20
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.100
Obama looked like Twitter and come moon.
He just like,

21
00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:13.620
his skin was so drawn across his face.

22
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.380
It's like a snare drum has been so exhausted.

23
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.600
Legacy's going to be taken over.
Just any president like George W.

24
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.370
Bush was to meet a handsome,
energetic guy when he got into office,

25
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.880
but eight years and nine 11 and the invasion and occupation of Iraq on the way

26
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:37.330
out,
his face had fallen,
his hair had died.
And I,
I,

27
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.140
I'm not a guy who hates him,
just disagrees.

28
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.650
But the presidency killed that guy.
I mean,

29
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:46.760
I just think the stress because you don't get the nice phone call.
Hey the cat,

30
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.190
we got the cat out of the tree.
It's like,
hey,
we lost eight guys.

31
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.360
That thing you said go.
Uh,
it went south.
Well,

32
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:57.630
I'm very curious to see how Trump comes out of this cause he's the one of the

33
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:00.810
older guys to get in there.
I think he's 70 or 71.
Right.

34
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.880
And in just in the past year,

35
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:07.140
like there's a picture of Bush for 2000 and 2008 I'm saying that's crazy.

36
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.430
Just kicked his ass.
And I'm not trying to put him in the pejorative.

37
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.703
It's just,

38
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.940
it's like when you see those really amazing photos of Lincoln during the civil

39
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.940
war or Lyndon Johnson in those think tank meetings,

40
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:24.090
him and Mcnamara,

41
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:28.920
his face is sliding off his skull because he's getting those phone calls.
Hey,

42
00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:31.410
we just lost six,
600 guys.

43
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:34.140
Mister President really started to give you this news because he insisted on

44
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:38.400
getting the bad phone call.
And you see what it does to a human being.

45
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.840
And um,

46
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.430
I noticed it with Bush and Obama cause those were trying times for both

47
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:45.480
presidents.
So was trying,

48
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.340
very trying administrations and I wonder what it's going to do to a guy who

49
00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:54.660
doesn't take care of himself,
who is carrying a lot of weight,

50
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.930
probably nowhere near the best diet.
And uh,

51
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.270
I don't,
I hope he doesn't have some kind of heart attack.

52
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.380
I mean I'm not the kind of guy who wants people to die easily could,
but a man,

53
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:11.710
you look at them,
you're like,
man,
you need to listen to the White House doctor.

54
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:14.080
Get on a plan because they can really rock you.

55
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.170
They can help you lose 40 pounds by spring of next year and you can really be,

56
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:22.120
feel better.
You look at them,
you're like,
man,

57
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.210
there's someone in the White House who can help you with that.

58
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.260
Like they're paid to get you on the track every morning and they could get him

59
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:31.780
up at five in the morning and get them out there and it's not going to do it.

60
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:34.960
He's got to watch Fox News,
something that I agree or disagree with those people.

61
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:38.650
And the TV is too bad because of president has all those people who are like

62
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.341
ready.

63
00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:42.760
They're already in their jogging outfits like a dog who wants to go to the park

64
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:46.140
waiting to train him and his,
um,
and the dietician.

65
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.660
They could like rock those calories.
Think he wants it.

66
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.620
I don't think he gives a shit.
