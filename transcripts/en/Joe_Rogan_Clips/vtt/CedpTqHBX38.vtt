00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.440
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:04.291
<v 1>You know what,
man?</v>

3
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:08.580
I think there's a problem with commentary with sports that leaks into MMA and I

4
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:09.690
don't think it belongs there.

5
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:12.350
And I've fought against it from the beginning and that's the,

6
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.310
the insult commentary.

7
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.520
There's a kind of like calling people bombs and calling people losers and you

8
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:22.100
know,
get out of the game.

9
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.560
<v 0>Snoop Dogg that piece of shit.
Do you know how to call them out?
What?
What's what?</v>

10
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.840
What?
Daniela,
please do call a quarter.
Oh,
Mary called him a bitch.

11
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.040
That was a mess.
That's not cool either.
Fight.
That was a mess.

12
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.050
I think he was fucked up.
I don't care.
Yeah.
You know,
you put it on public,

13
00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:43.760
he could,
you know,
apologize,
delete it,
whatever,
you know?
Yeah.
If I go to the UFC,

14
00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:47.210
Pii am I just punch him.
If I see a man,
I'm cool with that.

15
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.690
What else do you don't want?
None of that snoop.

16
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.240
I'm just saying,
I really offends me man,
because you know what man?
Conor,

17
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.610
you know people all have their opinions about them.

18
00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:01.490
I respect the shit out of that guy.
I love what he's done.
I love,

19
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.690
I love his shtick.
Um,
I think he's a,
he's a true,
uh,
uh,

20
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.000
sportsman.
I mean,
I like him.

21
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.620
He comes into the limelight for a little while and then he goes back and I think

22
00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:17.150
he goes back and he works his ass off.
I really think he does.
Definitely does.

23
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.820
I mean,
he wouldn't be where he's at if he didn't write,
you know,

24
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.430
but everybody judges him by,
you know,
what he,
he does out here.

25
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.981
<v 1>Well,
listen,</v>

26
00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:27.880
what he did was make $100 million fighting against the greatest boxer of all

27
00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:32.320
time for professional boxing.
Match ended well and won a couple of rounds,

28
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.790
which is fucking crazy.

29
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.250
<v 0>Yeah.
That's fucking crazy.
I mean,
I think Floyd,
I think,</v>

30
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.040
I think the vast majority of people could,
uh,
of good fighters could win around,

31
00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:44.080
so against Floyd,
because Floyd,

32
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.130
I don't know if I say gives them away,
but you know,
he's going to feel you.
He,

33
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.810
you know what I mean?
He's,
that's the way he fights.
He's,

34
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:56.020
he thought everybody like that and he rarely wins the first few rounds.

35
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.220
Agreed.
Yeah.
But that's not taken away.
Nothing from Connor though.

36
00:02:00.221 --> 00:02:04.180
He didn't want to get clipped by that.
Left or cut.
Did Not.
It wasn't on plans.

37
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.140
You're right.
Yeah.

38
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.130
<v 1>I just think that what I'm talking about,</v>

39
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:11.640
it's like the commentators and a lot of the journalists and you see less of it

40
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:15.420
today because I stayed even a Smith.
Yeah.
That kind of style.

41
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.520
There's a style and this is their stick.

42
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.470
Their stick is mocking people and creating controversy and I,

43
00:02:22.471 --> 00:02:26.670
that's why I say I don't think MMA is a sport.
I think it's more intense.

44
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.840
It's you're empty and out there,
you know when you see a fight,

45
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.380
you know,
and it's a crazy ass war,

46
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:36.990
like Robbie Lawler Hofeld Los Angeles,

47
00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:41.991
where it's just five rounds of chaos to diminish either one of these guys as a

48
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:48.090
man,
as a human being based on their performance to mock them or belittle them.

49
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.610
I just don't think it has any place in that.

50
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:55.611
I think it's a way more intense and way more personal experience for those guys.

51
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.730
It's not,
it's not playing baseball.
It's not,

52
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.290
it's not fucking bill Buckner dropping a ball.
It's not,
that's not what it is,

53
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:09.040
man.
It's way more intense.
If you got a guy who,
a lazy football player,

54
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:12.310
it doesn't run fast enough.
You want to mock them tasks,
whatever,

55
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:14.980
you go ahead and do that.
I don't care.
It doesn't bother me.

56
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.520
But you want to make fun of a guy who was literally putting his health on the

57
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:19.690
line in a,

58
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:23.920
in an occupation where you're competing against a motherfucking trained killer

59
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.220
and you guys are gonna throw bones at each other for five minute rounds.

60
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.840
You got to have some respect.

61
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.210
You have to have respect or you shouldn't be talking about it.

62
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.040
You should have some understanding of it.

63
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.970
You should know what the fuck you're watching and you should have some respect.

64
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.670
And if you want to say that a guy should retire the,

65
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:42.760
if you want to say that a guy is probably seen as better days,
that's fine,

66
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.320
but have some respect.
This is a different thing,
man.
It is not a regular sport.

67
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.930
<v 0>I agree.
And not that I would say also the,
uh,</v>

68
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.700
they have no right to be saying things that they've never done right.
Yeah,

69
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.690
I mean,
you,
you,
you just can't,
you don't have to compete,
right?

70
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.930
Like you do Jujitsu and more time shit,

71
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:08.931
and you get such a more in depth knowledge about what they're truly going

72
00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:13.320
through.
Right.
And what's happening by just experiencing it a little bit.
Right.

73
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.770
<v 1>There's that,
and there's also,</v>

74
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.270
I think if you've never really been punched in the face and you're,

75
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.820
you're talking about guys getting punched in the face,

76
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.020
like you really don't even understand the experience.

77
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.170
<v 2>Okay.</v>
