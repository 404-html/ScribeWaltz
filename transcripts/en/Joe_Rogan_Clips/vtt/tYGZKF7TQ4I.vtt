WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.030
One.
If you think you got what it takes,
get the hell out there.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.060
Don't put yourself a time limit.
Now some people say,
Eh,

3
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:09.060
if I don't do it in five years,
I'm going to quit or whatever.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.350
So when I came out here,
it was all in,
you know,
if I said five years,

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.610
I wouldn't have been here.

6
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.540
I would have been back a in Chicago working at Motorola.
Who knows.

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.930
Uh,
so I family's always been really,

8
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:25.230
really key to my success.
Uh,

9
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.100
having people who are very supportive and my wife,
who's a huge,

10
00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:33.270
huge reason I am doing what I'm doing.
I mean,
you,
you know,

11
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.570
to have a wife to deal with the life of a comedian on the road away from home a

12
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:45.370
lot,
and you've got to have like a strong,
strong woman to be in your corner to,

13
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.070
to put up with that.
Also just a deal with the Weirdo of fucking comics.

14
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:55.020
A weird person.
Yeah.
I mean,
just the,
just the mentality of a comedian is,
is,

15
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:59.940
is,
is tough to be around.
Not Tough.
It's just,
you know,
we're always,
we're always,

16
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.650
you know,
in our own heads sometime.
So,
yeah.
So to answer your question,

17
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.590
where do I go from here?
I don't know.
Uh,
I'm,

18
00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:10.320
I'm enjoying doing some movies.

19
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:14.910
I just started dipping my toe in to some of these movies,
the green book,

20
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:15.721
which is out now,

21
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:20.190
and a nominated for some awards for the Oscars and happy to be a part of that.

22
00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:23.450
And then,
uh,
I like it.

23
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.540
I exercising a different muscle,
um,
when it comes to acting,

24
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.470
but not comedic acting.
I liked the dramas.
Uh,
uh,

25
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.020
I,
I'm a serious guy.
Uh,
generally speaking,
I'm not a goof ball.

26
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.040
I'm not the guy always the center of attention and it's just not who I am.

27
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.280
So I like kind of being serious and,
and,
and,

28
00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:48.060
and acting in a drama kind of place to kind of who I am.

29
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.220
It's kind of a serious guy.
Uh,
and I like it.
I,
I,

30
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.780
I get my fix from doing the stand up on stage.
I don't need to do it in a movie.

31
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.730
So I liked the challenge number one.
And number two.
Um,

32
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.160
uh,
I just liked to do different,
different things a little bit outside the box.

33
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.710
Um,
so I liked,
I liked doing it.
I mean,

34
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:14.590
did this gangster movie coming out with Scorsese and no shit.
Yeah,

35
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.700
it does that it's called the work with Scorsese.
Yeah.

36
00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:22.170
So it's called the shit to Irishman.
What is it about?

37
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.780
It's about basically Jimmy Hoffa and how,
how they killed him.

38
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.540
This guy,
I have the narrow plays,
the Irishmen.
Jimmy Hoffa is played by,

39
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:34.140
but Chino,
pat,
she's in the movie,
so,

40
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:38.530
and I played crazy Joe Gallo.
Um,
and uh,
my first Dan,

41
00:02:38.531 --> 00:02:41.850
the scent was with De Niro and Peshy.

42
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.720
So the fuck was that lie in that?
Yeah.

43
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.690
So,
um,
I was shitting.
I mean there's no,
who is that on the left?

44
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.930
Pachino get the fuck Outta here.
Wow.

45
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.300
That's incredible.
I mean,
maybe it's just that photograph,
but it,
that,

46
00:03:00.301 --> 00:03:03.750
that barely looks like,
I know that,
uh,

47
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.950
this is coming out on Netflix.
That's crazy.
Yeah.

48
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.370
How different he looks.
Wow.

49
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.720
That's a Netflix movie,
Huh?
Fucking Netflix,
Huh?
Yeah,
it's a,

50
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:21.190
it's like $145 million project and they,

51
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:23.950
uh,
it's coming out on October two.

52
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:27.430
What is enlightened to just being around Scorsese on a movie set and realize

53
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:31.420
you're a fucking actor in a Scorsese movie.
That's gotta be,
I mean,

54
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.010
that is about as high level as is.
It's like either Francis Ford Coppola,

55
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.090
Scorsese,
there's like a few people that you,
if you're on a set with them,

56
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.120
you know,
Kubrick,
when he was alive,
like,
Holy Shit,

57
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.560
that was a holy shit moment for me.
I was out,
listen,

58
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.960
I am by no stretch of the imagination,

59
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.520
a seasoned actor and then to get thrown into this group of people,

60
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.870
uh,
and,
and working with them.
I mean,
I gotta tell Ya,

61
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.940
there was a sense of doubt.
Like,
you know,
sometimes I,
should I be here,

62
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.060
shit,
you know,
this is,
this,
is this happening?
And then you know,

63
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.210
to do the scene with the narrow and Peshy.

64
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.880
It was almost like after the first scene,
I'm like,
Oh yeah,

65
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.030
I should be here.
It's all the anticipation,

66
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.010
a leading up to the moment that is unfamiliar to you.

67
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.250
Then once you do it,
you feel like,
man,

68
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.780
that was all in my head and I made it sound like it was going to be,
you know,

69
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.170
cause I was thinking the negative too.
I always think,
oh,

70
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:38.230
I'm going to screw this up and this,
that's what motivates me.

71
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:43.150
I never look in the positive,
always come from a negative place.
But uh,
once,

72
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:45.040
once I did that first scene with them and they were,

73
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.170
these guys were more than helpful,
uh,
working with them.

74
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:54.910
I mean,
Scorsese,
when he came out it was friendly.
Nice.
You know,
it was,

75
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:58.480
it was encouraging to be around that kind of positive energy.

76
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.230
Did you have a hard time sleeping the night before?
Oh yeah.
I didn't sleep,

77
00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:06.220
I don't think for the first week leading up to the scene.
Um,

78
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.380
because I knew it was going to be with De Niro and Peshy.

79
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.990
They took Gotham comedy club in New York City and they made at the Copa Cabana,

80
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.430
which I thought was fitting because Gotham comedy club is kind of where I did

81
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:21.370
all my standup in New York.
I didn't really do any other club,

82
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:23.980
but Gotham and then here,
Great Club,
Great Club.

83
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.820
[inaudible] brothers who run it are fantastic guys.
And uh,
they,

84
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.550
they stayed transformed the Gotham comedy club into,
uh,

85
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.310
the Copa Cabana and uh,

86
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.050
Don Rickles is played by Jim Norton.
Uh,
no shit,

87
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.240
I'm watching.
I'm watching him on stage with,

88
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:47.074
um,

89
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.490
it's just crazy and it's like perfect Rickles.

90
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.190
I'm just thinking about that.
He's perfect for that.

91
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.100
You really did a fantastic job.
Really,
really did a great even

92
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.850
<v 1>smile is almost like Rickles ask.
Yeah,
they gave him</v>

93
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.333
<v 2>Ah,</v>

94
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.200
<v 1>oh,
that's fantastic.
Casting.
Great.
Wow.
I mean,
come on.
Slow.</v>

95
00:06:10.201 --> 00:06:12.980
The fuck else would be better.
You got to get them fat that they fattened him on,

96
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.190
fatten them up.
Did he give him makeup to fat number?
They make him eat,

97
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.740
<v 0>made them,
I think they made him bald and they gave him a fat suit.
No Shit.</v>

98
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.130
Wow.
So that's amazing.

99
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.390
I mean the Jim Norton's a guy known for what the 20 years and now I'm sitting

100
00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:33.710
there watching him as Don Rickles in a movie.
It was just blowing my mind.

101
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.030
It just blowing my mind.
But uh,
this thing is going to be,
I can't wait to see it.

102
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:40.670
I didn't see any of the movie even when I was doing it.

103
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:44.340
I didn't even look at what I was doing.
So,
uh,
yeah,

104
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.370
I'm really excited to see what this thing looks like.

105
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.270
<v 1>God Damn.
That's phenomenal.
What a milestone.</v>

106
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.780
A movie with Deniro output Chino Joe Judge Pass.

107
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.990
She a fucking Scorsese film.
Harvie cartels.

108
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.580
Holy Shit.
By Bobby kind of allies in it.
It's Harvey cartel.

109
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.350
A lot of people never saw the bad lieutenant.

110
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.860
Did you ever see them out of the 10 I've never seen.
Oh my God,
look,

111
00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:11.920
Harvey Keitel has been amazing in virtually everything he's ever done.

112
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.480
But the bad lieutenant is one of those movies that's so fucked up and so crazy.

113
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.820
And it was a about a bad cop,

114
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.290
like all fucking really bad co and a completely,

115
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.070
totally out of control.
But it is one of those movies where after it's over,

116
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.410
you know the credits roll and you're just sitting there trying to catch your

117
00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:32.290
breath.
Just going to Jesus Christ.
What the fuck did I just watch?

118
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:36.640
There's a an eighties ah,
I don't know how Jackie was.

119
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.450
It says 93 but they remade it with Nicholas cage a couple of years ago to get

120
00:07:40.451 --> 00:07:43.750
the fuck out of here with that bad.
It's not the same.

121
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.460
No,
I love Nicolas Cage,
but no,

122
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.180
you stick to drive in that Eleanor Mustang and gone in 60 seconds.

123
00:07:52.181 --> 00:07:56.110
You can't be bad lieutenant you son of a bitch.
Nothing.
You're not a great actor,

124
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.650
but look,
it's just,

125
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:02.320
there's certain guys that take over a role and to do that again,

126
00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:06.640
like here's one,
like say if they offered you taxi driver,
they say,
hey,

127
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.220
we're going to do taxi driver again.
You don't have to be like,
yeah,

128
00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:12.490
good luck casting somebody else.
Get the fuck away from me with that.
I can.

129
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.020
You can't be,

130
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.930
you can't be Dinero in taxi driver unless you're deniro like possible.

131
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.030
That movie Cape Fear,
another one he nailed.
It's by,
by the way,

132
00:08:22.031 --> 00:08:23.440
Kate fear was,

133
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:28.060
I think someone else was that character before.

134
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.680
I think Robert Mitchum I think played the same role that Deniro played.

135
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.070
But I didn't know that when I saw it when I saw it.

136
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:39.520
I just thought it's fucking deniro.
I 62 there it is.
Yeah.

137
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.130
But if they tried to do it today,
like get the fuck Outta here.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

138
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:44.973
no.
You can't.

139
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.320
Especially taxi driver now you can't recreate that role with another actor.

140
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.800
No bad lieutenant.
Nobody's seen that.

141
00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:53.650
Nicholas cage badly 10 and even Nicolas Cage probably didn't watch it.

142
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.880
It might've been like a Sikh.

143
00:08:56.881 --> 00:08:59.400
Why don't know if it was a remake cause it's called port of call.

144
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:02.100
Like it's got an extension on the end of the port of call New Orleans.

145
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.010
It's called bad lieutenant port of call New Orleans.
Yeah,
I heard about that.

146
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.320
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the Nicholas cage one to nine.

147
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.340
So they tried to piggy back on it or some shit like that.
Yeah.

148
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.970
But whenever that Harvey cartel version is,
Holy Shit,

149
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.530
but he's creating everything.
He was great.

150
00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:18.390
And Pulp Fiction and he's great and everything.

151
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:23.040
<v 0>Yeah,
he's a fantastic actor and they really,
I mean the people in this movie are,</v>

152
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.880
what's it like hanging out with those guys?
I listen Joe,
when I went in there,

153
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.910
I told myself,
I ain't talking to nobody.

154
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.560
I'm going to speak when spoken to,
um,

155
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.820
there was a part when they were kind of lighting Deniro and I,

156
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.960
and were standing face to face and he's looking at me and I'm looking right at

157
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:46.910
him and I wasn't gonna say nothing.
And then he comes in and my,

158
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.750
my tiny tiny needs to be tight and a little bit and he cinched my tie.

159
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.030
Oh Wow.

160
00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.420
Straightened out my,
yeah,
I had a wig.

161
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.680
They put me in a wig.
And what kind of wig would it look like?
Actually,

162
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:05.514
there's there,
there,

163
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:10.110
if you type up Sebastian Maniscalco Irishman that it should pop up.

164
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.930
Oh yeah,
there it is.
What is the difference?

165
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.260
I'm so confused.
Why did they give you a wig?
It's Scott sideburns.

166
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:23.260
I mean if you,
if you see it in person,
you'll understand maybe why I have,

167
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.160
yeah,
it's not that much of a departure from,
from my,
my real hair.
But,
uh,

168
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.380
<v 1>did they give you the option to grow inside burns and you like it?
The phone?</v>

169
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.000
<v 0>No,
they just said it again.
I didn't say nothing.</v>

170
00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:39.180
They said you're going to wear a wig,
no problem.
Whatever you want me to do.

171
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.210
Scorsese was like,
um,
okay.
Um,

172
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.290
there's a part where I'm going to go through a window and he's like,
okay,

173
00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:49.470
when you go through the window and I'm like,
oh,
I'm going to a window.

174
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.470
Cause I knew there was a stunt guy involved.
Right.

175
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.160
But he's telling me that I'm going to go to the window and I wasn't going to
say,

176
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.630
I don't do windows.

177
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.440
You want me to go to the window to a window.

178
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.250
I'm not gonna tell Martin Scorsese op,
sorry,
I need a stunt guy.
Um,

179
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:10.920
but then they said,
hey Marty,
there is a stunt guy here.
He goes,
oh,
okay.
So,
uh,

180
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:14.250
I was ready to go through the window.
I went through a window on news radio,

181
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.900
Nick Dipaolo through me through a window.
Is that right?
Yeah,

182
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.620
<v 1>it's,
it's easy.
They're made out of sugar glass.
You just go right through it.</v>

183
00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.160
It's weird.
It feels like nothing like a tissue paper or something.

184
00:11:27.161 --> 00:11:27.994
It's very strange.

185
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.540
<v 0>I was like,
whatever,
whatever it,
whatever it takes.</v>

186
00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:35.420
Scorsese wants me to go through.
I mean the guy went through the stunt,

187
00:11:35.421 --> 00:11:38.660
double went through and he cut his hand.
Oh,
did he really?
So I dunno what,

188
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.980
what it was.
Oh,
if I would've went through the window,
Joe,

189
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.470
I would've been dead.
He's such a cycle.

190
00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:46.960
He might've made the guy go through real glass,

191
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:52.670
<v 1>you know,
he might've been like,
this is just not realistic enough.
This,
yeah.</v>

192
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.160
If 500 extra dollars,

193
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.950
<v 0>this sugar glass,
whatever it is,
is not going to work.</v>

194
00:11:56.951 --> 00:12:00.490
But I guess you could probably cut yourself on that sugar glass shit if you

195
00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:04.810
landed wrong.
I mean,
if it was sticking up wrong,
you placed your hand funny.

196
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.580
It makes sense.
Probably could cut yourself a little bit.

197
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.920
But yeah,
it was exciting.

198
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.510
It's been really exciting for me to last three or four years,
um,

199
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.470
to have these opportunities to do these things.
And,
um,
yeah,

200
00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:22.030
it's,
uh,
that's great.
