1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.880
Hello Freak bitches.
So,
uh,
first of all,
thanks for doing this.

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.260
You've been on this crazy sort of whirlwind tour.

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.570
Have you gone anywhere or you just been doing it?

4
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:14.820
Most of them mostly from your house and honestly from my house,

5
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:19.320
just on Skype now for people who don't know the story,

6
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:21.330
let's give them the short version of it.

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.860
You were working at Google and what prompted you to write this memo?

8
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.690
<v 1>It's a,</v>

9
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.960
they would have these companywide meetings where they just push a lot of this

10
00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:33.320
diversity stuff and some of it was kind of weird.

11
00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:37.250
So I decided to go to these,
uh,
these secret meetings,

12
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:41.360
sort of that we're about a hundred people,
a completely unrecorded,

13
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.410
and they would talk about some of the things that they're doing and it would

14
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.080
really contradict what they're saying publicly where,
oh no,

15
00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:52.790
we're not changing any of our hiring practices for these candidates.

16
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.540
And they said,
yeah,
we basically are,
uh,

17
00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.050
making it easier for some kind of ways to get in.
And I,
you know,

18
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:04.220
I voiced some concerns,
but people just chain me and was like,
no,

19
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.520
you're wrong.
You're just like,
have white male privilege.

20
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.770
<v 0>I said,
you have white male privilege.
That was the actual word.
The is.</v>

21
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.780
<v 1>Yeah,
there's a lot of that going on.</v>

22
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.940
And so they asked for feedback on the program.
So I,

23
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.360
I wrote this document to clarify my thoughts.
I sent it to them,

24
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.860
they looked at it,
but you know,
they just ignored it.
Never told me anything.

25
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.410
So I went to a couple more of these programs and you know,

26
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.470
I gave similar feedback.
I gave the same document,

27
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.720
they kept looking at it but just never said anything.
And you know,
I,

28
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.350
I would send it to random people that I knew and half the people would be like,

29
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:42.570
yes,
exactly.
This is what I've been thinking.

30
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.530
And the other half would maybe disagree with some points,

31
00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:50.010
but it would never be an emotional outbursts or anything.
It would just be like,

32
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.250
oh,
are you sure that this is actually happening?
And it's like,
yes,

33
00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:56.100
because you know,
I've actually been to these unrecorded meetings.

34
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.113
This is what's happened.

35
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.070
<v 0>So if you could get into specifics,</v>

36
00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:02.700
like when you're in these meetings and they're talking about diversity,

37
00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:07.640
what is their concern and is it there they're trying to promote a,

38
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.820
an image of diversity.
Are they trying to promote actual diversity?

39
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.570
I do they think that there's a benefit for diversity or is it a part of their

40
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:16.860
public public image?

41
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.750
And is it a lot of it to avoid criticism because I think there's a big issue

42
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.770
with,
I mean if you don't have all your bases covered,
two black women,

43
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:28.860
two Asian men,
if you don't have all your bases covered,

44
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.900
you can get like pretty roundly criticized is not being diverse or being

45
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:36.850
possibly racist when you do that,
you're kind of fucked.
Correct.

46
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.391
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:42.220
So Google definitely has a huge target on its back and so there are people that

48
00:02:42.221 --> 00:02:45.340
want to complain that,
oh,
Google is not diverse,

49
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.470
therefore it's racist and sexist.

50
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.820
And so that's a lot of their fear that they look at their representation and

51
00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:55.810
then compare it to the overall us population and say,
Oh,

52
00:02:55.811 --> 00:03:00.580
we only have 20% women.
We should have 50% there's some sexism happening.

53
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.210
And so a lot of their stuff is,
oh,

54
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:07.870
we need to fix this because you know,
all this sexism is bad.

55
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.550
And obviously if you disagree with sexism,
that's of course bad.
And like,

56
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.660
I obviously don't,
uh,
you know,
want there to be any sexism,

57
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:20.290
but I just don't think that that's the sole cause of this.

58
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:23.880
A disparity in representation.

59
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.511
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:24.511 --> 00:03:29.511
It seems like in the interest of promoting an image of diversity,

61
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.610
they're willing to bypass science and the truth and the reality of culture,

62
00:03:35.701 --> 00:03:39.720
the reality of human biology and evolutionary psychology.

63
00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:44.721
There's just so much that they're willing to look past to get to this one thing,

64
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.960
which seems to be like this really important thing today.

65
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.740
Society that you want to promote an image of diversity.

66
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.000
It's more important than anything.
So like when you're in these classes or these,

67
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.510
I mean,
I wouldn't call it a class,
what would you call it?
A meeting?
Well,

68
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.270
whatever they are.
Yes.

69
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.640
<v 1>Some of them were classes somewhere,
you know,</v>

70
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.610
our day long programs and teach you things like what would they teach you there?

71
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.530
Talk about unconscious bias and no.

72
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.540
<v 0>Oh lucky you might be racist.
You have to find the racism in menu</v>

73
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.940
<v 1>and yeah,</v>

74
00:04:16.941 --> 00:04:21.410
there's a whole program that's trying to retrain your brain to think,

75
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.440
to think about race in a new way or something.

76
00:04:24.441 --> 00:04:28.640
So they're just assuming you're guilty pretty much.
Cause you're white.

77
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.620
I well yeah,
I mean they look at the representation and say racism,

78
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.483
sexism,

79
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.330
<v 0>do uh,
black people have to go to this.</v>

80
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.160
<v 1>Aye.
Aye.
They no one has to ask too.</v>

81
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.220
They are definitely pushing it on people.
And uh,

82
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.750
now managers are being evaluated by how well they promote diversity and

83
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:51.880
inclusion and you know,

84
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:55.720
it's just a slippery slope and I think it'll eventually become part of our

85
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.610
performance review.

86
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.040
<v 0>So if you're a white woman,
do you have to go to this?
I mean,
did that,</v>

87
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:04.840
are you encouraged to go to this?
Are you like,
Hey,

88
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:07.690
you made it through like this will have been looking for your fine or if you're

89
00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:10.240
an Indian woman even better.
Right?

90
00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:13.840
Is that how it works or would you still have to go there and approach your

91
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:15.190
unconscious biases?

92
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.930
<v 1>Yeah.
They say everyone has these unconscious biases</v>

93
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.600
<v 0>towards white people.
Oh,</v>

94
00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:23.450
do they have those where they have like black people with their unconscious

95
00:05:23.451 --> 00:05:24.860
biases towards white people.

96
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.490
<v 1>So they never acknowledged that anyone could be racist against white people.</v>

97
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.840
Of course.
Why would you,
yeah.
It's all this like if you have,

98
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.800
you can only be racist if you're have power or sex if you have power and they

99
00:05:36.801 --> 00:05:41.120
believe that the racist part.
Yeah,
I think so.
Well that's insane.

100
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.000
<v 0>That's a redefinition.
It's a very recent redefinition of the term racism,</v>

101
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.650
but it's very slippery.

102
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.540
Very dangerous because you could see it as,
you know,
promoting in,

103
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:56.840
in fact like exonerating racism towards uh,

104
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.020
other ethnicities or towards why people are towards people that you feel like

105
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:01.370
are in a privileged class.

106
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.640
You'd get away with it cause it's no big deal because they're the ones who are

107
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:07.160
racist.
Even if it's not even that person.

108
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:10.100
If it's people who look like them that have lived for centuries,

109
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.930
like somehow or another,
you are a guilty person with your teams,

110
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.920
with your white privilege.
So like,

111
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:18.460
what would they tell you when you would go to these?
Do you do,

112
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.700
did you like express some discontent or,

113
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.440
<v 1>yeah,
I,
I,</v>

114
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.510
my main concern was them saying 50% in the population look who all has 20%.

115
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.360
And so we're [inaudible] yeah,
yeah.
And you know,

116
00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:39.220
there were clear reasons,

117
00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:44.221
at least in my mind that that's not as simple as they're making out to be and

118
00:06:44.831 --> 00:06:46.030
that,
you know,
there are these,

119
00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:50.620
some differences and that could explain some of the issues that women are
facing.

120
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.950
And so a lot of these women issues in tech I feel are actually not really gender

121
00:06:57.401 --> 00:07:02.230
issues there just,
uh,
you know,
women on average are more cooperative,
for example.

122
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.910
And so they may find it harder to,
you know,
lean in,

123
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.710
in the corporate world like Sheryl Sandberg is saying,
but you know,

124
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.600
there are men that also feel like that I'm not very assertive.

125
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.810
I'm actually pretty shy and so I feel the same stuff.
It's not that,
you know,

126
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.020
there's a ton of sexism.

127
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.310
It's maybe that male typical behavior is rewarded.

128
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.780
Just as you know,
competitiveness is rewarding in a lot of corporate world,

129
00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:32.770
but it's not that we're just,
Oh,
you're a woman,

130
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.190
therefore you're obviously bad at coding.
You know?
No one has ever saying that.

131
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.750
<v 0>Right.</v>

132
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.750
I think there is absolutely an issue with assertive women being treated very

133
00:07:41.971 --> 00:07:45.180
differently than a sort of men.
Like an assertive woman is a bitch.

134
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.080
Like you don't want to be around them.
That's like the,
the,
the bias and a,

135
00:07:49.081 --> 00:07:52.440
that's a real issue I think for women that want to enter into any sort of a

136
00:07:52.441 --> 00:07:57.060
competitive field and you know where a man would be assertive if a woman does

137
00:07:57.061 --> 00:07:59.940
the exact same thing she's looked down upon,

138
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.300
just looked upon like a problem woman or like someone you don't want to work

139
00:08:03.301 --> 00:08:05.610
with.
Whereas the guy is just ambitious.

140
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.980
<v 1>Yeah.
Although some people will twist that and say that because I,</v>

141
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:10.880
and a lot of it is just,

142
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:14.000
they try to fit their ideology and they see one data point and they extrapolate.

143
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:19.210
So they see these studies and it's true that these women are viewed as less

144
00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:22.910
likable,
but they are seen as just as competent.

145
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.470
And so their performance review isn't affected really by being assertive.

146
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:30.970
It's just that socially they may not be as likely.

147
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.360
<v 0>Right.
But that's gotta be a factor in the way the behave.
Because for men,</v>

148
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:40.390
a ball busting successful man is supposed to be like looked up to like,

149
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.490
oh this is the guy who was kicking ass in the corporate world.

150
00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:47.330
He's doing it right.
Like you know,
Bob is ruthless.
But if Jenny's ruthless,

151
00:08:47.331 --> 00:08:50.090
like you don't want to be around her,
you know,
it's a,
it's a weird,

152
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.900
it's just that's,
I feel like that if there is a real bias with men,

153
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:55.980
and obviously I don't work in

154
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.910
<v 1>tech,
but I would assume that that would be a real bias.
Yeah.</v>

155
00:08:58.911 --> 00:09:03.540
And I mean I think some of the solution to that is just allowing people to be

156
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:08.210
more cooperative.
And you know,
actually,
so for example,

157
00:09:08.211 --> 00:09:09.044
a Google,

158
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.140
you're really rewarded for owning a particular project and seeing that one

159
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:16.530
project go through.
But if you're someone that is just,
you know,

160
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.930
can really help a lot of different people,

161
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.370
and you're not necessarily a sole owner of any individual thing,
but you're,

162
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:28.580
you provide a lot of value to a company that isn't really seen as positive as

163
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:33.140
someone that really drove the project alone.
Hmm.

164
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.560
That's interesting.
Yeah.
That seems like a bad thing for teamwork,
right?

165
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.270
Is that just a bad philosophy or something that got stuck in the way the system

166
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:44.130
works,
or,
I think it's sorta just,

167
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:48.450
it's hard to evaluate if I did,
you know,

168
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:53.210
10% of my time on 10 different projects and I help them don't make sense.
Yeah.

169
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.750
So you'd have to essentially trust the workers instincts and work ethic and,

170
00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.253
yeah.

171
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:08.910
<v 2>Okay.</v>
