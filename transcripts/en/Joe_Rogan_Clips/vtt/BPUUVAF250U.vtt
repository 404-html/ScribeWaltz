1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.590
The joe rogan experience.
Do you know anything what's going on in Boyle Heights?

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.080
No.
Boyle Heights.
Ucla,
right?
Yeah,
it's SLA.
And um,

3
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.390
apparently the hipsters are starting to open up our teasing old coffee shops and

4
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.480
art galleries there and they're not having it.
And uh,

5
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.540
the neighborhoods pushing back,
it's more than that.
There's a lot of videos.

6
00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:28.660
It's like straight up racist.
It's anti white racism,

7
00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.580
which is apparently totally acceptable.

8
00:00:30.581 --> 00:00:34.180
You didn't have cameras are blaring in your face.
Uh,
we'll boil heights,

9
00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:38.290
be ruined by one coffee shop.
It's not just one coffee shop.

10
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.170
They forced a gallery under.
Is this an older story from June's?
Yeah,

11
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.420
they forced a gallery out just through constant harassment and they broke the

12
00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:48.130
windows of this coffee shop and,

13
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.960
but what I watched last night there was disturbing was these air quote activists

14
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.380
standing in front of this gallery.
It's a fucking art gallery.

15
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.960
And they're screaming,
get the fuck out.
Get the fuck out of our neighborhood.

16
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.960
Get the fuck out.
We don't want you here.

17
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.790
And the guy was like trying to talk to him like,

18
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.480
you know some hipster guys like you know I'm,
I identify as a feminist.

19
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:12.300
Like one of those guy identifies a feminine,
you know,
one of those guys.

20
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:16.490
And he was like,
yes,
I'm here to support.
I'm here to support the QME.

21
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.560
We will fuck it.
Why don't you get the fuck out?
Get the fuck out there chanting,

22
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.810
get the fuck out,
get the fuck,
get the fuck out.

23
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:29.770
It's a great chance a sign that says fuck white art,
white fuck white art.

24
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.260
The coffee shop,
they broke the windows here.

25
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.560
The coffee shop was even more fucked up cause one of the guys is actually a

26
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:38.930
Mexican.
He slapped her.
No,
they fucked up proper.
Okay.
Right.
Yeah.

27
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:41.150
And one of the guys who won in the coffee shop,
they were calling it,
it's,

28
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.500
they called it like weird coffee or something like that.
And neither the,
they,

29
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.890
they put a sign on it calling it white coffee and they broke the window.

30
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.280
But one of the guys who owns it is Latino.
I don't know if he's Mexican,

31
00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:54.340
but he's definitely,
it'd be funny to open up a spot called white coffee.
Yeah.

32
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.810
White people come.
People just called white people problems.
Look,

33
00:01:58.811 --> 00:02:00.640
a new generation of anti gentrification,

34
00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:03.550
radicals are on the march in Los Angeles and around the city.

35
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.530
This is not every dad is not an accurate way to frame what's happening.

36
00:02:08.531 --> 00:02:12.520
No,
that's crazy.
This is not anti gentrification radicals.
These are,

37
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.240
these are writers and the writing and these people have fire in their hands or

38
00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:19.660
walking in the street and they're yelling at a bunch of racist shit and they

39
00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:23.660
covered their faces up.
Look,
I get it.
I get what's going on.
Like they're,

40
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:26.200
they're afraid they're gonna lose their neighborhood and they're afraid their

41
00:02:26.201 --> 00:02:29.940
neighborhood's going to be pushed out.
The dinosaurs felt the same way.
So to,

42
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:32.800
yeah,
so did cavemen.
Everybody feels the same way.

43
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.370
The world is a fucking fluid moving thing.

44
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.880
You can't just save neighborhoods forever.
It just doesn't work that way.

45
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.140
You can't save anything forever.
No.
I mean,
and there's nothing wrong with it.

46
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:47.590
God Damn Gallery moving into your neighborhood.
That's crazy.
Right,
right.
Like,

47
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.503
like I,

48
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.720
I see it when people do this whole thing about like Walmart's moving into small

49
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:54.390
towns and that they lose,
they panic.
Like I get that.

50
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:55.710
I understand it's changing industry.

51
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.800
A dude selling fucking lattes is not going to dynamically shaper and,

52
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.670
and if it does it'll take 15 more more years.
Yeah,
it'll take 15 more years.

53
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.400
But they know it's coming.
They know what happens in these neighborhoods.

54
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:11.401
It's like these hipsters move in first because La real estate is so ridiculous

55
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:17.380
and it doesn't make,
like I was looking at places near where Collin lives,

56
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.130
cow lives in Santa Monica and I was looking at places like he lives above
ground.

57
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.690
Yes,
I know right.
He lived in like the sewer system or something like that.

58
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.580
I can think like one of them Ninja turtle because the turtle that can live on

59
00:03:29.581 --> 00:03:33.400
the beat,
the scoring system.
He lives in a very nice neighborhood.
I mean I'm not,

60
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.840
but I was just looking in Santa Monica in general and a regular house,

61
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.680
like a regular house is $2 million.
Yeah.
Bullshit House.

62
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.190
Like it was a fucking normal house house.
Nothing like you be like,

63
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.470
you can bring a a gal back home like,
hey my house.
Huh?
You know,

64
00:03:48.471 --> 00:03:52.090
look at the view of the city.
No,
there's none of that Arrow or $2 million.

65
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:54.820
You get a shack two bed.
One and a half bath.
Yeah.

66
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:59.710
With the fucking old bullshit linoleum.
Yeah.
Shitty sync with the ring.

67
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.910
Where at the fucking water.

68
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.140
The dirt has just stayed in those old la La loves doing like,
uh,

69
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:07.960
in the 60s they love doing like a or in the 50s,

70
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:12.020
maybe pink like pink and green bathrooms.
So it was like pink tile.
Yeah.

71
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.310
And they leave that and ultra,
um,
I was just looking today Deco's at arc.
Yeah.

72
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.870
Or just,
or just bad decision making.
It's all,

73
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.930
we're looking at a place today where you guys looking just Hollywood hills on

74
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:25.270
the other side of,
yeah.
It's just,
it's a nice,
yeah,
but it's a nightmare.

75
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:27.520
All that stuff.
Can you think of it?
They're like,
oh,
the drainage.

76
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.360
I went to a super rich dude's house.
How much does that one take?
A guess.

77
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.510
$10 million.
A little more.
No Way.

78
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.930
At 2.2 well you don't mind cause it's a DUPLO.
They split it.
It it.

79
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:40.960
Those are two apartments they rent,
right?
Is that what it is?
Yeah,
that's it.

80
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.670
That's to one side is a door or the right and lefts or doors.
Yeah.
Yeah.

81
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.860
So what La does is they take these old buildings,
split them like that,

82
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:49.970
so then they can make twice the money.
The property is,

83
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.670
the property can't be worth that much.

84
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:54.880
It's just the fact that they can rent it to two people.
That's a lot of money,

85
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:59.680
man.
Wow.
Oh my God.
This is 1.5 0.5 how big is it?

86
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.460
1,000.
A thousand square feet.
Square feet.
Stupid one.

87
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:04.920
That's the size of this studio,
right?

88
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.170
That's the size of where the mics are inside of here.
It's pretty close.

89
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.880
A thousand square feet is really,
I mean if you're one dude living by yourself,

90
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.000
like maybe you've got a dog.
Yeah.
But then that one dude would just rent.

91
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.300
He probably should.
They,
unless he's just real simple.

92
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:22.030
Like there's those people that buy those miniature houses.

93
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.360
Ever seen those tiny houses,
tiny house that you want to talk about?

94
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:29.710
Warm whole shit.
I got it.
I got ended that so deep,
Dude.
I was like,

95
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:32.540
what if I did that?
What if I did a tiny how shit.

96
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>
