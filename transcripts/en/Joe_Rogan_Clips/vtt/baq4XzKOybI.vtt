Hello Freak bitches

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.400
<v 1>in the video game industry with these people that are predominantly left wing</v>

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.000
and predominantly progressive quote.
I say progressive,

4
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:13.640
but progressive is kind of a dirty word now.
It's becoming,

5
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.410
there's a difference between liberal and progressive.
Well,
it's,

6
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.680
it would be great if everybody was liberal.

7
00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:22.160
If it'd be great if everybody was progressive and it'd be great if everybody

8
00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:25.460
wanted people to have freedom of choice and,

9
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.230
and freedom to be whoever you want.

10
00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:29.630
But that's not really what those things are anymore.

11
00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:31.370
Those things are like ideologies.

12
00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:34.550
There are these predetermined patterns of behavior that people subscribed to in

13
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:37.520
a very,
very rigid way.
How,

14
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.580
what did you find was an issue when people found out about your extreme

15
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.550
understanding and a respect for the history of the United States?

16
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.470
<v 0>Well,
they think it's,
they primarily,</v>

17
00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:53.760
they think it was like kind of a joke because not,
not,
not a hydro,

18
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.020
but like you're,
you're a clown kind of.
Because why?

19
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.620
Because I believe in a small government,
for instance,
I believe in low taxation.

20
00:00:59.621 --> 00:01:01.840
I believe in the elimination of the income tax and things like this.
These are,

21
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.580
these are Rad,
but I don't actually have like,

22
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.910
not all my ideas are radical or even outside of the mainstream.
Socially,

23
00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:09.760
I'm probably further to the left than many of these people,
you know.
Uh,

24
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.490
I think that it's,
it,
it goes back to this idea,

25
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.590
and this is something Dave Ruben has touched on a lot in this show,

26
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.970
which I'm sure you're familiar with,

27
00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:18.490
which is this idea that it's really all or nothing.

28
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.610
Like they don't want to be an ally with someone that might be able to help them

29
00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:24.520
in x,
Y,
and Z if they disagree with people in a,
B and c.

30
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.350
So they could have had a great ally in me and being like,

31
00:01:26.351 --> 00:01:30.840
I've been pro gay marriage forever.
I've been pro choice.
Uh,
you know,
uh,
um,
um,

32
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.270
for the decriminalization of drugs,
I'm for the legalization of prostitution.

33
00:01:34.271 --> 00:01:37.240
I'm for a lot of these things that are very far to the left socially that we

34
00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:39.880
probably could find some agreement on somewhere and we can work on those things

35
00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:42.970
and get those things done together.
But because I say also like,
Hey,

36
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.720
the income tax is predatory and really hurts people.
I own a business,

37
00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:48.760
I owned a business and I want to,
I guess I want another one now.

38
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.540
And I know that I could have hired another person if taxes weren't so onerous on

39
00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:56.230
me.
Um,
and so I also stand on there and they,
they,
they're like,

40
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.310
this never happened.
This stuff that you just said never happened.
This left,

41
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:00.041
this left the left wing.

42
00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:02.950
Stuff that we agree on never happened because you don't believe in because you

43
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:05.000
have this one thing that we have a problem with now we're going to get.

44
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.920
<v 1>But you're not being that clear about that.</v>

45
00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:10.490
Like what is the issue when it comes to small government,

46
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:13.100
like you wanting small government,
what's the opposition to that?

47
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.970
What are they saying?

48
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:14.151
<v 0>Well,</v>

49
00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:17.540
they say like they make a lot of it's insinuations cause a lot of it isn't even

50
00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:21.200
things that I feel or believe.
So an example would be,
um,
you know,

51
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:22.940
I see a lot of people say all the time,

52
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:25.650
like a column doesn't believe in welfare or column doesn't believe in,

53
00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:28.910
in an social security.
I'm like,
I never said that actually.
I just,

54
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.060
I believe that these things should be reformed and,

55
00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:32.750
and maybe take it back a step,

56
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.320
but they even look at that as a push too far on the,
on the system.

57
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.370
I guess what I'm trying to say to you,

58
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:40.670
and I'm sorry I'm not being more lucid with you,
I'm trying my hardest is,

59
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.700
is that they're,
they,
you have to agree with them lockstep,
right?

60
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:48.060
If they see you in one way that isn't it,
that is,

61
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.900
is injurious to their cause or to that is conflicting or contrary to what they

62
00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:55.410
believe.
They do not give a fuck about anything else you believe.

63
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.690
And that's the thing that always frustrated me and what so surprise me within

64
00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:00.070
that,
people really were running me out on a rail out of the gaming

65
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.770
<v 1>industry with the,
with an completely innocuous joke,</v>

66
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:04.420
which I think tells you everything you need to know about the,

67
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.070
the intent that they don't see.
They don't want allies in different ways.

68
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.240
Allies in different close allies.
They want just,
they just want complete,

69
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.900
you know,
it's very Orwellian.
They just want you to be completely like them.

70
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:19.090
And if you're not like them,
they don't want anything to do with you.

71
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.760
And it's these,
and it's not even like I was advocating for anything crazy.

72
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:23.410
I don't advocate for anything crazy.

73
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:25.540
I don't think that doesn't sound crazy at all.

74
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.750
But what's interesting is we've kind of turned a corner where in many ways the

75
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:35.590
right is more tolerant than the left to variations in their ideology.

76
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.580
Whereas the right is much more tolerant to people that support gay marriage.

77
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:43.720
The right is much more tolerant to people that,
I mean this is,

78
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:44.560
you fill in the blanks,

79
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:49.561
there's a bunch of different rights that the REIT would sort of accept from

80
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:53.400
someone who also voted Republican.
But the left isn't like if,

81
00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:57.280
if you got to the point where like I got an a in a heated argument with someone

82
00:03:57.281 --> 00:04:01.570
wants about abortion,
which I'm pro choice,
but what I was saying,

83
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:02.810
well essentially what I was,

84
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.480
it was a criticism of a Richard Dawkins quote where he's comparing a human

85
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:10.840
embryo to a pig fetus or a pig embryo.

86
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.850
I forget what the terms you used,
but I'm like,

87
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:15.790
well that's ridiculous because one of them is going to become a person if you

88
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:18.790
don't take it out of your body.
Right.
And that was the idea behind it.

89
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:23.770
Like you can't,
you can't use that sort of an analogy because it's not true.

90
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.680
I mean it's just one has the potential for being a person.

91
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:29.800
And I was being accused by this guy of being right wing because of it.

92
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.420
And I was like,
well,
I'm not right wing.

93
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.220
I'm just talking about the potential for life.

94
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:38.140
Like a pig embryo is never going to be my neighbor Mike.
You know,
it's just not,

95
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.210
you know what I mean?
But,
but that baby,

96
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:43.870
I'm not saying you should be forced to make that baby a person and keep it in

97
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:48.270
your body when it's a few cells and then,
uh,
two weeks old.
And then,

98
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.080
I'm not saying that you can't choose when to terminate your pregnancy,

99
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.450
but what I'm saying is you're terminating a pregnancy.

100
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.480
We both know what you're doing.
I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to do it,

101
00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:01.930
but to pretend that it's not messy and nobody wants it to be messy.

102
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:04.930
Nobody wants it to be a complicated issue.
They want it to be cut and dry.

103
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:07.810
If you're on the left in particular,
it's pro choice,

104
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.520
a woman's reproductive choice,
that freedom of your body to do what you want.

105
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.490
I get all that.
I'm 100% with you,
but let's,

106
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.220
let's not lie about what it is because as soon as,

107
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.520
as soon as we distort the reality of what the thing is,

108
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.610
then we put up these ideological boundaries.

109
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:28.750
And blinders and we make communication very difficult and we make these rigid

110
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:33.040
ideologies almost like a religion.
They're,
they're almost like dogma.

111
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.590
And when you do,
I put it,
I mean,
when you do that,

112
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:38.710
you have real problems because people can't communicate.
So if someone,

113
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.340
these are the things that I,
I forgot for so long in a way,

114
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.530
because I was writing about games,
which I love.
I Love Games.

115
00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:46.210
I think they're important.
They're an important piece of escape.

116
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:48.070
They're an important piece of art.
I think that's all great.

117
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.090
But being able to engage with someone like yourself,

118
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.390
with someone like a Dave Rubin or someone like a Steven Crowder,

119
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:58.100
whoever it might be.
I was on Glenn Beck's radio show last week.

120
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.650
<v 0>It brings out an energy in me that wear a bow tie.
I was,
oh,</v>

121
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.340
I don't know.
I was on the phone,
so I have no,
he could have been naked for on.
Uh,

122
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.870
but it brings out an energy me where I'm like,

123
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:12.290
I can finally engage with people that know what the fuck they're talking about

124
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:14.600
in this particular realm,
which I think is so exciting.

125
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:17.840
And so interesting and we can have,
you know,
we had,
we debated,

126
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:19.430
we don't agree on everything.
I think that's awesome.

127
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.320
That's a really cool that you found,
uh,
a very big positive out of this.

128
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.250
Now you can express yourself more honestly and you can,

129
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.760
you can gravitate towards your real interests and yeah,

130
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:32.481
that's what I'm trying to do.

131
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:35.930
I'm trying to use this as an opportunity for myself and try and use it as an

132
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:38.840
opportunity to just carve out a little slice of the Internet.

133
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.680
However big or small might be where we can affect some positive change and like

134
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:43.430
an idea,
you know,

135
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.020
ideas and learning and free expression and free thought and making mistakes and

136
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:49.850
disagreeing and all that.
I think that's all great.

137
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.410
I want to use this as an example.

138
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.570
I want to get away from the Orthodoxy of the gaming industry.

139
00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:56.200
It's stifling and it's strangling and that's why they think,

140
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.520
let's go back to that because why do you think it is like that?

141
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.180
Why is the gaming industry so hardcore ideologically left wing progressive?

142
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.330
Like no variations,
no room for debate.
Why is that?
Well,
I think it's,

143
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.830
it's portrayed,
it's like it all gets funneled through a media that is,

144
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.150
that is hyper liberal.
Right?
So it's,

145
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:17.660
it's similar in a way to what's going on with the media in,
in news and politics.

146
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.450
These,
um,
you know,
underneath the surface of the gaming industry are,

147
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:26.770
there are plenty of conservatives and libertarians,
they,
they hide.
Yeah,

148
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.260
they do a lot of them.
A lot of them will,
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry,
go ahead.

149
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.210
I was just gonna say,
a lot of them talk to me.
I mean,

150
00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:35.000
I know people that are like heads of studios that feel the way I do.

151
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:38.360
I know people that are in the trenches at Qa and doing like very menial things

152
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:40.220
that gaming studios,
I feel the way I do and everything in between.

153
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.460
I remember at GDC game developer conference in San Francisco,

154
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.570
which happens every spring,
six or seven years ago,
a guy pulled me aside.

155
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:48.560
This is the first time it ever happened to me.

156
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:51.410
And this was when I was kind of starting to make a name for myself and he pulled

157
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:55.310
me aside and he's like,
hey man,
I work at x,
Y,
and Z and it works on a big game.

158
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.380
And he's like,
keep doing what you're doing.

159
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.680
There are a lot of people out there that agree with what you're saying.
Um,

160
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.960
but they're,
they're,
they're,
they,

161
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:06.650
they don't dare speak out because they'll get lambasted in some way.

162
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:09.020
Look what happened to me over something so innocuous there.

163
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.730
Obviously you were saying that there is some pushback about your ideas before

164
00:08:13.731 --> 00:08:16.610
this.
Yes.
What,
what did you experience?
Well,

165
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.960
so every time I would write a politically driven,
um,
op Ed for instance,

166
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:23.120
when I was at ign,
I had,
I was,
I was senior editor,

167
00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:26.540
but I kind of had like editor at large qualities where it meaning for B,
Let,

168
00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:29.390
don't know,
editor at large,
basically in a way,
do whatever they want.

169
00:08:29.391 --> 00:08:30.770
Like they'll find something to write about.

170
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:33.440
I used to go away for days at a time and no research things and then write these

171
00:08:33.441 --> 00:08:37.010
big 50,000 word articles,
um,
50,000 words.
Yeah.

172
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:40.400
The history of not that kind of time,
dude.
Well,
I,
I did,
I carved it out,

173
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.310
but what about people reading it?
Oh No,
it was in five parts.

174
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.270
The history of naughty dog.

175
00:08:45.271 --> 00:08:48.490
It was like my opus naughty dog's this very huge actually in Santa Monica.

176
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.540
Very huge game developer,
very talented game developer.

177
00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:53.750
I went and talked at 19 people,
got about a bunch of primary sources and,

178
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.870
and all these things.
And this piece that I really cared about.
Um,
and so,

179
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:01.110
but when I would write things like the political correctness piece about,

180
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.700
let me give you an example.
There's a game that was canceled,
um,

181
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.190
maybe five years ago or so.
It was pretty late in development.

182
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.890
So it's weird to cancel a game when they've already spent a bunch of money on
it.

183
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.550
It was called six days in Fallujah and it was a game about it.

184
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.750
It was a third person shooter.
I think about,
uh,

185
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.030
the experience of Fallujah in Iraq.
You know,
terrible conflict that,

186
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:21.923
that happened there.

187
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.220
And people even on the right were getting upset about being like,
it's too soon.

188
00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:30.390
It's,
it's uh,
this is,
this is still ongoing.
How can you do?

189
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.950
And I wrote a piece being like,
what are you all saying?
Like this is awesome,

190
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.060
this is so great that someone wants to tell a story like this and,
and,
and,
and,

191
00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:41.190
and,
and do something like this.
And you just get it from all sides.

192
00:09:41.191 --> 00:09:44.910
People will be like,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's not sensitive.
It's,
it's,

193
00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:45.900
it's all of these kinds of things.

194
00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:48.330
And then the girlfriend mode thing I wrote about where people were like,
oh,

195
00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:50.070
you're a sexist and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And I'm like,

196
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:53.190
I'm actually just protecting the sanctity of a man who might've made a mistake.

197
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.400
That's it.
You know,
instead of destroying him,

198
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:00.030
it goes back to this whole thing of like the last year,
I'm sorry,

199
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.720
the girlfriend mode,
the borderlands story I told you where the guy,

200
00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:06.500
and they were all going after him and going after his job and doing all these

201
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.830
things.
And I wrote a piece being like,
hey,
yeah,
like if this is a far skies,

202
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.860
like he made a mistake maybe and I don't know that he shows a soft target and

203
00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:18.950
they just went after it.
Exactly.
And uh,
it reminded,

204
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.760
so you've experienced blowback?
Yeah.
Every time.
Yeah.
Every time.

205
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.170
What was the blow back from that,
from you defending this guy saying,
well,

206
00:10:25.171 --> 00:10:28.050
he just really fucked up the way he described things,
but he was,

207
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.430
it was an innocent in that regard.
Well,

208
00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:32.580
you lose like social cache when every time it's something like this would
happen.

209
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.340
Right.
So that's why I say like this was the moment,

210
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.950
the joke was the moment that they were looking to pounce.
Really.

211
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.930
And I'm not saying that they were calculating,
everyone's waiting,

212
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:44.250
but they saw an opportunity and they took it because over time you lose respect

213
00:10:44.251 --> 00:10:46.890
over people because of your political stances.

214
00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:48.840
He completely reasonable political stances,

215
00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:52.250
I think where they remember that you said this and he said this and he said this

216
00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:53.820
and said,
listen,
like really?
You didn't,

217
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:56.640
weren't really having debates with people where you were disagreeing with them.

218
00:10:56.641 --> 00:10:59.640
It was simply a matter of reaction to some of the things that you had written

219
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.820
when they were trying to box you into some sort of a conservative group.
Right.

220
00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:05.940
And they would call me in and you know,
now it's like I'm a Nazi,
I'm all right.

221
00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:08.040
I'm all these things.
I'm like,
I don't think,
I don't think I have one.

222
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.510
I don't think I have one.
Alright.

223
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.550
I don't even really know what the alt right means,
but like,

224
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.670
like what is alt right?
Like what happened to me,

225
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.640
it seems like the far fringe is like the Richard Spencer is of the world and Neo

226
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.540
Nazis and the white supremacists and the end,
the actual,
uh,
nationalists.
Well,

227
00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:24.990
as soon as you write alt on something,
I feel like it's a message board thing.

228
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:29.760
Like,
all right.
It's like it's a t it's a reddit thing.
Yeah,
exactly.
So,

229
00:11:29.761 --> 00:11:34.110
all right.
Alternative,
right?
Like what is it?
I mean I don't,
I don't know.

230
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.480
I hope not based on their,
based on their,
based on their characterization of it,

231
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.330
but to me,
I'm sorry,
go ahead.
No.
What is,
uh,
what,

232
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.780
how would they define you as being all right?
What would they say that,

233
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.490
that you have outright characteristics.

234
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.910
You can see these message boards for instance,

235
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.140
a lot of people were very supportive on reddit and all these kinds of places are

236
00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:55.330
a little more known for free thought.
But there's this one video game,

237
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.290
a message board in particular,
um,
that is just insane.

238
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.460
And there was 125 page or so thread about me,

239
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.190
20 posts or I think it might even be 50 posts the page.

240
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.630
And I was reading it and it hurts some of it that because people are like,

241
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.900
first of all,
people telling me I said things I never said,
I'm like,

242
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:15.520
do you think people like Collins,
you know,
against,
you know,

243
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:18.160
his name is no taxation as even believe the taxes should exist.

244
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.490
I often talk about how I really like Ian Rand and I really like Atlas Shrug,

245
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:22.960
but I don't consider myself an objectivist.

246
00:12:22.961 --> 00:12:25.180
I don't believe that selfishness is necessarily a virtue.

247
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.090
I just think she's interesting and I think some of her ideas are interesting.

248
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.730
You know,
God forbid I exist somewhere in the gray area,

249
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.240
but they're like Collins and objectivists and he's selfish and Blah Blah Blah

250
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:38.350
and like Collins a Nazi and he,
he's a racist.
He's a song.
I think the term,

251
00:12:38.351 --> 00:12:42.100
a lot of the news was soft racist or soft bigot,
soft race and being like that.

252
00:12:42.101 --> 00:12:42.934
He,
he doesn't,

253
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.720
he doesn't intentionally or actually overtly say anything but supports causes

254
00:12:46.721 --> 00:12:47.730
that are racist or sexist.

255
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.620
These are the kind of character assassinations that were going on basically

256
00:12:50.621 --> 00:12:54.550
people with on,
on,
on,
um,
on bulletin boards with,

257
00:12:54.551 --> 00:12:57.640
with yarn and maps.
Like that's what,
how I picture them,

258
00:12:57.641 --> 00:13:00.330
like trying to make continuous connections and,
and,

259
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.640
and it's like these things aren't even things I feel and,

260
00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:07.750
and things that I said or being taken out of context.
I often use the,
um,

261
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.300
in video games,
one of the big things is like,
you know,

262
00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:14.170
there's a need for diverse casts and diverse protagonists and stuff like that.

263
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.720
And I often use the case that I used to use the saying,

264
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.150
I don't believe in diversity for diversity's sake.

265
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.180
I believe that an artist should tell his story.
So if an artist,

266
00:13:22.181 --> 00:13:24.460
a writer and a of the game wants to have an all white cast,

267
00:13:24.461 --> 00:13:25.750
and that's what he thinks serves his story,

268
00:13:25.751 --> 00:13:28.780
I don't think that makes them a racist.
If he wants to have an all Asian cast,

269
00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:31.660
I don't think that makes him a racist either.
I think that's what he wants to do.

270
00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.500
Um,
and people took that out of context and we're calling me a racist and a bigot

271
00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:36.880
and all of these kinds of things.
And it's,
it's,

272
00:13:36.881 --> 00:13:39.550
it's hurtful because there's no one there that no one's defending me,
you know,

273
00:13:39.551 --> 00:13:41.830
and I can't,
I can't defend myself because I'll just make it worse.

274
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.400
So it was a kind of like this hapless kind of situation that I found myself in

275
00:13:45.401 --> 00:13:46.870
and I tried to make the best of it.

276
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:52.090
I had a debate once about that with a friend who was an Asian actor and he was

277
00:13:52.091 --> 00:13:56.770
talking about the lack of roles for Asians in Hollywood and what a massive issue

278
00:13:56.771 --> 00:14:00.220
is.
And you know,
that he wanted to raise awareness of it.
And I was like,
man,

279
00:14:00.221 --> 00:14:02.170
but this,
we're talking about a creative venture.

280
00:14:02.171 --> 00:14:04.900
You're talking about somebody writing a story.
Like I think the,

281
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:08.440
the correct way to go about it is to try to figure out how to get your own

282
00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:11.710
project through or someone else who feels very strongly about this,

283
00:14:11.711 --> 00:14:13.120
trying to get their own project through.

284
00:14:13.121 --> 00:14:17.500
But the right way is not for someone to have to compromise their creative vision

285
00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:21.760
in order to encompass the full spectrum of races in whatever story they're

286
00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:23.980
writing.
Like it's still creative story.

287
00:14:23.981 --> 00:14:26.560
Like if you want to write a story about a small town in Maine,

288
00:14:26.561 --> 00:14:28.030
like Stephen King has done so often,

289
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.710
you shouldn't have to have 10% Asians in that story.
I mean,
you just,

290
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:35.070
that's not what creativity is about.
It's about there.

291
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.490
There are places and people and that what you're going to run into all black

292
00:14:39.491 --> 00:14:43.930
folks or,
or are you going to run into all Norwegian people?
I mean,

293
00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:48.290
and those stories are just as valid as a story that's fully Dovers you.
No,
no,

294
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.220
I don't think that that necessarily makes anything better.
And I also think

295
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.320
<v 1>that when you're talking about that you're,
so you sort sir,</v>

296
00:14:55.321 --> 00:14:59.570
you're sort of talking about it like there should be a quota,
you know,

297
00:14:59.571 --> 00:15:04.400
and like Hollywood should recognize the need for these people to be in films and

298
00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:05.990
movies and says you,
you're,

299
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.610
you're making this politically correct sort of,
um,

300
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:12.800
you'll be passing these,

301
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:17.330
these judgements on this thing that is all about imagination.
I mean,

302
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.010
Hollywood essentially.
Like what,

303
00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.530
when you're making a television show or you making a movie,

304
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.450
it's really about an imagination.

305
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.560
It's about imagination and vision and having that vision being entertaining for

306
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:27.981
people.

307
00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:32.060
And if you like only want to write about the people that you were in college

308
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:34.730
with,
that you were,
that you shared a dorm room with,

309
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.470
you should be out allowed to.

310
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.890
And if there's a disproportionate amount of people that are doing that,

311
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.650
that happened to be white males that,
you know,

312
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:44.840
we should probably try to figure out why.

313
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:49.970
But the idea that you have to force people to hire Asian folks or black folks or

314
00:15:49.971 --> 00:15:52.250
women or whatever,
that's fine.
That seems so crazy to me.

315
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.370
<v 0>Yes.
Serve the story.
Right.
And to give you a little glimpse that it's,</v>

316
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:57.950
to give you some context with what might be going on in gaming,

317
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.860
there was this very popular game series called the Witcher,

318
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.940
which is made by a Polish developer called CD project there in Warsaw.

319
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:10.420
And it's based on the fusion of like Polish kind of identity with this famous

320
00:16:10.731 --> 00:16:13.670
book series that's based on like kind of Polish or you know,

321
00:16:13.671 --> 00:16:15.890
like kind of the Lord of the rings,
but in Eastern Europe.

322
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.440
And One guy's cartoon character that works at this website called Polygon in his

323
00:16:21.441 --> 00:16:25.730
review was talking about how uh,
there were no,

324
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.560
there was no diversity there.
And,
and,
and everyone's like,
dude,

325
00:16:30.561 --> 00:16:34.350
it's Poland and it's based on Poland of your right.

326
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:39.730
And it's about dragons and like goblins and there's some white guys and this is

327
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:43.740
like what you're upset about,
you know,
and there's another guy making,

328
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.360
and I think he's Slovakia and I don't want to,

329
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.290
somewhere in eastern Europe making a game called kingdom come deliverance.

330
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.660
And it's supposed to be very realistic.

331
00:16:50.661 --> 00:16:55.460
Look at something like the 14th or 15th century in that area.
And again,
the,

332
00:16:55.461 --> 00:16:57.950
they're complaining,
there's no diversity,
there's no diversity.
And he's like,

333
00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.980
there was no black people in this area in 1500 I'm trying to make a game that's

334
00:17:04.641 --> 00:17:08.060
true to the air does that,
that doesn't make him a racist.
And,

335
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:10.370
and these are the kinds of,
this is just the kind of bullshit,

336
00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.490
but you see this in movies,
you see this in TV shows.
It's not,
it's not exclusive,

337
00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:16.190
the gaming,
but it's,
but it's what I've had to deal with for a long time.

338
00:17:16.191 --> 00:17:17.210
And I'm just saying it's the root of it.

339
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.180
<v 1>The what?
What's causing it,
like why,</v>

340
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:24.300
why do people feel like they have to put a black person and a game about Poland

341
00:17:24.341 --> 00:17:25.900
and the 15 hundreds or whatever it was?

342
00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.850
<v 0>I think,
I mean,
I don't the,
thankfully the people that make the games don't care.</v>

343
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.010
They're like,
we're going to make our game.
Right.

344
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.130
The people that are complaining about it,
they're virtuous virtue signaling,

345
00:17:35.131 --> 00:17:38.220
which is not even a term.
I even knew what it meant until a few weeks ago.

346
00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.080
Like I heard people throw that term around.

347
00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.770
I didn't quite know what a man I looked at.
I looked into it.
It's,
you know,

348
00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:46.740
and you know what it is.
It's,
it's the idea that these virtuous people,

349
00:17:46.741 --> 00:17:48.030
at the same people that attack me for the joke,

350
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.540
I have to virtuous and show that I am against sexism.

351
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.430
So I have to attack the man.
You know,

352
00:17:53.431 --> 00:17:56.280
I have to do all these kinds of things in this need,
you know?

353
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.730
But what they're saying,
when they,
when they,
when they're saying we have to have,

354
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:04.200
um,
black people in this game,
in eastern Europe,
in the 15 hundreds,

355
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.680
what they're saying,
what they're really saying is you're a racist.
Yeah.

356
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:08.790
That's the,
that's the subtext.

357
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
And it goes back to this character assassination in this need to destroy.
