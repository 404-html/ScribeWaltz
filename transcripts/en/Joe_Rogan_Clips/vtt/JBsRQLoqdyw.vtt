1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.900
The problem with church is the problem with anybody that gets in any sort of a

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:06.270
position of power,
it's easy to abuse it.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.510
So the have a guy who's a pastor that's not a creep and that really cares and is

4
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:15.030
really a good person and really wants to care about the community and really

5
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:19.410
rise once everybody to do better and get better with life but isn't trying to

6
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:23.280
buy a fucking Rolls Royce like Joel Olsteen and live in a giant mansion.

7
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:26.850
It's like,
and it always go church and always goes.
It always goes south.

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.460
It's absolutely love about Joel Olsteen is,

9
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:32.850
he's an arena act as a preacher.
He's um,

10
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.440
he bought the old place,
the old arena where the uh,

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.210
the Houston Rockets used to play.
He bought it.
Yeah.

12
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:42.300
That's how much money that guy has.
And then he fills it up.
Yeah.

13
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.520
Well that was when the hurricane came.

14
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:47.730
People criticized him cause he didn't open up its doors to a,

15
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:50.580
all the folks who were displaced from their homes tease them about that.

16
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:53.460
It's like you saw that electric blue carpet he put on anything.
What do Yo,

17
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:58.460
you fucking guys getting it all wet?
No,

18
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.810
he does.
He has his sick as we look at that place.
Oh,

19
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.640
maybe it's the curtain that I thought.
Yeah.
I mean look at that fucking place.

20
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.160
Holy Shit that looks like a dice clay special and all those people is thrown

21
00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:15.780
down.
All those people are paying to be there.
Okay.
There's somebody out there,

22
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:19.710
scalping tickets.
I got to buy the altar is two ways of looking at it,
right?

23
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:22.890
One is these getting all those people together and there's a sense of community

24
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:23.724
amongst all of them.

25
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.500
And two is that guys making out fuck load of money and he's got so much power.

26
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.300
You know,
you and all those people just at your,

27
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.790
but it doesn't mean you're necessarily a bad,

28
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:35.760
nick doesn't necessarily mean he's like,
what?
What can you do with it?

29
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:39.120
Which is getting the reason why I'm thinking,
uh,
you know,

30
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:42.750
stopping in every once in a while,
uh,
got to find a good spot.

31
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.680
Like they were doing that rock and roll church thing for a while.
There was,
uh,

32
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.630
I remember,
uh,
one of my friends who's a producer,
his assistant was,
she was lost.

33
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:51.811
She,

34
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:56.700
I think she want to spiritually or she was lost a lot of ways,

35
00:01:56.701 --> 00:01:59.820
but she,
uh,
was doing this,
what's going on Jamie?

36
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.240
Get through 4,000,

37
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:07.590
$950 for the author to,
do you want to go?
What the fuck?
Yeah,

38
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:11.070
we could do that.
1,000.
It's 400 bucks.
No,
no,
no,
no.

39
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.510
$4,950.
Two tickets for two tickets.
Right.

40
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.860
Sanction for ro Rodeo de Dude for grand.
And what that guy fucking,

41
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.470
that's not even at the state.

42
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:25.860
Catch the handkerchief when he's done fucking preaching how much I get for a
row.

43
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:28.640
Two or so they're not available.
Not available.

44
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.260
So now he's a resale tickets to them.
Know what it is,
man.

45
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:32.670
They got fucking season passes.

46
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.300
People probably buy season passes to Joel Olsteen says this to her.
This is her,

47
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:38.870
this Florida stop.
Well,
I saw there was a place,
uh,

48
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.220
that I was at that he was coming to and one of the,

49
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:43.290
one of the big spots I was at,

50
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.040
he does these arena tours and he does a Vegas too.

51
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:49.020
He does the fucking t mobile arena in Vegas.

52
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.860
I want to see the show picture of him up there and his eyes open,

53
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.300
smiling and shit.
It's crazy.
It's a lot of money that guys make.

54
00:02:57.301 --> 00:03:00.280
I used to say he's so full of,
he can't look at the crowd.

55
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:03.700
That's why his eyes are still here.
They still believe in this shit

56
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.510
there.
When you lie in eye contact is the toughest fucking thing ever.

57
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:13.930
But whatever he's making people feel good.
He's making his fuck.

58
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:17.320
He's in show business.
I want to see the show though.
He's in the God showbiz.

59
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:19.990
New happens.
You have to respect an arena act I think.

60
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.210
I think there's something to that.
There's something to do that.
It's

61
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.440
this girl that was talking about,

62
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:31.300
she was real lost and I think she was Jewish or maybe she converted to Judaism

63
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:32.051
later.
But anyway,

64
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:35.290
for one point in time she was going to this rock and roll church.
She was like,

65
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.260
she was a sweet kid.
She was like,
you should go.
You would really like it.

66
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:40.650
I'm like,
I guarantee you wouldn't like it.
I'm like,
wait,

67
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.050
some young hip guy probably sing songs,
probably tries to fuck women.

68
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.980
Like get Outta here with that.
It's like a yoga class.
It's like David Koresh.

69
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.220
Waco got started.
How did it get started?

70
00:03:50.221 --> 00:03:53.950
And get started with one guy with a guitar and he brought that message of Jesus

71
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:56.860
and he had some really profound things to say and people really,

72
00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.900
it really helped them feel better,
resonated with them.

73
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.890
Then he started banging people's wives and that's what happens.
Yeah.

74
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.730
It always happens that way.
Well,
those rock and roll alternative churches,

75
00:04:06.731 --> 00:04:09.670
there's a few of the,
like the Justin Bieber Guy,
you know the guy that uh,

76
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.150
Justin Bieber has,
he's the one who told Justin to get off the road,
cut off,

77
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:16.870
throw Justin,
come back home to Jesus like he's getting,

78
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:19.550
he gets these guys to do like,
get a basketball player.

79
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.970
Stop playing basketball to not apply,
but no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
That,

80
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.300
that guy's not doing the road anymore.
Oh,
he goes back and forth.
I mean,

81
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.080
it took a little time off at the end of this tour.
Canceled his tour because,
uh,

82
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.110
the,
the preacher told them it's,
well,
maybe he's right though.
Let's be honest.

83
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.080
First of all,
beeper,
probably as a fucking billion dollars in the bank.

84
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.370
And maybe he was frayed around the edges is losing his fucking marbles.

85
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.580
The kid's 21 years old.
He's about as famous as a human being.

86
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:50.500
Could possibly he only 21 shy.
He's young.
There's the preacher.
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,

87
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:54.910
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
What the fucking Dick groat preach.
Hold up.

88
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.830
See what seats,
what's going on with his fucking shorts brow.
No,

89
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.270
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Any guy who show and Dick Route.

90
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.700
You know what I mean?
Like the base of your cock,

91
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.520
you're pulling your shorts down to base your cock like that.

92
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.340
You're doing that because you're trying to get laid.
Stop.

93
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.640
Pull your fucking shorts up to a normal height.

94
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.450
Those things should be five inches higher.
I know what you're doing.

95
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.000
Your cock is slapping against your thing.

96
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:24.070
You probably don't even have underwear on you fucking creep.

97
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.160
Jesus does not want you dressing like that.
No.
And look at them.

98
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:32.320
It's kind of habs big old handsome guy.

99
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.120
He probably Dick's chicks down for the Lord,
right?
Dick's.

100
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.940
Dick's some down for Jesus.
It's really them.
Big Old,
handsome,

101
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:44.790
charismatic guy taking him down for Jesus.
Apparently he's a very,

102
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.980
he's a host.
Get to Yangon.
Would Oprah.
So you know he's legit.
