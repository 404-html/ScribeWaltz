1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.900
Good Shit going on.

2
00:00:00.901 --> 00:00:04.880
I'm getting offers and all sorts of different things and I'm like,
I,
I,

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.990
I'm my own boss.
I'm not going to fire me.

4
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:09.500
I'm not going to accidentally tweet something one day and then go that I'm going

5
00:00:09.501 --> 00:00:13.560
to fire Dave Rubin.
Like,
you know,
like my,
my fans fun most of what we do.

6
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.130
And it's like I need to grow.
Like we definitely need to grow because there's,

7
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:18.870
we're just,
my guys were just doing too much,

8
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.540
but I'm also very aware that the more we start growing,

9
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.670
but all the problems that you just laid out,

10
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:25.800
we'll start becoming more and more real.

11
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.370
So I like being a slim and trim as possible,
at least for now,

12
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.110
because I don't want to be down the road where we've had,
we got too many people.

13
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:34.950
There's too many,

14
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.730
just different competing interests and business interests and political

15
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.490
interests and everything else.
So it's like,
that's why,

16
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:44.940
I mean you're what you're doing here.
It's fricking,
it's amazing man.
So you know,

17
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:48.390
there was an article right after that IDW thing came out in the times that was

18
00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:52.330
calling you a conservative.
And I think,
I think I emailed it to you.
I was like,

19
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.630
man,
it was the twitters,
Twitter things.
So the renegade conservative,
right?

20
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.060
That's what it was.
Pro Gay rights.
Pro Women's rights,

21
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:04.110
pro choice pro marijuana,
pro universal health care,

22
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.290
pro universal basic income.
Like what else do I have to do?

23
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:11.520
Like what other things am I,
oh pro second amendment.
He must be right.
Yeah.

24
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.280
Well Joe,
you're off.
You can't just have you,
what do you think?

25
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:17.780
You can have a series of thoughts that don't all lock in.

26
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.970
Would they be in a pattern that you have to be in the pattern?

27
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.710
I'm not just don't understand why someone's willing to be dishonest like that.

28
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.860
Like a sh a cursory examination of people's thoughts and positions on things

29
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:34.050
would lead someone to realize I'm definitely not a right wing person.

30
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.300
But the thing is that they own the narrative for so long that they can still get

31
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:40.330
away with it.
Yes.
Yes.

32
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.550
And what's happening is now it's shifting and that's what I mean by I think

33
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:47.970
we're starting to win and I don't mean it when like we're going to destroy these

34
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:52.860
people.
I mean I think the narrative has started to shift a little bit where the

35
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:55.980
enthusiasm behind the conversations that we're all having,

36
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.240
whoever it is in this thing,

37
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.550
the enthusiasm is so great and there is no counter enthusiasts.

38
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.390
Like where are all the versions of us on the other side of this,
I'm gonna,
right?

39
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.100
No,
I don't even mean on the right,

40
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:12.210
like the people that really are selling identity politics at a really great way

41
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:16.050
at a comedy level who have a huge podcast and like where is the,

42
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.670
where is that intellectual set of people?

43
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.670
Where's the Sam Harris of the other side of this or the that have real

44
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:21.990
followings.
They don't exist.

45
00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:25.260
And that's partly why the hysteria has been ramped up.

46
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.020
They can't believe that out of nowhere,
just because of our,

47
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.960
all of our just wherewithal and desire to do what we think is right or what

48
00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:35.850
makes us happy or whatever the hell you want to call it.

49
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.940
They can't believe we all freaking created something.
Well,

50
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.630
they were all in a group.
I'm weirded out that we're in a [inaudible] group.

51
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.620
We're in a boy band or what?
I Guess Christina Hoff summers isn't that band too?

52
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.990
Who else is in that band?
Is Heather in it?
Yeah,
it has.
It has there.

53
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.950
I mean it looks,
we don't ever get to Brett.

54
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.750
Well you didn't get the car yet and get the card.

55
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.500
The clubhouse is under your studio.
Man.
Shapiro with joking around about it.

56
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.670
But like with the super friends?
Yeah,
like what is,

57
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:04.060
this was just the weirdest Avengers ever.
It's a weird group of humans.

58
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:06.460
I mean me and Ben,
we disagree on a lot of shit,

59
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:09.940
but we're super friendly to each other.
Like when I do his show or he does my,

60
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:14.320
I really enjoy that guy.
I like him.
You do freaking Shapiro show before my show.

61
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.100
Sorry,
what?
The guys had a shelf for three weeks.
Well,
this,
what are you feeling?

62
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:22.180
People were mad at me with the way I dressed.
See that.
They were like,

63
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.030
everybody else is wearing a nice shirt and a tie.
I'm like,
listen man.

64
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.160
I told the guy I was on my way to the comedy store.

65
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:30.100
You want to take a photo of me?
I'll be there.
You're not in the bush.

66
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.000
In the brush.
Yeah.
I should be in a bush.
Went up my ass.

67
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.180
I'm wearing a fucking chucks or converse and a some sort of a flannel shirt.

68
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.390
I bought that jacket,
Alaska.
I've just,
that's how it was.
Where I just,

69
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:50.230
what I was wearing at the comedy store,
Greenery.
Sure.
I said,
all right man,

70
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.330
that's what I'm wearing.
No greenery around.

71
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:55.870
The comedy store would have to go up to sunset,
but we'll ignore either way.

72
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:59.590
I just don't,
I don't give a fuck.
That's what I looked like.
That's who I am.

73
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.380
I'm not interested in portraying an image.
Just it is what it is.

74
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.150
You know?
It's like this,
this intellectual dark web,
like it's fucking Eric.

75
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:14.110
He's crazy.
And he's,
he gets mad when I call him crazy.
He loves it.

76
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.060
He's trying to get me to do,
are you on the whatsapp?
Oh,
I'm on the ones.

77
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.280
The little fucking check.
No,
I haven't jumped in yet.

78
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.730
I've been busy.
I don't have the time.

79
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.090
Just two or three messages for different group text conversations with comedians

80
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.280
were talking shit about things and talking around.
I'd have time for this.

81
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.320
I'm busy,
man.
All right,

82
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:38.680
well then you can't come to the club trying to make a yoga class.
I don't know.

83
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:42.400
Fucking time.
Yeah.
Who the hell goes like,
are we a group?
We do.

84
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:45.580
We have a meeting and shellacked cards and like we have in common,

85
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.210
I think we have a respect for our audience and intellectual curiosity,
you know,

86
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.250
electrical curiosity for sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I think that's where,

87
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.040
that's where a guy like me and Shapiro,

88
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.330
although we have very different opinions on many different things,
you know,

89
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.910
I think we both are intellectually curious.
Yeah.
So think about it.

90
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.460
I've had been on many times,
I,
I consider him a friend.
We've,

91
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.070
we've broke bread together,
although he's kosher,
which makes it fucking pain.

92
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.670
What do you have to eat?
[inaudible] has such a smart guy.
Follow that blue,

93
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.410
do well.
I eat whatever the hell I to him about whatever I want,

94
00:05:18.411 --> 00:05:21.340
but he usually bring something or you know,
has to launch.

95
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.550
You did a kosher restaurant.
I did eat it,
a kosher restaurant with him once,

96
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:27.580
but then it was all these orthodox Jews there and then they treat him like Jesus

97
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:29.890
and I was like,
dude,
I'm not a photographer.
You know what I mean?

98
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:32.080
I have to take all these pictures of him.
And they're like,
who's that guy?

99
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:34.540
I was like,
I'm not doing that again,
but it's funny,
but.
