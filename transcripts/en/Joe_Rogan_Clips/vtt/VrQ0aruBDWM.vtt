1
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.870
The first man to smoke marijuana.
Never really smoked it.
He inhaled it.

2
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.620
He was a Chinese man.
He was a very great man and whenever he lit the,

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.890
the plant,
it wasn't to get high,

4
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.120
but he would start to get high and every time he got high a blue bird would come

5
00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:21.030
to him.
Chicken canned food.
Chilled water.
Ha ha ha ha.
Cool.

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.510
Have you ever been to Disneyland?
I mostly live in La.
You know what?

7
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.730
Fuck California.
Go and try living in the woods by yourself for a while.

8
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.710
Saw Him on Milan kid.
Why are we doing this?
It's crazy.
I just took,

9
00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:39.460
it was a civil war starting today.
I don't want to jump the gun on that.

10
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.500
I got pistol whipped with
the gun to the head.

11
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.930
Nothing blood.
Thank God.
But if fucked him hurt and I looked at them like,

12
00:00:49.931 --> 00:00:53.440
what are you crazy like I don't even what to know what the fuck you guys are

13
00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:54.790
doing?
Yeah.

14
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.040
The way the tie was hitting the speeds,

15
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:02.650
like the how fast they were going up hill.
I mean,

16
00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:04.210
I think at Tesla.

17
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:05.690
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

18
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.020
<v 0>it's the most fun thing you could possibly buy ever.</v>

19
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.290
The first 30 minutes of that,
like I told I was going to die,

20
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.760
I try to convince people to slow down is just mind blowing.

21
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.290
I wouldn't recommend it,
but even in Turkey we lose our fucking minds.

22
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.280
My friend who I kidnapped showed up.
That would cause a lot of trouble.

23
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.010
He was the king of me too.
This is also true of Facebook.

24
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.900
I saw a movie chimpanzee.
Yeah.
That was gonna be like some days anything.

25
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.630
I was like,
holy cow Bro.
That movies like a porn,
damn.
These chimps are,

26
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:41.631
are mean to wow was on the monkey bars and they kill each other and they torture

27
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:46.620
each other.
That's pretty bad.
Um,
the hundred monkeys that's stuck.
I light porn.

28
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.760
Uh,
I,
I don't want to sound like,
like thanks for too dark.

29
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.720
The universe as we know,

30
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:55.070
it's will dissipate into a fine mist.

31
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.320
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.410
<v 0>Of Cold.
Nothing.
This is,
what the fuck is this.</v>

33
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.350
I'm not that good looking and I am not happy,

34
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.330
so I'm a suck bro.
I think best case scenario,
we

35
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.930
effectively emerge with Ai.
We get the fuck up before I fucking kill you.

36
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:18.160
You dumb motherfucker.
No,
no,
no,

37
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.040
definitely not.
Definitely not.
I was good.

38
00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:24.190
I would cause a lot of trouble sleeping in the garage.
No dinner.

39
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.440
This is not a wise move.
We should not do this.
It's very dangerous.

40
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.393
Why?

41
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.470
<v 1>Okay,</v>

42
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.380
<v 0>fuck you motherfucker.
I wouldn't recommend it but,</v>

43
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.490
and that would be probably a safer way to go about things.

44
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.080
Go home you a little giddy flux.
You know it's just a hole in the ground.

45
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.200
Go home you little Guinea.
Fuck.

46
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.240
I know I can rock and roll.

47
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.010
I could throw down on seventh street but it's got to be seven straight.
None.

48
00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:59.350
None.
No.
Get up the P two times.
Cause once you're 50 it could be up and down.

49
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.690
I'm not sure what you mean by that.

50
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.830
Well I've been a specialist on asleep since day one [inaudible] so my mom would

51
00:03:07.831 --> 00:03:11.700
wake me up.
I read night at three 30 in the morning with a Cuban sandwich.

52
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.670
You know the things they need to be,

53
00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:18.630
things that make you look forward to waking up in the morning.

54
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.530
He would wake up in the morning.

55
00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:21.900
You look forward to the day before to the future.

56
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.130
I did cocaine for 30 years.
It's probably not wise.

57
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.430
I've been in the fuck another dimension since last week and I don't give a fuck.

58
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.310
It's not necessarily bad.

59
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>

60
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.580
<v 0>It's just how many people really try to assassinate Kevin Hart with weapons?</v>

61
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.790
I tried for years.
He's just a creepy fucking dude.
That's true.

62
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.680
That mother stone called rape me.
He became friends with this dude.

63
00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:52.460
They had a cat and they started raping them.
Sort of primal drives.

64
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.390
There won't be an outcry.
There will be an investigation.

65
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.460
Years will pass.
There will be some sort of insights committee.

66
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.350
They will be rulemaking.
Then there will be oversight.
Eventually regulations.

67
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.900
This all takes many years.
I was polishing the flux in the the musket.

68
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.470
This is very exciting.
Every day is think of one and put a gun to his side.

69
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:19.790
Do I know what's going on?

70
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.580
Pat Them in the back and he giggles and shit cause I'm too weighty on tip toe

71
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:27.120
went up to him.
He don't even hear me in bushes or nothing like that.

72
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.190
That's how good I am and I don't even know.
I've never trained him Quantico,

73
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.730
and then this guy ended up dying at age.
I'm real life bad.

74
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.800
Your biological self dies.
You can just probably just upload into a new unit.

75
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.350
Are you fucking nuts?
Yeah,
pretty much.
I go,

76
00:04:46.351 --> 00:04:49.140
what the fuck am I doing sitting here?
That's what's few tile.

77
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:50.400
What are you going to do?
