00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.680
When you guys wrote songs,
how did you,

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.830
how did you put the lyrics to the music?
What was the process like?

3
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:11.520
How did you guys sort that out?
So you would you come to them with an idea?

4
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.060
Would they come to you with a riff?
Like how,
how would,
how would it work?

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.470
It'll work ah,
a number of ways.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.500
But a mistake that a lot of young writers in my department,

7
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:29.030
the lyrics make is that they think of it as secondary.
Mm.

8
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.550
They wait for the music or the track first and then you'll walk into a studio

9
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.860
and hope that the hand of God will descend and grace you with a amazing

10
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:49.230
epiphany's.
I can't even spell amazing.
All right.

11
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.960
Um,
and called upon to do it right away.
You know,

12
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:57.870
you'll work out a beat and go,
Dave,
you got some lyrics.

13
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.290
If I go walk into that room and try to create it right there,

14
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.270
nine times out of 10 it's going to be moon in June,
right?
Moon in June.

15
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.940
Really?
When sometime soon.
What time of day?

16
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm thinking noon and literally I'm going to put my hands in the air.

17
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.160
Why?
Well,
cause I just don't care.

18
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.240
You wind up there unless you're banking.

19
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.830
Think like debate.
If you're going to debate somebody,

20
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160
you're banking your ideas,
right?
Alright.

21
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.440
And whatever the subject is,
you can go,

22
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.150
you don't even have to have this subject itch.
Okay.
I like what he just said.

23
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.050
I might even write that phrase.
I like what you just said.

24
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.740
Could be a Drake lyric.
Any expressions,
ideas,

25
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.700
slogans,
uh,

26
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.260
anything that comes from other tunes in terms of their lyric.

27
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.470
And is everybody contributing?
No,
that's just me.

28
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.370
Just to have volumes of that and those kinds of ideas,

29
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.670
ideas for songs,
storylines,
et Cetera.

30
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.060
You would never go into a fight without doing that.

31
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.090
Collecting moves right from every other film of every other fighter that you

32
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:28.560
possibly can,
so that when somebody goes like this,
you go,
oh,
I know what to do.

33
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.470
So and so from Muslims.
And then I'm going to visit like this.

34
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.980
And somebody says it's a song about they play a song.
I go,
wow,

35
00:02:34.981 --> 00:02:38.460
it sounds kinda like cowboy music.
Let's ride it back.

36
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:41.190
Cowboys going through the banking.

37
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.590
Giddy up.
That's cool.
Title.

38
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.710
I heard a cowboy.

39
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:54.030
I say it on the TV set and I wrote it down literally.

40
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.410
Okay.
And you start bay,
you get,

41
00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:02.890
I see the lights on and you start banking.
Okay.

42
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.650
Somebody says something you dig.
Um,

43
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.080
I heard somebody,
a waitress named pepper

44
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.450
where the unlit pall mall cigarette tell me,

45
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.630
oh honey.
Nothing could have stopped us back then anyway.

46
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

47
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.380
<v 0>That's a title.
That is a title.
I wrote a song to it.
Did Ya?
Oh yeah.</v>

48
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.240
Where's this waitress on the road?
Just to,

49
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.710
well she also had some else's say she leaned over,
she showed me that,

50
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.710
that cleavage a little bit and she'd look and she go keep your four Connie.

51
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.510
There's Pie,
excuse me,
I guess.

52
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.300
And you write it down.
Yeah.
Banking.
Yeah.

53
00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:58.410
I like the term they use in debate.
Your banking,
banking,
your ideas.

54
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.690
So when you would go on the road and someone say something that you would

55
00:04:00.691 --> 00:04:04.530
physically write it down,
go home and write it down today.
Today.
All the time.

56
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.370
Bank.
Yeah.

57
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.600
And it goes into the books and then when it's time to deal with a given soon as

58
00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:12.270
you listen to music,
if the music came first and you,

59
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.390
I dunno what's just remind you,
so it sounds like Kung Fu,

60
00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:23.070
that sounds like country,
right?
That sounds like a engines are coming.

61
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.950
It's a and on and on.

62
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.090
It follow you might suggestion idea to write things down physically or do you

63
00:04:30.091 --> 00:04:34.680
type them?
I sh I print.
Print,
yeah.
And I,

64
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.150
I paint and draw routinely.
Okay.
As you know,

65
00:04:39.151 --> 00:04:43.920
as part of the martial arts.
Okay,
sure.
[inaudible] Musashi.
Yep.
But,

66
00:04:43.921 --> 00:04:47.940
uh,
when I was in Japan,
uh,
two and three nights a week,

67
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.840
I,
well we call it training.
I did assume Yay.

68
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.610
With a Sumi eight teachers direct Sumia.
It's um,

69
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.040
like calligraphy,
pen and ink in,

70
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.060
in the world of the digital future.

71
00:05:03.061 --> 00:05:07.590
I spent two years practicing four shades of gray and two shades of black.

72
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.550
Yeah.
You want to see my lesson?
Can you do,

73
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.600
can you focus your camera if I stand up?
Yeah.
Can you fucker you,
well,

74
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.240
here's my lesson.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm going to walk from here to here.
Okay.

75
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.250
I'm here painting.
Okay.
I'm the only guy in the room.
Ready?
Okay,
here we go.

76
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.113
No.

77
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.090
Yeah.
Okay.
After six months,

78
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.720
I heard better Jesus Christ.

79
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.680
After almost 10 months a shit dad.
He goes,

80
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.250
Mr Rod,
I think you are best student.

81
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.730
Oh,
I should not my painting.
He said,
no,
no,
not.

82
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:06.530
Your painting said you are most determined.

83
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.510
You are most sincere.

84
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.260
You really enjoy most like this.
Thank you sir.

85
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.631
He said,

86
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:19.631
I wish to invite you to director's meeting Sumi society.

87
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.130
Whoa.
That's I made the same face.
And I said,
whoa.
I said,
when is that?

88
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.443
He said,

89
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.840
right now and pulled out a bottle of Saki and that's shoe little cups.

90
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.950
Okay.
One of my best friends in Tokyo.
Wow.

91
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.370
First Shit for six sixth,
sixth first six months.
I might've got seven words.

92
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.490
Oh.
For a guy like that,
in this day and age,

93
00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:49.940
it must be insanely difficult to get someone to have that sort of appreciation

94
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:54.280
for commitment.
Well,
it's,
it's a national thing.
Okay.

95
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.400
You learn that stuff in grade school and it's sorta like music lessons.
Okay.

96
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.230
Painting and calligraphy is as well known as perhaps piano lessons.

97
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.660
And what were you thinking while you were doing all this?

98
00:07:05.661 --> 00:07:07.700
While you're learning this and spending months and months?

99
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.690
I focus on specifically that,

100
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.160
knowing that at the end of the term,
I'm going to be a little,
I don't know.

101
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:20.540
I'm sharpening things a little bit and when I'm called upon even to have a

102
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:23.240
discussion like this,
yeah.
I,

103
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.460
I can bring a little contribution to it.
Yeah.

104
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:31.040
It can be more entertaining for all of you listening to this.

105
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.250
It can,
you know,
that's an amazing recognition that you have though,

106
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:36.140
that you realized while you were doing this,

107
00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:38.720
that even though consciously all you're doing is doing calligraphy,

108
00:07:38.721 --> 00:07:41.360
you're working on other parts of your mind.
Oh,

109
00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:43.130
I knew I was never going to pay for shit.

110
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.670
50 shades of Dave.

111
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.950
But you were still focusing 100% of your energy on doing it while you're doing

112
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:54.680
it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
