00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.440
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.040
<v 1>we just never stopped coming at you.
Excellent striking technique.</v>

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.933
Take a tremendous,

4
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.630
<v 0>my whole thing with it though is as soon as you test positive once I'd take you</v>

5
00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:16.550
out of the greatest PR.
It's just against the rules.

6
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:19.310
I'm not even against steroids,
like take steroids,
you know,

7
00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:23.180
like if it's your endocrinologist tells you to take steroids,
go fucking do it.

8
00:00:23.181 --> 00:00:26.750
Good.
Good for you.
But in our sport,
unfortunately it's against the rules.

9
00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:31.010
So there's only a certain amount of people doing it.
So if you're doing it,

10
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:34.420
you're cheating.
Right.
And,
but do you think John was taking steroids?

11
00:00:34.421 --> 00:00:37.430
I don't know,
but I don't think he was,
but to be honest,

12
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.020
it doesn't matter to me.
I mean,
you know,
I've said this for a long time.

13
00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:45.290
I think it should be a lifetime ban.
First offense period.
Yeah.

14
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.260
And there's going to be martyrs.
There would be guys like,

15
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:49.850
I don't think 10 means was taking steroids.

16
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.840
He certainly did not look like it did.
He wasn't,
Oh really?

17
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:55.130
I didn't know what that far,
okay.

18
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.840
<v 1>Found the supplement that he was taken.
There was a totally legal supplement.</v>

19
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.550
You get a bunch of shit big companies or these uh,

20
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.030
companies rather than get it from China and they,

21
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.070
they have these bins and like we had a problem with that with the Alpha brain

22
00:01:09.071 --> 00:01:09.710
when we first had,

23
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.360
not steroids but vitamins that were in Alpha brain that weren't supposed to win

24
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.020
to be there.

25
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.740
We have all our stuff independently tested and when we had it independently

26
00:01:17.741 --> 00:01:18.520
tested,

27
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.370
it turns out that the mixers then when they were putting all the different

28
00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:25.600
ingredients and they will be putting in these vats and they had used these vats

29
00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:27.640
for other shit and had a completely cleaned it out.

30
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.380
This is a problem with companies that sell steroids and also sell things like

31
00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:36.880
creating like this is the,
this is the big story about John Jones.

32
00:01:36.881 --> 00:01:38.800
This is the big rumor.
This is what they're,

33
00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:42.360
what they think is that he was doing coke that had creatine in it.

34
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.450
It was cut with creating that creatine probably had trace elements of steroids.

35
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.400
The reason why that makes sense is because he tested negative right before that

36
00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:55.870
test and then tested positive and then tested negative again a short time after

37
00:01:55.871 --> 00:01:59.710
that.
This is a steroid that takes several months to get out of your system,

38
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.790
but it got out of his system very quickly,
which would indicate it was a very,

39
00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:05.680
very small trace amount,

40
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.550
not an amount that you would take if you were actually using it to try to,

41
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.780
you know,
to get a performance enhancing benefit.
That's what I,
I book.

42
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.690
It makes sense to me.
And so it makes sense.
Nitsky too.

43
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.200
<v 0>It's fair enough.
And I,
I'm certainly there's cases,</v>

44
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.930
so under in my world where,
okay,
first offense,

45
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.830
lifetime ban,

46
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.220
I take a lot of guys would be a lot more careful with things like hat for one.

47
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.920
And I think,
uh,
you know,
there'll be a due process.
So,
you know,

48
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.050
say he proved that or like 10 meetings,
you know,
prove it,
you know,

49
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.980
he comes right back.
Right.
Um,

50
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.580
and I also think unfortunately there would be people that would probably,

51
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.020
uh,
you have no bad intention and would,
uh,
have the,
you know,

52
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.920
end up testing positive and having a lifetime ban and there'll be martyrs

53
00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:54.754
basically.

54
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.870
<v 1>Champ.
I can't sign off on martyrs,
man.
Too many too to have dreams,
you know,</v>

55
00:02:58.871 --> 00:03:00.040
for sure.
What about

56
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.860
<v 2>you?
Like what if you accidentally took some creatine and some bullshit?</v>

57
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.450
<v 0>Personally,
I'm extremely diligent.
I do my,</v>

58
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.190
I do my due diligence,
man.
I got,

59
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.110
I worked with muscle farm for years now and like I know that and they have great

60
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:16.800
stuff.
Yeah.
They may have based stuff.
I know that it's good stuff.
I,

61
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.030
that's my primary supplement source.
I mean,
I,
I'm,

62
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.160
I don't go do coke.
You know what I mean?

63
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:28.870
Like if you do those things and something bad happens to you,
that's your fault.

64
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.640
You know what I mean?
If,
if,
if for instance,
he was doing coke and,
uh,
he,
you know,

65
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:37.980
not knock on John Jones either.
I mean,
I'm not living his life.
I mean it's,

66
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.970
he's in a difficult situation as a young kid,
uh,
you know,

67
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:44.200
with God,
I mean,

68
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.400
I can only imagine the amount of people approaching him for crazy things and

69
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:52.630
trying to talk him into all this.
And so I have some sympathy for his situation.

70
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:54.040
But,
you know,
you make the choice,

71
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.930
you have to pay the consequences for the choice.

72
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.540
<v 2>I agree that you should pay the con the choice,
the consequences for the choice.</v>

73
00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:03.540
I just don't agree that the price should be so high.
You know,
like,

74
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.030
like when you think about a guy like Anderson Silva,

75
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.400
Anderson Silva just tested positive again.
Again.

76
00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:11.700
Do you think that that takes him out of the consideration for the greatest wall

77
00:04:11.701 --> 00:04:15.630
tie?
In my mind,
100%.
See,
I even doing it because he's old.

78
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.190
He's doing it because he's 40.
So we,
again,
we can feel whatever

79
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.070
<v 0>feel right.
I mean,
I feel like he probably wasn't doing it the whole time,</v>

80
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.690
but he might've been.
Yeah,
but do I?
No.
Hell No.

81
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.610
<v 2>You ever see his trainer?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I,
Eric Silva when I fought him.</v>

82
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.780
You know his trader looks ridiculous.
He's set like 70 years old.

83
00:04:36.781 --> 00:04:40.050
He's just flunking.
Yeah,
it looks like the hall.

84
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.990
He's like 5% body fat at 60 years old.

85
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.750
Like I sent a picture to the guy to Dana and I go,
this is Anderson's trainer,

86
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.400
lol.
And Dana sends you back.
Holy Shit.

87
00:04:53.401 --> 00:04:56.510
Are you serious?
Like oh yeah,
that's his trainer.
Oh fucking guys.

88
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.690
So Jack Dana's certainly seen him around to,
you have so straight it.

89
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.110
Lots of guys.
Is that,
that's just not,
that's a different guy,
man.
He's younger.

90
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.740
He's right there in your

91
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.320
book to the picture.
To the left is left is the one.
Yeah,
that's the picture.

92
00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:16.940
I said Dana,
he's so,

93
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.810
I mean it's fucking abs stick out like Blegh biceps.

94
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.500
Each one of his abs looks like a a bodybuilder's Bicep,
which is glued to it.

95
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.010
That's great.
Listen,

96
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.180
there's like you can get big at 60 you could be pretty built at 60 you can't be

97
00:05:36.181 --> 00:05:40.950
that bill.
It's not positive.
It's like 0.01% of the population that can do that.

98
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.790
Maybe they all live in Africa.
Yeah.
They're out there.
I'll have like super genes,

99
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.280
you know,
they're all like Francis and condos,
relatives.

100
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.470
So few people that are built like that.
Good man.

101
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.320
Not at that age.
You know,
at that age,
you know,
the body starts to diminish.

102
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.160
There's just no if,

103
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.910
<v 0>ands,
or buts about it.
Do you know that he's at old for sure.
Yeah.
That guy's old.</v>

104
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.380
Yeah,
he's in his sixties it's funny.
He's a,
I think he's an ex jam,
right?

105
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.180
Is that it?
[inaudible] I know he trained Eric Silva who was a GM.

106
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.730
He was in his corner and I was like,
I'm glad I'm fighting a little guy.
Not Him.

107
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.740
Nope.
Change boy.
You want to talk about a post Usada guy?
Like he's,

108
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.180
he's one of him.
And Vito Vito,

109
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.270
obviously it was a testosterone replacement therapy,

110
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:27.660
but I think Johnny Hendricks was probably the most obvious.
Right.

111
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.920
Formance wise for sure.
You got to wonder about Hendrix,

112
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:32.600
like how much of it was burnout,

113
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:35.750
how much of it was possibly he was taking something?

114
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.200
You gotta say it possibly because he never tested positive for anything.

115
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:42.800
But absolutely.
Yeah.
But Dude,
he was launching people across.

116
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.830
I was the last fight before you saw the,
when I fought him,
you know,

117
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.610
I felt a strength.
I've seen his body.
I mean,

118
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.000
I felt it firsthand is a completely different world.

119
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.580
Completely different compared to now.
It doesn't look the same.

120
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.270
He doesn't fight the same.
Certainly part,
part of that has to be motivation to,

121
00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:06.650
I mean,
he's just,
there's no way he,
he's under the same,
uh,

122
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.570
mental,
uh,
aspiration that he had before.
He's just,

123
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.760
he just looks at it differently.

124
00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:14.660
It could be also because his hormones are all fucked up.
Yeah,
absolutely.

125
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:15.740
It's a big speculation.

126
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.310
If he was on something and then he's off his hormones crash,

127
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.550
there's no way they can't.
That's just hand that and that affects your mind.

128
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:25.850
Right.
100%.
I'm never take it,
but I mean,

129
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:30.730
I see people that go on and off of it and they're like depressed and look at the

130
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.960
tour.
Remember when [inaudible] came back?

131
00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:36.350
I mean there's so many pictures of detour when he fought like Michael Bisping

132
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.070
and then you see V tour after Usada and he just,

133
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.820
he's got that old man bod and he goes in there and his body's kind of like loose

134
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:44.654
and it just,

135
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.040
it's your body's not producing hormones anymore if he takes on that shit.

136
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:52.260
When he was 19 man,
well yeah I guess.
Yeah,

137
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.350
Randy and he was 240 pounds and his neck started up here.

138
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:01.400
His neck started about two inches above his ears and just went down straight to

139
00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:05.390
his shoulder.
He's so fast.

140
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.130
Ridiculously fast.

141
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:12.470
Especially when he fought tank five ridiculously fast.
Yeah.

142
00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:14.430
Cause I would have for us any,
as I say,

143
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.470
like if you slow down when you stopped taking that stuff,

144
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.050
like if your muscles actually uh,
you know,

145
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.970
your fast twitch muscles go away or something like that,
you know,

146
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:28.970
body crashes right.
When you're that jacked up on steroids,

147
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:33.260
your whole body,
first of all,
your,
your balls are just like on vacation.
I mean,

148
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:35.870
I know you get stronger,
but what about,
you know,
speed though.

149
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:40.250
That's a different thing.
I said,
a lot of speed is from a neurological,
right?

150
00:08:40.251 --> 00:08:43.790
It's a lot of,
uh,
you know,
the nervous system.
So I wonder,
you know,

151
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:46.260
about the effects.
I'm like,
well,
I don't know.
Did you see the study?
Uh,

152
00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.590
Andy Galpin just came out with which one?

153
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:52.270
He just posted it the other day about a epigenetic memory of muscles.
Yes.

154
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.540
So this is,
I think,

155
00:08:53.541 --> 00:08:58.541
a big problem with the steroids because I say I do steroids when I'm 19.

156
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:02.880
Now my muscles get jacked and now my muscles remember how to get that jacked

157
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:04.120
again.
Um,

158
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.630
even though I'm off steroids for 10 years and then I come back at 30 and,

159
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:08.600
and Redo it.
Yeah,

160
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.650
<v 1>that's a very good point.
That's a very good point.
And a very real point.
Yeah.</v>

161
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.520
You body has muscle memory and especially if you do it when you're young and

162
00:09:16.521 --> 00:09:19.490
then your body has an adequate amount of time to rebuild and you start

163
00:09:19.491 --> 00:09:23.390
developing a natural hormone level that also increases your tendon strength.

164
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.590
It increases,
it increases ligament strength.
I mean,
it just,
your body changes it,

165
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.310
it changes the density of your muscles or your bones.
It just does.

166
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.150
There's a lot of bet.
I mean,

167
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.520
and then there's another argument for women and women that have taken steroids.

168
00:09:37.521 --> 00:09:40.760
It's even more intense argument because you're putting supernatural levels of

169
00:09:40.761 --> 00:09:42.290
testosterone in a woman's body.

170
00:09:42.291 --> 00:09:46.070
They develop all this new muscle tissue that never would have been there without

171
00:09:46.071 --> 00:09:49.640
it,
and a certain amount of that sticks around.
And do you know,

172
00:09:49.641 --> 00:09:52.640
you might not even ever been able to develop that kind of strength without it.

173
00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.450
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's what,</v>

174
00:09:55.451 --> 00:09:57.810
that was the first thing I thought of when I seen that study.
Yeah.

175
00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.970
And that was where I was,
I,
you know,
there's,

176
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:04.390
there's always a lot more to it than meets the eye.

177
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:14.410
<v 3>Okay.</v>
