1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
All that stuff is legitimate.
It's a problem.
Something that should be looked at.

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.760
It's just a shame that the judging is so poor and it's been this way for so
long.

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.500
Well to the boxing,
I mean you have a,
then,

4
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:17.160
I'm not saying this in a derogatory way,
in some ways it's a good way,

5
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:21.300
but you have a dictator running,
you know,
you have safe and no,
but,

6
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:26.301
but it's okay to have a dictated sometimes because at least you have rules that

7
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:31.080
are,
he had to,
you have structure and uh,
you know,

8
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:33.960
as long as they're not,
you know,
taking people out and killing them.

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.980
I know what you're saying.

10
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.980
And so boxing has boxing.

11
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:44.130
He has no real
accountability,

12
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:48.090
no structure across the board.
No,
you don't real,
you know,

13
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.600
lateral structure and conformity,

14
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.520
not done unilateral because you have different states that have different

15
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:59.280
commissions and you know,
there's supposed to be tied together,

16
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:03.660
but they all act differently.
And there's no natural commission.
There's no body,

17
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:08.460
there's no dictated.
There's no czar.
There's no it,
there's no NBA commissioner,

18
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:09.840
there's no NFL commissioner,

19
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:14.100
there's no MLB commissioner that overlooks and polices the whole sport.

20
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.360
And
there's those separation of

21
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.360
church and state,
so to speak,

22
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:25.290
where the people making the money in the sport are separated,

23
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:28.830
truly separated from the people supposedly administrating this.

24
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:31.110
But there's no separation.
They,
I mean,

25
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.320
promoters actually that are making the money and have obviously a horse that

26
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:39.500
running in the game,
so to speak that night,
uh,

27
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.730
that they want that fighter to when they pay the judges.

28
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.440
And there's no,
there's no,
again,
there's no buffer.

29
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:54.441
There's no separation where you can have promoters and managers that can

30
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:59.190
actually go to the commission and say,
we don't want these judges to judge.

31
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:00.840
They can't say,
put this judge and,

32
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.550
but they can knock two inches out and in commissions.
We'll listen to them.
Uh,

33
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.170
the alphabet organizations,
they're corrupt.
Um,
they are,

34
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.660
I mean,
it's not teddy atlas saying it.

35
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.390
It's everybody saying that there's very few people that are going to say they're

36
00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:18.360
not corrupt,
corrupt.
I mean,
if you're going to be honest about it and you're not,

37
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:21.360
and you don't have an agenda where you're afraid to say it because you have an

38
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:24.610
agenda,
which is a lot of people doing my business,
they have an agenda.

39
00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:26.760
So they're not going to say dude,
because they're part of it.

40
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.640
If then are part of it.
Uh,
they're,

41
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.910
they're friendly with people that are part of it and,
uh,

42
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.370
they want to have access,
they want to have relationships.

43
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:37.140
So they say away from it and,

44
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.640
and they understand how the call should work so they understand,
uh,
you know,

45
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:43.970
is it,
is it a smoky room with cigars?

46
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.700
Like the old days were Frankie Carbo was one of the things and you put an

47
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:49.410
envelope,
no,
it's not diet,

48
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.580
but you might be paying $30,000 for an ad and,

49
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.520
and,
and uh,

50
00:02:55.521 --> 00:03:00.521
at a convention for the WBA or the WBC or the w IBM for Wbl,

51
00:03:01.771 --> 00:03:06.460
whatever the heck they are.
And you might be paying 30,000 an ad.
What,
what you,

52
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.290
you know,
why you paid the 30,000 for that?

53
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.960
I don't think that you just like to see,
um,
your name and add in a,

54
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.750
in a brochure.
There's,
there was a purpose behind paying that had.

55
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.980
And um,
so there's no,
again,

56
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.750
you have the administrators have to sport the commissions and then you have to

57
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:33.421
alphabet organizations that get paid a sanction and fee fund the champion.

58
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.500
So they want that champion to win.
And so they get to sanction fee.

59
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.060
And especially if he's a popular champion.
So they,

60
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.010
so now you have
no body saying,

61
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.820
well,
the manager can't talk to the sanction organization for modern account.

62
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.180
Of course they can talk to them and say,
I want my guys rated high.

63
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.340
Of course they have access.

64
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.800
So they have access to talking to somebody,

65
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.780
influencing somebody to move their guy up in the ratings,

66
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.430
these honest ratings.

67
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.920
And they have access to telling an organization.
While I,
you know,

68
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:14.650
I'd like to push a mandatory,

69
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.160
I like to push my guy to get the mandatory,
which means of course,

70
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:20.920
that he's going to fight them within a certain period of time.

71
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.920
He's got to fight to champion,
which I was missing.
You never may.
Yeah,

72
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.070
that's absolutely missing.
So you have all that stuff going on

73
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.070
and we're where,
where is the,

74
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.750
where's the,
where's the oversight?
Yeah.
Where's the of I,
where's the police in?

75
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:40.810
Where's the,
where's the line where,

76
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.480
because again,
people making money,
people running the sport,
people making money,

77
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.160
people administrating this sport.

78
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.610
It's not supposed to blur a is supposed to be a separation.

79
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.690
Now if you know where to go in Europe,

80
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.810
America,
United States too,

81
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.380
but all through Europe where there's a lot of big fights too was just a big

82
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:06.250
fight with Joshua.
Uh,
in London they drew 90,000 people,

83
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:09.770
which is good for the sport and it's,
it's,
it's incredible.
Um,

84
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.940
but if you know where restaurant to go to tonight before big fight,

85
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.890
you were walking around.
So,
and I've been there,
you will walk in the restaurant.

86
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.250
I'm not going to say something.
And if I can't stand behind it,

87
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.940
and you will see at the restaurant and so big table kind of like,

88
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.270
you know,
not the last supper,
but it's,

89
00:05:32.271 --> 00:05:37.271
it's a big table and you will see all the officials at that table that are going

90
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:40.810
to work to fight the next night.
And you will see the organizational heads,

91
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.160
the heads of that sanctioning body.
And,
and the guys that are in charge,

92
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:49.750
the presidents,
vice presidents,
um,
supervisors are judges,

93
00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:54.010
referees.
And guess who the host of the dinners,
the promoter.

94
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.490
Somehow with that,
I mean there's something greatly wrong with that,
right?

95
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.090
So the host of the dead end,
it's a big bill obviously.

96
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:03.980
I mean it's a lot of people.
It's a good restaurant.

97
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.250
The eating all the best of drinking the best wines and everything else.

98
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.460
So it's a big bill and it's been picked up by the promoter who wants a specific

99
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:17.090
fight to win that night.
And he's got all,

100
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:22.091
he's got access to all the judges or the officials or the organizational heads

101
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.610
now.
So I would say to the people that are listening out there that,

102
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.300
just to make the analogy that really I think would hit home the New York Yankees

103
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.660
there obviously your universally known,
uh,

104
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.840
name and,

105
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.780
and Brant and the sort of organization maybe the biggest of all time.

106
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.170
So how about in New York?

107
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.060
You go to the best restaurant and the night before a world series game,

108
00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.220
you walked into the restaurant and you saw all the umpiring crew,

109
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.990
all the officials that are in charge of the umpiring for the world series game,

110
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.640
sitting at a dinner hosted by the Steinbrenner's problem,

111
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.120
problem,
problem,
problem,
giant problem.

112
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.790
And it can't happen because there's a commission would never let that happen

113
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:20.990
because the integrity,

114
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.110
the credibility of Dysport would be down the tubes in one moment.

115
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.410
Right before you could finish your shrimp cocktail.
And,

116
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.720
but so it can't happen.
It happens on checked.

117
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.740
But it happens all the time in boxing.

118
00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:38.540
And just to look of impropriety is wrong.

119
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.050
It should be wrong,
it should be worn.
The baseball,

120
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.450
it should be wrong and football should be wrong and MB,

121
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:49.040
but it should be even more wrong in a sport where you risked so much.

122
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.610
Yeah,
no,
I agree.
Yeah,
it's a very,
very good point.

123
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.740
And I don't know how you would ever fix that.
I mean,

124
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:58.970
how would you have some universal oversight of the entire sport and how would

125
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:03.940
you get everybody from the Wbo Wba,
WBC.
They wouldn't.

126
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:04.281
No,
no.

127
00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:08.090
They don't care enough because the president of the United States started Karen

128
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:10.790
when there was a problem with baseball.
He got,
he got involved.

129
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.970
That was about steroids though,
right?
Yeah,
but it was a problem.

130
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.280
It wasn't that a horseshit problem.
I mean,
it was a real problem,

131
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:19.850
but it was more of a problem of they wanted to clean up the image because it's

132
00:08:19.851 --> 00:08:24.830
America's sport and they had these people,
they're worried about where the fence,

133
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:28.130
we're going to leave the game a little bit.
So it was a problem.

134
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.390
It was a problem that was impacting them.
It was impacting.
Listen,

135
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:36.380
it was impacting the perception of the game,

136
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:41.490
which impacted the,
the gates,
right.

137
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.860
What they're going to make.
And ultimately the fan base,

138
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.500
which of course impacts them financially.
Uh,

139
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:54.570
it impacts the country because of less people care about this sport.

140
00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.620
Um,
you're gonna see it less and if you care about it,

141
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.760
you're going to be one of the people that are left out.

142
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:05.210
So it was a problem and they can't,

143
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.270
I don't,
I'm going to be careful saying this,
but not that careful,

144
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.880
but because you have to say it,

145
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:16.350
I don't think that they care as much about the people in boxing.

146
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.340
I don't think they do in there.
I just,
it's,
it's more of a dangerous,

147
00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:22.980
dirty sport in their eyes.
Yeah.
And,
and,

148
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:24.990
and the people that come into it and everything else,

149
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:27.870
how am I going to get into all the other stuff that you could get into that,

150
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:32.200
you know,
was so popular to get into in some ways nowadays?
You mean like racism?

151
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.290
Yeah.
I'm not going to get into that because
I don't want to,

152
00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:42.210
and I don't have,
you know,
definitive things to show for that.

153
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:47.310
I just know how I will,
the precise,
it's not,

154
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.090
it's not cherished the way baseball's cherish when there's a big fight like

155
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:54.270
Canelo and triple g,
people get excited and a lot of people will buy it,

156
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.770
but it's not necessarily thought of as something that represents America.

157
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.450
And in particularly in canal triple g,

158
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:03.270
you're talking about two people that aren't American to begin with.
Yes.
