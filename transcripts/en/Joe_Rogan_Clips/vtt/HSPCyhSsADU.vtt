1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.010
I don't know if you have any data on why Jacob Wall was recently banned.

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.600
Do you have that?
Uh,

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.070
<v 1>um,
I believe</v>

4
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.870
<v 0>who is chicken wall?
He's a,
I don't how to describe him.</v>

5
00:00:08.871 --> 00:00:10.870
He's a conservative personality but he's very,

6
00:00:10.871 --> 00:00:14.860
very controversial for like fake news or something.

7
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.110
I don't know too much about him so I don't want to accuse them of things cause I

8
00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:19.570
don't know who he is.
But he was,
uh,

9
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.740
he was in something where you tried accusing Muller of like sexual assaults and

10
00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:26.850
it turned out to be like just completely fake.
Ridiculous.
Good.

11
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.360
This was a gentleman that was in the USA Today article where he admitted that he

12
00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:32.620
was going to,

13
00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:37.621
he had a use tactics in the past to influence your election and he will continue

14
00:00:38.531 --> 00:00:40.570
to do so using all of his journals.
Yes.

15
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.580
<v 1>When we saw that report,
our team looked at his account.</v>

16
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:47.130
We noticed there were multiple accounts tied to his account,

17
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:50.130
so fake accounts that he had created that we're discussing political issues and

18
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:53.800
pretending to be other people.
Um,
um,

19
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.410
we would have phone numbers,
linking accounts together or email addresses.

20
00:00:58.411 --> 00:00:59.730
And some cases,
Ip addresses,

21
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:02.190
other types of metadata that are associated with accounts.

22
00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:03.810
So we can link those accounts together.

23
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.280
And having multiple accounts in and of itself is not a violation of our rules

24
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:11.730
because some people will have their work account,
the personal account.

25
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.420
It's when you're deliberately pretending to be someone else and manipulating a

26
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:18.730
conversation about a political issue.
And those were exactly the stint,

27
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.520
the types of things that we saw the Russians do,
for example,

28
00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:23.600
in the 2016 elections.

29
00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:28.020
So it was that playbook and that type of activity that we saw about Jacob Wall.

30
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.740
And that's why his accounts were suspended.
Did you investigate Jonathan Morgan?

31
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.240
I don't know who that is.
Why?
Uh,
that's,
that's the important question.

32
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.970
Why I don't,
I don't know who that is,
but that's,
that's,

33
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.330
it might be that someone at Twitter investigated him.
I personally don't know.

34
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.480
<v 0>So,
uh,</v>

35
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.210
one of the issues that I think is really important to get to is you should know

36
00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:50.270
who he is.
He's more important than Jacob Wallets,
but for some reason,

37
00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:52.630
you know about this conservative guy and not the Democrat who,

38
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.770
who helped metal in the Alabama election?
Well,
so Jonathan,

39
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.780
according to the sheer volume that they have to pay attention to it,
right,
right,

40
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.200
right.
But it's,

41
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:03.920
it's about grains of sand making a heap and the flow of a direction where we can

42
00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:06.080
see Jacob Wall has said he's done this,
so you're like,

43
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:07.190
we're going to investigate.
We banned him.

44
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.180
It was recently reported and covered by numerous outlets that a group called new

45
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:15.410
knowledge was meddling in the Alabama election by creating fake Russian accounts

46
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.770
to manipulate national media into believing that Roy Moore was propped up by the

47
00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:21.950
Russians.
Facebook banned him as well as for their people.
But Twitter didn't.

48
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.680
He's still at it.

49
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.200
<v 1>Did Bam.
The accounts that were engaged in the behavior.</v>

50
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.040
<v 0>I do remember,
I do remember signing this division,
our team that's worse,</v>

51
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:32.150
that one.
So you didn't bend the guy doing it,
but you banned the people like so

52
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.470
<v 1>in the case of Jacob,</v>

53
00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:36.740
while we were able to directly attribute through email addresses and phone

54
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:37.161
numbers,

55
00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:41.150
his direct connection to the accounts that were created to manipulate the

56
00:02:41.151 --> 00:02:45.680
election,
if we're not able to tie that direct connection on our platform or law

57
00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:49.220
enforcement doesn't give us information to tie attribution,

58
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.460
we won't take action.
And it's not because of political ideology,

59
00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:54.770
it's because we want to be damn sure before we take action on it.

60
00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:59.620
So someone could use a VPN perhaps and maybe additional email accounts and they

61
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:02.770
could game the system in that we are certainly sophisticated ways that people

62
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:04.560
can,
can do,
uh,

63
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.870
things to mask who they are and what accounts that they're controlling.

64
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.820
<v 2>Interesting internal conversation to just to provide more light and to what</v>

65
00:03:11.821 --> 00:03:16.680
happens.
Like I got to,
I got an email or a text from Vigia,
um,

66
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.270
one morning and said,

67
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.530
we are going to permanently suspend those particular account and it's not a,

68
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.740
you know,
what do you think it's,
we are going to do this.

69
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.100
And I then have an opportunity at task questions.

70
00:03:29.101 --> 00:03:32.940
I asked a question why she gave me a link back to the document of all the

71
00:03:32.941 --> 00:03:37.350
findings and USA Today.
Um,
we took the action,

72
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.250
I was on Twitter.

73
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.080
A bunch of people pointed me at this particular case since some of those tweets

74
00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:47.640
to her what's going on?
So that's well that's in the background.

75
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.320
<v 0>Wouldn't you just terminate anybody associated with the company that was doing</v>

76
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:53.560
this?
I mean,
you keep in mind too,
at the time when this campaign was happening,

77
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.880
this is what basis he had,

78
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.020
he admitted to engaging in the operation in a quote to New York Times and you

79
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:00.340
banned the accounts associated with it.

80
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:02.650
So if you know he's the one running the company,
wouldn't you be like,
okay,

81
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:03.484
your gun,

82
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.320
<v 1>um,
do you want us to take every single newspaper accounts attribution?</v>

83
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.020
Because what we were able to do in the Jacob Wall situation was actually tie

84
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:13.300
those accounts in our own systems,
right?

85
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.330
That he will actually control the rounds.

86
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.050
Not just take the word of a newspaper article.
You said,

87
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.290
you said you band his accounts.
Yes.

88
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.150
And you know from his own statement and from his tweets that he was the run

89
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.360
running,
running the company Jacob Wall?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Jonathan Morgan.
Oh,
sorry.

90
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.720
I'm getting confused about it.

91
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.370
<v 0>Uh,
uh,
Jacob Wall.
It's announced in the USA Today.
He says,</v>

92
00:04:34.371 --> 00:04:36.890
I'm doing this and you're like,
okay,
we can look at his account,
we can see it.

93
00:04:36.891 --> 00:04:40.050
We get rid of him with,
with new knowledge.
You said you did take it,

94
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.923
<v 1>those counts down.</v>

95
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.590
I believe we were able to take down a certain cluster of accounts that we saw

96
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.230
engaging in the behavior,
but we won't,

97
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.750
weren't necessarily able to tie it back to one person controlling those.

98
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:52.360
Like even if they say they did it and this is where I get back,

99
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:56.440
like we like to have some sort of attribution that's direct that we can see.

100
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.540
Would we just take the any newspaper or any article at face value and just

101
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.650
action them?
That's a good,

102
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:06.880
you have to contact him and get some sort of a statement from him in order to

103
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.890
take down his account.

104
00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:11.410
And obviously I don't think he would admit to manipulating Twitter if Twitter

105
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.670
asked him.
So the fact that he communicated with the newspaper,
right,

106
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.840
<v 0>to clarify,
uh,
what they said,
what,</v>

107
00:05:17.841 --> 00:05:21.310
what they claimed to the New York Times was that it was a false flag.
Uh,

108
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.480
near Time said they reviewed internal documents that showed,

109
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.480
they admitted it was a false flag operation.
Um,

110
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.480
the guy who runs the company said,
Oh,
his company does this.

111
00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:35.180
He wasn't a aware necessarily,
but it was an experiment.
So He's,

112
00:05:35.181 --> 00:05:39.060
he's given kind of a,
in my opinion,
duplicitous,
like,
you know,

113
00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:41.460
not straight forward,
but at the time of this campaign,

114
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:44.460
which he claims to know about,
he tweeted that it was real.

115
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.090
So during the Roy Moore campaign,
he tweets,
wow,
look at the Russians.

116
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.610
Then it comes out later.
His company's the one that did it.

117
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.230
So you're kind of like,
oh,
so this guy was propping up his own fake news.
Right?

118
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.760
Then when they get busted,
he goes,
oh,
it's just my company doing an experiment.

119
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.430
But you tweeted,
it was real pyramid.

120
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.920
You use your verified Twitter account to push the fake narrative your company

121
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:07.520
was pumping on this platform.
And so,
so the point I want to make I guess is

122
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.610
<v 1>it sounds like we need to take a closer look at this one</v>

123
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.180
<v 0>ban and bring back Morgan murder.
Well Meghan Murphy,
Megan Murphy,
sorry.</v>

124
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.960
Morgan Murphy is a friend of mine.
Te Te te te to,
sorry Morgan.

125
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.690
So this is the,
I haven't read the story.

126
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:23.720
It's been like two months since the story broke.
So I could have my,
you know,

127
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.180
I don't want to,
I don't want to get sued and have my facts wrong,

128
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.910
but the reason I bring this up was not to accuse you of wrongdoing.

129
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:31.550
What's the point out that I don't,

130
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:34.700
I don't think that the people who work at Twitter are twirling their mustaches,

131
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:37.460
laughing,
you know,
bad press in the band button whenever they see a conservative.

132
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:38.300
I think it's just,

133
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.480
there's a bias that's unintentional that flows in one direction.

134
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.690
So you see the news about Jacob Wall and I think there's a reason for it too.

135
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.680
There's a couple of reasons for one,
yours,
your staff is likely more,

136
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.910
you've mentioned more likely to lean left and look at certain sources.
Uh,

137
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.850
so you're going to hear about more things more often and take action on those

138
00:06:55.851 --> 00:06:59.750
things as opposed to the other side of the coin.
But,
but we,

139
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.060
we have to consider like where the actions are taking place.

140
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.750
And I'm speaking more broadly to the 4,000 people that we have as a company

141
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:09.410
versus no deliberateness that we have on bridges team.
I just mean when we,

142
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:12.740
when we look at a company wide average of all of your employees and the

143
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:15.710
direction they lean versus the new sources they're willing to read,

144
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.050
you're going to see a flow in one direction,
whether it's intentional or not.

145
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.790
And so I think the challenges,

146
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.350
<v 1>well we don't generally rely on new sources to find stipulation of our platform,</v>

147
00:07:24.351 --> 00:07:27.200
but we're looking at what we're seeing,
the signals we can see.

148
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.450
And once in a while we will get tipped off to something.

149
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:32.150
But like for the most part when we're looking at manipulation,

150
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:35.300
it's not like the New York Times can tell us like what's going on on the

151
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:37.880
platform where the ones that have the metadata of bank accounts were the ones

152
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:39.650
that can see patterns of behavior at scale.

153
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:40.920
<v 0>I hear your point.</v>

154
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.600
I knew one name and I didn't know another name and it was because visual said

155
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.480
you don't work permanently banning this account.
And yes,
we,

156
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.240
we didn't have the same sort of findings in the other particular account,

157
00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:55.880
which I got feedback on pastor her and,

158
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.940
and we didn't find what we needed to fund.
I think

159
00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:58.581
<v 1>to be clear,</v>

160
00:07:58.581 --> 00:08:01.370
the team had taken action on those stuff months ago when it actually had

161
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:02.270
happened.
Tried it.
Yeah.
