1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.570
You guys are going to hate me for it.
You know what I want.
I want one.

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.230
One example at eff.
Why we should believe the earth is flat.

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.120
You son of a bitch.
You want it so bad and I am high and drunk

4
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.750
too.
As long as it's a joke and it's funny,
I'm cold.
It gets angry.
It's not fun.

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.230
I'm not married to this route.

6
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.460
If it's job not married to it convinced me that it's flat.

7
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.780
There's no way I could do that.
God really?
There's not one example.

8
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.740
It takes about a year and a half and like wanting to have this to me very hard.

9
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:36.570
They not so strong.
You look at your sons cartoons.
It's all space.

10
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.990
I look at all my shit,
all the shit my son likes,
his everything is,

11
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:42.850
they're taking space.
Still doing research on this currently in space.

12
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.790
Direct everyone to Hashtag spaces fake doing research.

13
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.810
Is that real?
That's a real site.
Hashtag spaces fake.

14
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:53.820
It's something I'm investigating for my next hour

15
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.960
for legitimately looking deep into the folder.
There's mild dam.

16
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.630
Like what space?
No,

17
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.850
it's the same thing.
Okay.
Got It all wrong.
You've got it all wrong.

18
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.410
This is not very organized.

19
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.670
Know what I'm saying is that everybody couldn't have it all wrong,

20
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.060
but anybody that thinks the earth is flat,

21
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.050
they totally don't believe what we're taught about what's above us.

22
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.010
So fake.
What about the sun?

23
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.160
They mean all the stock information we're getting.

24
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.180
You're lying about that shit that,
it's not that it doesn't exist.

25
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:37.200
Of course it exists.
We see of course,
but space is fake.
Sounds ridiculous.

26
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:40.080
Like there's,
there's something.
I'm looking at it and it's it.
It's fake.

27
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:41.640
That's ridiculous.
That's not what it means.

28
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:45.480
It means that all the information we got to buy,
all their eyes in the sky,

29
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.693
something else,

30
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.510
their line to NASA law and there's a reason tell you,

31
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.850
but you guys who don't want to hear it,
hold on.

32
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.020
So I don't want to tell him to give us a,
like the cliff notes.

33
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.440
The cliff notes are man,
ah,

34
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.060
have you studied any kind of a,
he doesn't need to be.
Let's hear.

35
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:07.750
Just so few of if goal,

36
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.920
always been for the most powerful emperors is a one world government.

37
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.610
Always wanted a one world government.
All of the Roman emperors,

38
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:20.760
they tried to figure out,
they tried to do different combinations.
How about him?

39
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.760
And they would fall and they were a new emperor would come and go,
you know what?

40
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.900
I'm going to fucking rule domination.

41
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.510
I'm not going to let my soldiers get married that way.

42
00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:32.880
We'll have a stronger army.
They have different philosophies.

43
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:36.270
Everyone believed different shit,
but they all wanted a one world government.

44
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.670
There is no way to have a fucking Walmart with government it.

45
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:39.930
Nobody's into that shit.

46
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.650
Not even other rules from small countries or like one world government that's

47
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:46.200
going to put me out of a job.
Fuck your one world government.

48
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.190
People don't know shit about politics.
Don't want a one world government.

49
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.970
There's no way you're going to sell the one world government.
It's impossible.

50
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.800
The only way,

51
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.460
the only way to make a one government work is to have the people embrace it.

52
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.810
They have to want it because nobody wants it.

53
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.940
So the trick is to make,
to make people want it,
to embrace it.

54
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:13.990
There's only one way I got to pay.
There's on the line morning,
Miss Allen's,

55
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.030
I noticed know the only way and the known this forever,

56
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.300
the Vatican knew this,
the Vatican,
the pope water to rule the world.

57
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.290
They all knew it but they couldn't do it.
They all knew it,
but they knew one way.

58
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.350
But there's no how they're going to put it away,
man.

59
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.420
The only way is if there was some extra terrestrial threat from up above us,

60
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.400
that would be the only way to have everyone embrace the one world government.

61
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.060
They all knew that for years they didn't work.
That's the plan.

62
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.990
They can never make Brando that they didn't have the technology 500 years ago.

63
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.710
The Vatican knew about it,
they wanted it.
And you go to the Vatican,

64
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:55.030
you see paintings,

65
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.350
that paintings of like have you let those with aliens in them and back when I

66
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:03.010
used to believe in Ufos,
but before I figured out that um,

67
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.190
Ufo is where are they want us to believe in Ufo as they're preparing us for a

68
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:13.750
fake alien invasion.
That's always been the plan.
A one world government.

69
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.130
The only way to do it is to get us to embrace it and the only way to embrace it

70
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.630
is from an alien attack.

71
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.920
Ronald Reagan talked about it many times at the UN CFR.

72
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.490
He talked about it because wouldn't it make,
he looked at all the leaders of the,

73
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.590
of the nature of the world and said,

74
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.880
what did it make our lives easier if we just had some,
you know,

75
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.050
some kind of extra terrestrial threat.
He said,
that shit,

76
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.550
he said that in front of the UN wouldn't.
Aw,

77
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.780
he's trying to get everybody into Dan too.
I don't think he ever said no,
no.

78
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.670
He said that many times.
A 10 video montage.
Ronald Reagan,
Ronald Reagan

79
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.760
was vice president.
He was talking about,
and there's many videos of him saying,

80
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.720
we are what lies before us.
He's in front of the nation doing it.

81
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.140
State of the Union address,
saying what lies before us.

82
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.550
Is the opportunity to forge a new world,
order a world,

83
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.530
an order because he's talking about like,

84
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.210
isn't that means that the spaces for yes.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
When people ask me,

85
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.400
why would they fake space?

86
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.270
It's always been about a fake alien attack.

87
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.580
You can't have a fake alias politics.

88
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.780
Never fake an attack without space.
But I've never heard of politics.

89
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.390
You have to have space first.
So they always,
you know,

90
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:35.950
who promoted space more than anybody who want Nazis.
Nazis,

91
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.080
not before the Nazis.
You know,
mine's the Vatican.

92
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.500
They have all the biggest,
uh,
they have all the astronomers.

93
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:46.600
They're all Jesuit Vatican's,
all of them.

94
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.420
All the ones that are giving us this information about space.

95
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.680
They all come from the Vatican.

96
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.910
The Vatican has the most beautiful towns come here.

97
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.020
Know what the name of the [inaudible] doesn't have the most powerful,

98
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.510
you know what his name is?
The most powerful telescope.
The Bat again,

99
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.440
and you know what name it is.
I've done the research on Youtube.
Hi Nancy folks.

100
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.610
But you're done with this.

101
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.970
Do you know what the mass one and chill is the most Pelo power telescope in the

102
00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:15.200
world?
It's in the Vatican.
But do you know the,
what's Lucifer falls?

103
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.310
Lucifer's Dick and balls.
Never seen this fucking town.
Really legit,
dude.
Uh,

104
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.570
I think the biggest ones in Chile,

105
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:22.850
I think they have to be in high altitude paddock.
Yeah.

106
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:23.960
I don't think it's in the Vatican.

107
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.290
When people ask me why would they fake all this shit,

108
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.780
but I don't think they got to go bed.
It's just a crazy theory.
I'm trying to,

109
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.750
I'm just,
it certainly has.
We're talking to these Ellis,
these funny theory,

110
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.970
but Eddie,
these new chilay,

111
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:42.971
very large array telescopes that they're creating are fucking gigantic and they

112
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:45.590
take over enormous pieces of land.

113
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.260
Google does very large array.
It's called not,

114
00:06:49.261 --> 00:06:51.230
it's called the very large telescope telescope.

115
00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:53.780
I watched the documentary with you at your house.

116
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.140
It was like 2001 and I think five years.
They're going up.

117
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.160
They're putting the documentary about them putting together the very large

118
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:06.161
telescope in Chile and they're talking about by the year 2005 we're going to

119
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:06.950
have this,

120
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.720
we're going to have three telescopes are linked with a computer to make us,

121
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.460
we're going to see further into space than ever before.
None of that shit came.

122
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.300
What are you talking about?
Camp is that there's a very,

123
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.690
very large array up yet no large telescope.
But I know they have,

124
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.310
they have them in Hawaii.
Weird,

125
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.170
isn't it weird that every space documentary all the series,

126
00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:35.180
I had them all,
Jo,
Adam,
all we watch them all the time.

127
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.020
I tried to remember all the shit about a neutron star and a super hyper Nova.

128
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:43.700
I was ball state were balls deep into space and then every now and then we'd

129
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:47.480
watch this documentary after documentary.
Morgan Freeman ain't got the universe.

130
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.790
We had a shit.
Shit,
I DVR and all that shit.

131
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.310
Anything that's at space still smells fucking ball.

132
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.400
I thought it was better than people and shit cause I knew so much about space

133
00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:00.740
and every now and then I'd watch all that shit and wonder and wonder why this is

134
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:04.820
all cartoons,
Eddie Watt.
But it's just so hard.
And then I go,
okay,
whatever,

135
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:08.720
whatever.
And then I keep watching all DVDs on space or I'll CGI,

136
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.260
there's nothing real and everyone watches that.
They believe it.

137
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.880
The narration is all programming what's above us and what we're on.

138
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.790
We're being lied to.
Once you go flat,
you never go back.
Listen,

139
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.070
if you think campaign,
they listen.
They're lying to us about everything.

140
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.350
This is the one thing I want to say.
Okay?

141
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.660
It's not that we believe something ridiculous and you don't.

142
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.920
You don't believe it.
We're gullible.
We're gullible.
We,

143
00:08:38.921 --> 00:08:43.250
we believe some weird shit about the flat earth.
We believe some weird shit.

144
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.950
You don't believe it.
You're smart.
It's not about that.

145
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.500
It's about we actually don't know what we're on.

146
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:49.940
And we always say that we don't know,

147
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:53.780
but based on all the shit that we got by the mainstream,

148
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.480
we don't believe that.
Here's what you believe that I see.

149
00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:02.040
It's not that we believe something crazy and you don't because you smell it.

150
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.280
The bullshit.
Isn't there a sense that

151
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.980
we are get a totally different tool we looked at as you use

152
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.260
and we don't really any of them.
Yeah,
but you use,
we don't.

153
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:16.500
And if you use that microphone,
use a cell phone.
Right?
It's science.
Hold on.

154
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.420
I believe that.
I believe in it.
Okay.

155
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:21.690
Why do you believe in that and want to believe but study.

156
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.610
I don't need to read something to verify,
but when you benefit,
benefit,

157
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.770
you benefit for every day.
I know.

158
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:32.910
I love this and why we'll need to cut this.
It's 10 o'clock.

159
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:39.660
Come see me in Vancouver at the vogue theater and in Salt Lake City at wise

160
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:43.470
wiseguys March one and two I love science too.
I love science.

161
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.080
I don't want to fight.
I want to laugh about it.
I'm an idiot.

162
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.740
I believe in flatter.
I'm crazy.
That's all you need to know.
