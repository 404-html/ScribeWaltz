00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.440
You're doing what you want to do,
like you're ready total,
whoever.
Let's do it.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.590
Yeah.
If you wanted to make a record,
jod be there.
You know what I mean?

3
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:10.380
That's what I'm saying.
Well lucky for you.

4
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:13.770
I'm totally talentless and the music department so it's not going to happen.

5
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:15.120
But now you're such a talent man.

6
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:19.470
I love like when you and Dominic Cruz are commentating together doesn't get any

7
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:21.390
better.
Yeah.
I love dom.
He's an awesome man.

8
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.800
He beat the shit out of me a couple of times.
Um,
why did you let him?

9
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.000
Cause he,
you know,
we,

10
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.860
we used to sponsor him a little bit like with famous like you know,

11
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.300
he used to walk out and famous stuff like when UFC wasn't,

12
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.050
they didn't have Reebok gear.
Um,
and he would come down and train,

13
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.340
cause I would train with this one guy Josh over here in Woodland Hills and he

14
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.410
said,
travel,
I'm going to be in town.
I'm going to come train with you.
I was like,

15
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:47.070
okay,
cool.
Little did I know it'd be dom tossing me around and like,

16
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.320
oh my gosh,
man,
it was so difficult.
But he make you roll with them?

17
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.300
Well now it'd be,
he'd be like,
try to sleep me.
I tried to knock me out today,

18
00:00:57.301 --> 00:01:01.140
so I'm giving my all and,
and you know,
I was using as defense and you know,

19
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:04.110
when you,
when you actually swinging in the air and you're not landing,

20
00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:06.420
it actually more tiresome than when you're hitting somebody.

21
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.710
So I'm swinging in the air,
he's like on the side of me all of a sudden like,

22
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:10.921
you know,

23
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:14.790
he's so quick like with footwork and then I'm wrestled to the ground and it's

24
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:19.320
just a rap every time and he's so,
so talented.
So yeah,
man,

25
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.460
I love that guy.
He just has the most ridiculous footwork.
His,

26
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.700
his footwork is so unique to him,
to everything he does.

27
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:29.760
It's got like this weird herky jerky little,
yeah,
he does.

28
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:32.580
He's probably one of the most unique MMA fighters ever.

29
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.150
I feel like a lot of people have kind of borrowed from his style,
you know,

30
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.450
for sure.
Not to say they didn't make it their own,

31
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:42.380
but I feel like dom was the first one you saw,
you know,

32
00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:45.660
kind of move like unquestionably.
Yeah.
And that's because of his intelligence,

33
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.820
because he doesn't like getting hit.
He's like,
okay,

34
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:49.590
I gotta figure out a way to knock it hit so much.

35
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:53.280
Like what's the best way to not get hit?
And it just came up with,

36
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:54.960
it's very unorthodox way of moving.

37
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.350
He's a real encyclopedia of information when you start talking to him about

38
00:01:58.351 --> 00:01:58.741
fighting.

39
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:03.510
Like he's a really enjoy doing commentary with him because he's so insightful.

40
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.320
He's so good at pointing out little areas where he thinks people are making

41
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:11.250
mistakes or how to capitalize on certain things that people are doing.
Yeah,

42
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.010
I've watched fights with them before and he's,
and he,

43
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.270
he gives a different insight than what I'm seeing.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
he's great.

44
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:21.780
Especially when it comes to wrestling clinch work and you know,

45
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.620
and even like weird striking techniques.
I mean,
he's just,

46
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.030
he's so good at be funneling people that he fights with,

47
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.660
with movement and information.
Like he's giving them looks and,
and they're,

48
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.490
they're trying to set up,
you know,

49
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.950
they're standing there trying to set up and they don't know what the fuck he's

50
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:40.190
doing.
Then they have to reset and they trying to get,

51
00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:43.710
and then he's giving them a different look and standing over here and then he's

52
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:46.590
in front of it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a trip.
He's great.

53
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.390
Just fucked up his shoulder again man.
I know,
man.
I think he,
he trains so much,

54
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.110
I feel like he just,
you know,
he says not obsessive.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's a savage.

55
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.213
I mean he,

56
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.270
he got back from knee surgery and he went so hard that he gave himself plantar

57
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:02.170
fasciitis,

58
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.400
say fucked up the bottom of his feet from running and sprinting and doing all

59
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:10.450
kinds of crazy shit to get in shape.
And you know,
he got over that and I mean,

60
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:14.980
he's had so many different surgeries.
Nice.
Miserable.
Have you had that?
No,

61
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:19.150
I've never had planner.
Oh Man.
I had it on a tour where I would,
I,
I'd get these,

62
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.210
I get these weird kind of things where I have to do a certain thing before I go

63
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:25.790
on stage.
So one of the things I did on a tour that was,
I don't know,

64
00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:29.620
it was about a four month tour,
is run four to five miles before the show.

65
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.410
And by the,
by the middle of that tour,

66
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:36.490
I had actually given myself a stress fracture in my foot.
It was terrible.

67
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.200
Did you run on concrete?
Not a treadmill.
Real?
Yeah.
Wow.

68
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.860
Damn Dude.
You sometimes,
sometimes when,
when there was no treadmill,

69
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:48.280
I just run out in the street,
but I kind of get like that where I just like,

70
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.820
I don't know.
I get obsessive about stuff and I want to,
I want to do it.

71
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.090
I get to kind of,
I throw myself all the way in.
