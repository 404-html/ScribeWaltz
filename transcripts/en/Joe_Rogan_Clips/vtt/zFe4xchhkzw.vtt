1
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.540
Yeah,
I got to tell you that your victory speech after you beat you on,
uh,

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.600
was my all time favorite because it wasn't even just about you or about the

3
00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:18.340
fight.
It wasn't about anything.
It was just you expressing yourself.
Pat,

4
00:00:18.341 --> 00:00:21.640
what are you doing over there?
You right.
Checking out the sorrow.
Okay.
Tassel.

5
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.600
<v 1>Yeah.
No,
uh,
I just think that,
um,
uh,</v>

6
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.280
<v 0>it was an awesome victory speech.
It was really amazing.
It was a,
you were,</v>

7
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.530
you know,
you were just spilling your heart out and it was in your,

8
00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:40.800
your moment to shine and in your moment to shine you,

9
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:42.180
you didn't make it about you.

10
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.710
<v 1>I think I fight better that way,
you know,
when,
um,
you know,
it's always about me,</v>

11
00:00:47.711 --> 00:00:50.770
like throughout the training camp,
like everybody,
like my coaches and teammates,

12
00:00:50.771 --> 00:00:54.730
they're always helping me and it's just,
it gets to be a bit much sometimes,

13
00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:57.550
you know,
and I want to,
um,
I want to help other people.
Um,

14
00:00:57.551 --> 00:01:02.170
it feels my spiritual cup more,
um,
you know,
spiritual cup.

15
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.220
Yeah.
Um,
I think that,
you know,
I've,
uh,
you know,
if,

16
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.610
if your hands close to,
to give,
you know,

17
00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:13.590
you can't be open to receive kind of thing.
And,
um,
I think that,
um,

18
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.290
the more that I can give to people,
the more that I can get myself,
you know,

19
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.800
and I think that,
um,
you know,
just like plants and animals,
the way,
you know,

20
00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:23.410
if you look at nature,
everything is a symbiotic relationship,

21
00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:25.570
but I think that humans can be the same way.

22
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.780
<v 0>That's an interesting way of looking at things.</v>

23
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:29.250
Have you always looked at things like that?

24
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.400
<v 1>No.
Uh,
uh,
I shouldn't say,
not always,
but a,</v>

25
00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:38.690
I always was a person that,
you know,
want it to be outside.

26
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:40.250
I want us to be in nature.
I grew up in a,

27
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.000
like urban jungle and Milwaukee and just concrete everywhere,
you know,

28
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:47.630
no place to go outside except for,
you know,
just playing in the alleys and stuff.

29
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.320
But,
uh,
um,
my,

30
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.150
my lineage is from Lithuania where they're like very in tune with nature and

31
00:01:56.151 --> 00:02:00.230
they're pagans and like slash Christian and uh,

32
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.470
so they really,
you know,
just,
just my whole family,
you know,

33
00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:05.900
they come from living off the land and stuff like that.

34
00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:08.810
And so that's always been something I wanted to do.
Um,

35
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.440
and I'll just put it in this situation,
you know,
just to,
you know,

36
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.490
try and do martial arts and trying to like,
uh,
you know,

37
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.340
I guess control my emotions and stuff.

38
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:23.710
Just living in this chaotic environment that I grew up in and um,

39
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.390
nature is where I felt the most piece at.

40
00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:28.910
So that's always something that I connected with.

41
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.250
And then the more that I kind of,
uh,

42
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.200
focus on nature and animals and stuff like that,
I noticed that,
you know,

43
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.730
there's a,
I don't know,
I tried to live my life the same way.

44
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.300
<v 0>Well,</v>

45
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.360
it's just interesting leading up to that fight to that you are kind of like the

46
00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:46.900
antidote to a lot of things that people are getting annoyed at.

47
00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:51.110
Nema may all the trash talking and all the negativity and all that,

48
00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:56.111
like fighting at press conferences and you just shut all that shit down with

49
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.843
Yolanda.

50
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.010
<v 1>Wait,
there needs to be balanced.
Know it's like,
I mean,
I like entertainment.
Yeah.</v>

51
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.800
I,
I,
you know,
I should talk sometimes too,
you know.
But,
uh,
I,

52
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.400
there just has to be a balance,
you know?
And it has to be honest too,

53
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:11.440
like if you really feel this way about somebody,

54
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.410
like if you're really upset with this person,
yeah.
I say how you feel,

55
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:18.040
but like don't just go out of your way just to be entertaining because you think

56
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:21.820
it's going to be funny or something or you think it's just going to be like,

57
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.330
it's not genuine,
you know?

58
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.860
<v 0>Yeah.
But it was just the way you handled yourself.
Like,</v>

59
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.830
cause her whole thing is talking shit.

60
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.160
The whole thing is scaring people and did boogie woman and coming to get,

61
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.960
you know,
all that stuff and you were just dead faced and I think,
yeah.

62
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.850
Fucked her head up.
I really do.

63
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.410
<v 1>So,
uh,
you ever see that video of like the,
what was that video with all that?</v>

64
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.090
Not that one.
The one you just showed me earlier,
it was like,

65
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.130
is this dude like standing in front of an elephant?

66
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.390
And they like started charging at him and he was like calm,
you know?

67
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.210
And he just stood there.
Yeah.
I don't know how crazy it was.

68
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.400
<v 0>Trample them.
Yeah.
We just watched it on elephant is coming through is like,
yeah,</v>

69
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.760
I've seen that.
Just stands there in one spot.

70
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.390
<v 1>Don't try that at home.
Yeah.</v>

71
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.940
The difference then obviously,
cause you're talking about an animal.
Right.

72
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.030
But it just,
I think it's a good analogy to draw from like Yolanda energy.

73
00:04:17.031 --> 00:04:21.860
She was very like chaotic and very in my face and very threatening.

74
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.840
Intimidating.
Yeah.
And like,
yeah,

75
00:04:23.841 --> 00:04:27.080
don't go out of your way to stand in front of an elephant's running at you.

76
00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:31.550
Like don't put yourself in that position.
But I,
I had to be there.
That's my job.

77
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.790
You know?
So,
um,
so when you're in those situations where he like,

78
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.070
you don't know what's,
do you know,
you just stay calm.

79
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.710
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
you didn't just stay calm,</v>

80
00:04:39.711 --> 00:04:44.330
you stayed eerily calm and you were like reciting the Lord's prayer when I asked

81
00:04:44.331 --> 00:04:46.760
you that,
I was like,
whoa.
It was like,
what are you saying over there?

82
00:04:46.761 --> 00:04:48.170
And you're like,
I'm reciting the Lord's prayer.

83
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.860
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh,</v>

84
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.450
the whole training camp was just crazy.
But like that week in particular,

85
00:04:56.451 --> 00:04:59.780
like I was convinced that this might be my last fight.

86
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.430
This might be my last day on earth.

87
00:05:01.431 --> 00:05:05.660
Like I was so just like ready for anything at that point,
you know?

88
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.520
<v 0>Why were you thinking that it might be your last fight?</v>

89
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.180
<v 1>I don't know.
Some crazy.
I Dunno.
Just cause,
uh,</v>

90
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.840
I don't know.

91
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.630
I think I started to think that almost like every fight is because it's,
uh,

92
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.600
it's tough.
Yeah.
It's tough,
but it's the best thing in the world.

93
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.500
<v 0>Especially the,
the,
all of the,</v>

94
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.940
all of the stressors that came along with this fight in particular,
right?

95
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:34.920
Especially all of those,
like [inaudible] and then we have what we've,
we've had,

96
00:05:34.921 --> 00:05:38.340
uh,
in that fight we had a,
we had a few,
like kind of,

97
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.060
I don't want to say magical moments,
but say for instance,

98
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.210
we bring Mishka with us everywhere we go.
I'm dog,

99
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.250
our flight was delayed three hours,
four hours.
And when we landed,

100
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.660
we landed like a few hours after that truck drove through the park and killed

101
00:05:54.661 --> 00:05:56.910
all the people in New York,
which was right by our,

102
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.180
which if we would've been there on time,

103
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.510
we would've feel assigned the pollsters and then been outside of the park

104
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.960
walking Misha.
So I mean,
just little things like,
like that,

105
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:10.430
like we would have been outside maybe at that spot and had been witnessed to

106
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.220
that.
Right.

107
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.490
<v 1>Thank you.
Would have heard it or something and that would affected me,
you know,</v>

108
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.380
and um,
eh,
the Antifa March.
Yeah.
And there is just all this stuff about,
you know,

109
00:06:19.381 --> 00:06:22.350
like people are going to be protesting and stuff like that and they even like

110
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.800
the day of the fight and I just get a lot of anxiety over that stuff.

111
00:06:25.801 --> 00:06:29.140
I get anxiety over like big crowds of people and it's like,
you know,

112
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.060
just feel like crazy.
Yeah.
Um,
you know,
and it's,
uh,

113
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.430
yeah.
I just,
I wasn't even just thinking about the fight when you,
Ana,

114
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.880
it was more than that,
you know,
it was like what,
uh,

115
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.200
what all her energy re represented to me like all my past,
like,
um,

116
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.270
just negative people that,
you know,
uh,
you know,

117
00:06:48.271 --> 00:06:51.780
want to want to strike fear into your heart,
you know?
And um,

118
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.570
I wasn't gonna let that happen even though I was scared,
but you know,
I just,
uh,

119
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.870
I wasn't going to stop doing what I was doing just because of that.

120
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.260
<v 0>Well you were eagerly focused like one time she stuck her fist in your face and</v>

121
00:07:02.261 --> 00:07:03.670
touch your face.
You didn't even move.

122
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.140
<v 1>Yeah.
Cause I know she needed a reaction from me.
You know,
it's just like,
um,</v>

123
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.580
it's just like with anybody,
you know,

124
00:07:09.581 --> 00:07:14.230
so you don't give energy to something negative.
You don't feed the fire,
you know?

125
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.440
<v 0>Yeah.
That's gotta be a mind fuck for her though.
Right.</v>

126
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.790
[inaudible] used to people reacting to her and headbutting bet,
you know,

127
00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:24.930
going head to head with her trying to show her and you just stay calm.

128
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.420
<v 1>Yeah.
Cause I mean,
you know,
it's,
it's uh,</v>

129
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.710
either you really,
Eh,
I mean it's either one or two things.

130
00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:37.160
Either you really disliked me enough to like,
you know,

131
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.370
put your hands on me outside of the competition or his fight,
you know,

132
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:43.700
or it's a character or are you just doing this for show?
Right.
You know,

133
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:46.700
it's either one of the two and I just don't think she's really a bad person.

134
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.310
I just think that,
you know,
she's put in this position and maybe she,
you know,

135
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.500
that's what she felt like she had to do.

136
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.000
<v 0>Why I wrote something about the Volk on owes the Mirror Daniel Cormier fight the</v>

137
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.600
other day that what owes Tamir was trying to do and what me was trying to do.

138
00:07:59.601 --> 00:08:03.230
It's like they're trying to sow seeds of doubt that you're trying to,

139
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.460
there's a real issue with someone that's about to fight where you're about to

140
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:10.190
compete and it's this crazy nerve wracking thing.

141
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:12.710
And the unknown is always there.
You don't know what's going to happen,
right.

142
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.710
So someone can convince you,
I'm going to fuck you up.
You're like,

143
00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:18.680
God damn is he gonna fuck me up.
Like you really start thinking it if you,

144
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.630
if it's in your head.
And that,

145
00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:23.270
one of the things that Daniel said in that fight was that there's,

146
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.680
there's levels to this thing.
Like,

147
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:27.800
you think you're going to come in and fuck me up with this.
He's like this,

148
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.130
he's not you.
You're not,
you haven't experienced this yet.

149
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:35.650
<v 1>Right.
And as it's something that I,
you know,
I,
I,
uh,</v>

150
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.450
Avalara's by for you want to sell,
you know,

151
00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:41.350
and I think it's great that I was putting this position to face her because I

152
00:08:41.351 --> 00:08:42.880
had to get better and are like,

153
00:08:42.881 --> 00:08:46.030
I had to get up to that level in order to face her.

154
00:08:46.031 --> 00:08:50.980
And I had to do a lot of research and,
uh,
work on my mental stability.

155
00:08:50.981 --> 00:08:53.930
I mean,
she kept saying I was mentally unstable,
like,
and those,
you know,

156
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.360
phone calls and stuff,
the conference calls beforehand and I was like,
okay,

157
00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.080
you were mentally unstable.
What was the cause?
Rose's mentally unstable?
Yeah.
Oh,

158
00:09:03.081 --> 00:09:07.910
my dad,
my dad was,
was correct.
Like in what way?
Uh,
I mean,

159
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:13.280
well,
I don't know.
To me,
I can't speak for myself,
but like,
uh,
it's just,
uh,

160
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.930
please do,
you know,
sorry.
You could go it.
Okay.

161
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.620
<v 0>It's like everyone getting ready for a fight.
It's,
it's,
um,</v>

162
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.100
there are some people who can be excited about the fight the entire time and

163
00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:28.950
they don't give a shit about anything and they just need you to do.
I love it.

164
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.750
And then there's also the ones who,

165
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.210
who get ready for a fight and while getting ready for the fight,

166
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.470
it's nerve wracking.
And especially with all of the Boogie woman and all the,

167
00:09:37.471 --> 00:09:38.910
you're mentally unstable.

168
00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:42.630
And then in the history with her dad and her history growing up and just all of

169
00:09:42.631 --> 00:09:46.350
those things coming to a head,
this was exactly what rose wanted it to be.

170
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.380
The scariest possible situation for her to be in New York with the end,

171
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.590
with the Antifa march that happened in front of the hotel the morning of we bet

172
00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:57.330
we almost didn't make it to the fight.

173
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.140
<v 1>I Dunno man.
It's like somebody asked me like,</v>

174
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:03.870
what's different since you've been champ?
And I'm like,
really?

175
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:06.330
I'm just sitting here trying to figure out what's different.
You know,

176
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:08.730
like obviously you're sitting here talking to you like that's cool,

177
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.900
but I'm talk to you before.
Yeah.

178
00:10:10.901 --> 00:10:15.560
I mean you talk to you now that this crazy thing happened.
Right,
right.

179
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:20.300
Um,
so yeah,
I mean things are different,
you know,
like I definitely notice more,

180
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.270
more people,
uh,
recognizing me.

181
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.930
We have a very unique look to with your shaved head.
Yeah.

182
00:10:25.931 --> 00:10:29.920
I can't hide or you don't have to wear a used to go to the movies.
Right,
right,

183
00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:30.760
right.
Yeah.

184
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:35.670
<v 0>And you guys are going to fight again in April.
Back in New York.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

185
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:39.080
That'd be cool though.
Eyebrows come to Brooklyn.
This is coming to Brooklyn.

186
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:43.010
When you,
when the fight was over,
what did you,
what did you take some time off?

187
00:10:43.011 --> 00:10:45.460
Like,
how did you,
did it?
Did it even sink in?

188
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.810
<v 1>Like how do we had to go?</v>

189
00:10:46.811 --> 00:10:50.860
We had to get fuck out of their way or they go home like,
um,
like all of this.

190
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:55.260
So like the,
you know,
the,
the truck accident and like the protests and all this,

191
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:58.950
you know,
paranoid that I had,
I had to um,
hideaway,
I'm,
I'm a hermit,

192
00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:03.130
so like I like to like to be,
we went home,
he went straight to the airport.

193
00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.280
Two 30,
two 30 in the morning flight wasn't until 9:00 AM

194
00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.770
there was gonna be a marathon.
Right?
Yeah.
The next day.

195
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.240
<v 0>Yeah,
we heard there's going to be a marathon,</v>

196
00:11:12.241 --> 00:11:15.990
but also rose did what she did and as soon as it happened we all went,
oh fuck.

197
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.740
<v 1>Oh.
I like,
I robbed a bank.
Like,
oh,
like</v>

198
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.140
everybody be cool.
Just keep smiling.
Wow.
Yeah.
That was it.

199
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.050
I mean obviously I knew that was going to happen.
Um,

200
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.940
I actually envisioned me knocking her out with like a Burka and the third round

201
00:11:33.941 --> 00:11:37.210
cause I thought she's going to be like overly aggressive after a certain point

202
00:11:37.211 --> 00:11:41.440
that she would get frustrated.
That didn't happen cause it,
you know,
uh,

203
00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.260
she thought I was throwing a jab but yeah.

204
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.390
<v 0>Why do you think that,
I mean when you went into that fight,</v>

205
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.400
she was such an overwhelming favorite.

206
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.760
She was thought of as being one of the pound for pound top fighters in any way

207
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:57.490
class.
And why did you think that you're going to knock her out?

208
00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.260
<v 1>Because everybody tries to take her down.</v>

209
00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:04.400
Everybody so desperate for the take down that it's like her striking,

210
00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.410
I mean this from what I see is,

211
00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:10.760
I mean I sit across from volunteering shut Chanko and like we go like back and

212
00:12:10.761 --> 00:12:13.010
forth.
Like it's not a thing to me.
Like I got Pat Barry,

213
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:14.330
pat you bury in my corner.

214
00:12:14.331 --> 00:12:17.660
I got Trevor Whitman and my corner and I had done taekwondo,

215
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.370
a striking like my whole life.

216
00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:22.460
Like it's not something that I've never seen before.
Right.
You know,

217
00:12:22.461 --> 00:12:25.790
and just that Dutch style,
like kickboxing,
like it's great.
It's hard.

218
00:12:25.791 --> 00:12:30.290
It's very intimidating to send across from,
but you can,
you know,

219
00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:35.050
it's very rhythmic on the beat.
Like it's not,
I don't know,
it's,

220
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:40.070
it's just something that it looks scary but it's not to be scared of,
you know,

221
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.470
<v 0>that's interesting to where you're putting it because most people thought of her</v>

222
00:12:44.471 --> 00:12:49.360
as being like this very solid.
Her fundamentals are rock solid.

223
00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:53.030
She's incredibly technical.
Yeah.
Vicious Jab.
Yeah.
You know,

224
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.290
but you just saw that the rhythm was predictable.
I mean we,

225
00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.500
we knew everything she was going to do before she did it,

226
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:04.590
<v 1>watching it for a long time.
Right.
You know,
like,
and she is the,
the like,</v>

227
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.330
I mean she has the most dominant female.

228
00:13:06.331 --> 00:13:08.820
Like these girls could not hang with her,
you know,

229
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.210
and she's still the best out there,
you know,

230
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.970
<v 0>been on the radar since she'd be Carla.</v>

231
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.420
Like we knew that that was the fight as soon as she'd be calling.

232
00:13:17.421 --> 00:13:20.400
And it was just a matter of how are we going to get there?
Like,

233
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.170
what route are we going to take to get there?

234
00:13:22.171 --> 00:13:26.970
And so when the fight came around a big,
a big,
this whole,

235
00:13:26.971 --> 00:13:29.730
this entire training camp was mental.
It wasn't physical.

236
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.330
The whole training camp every day was mental mentality,
mind,
mental,

237
00:13:33.331 --> 00:13:36.420
mental strength,
just mental,
mental,
mental,
the entire training camp.

238
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:41.580
And one of the keys to the fight was knowing what she's going to do before she

239
00:13:41.581 --> 00:13:44.400
does it.
And I mean,
not just in the fight but in the interviews,

240
00:13:44.401 --> 00:13:47.520
in the press conference,
backstage,
backstage,
like we,
we,

241
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.810
we knew everything that was going to happen and it all happened exactly the way

242
00:13:51.811 --> 00:13:54.810
we knew it was going to.
Wow.
Yeah.
We were there.
This was,

243
00:13:54.811 --> 00:13:58.740
this was an excellent dissection of a person of an athlete.

244
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.760
Now what is the feeling like having gone through that,
having accomplished it,

245
00:14:02.761 --> 00:14:05.320
having literally blown it out of the water,
right?
Yeah.

246
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.080
You smashed in the first round.
Crazy moment.
Yeah.
Now you got to do it again.

247
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:14.630
<v 1>I know.
Yeah.
That was the tough part.
What's the,
what's the thought process?</v>

248
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.590
Um,
you know,
just,
uh,
you can't make the,
uh,

249
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.500
what is this thing of Haley said?
I don't know.
I'm gonna mess it up,

250
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.470
but she can't paint the model.
It's a twice,
you know,
like,

251
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.910
so it can't be the same approach.
You know,
it has to be something different.

252
00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:33.380
It has to be.
Um,
but you know,
at the same time,
and if any broke,

253
00:14:33.381 --> 00:14:36.740
don't fix it either.
So like,
uh,
it's gotta be a combination of like,
yeah,

254
00:14:36.741 --> 00:14:38.810
we're going to keep doing what we're doing,
but,
you know,

255
00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:42.100
keep getting better obviously all the time.
I mean,
it sounds a little center

256
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.390
<v 0>on cliche.
We don't prepare for one in particular person.</v>

257
00:14:45.391 --> 00:14:49.170
It's always were roses on the road to getting her black belt.

258
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:53.090
And that's what the,
that's what the mission is.
I mean,
of course,
uh,
we,

259
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:55.670
we do get into particulars based on who it is,

260
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.890
but that's only for a very short period of time.

261
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.600
The whole goal is just to make Rose A.
Black belt in every,
in grappling,

262
00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:03.690
wrestling,
striking,

263
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.970
<v 1>like just interviews,</v>

264
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:09.160
<v 0>everything.
Just,
just become a black belt,
become a master of all of it.</v>

265
00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.490
And that's been,
that's been the

266
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.320
<v 1>Golson like even,
um,
another,</v>

267
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.640
like he was saying the mentality of this last training camp.

268
00:15:14.641 --> 00:15:19.320
It wasn't just like a,
you know,
okay,
I'm going to,
I'm in a journal,
which I do,

269
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.450
you know,
during all that are all like,
you know,

270
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.940
like we talked about just doing like a float tank or something like that.

271
00:15:23.941 --> 00:15:28.590
Like those little mental exercises are great,
but also like,
um,
uh,

272
00:15:28.591 --> 00:15:29.760
working on creativity.
What's up?

273
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.250
<v 0>I was about to say,
I just,
I was just doing the number of ice baths she took.</v>

274
00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:38.100
<v 1>Oh yeah.
I did a lot eyes mass.
I said,
yeah.
Oh yeah.
The last one was the worst,</v>

275
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.470
the last every day.

276
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:44.190
<v 0>But like every day to a point where it actually became challenging for me to get</v>

277
00:15:44.191 --> 00:15:46.410
the water colder cause I was like,
this is ridiculous.

278
00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.120
How should you get in and within,

279
00:15:48.121 --> 00:15:51.450
under now it's gotten to a point now it had been under 25 seconds.
Like the,

280
00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:55.420
you know,
when you first get it right,
like it's under 20 seconds,

281
00:15:55.421 --> 00:15:58.140
120 seconds and she's just stone faced.
It's just amazing.

282
00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.700
<v 1>Yeah.
The last one that I did,
like it was hurting so bad.
I was like crying.</v>

283
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.450
Like I never had either the,
where I start crying and like,
cause it hurts a bit.

284
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.890
But anyway,
like,
yeah.
So that,
and then on a lot of benefit from that.

285
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:15.510
Yeah.
I do like,
I mean the,
yeah.

286
00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:20.040
Reduction of inflammation.
Yeah.
And then just like mentally,
mentally,

287
00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:24.540
and emotionally too,
right.
Um,
no,
cause it's like,
why is this so scary?

288
00:16:24.541 --> 00:16:27.870
But it hurts,
you know?
Um,
but it's,
it's good.
I mean,

289
00:16:27.871 --> 00:16:31.650
if you can get in the cold ice baths and nobody's in across music and scare you,

290
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.640
it's less scary than the cold.
But,
uh,

291
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:45.730
<v 2>[inaudible]
okay.</v>
