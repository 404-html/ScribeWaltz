WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.910
And then what's Sean that's sugar.
Shauna's as but it's way more than that.

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.870
He makes more than that.

3
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.570
So what is fortnight you can somebody explain fort night to me?

4
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:10.290
I'm sorry I was still in far cry.
Five any third person shooter,

5
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:13.050
you're jumping around shooting.
Be Bold with third person shooters.

6
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.270
Like is it a story or is it just like you're,
you know,

7
00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:16.380
you got other people people up.

8
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:19.920
I think the story is really just drop it in to survive.
Oh,

9
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.310
there's no campaign mode or if there's cancer is,
but that's a separate,
yeah,

10
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.270
that's not what,
it's interesting to me about fortnight.
The graphics suck.

11
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.250
I don't want you and me,
that's a graphic style.
But those that,

12
00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:36.520
that it has to uh,
Xbox to,

13
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.720
somebody had a,
a,

14
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.590
an image and it was from 2007 it had said,
man,
look at this.

15
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:46.200
I wonder what video games are going to be looking like.

16
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.920
The graphics going to be looking like in 2018 and then it shows fortnight and

17
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:53.190
it's like,
this is like,
dude,
there's like,
they've turned the textures off.

18
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.120
They 100%.
You turn the textures off when you play online,

19
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.360
if you don't have a powerful enough computer,
sure you don't claiming.
Right.

20
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.030
So it doesn't make you streaming.
It doesn't make your video game.

21
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.500
Video card works so hard,

22
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.850
but also it makes it easier to recognize shapes because they're not as like that

23
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:10.140
was the thing that he did with quake.

24
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.590
They would completely turn the textures off when guys would be like playing in

25
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:18.090
high level matches and you would just deal with these flat walls and then the

26
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:20.720
object,
the person that you were fighting against wood,

27
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.500
they would stand out and start contrast.
Right,
right.
So you didn't have,
you know,

28
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.160
otherwise you'd be in this castle wall,

29
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:29.790
you'd have the incredible textures on the wall and you wouldn't be able to see

30
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:32.750
them as easily distracting.
That's what I think.

31
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.310
I think I love about video games too.
He's like,
you know the scenery.

32
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.190
Sometimes I just want to stop and be like,
that's it.

33
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.190
The right side has full graphics is not,

34
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:45.670
so it depends on what is reasonable.
I mean it still is a little bit,
you know,

35
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.510
that's not much different.
At all.
Yeah.

36
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.040
I mean sort of the left side is just dark.
There's grass.
Yeah.

37
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:57.270
Look at the graph building.
There's still some movement on the ground.

38
00:01:57.271 --> 00:02:00.960
It's not flat plain like it isn't quick.
Go to quake it play,

39
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.380
go to quake three,
no textures.

40
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.120
Make a video or a pull up a video of that and you'll see what I'm talking about.

41
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:14.010
What I'm talking about is like literal flat walls where people turned everything

42
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:17.100
off and it got to a point where they weren't allowing it and certain

43
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:20.790
competitions because it makes such a big difference because now you're just
like,

44
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:23.130
it's a target in front of a blank screen.

45
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.660
You can also replace all of the characters with a larger character like uh,

46
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.280
like say if you were playing,
I was like this girl,
so I get this one.

47
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.530
It's showing the mod in between.
Maybe I'm thinking,
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:41.770
I'm sorry.
I'm really quick.
Like I've heard of air you son of a pitch,

49
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.830
so no,
no.
Jamie pull,
pull up,
quake,
no textures,

50
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.600
pull up,
quake,
no textures and then you could watch what it looks like.

51
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:54.000
That is not,
no textures,
that that's different.

52
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:56.760
You could see the difference in the colors and things are moving.

53
00:02:56.761 --> 00:03:00.160
It's when they turn off all the,
you,

54
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.110
you get to see these flat well that's what it looks like.
Seat.
Yeah.

55
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.630
Now that is a way different experience.
Yeah.

56
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.780
It would be much easier to get to see.
Right.
You can't shut those still exist,

57
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.560
but all the textures are gone.
Yeah.
And if you show a video that,

58
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.180
see if you could find a video of that Jamie,
when,
uh,

59
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.830
in the videos you see things moving around with no textures and you realize what

60
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:23.830
an advantage it would be if you were playing someone who's,
you're,

61
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.200
you're constantly dealing with all this visual input.

62
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.620
You have all this different shit.
High visibility.

63
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.910
It's hard to find out who is this,
which games this quake live.
Oh,
okay.

64
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:36.970
This is again,
I still got to ask what is quick.
I mean,
I know I've heard of it,

65
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:37.721
but I've never played it.

66
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:41.320
Like it's the ultimate first person shooter and it's the original one.

67
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.760
It was originally quake one and well there was doom but it was doom.

68
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:48.550
I've heard of like I've even their they days we did doom didn't pay.

69
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:51.070
They came out with another,
didn't they come out with another version of Dune?

70
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.120
Yes they did.
And there's another one that's coming out soon.
Um,

71
00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.150
but what quake one was was these cool maps and you would run around and shoot

72
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:02.350
each other and you'd have these death matches.

73
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:05.260
So one on one death matches and shoot rockets at each other and shit.

74
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.070
And you're seeing it through your perspective.
Like,

75
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:10.250
so if you have a rocket launch,

76
00:04:10.251 --> 00:04:13.660
you see the rocket launcher in front of you there at that whole idea.

77
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.680
What does this one,
oh,
this is quake champions.
This is the newest version.

78
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:21.100
I mean the graphics are fucking incredible on these things now they,

79
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.270
they're so excited.
We're going to have,
we're setting up a lamb here,

80
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.500
a local area network here.
What we're going to stream,
live and play each other.

81
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.650
Excellent.
And a waste massive amounts of time.

82
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.820
And I'm sure I'm going to Yell Dad.
Sometimes I'm sorta like,
oh,

83
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.930
three hours just went by.
He's going to go to sleep a little bit.
Oh,

84
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.030
well whatever,
dude,
it will suck up your time,
but then you know I can't play.

85
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:43.511
I'm just,

86
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:46.540
I'm not good enough to play those kinds of things like it's just like spawn,
die,

87
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:49.960
spawn guy you to figure out how to do it.
You're a smart guy.

88
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:52.880
How dare you say that?
You put the limitations.

89
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.200
We can't do that.
Listen,

90
00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.270
we just need to learn left w a s d learn how to move your fingers around now I

91
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.960
need the soles are bullshit.

92
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.500
I got some people say it can't get any real accuracy with a console.

93
00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:11.770
That's your problem.
The finger,
the type,
I mean the console.

94
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:15.370
Now I'm thinking I could send it to you.
How do you learn physics?
How do you,

95
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:19.750
what is that?
All this fucking
movie.
We were like,

96
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:22.580
you can do it man,
you can.
It's like rocky or something that's ready.

97
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.260
Karate kid or whatever.
How ever done that for video games,

98
00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:27.620
who'd never been that movie where he still is?

99
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.360
Someone teaches someone how to play a video game nerd in the beginning and he's

100
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:33.910
like a loser,
but you know,
it comes back and he gets the girl.
Well,

101
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:36.880
one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to you about this in particular is

102
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:41.881
because I am more and more convinced that it's our future may lie in some

103
00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:47.461
artificially created world and that people are more interested in more attracted

104
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:53.590
everyday to virtual reality,
augmented reality,
virtual reality.

105
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:58.280
And what can Jamie,
what was that game?
That one game where,
um,
there was,
uh,

106
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.700
the,
it created worlds.
I was going to pull that up earlier and ask,

107
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:04.230
it's called no man's sky.
Oh,
I played that.
I played the,

108
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.460
I bought it because of course any space game.
I'm like whoring though.

109
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.540
It is because you know,
they have 80 trillion worlds,
but they're all,

110
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.160
they're basically,
they don't look that different,
you know,
so it's like oatmeal,

111
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:17.600
80 million bottles and over there you could go there and people are shooting

112
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:22.070
each other and stealing money.
No,
no.
What is better for that?
Oh yeah.
Right.

113
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:23.510
I mean it's,
you know,
it looked like it was people,

114
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:26.000
but what's better is I'm elite,
dangerous.

115
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.900
So after this I was so disappointed in this,
uh,

116
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.980
I went back and I found a leap dangerous,

117
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:33.580
which actually just disappointing this cause there was no action.
Yeah,

118
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.500
there was no,
you just ran around in your mind stuff.
It was sorta like,

119
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.460
it just wasn't exciting.
There was nothing exciting.
There was no,
you know,

120
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:41.600
there was no,
so I,
like I said,

121
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:44.840
I don't usually play sort of these massive multiplayer games.
So this is elite,

122
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:48.140
dangerous,
elite,
dangerous end.
It is man the trading or you know,

123
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:51.440
you could decide like,
oh,
I want to be a,
I want to be a bounty hunter,
you know?

124
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.040
Um,
and it was so rich.
I just,
I spent,

125
00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:57.050
there was like a good six months in my life that I was like,
you know,

126
00:06:57.051 --> 00:06:59.510
working my way,
getting better ships.
That became,
because you're like,

127
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.700
who doesn't want to be a bounty hunter?
Right.
You know what I'm saying?
Like,

128
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:04.790
that's what everybody's,
and this just this game had,
you know,
and there's like,

129
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.620
I don't know,
a few hundred thousand people in there.

130
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.330
You're creating the universe.
It's evolving.
They add storylines.
So,
you know,

131
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.980
well we are setting up an HTC vive here and uh,
we're,
we,

132
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.760
Jamie was HTC vibe.
How dare you.
I know,
man.
It's like,
you know,

133
00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:23.890
that's a copy yourself dork you call your [inaudible].

134
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.890
Um,
they never not have sex.
Virtual reality.
It's,

135
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.550
and it's a consumer virtual reality.
When my friends never done,

136
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.310
Ooh boy.
I know.
I've been waiting.
I've been sort of,
well we tried to get one.

137
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.640
Jamie went out yesterday and look,
they're all sold out.

138
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:42.600
So we had to order one and so we're ordering one,

139
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.760
we're going to have it set up in here.
Um,
and the,
uh,

140
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.510
the games I played the games of two years ago and I'm sure they're way more

141
00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:54.140
advanced than they are now.
There's a crazy archery game where the,

142
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:57.860
you're on a top of a castle and these little monsters that look like they could

143
00:07:57.861 --> 00:08:01.370
be in south park,
they're not like detailed kind of cool.

144
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:03.380
Look and monsters and you shoot out on with bows and arrows,

145
00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:05.630
they're trying to invade the castle.
But man,

146
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:09.170
it's addictive because you really look down,
you see them all around you.

147
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.130
You have like a real,
so it was just that my always been my question about like,

148
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:17.660
you know,
I sit on my chair and I play my video game.
So like our,
yes,
this is it.

149
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:20.960
See this guy has a thing in his hands and he's moving around.

150
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:24.910
This is like a star wars one and there's a bunch of different ones that I've see

151
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.470
always gotta be standing right in some sense.
Yes,

152
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.680
you want to just like sit down with a borrower and like in a can,

153
00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:34.910
but there's also a boxing one that you get a real workout in.
So it's a game.

154
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.870
And uh,
I played it over Duncan's house.
We think there's a video of it,
but it's,

155
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.500
it's weird because you punch wrong.
So like,
um,

156
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.080
like if I'm holding my hands like this,
which is,

157
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:48.950
I'm holding my hands vertically where my thumbs are up,
right.

158
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.040
The boxing gloves would be horizontal.

159
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.720
Like they would be if you were punching someone.
So,
so it doesn't do the turn.
No,

160
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.640
it's weird.
So as you move your hands forward like this,

161
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:03.780
which you really wouldn't punch like that,
then the punches come out.

162
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:04.970
So they've got to iron that out.

163
00:09:04.971 --> 00:09:08.160
I was going to say that'll be something that'll work out.
Yeah.
And make the,
the,

164
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:11.940
the controller rotate the way a fist would.
But as you're doing it,

165
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:15.000
you throw real punches and someone's throwing punches at you and when they throw

166
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:17.850
punches at you and they hit you,
you see a white flash in front of the youth.

167
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:22.270
That's good.
Makes you nervous.
Just like real sparring does what the,
you know,

168
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:22.441
I mean,

169
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:25.170
so like this question of like what are we going to do with virtual reality?

170
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:27.450
Cause like I said,
you know,
I already,
you know,

171
00:09:27.451 --> 00:09:31.830
I see huge potential for like education in gaming and that's why we built our

172
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:35.070
game.
Yeah.
Here's,
this is me over Duncan's house.

173
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.550
Just want anybody to walk by.
You know,
I got to go get a beer.
Bam.

174
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:43.450
I'm beating this guy up,
moving around them.
See that's the thing.
I always wonder,

175
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.840
that guy was fucking Duggin up every day.
It's like,
dude,
how'd you be it?

176
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.050
I was like,
move around.
Don't stand right in front of the rope.

177
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.530
The rope a dope.
Well,
you gotta,
you gotta have footwork and movement,
but you,

178
00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.530
you can really get a workout with that.
I'm not joking.

179
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.010
You get exhausted and you know,
you,

180
00:10:04.011 --> 00:10:08.450
you keep going and fight tougher and tougher opponents.
Well,
you know,
that's it.

181
00:10:08.451 --> 00:10:10.320
And that's the quite,
you know,
so like talk about haptic suits,

182
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:12.870
like where eventually you know you're going to wear things.
I didn't see the,

183
00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:17.040
I read the book but didn't see the,
what was it?
The movie that just ready,
set,

184
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.680
ready.
Player one I didn't see,
I didn't see you.
Have you read the book?

185
00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:21.780
The book's really good because the book is like full immersion.

186
00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:24.730
Like the whole book is about like when virtual reality is,
it.
