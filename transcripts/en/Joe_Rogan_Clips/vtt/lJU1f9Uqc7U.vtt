1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.280
These are serious,
like when you think about this,

2
00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:06.150
like you probably shouldn't smoke too many of these because it's just plain

3
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:10.500
tobacco.
I love,
I love him.
Now I got to the point where I couldn't smoke joints.

4
00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:15.300
I couldn't smoke out of a bong a pipe.
It had to be a backward,
that's where I am.

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.800
Yeah,
fine.
I love it.
I like him.
Did you ever smoke cigarettes?
No.
See I did.

6
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:22.920
I smoked a lot of cigarettes and then I quit smoking cigarettes.

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.670
Just smoked weed and then I discovered backwards and I was kinda getting a

8
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:30.870
little bit of both.
No,
still getting it tobacco that I missed.
Um,

9
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.370
but yeah.
Yeah.

10
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:36.940
My friend Ari said that he started smoking spliffs in England,
you know,

11
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.570
and when he was over in the UK,
the next,

12
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:43.320
the weed with the tobacco and he got totally hooked on tobacco again cause he

13
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:47.290
had quit cigarettes for years and then he started smoking the weed mixed with

14
00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:50.400
the tobacco.
And before he knew it he was smoking cigarettes again.
Yeah.

15
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.970
So he smoked while he was over there and then he quit as soon as he was done.

16
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:57.420
And then came back to you.
US.
Yeah.
I feel like they just started smoking.

17
00:00:57.421 --> 00:01:01.920
Just pure weed over there,
Jeff,
for years.
For years.
It was both.
Yeah.

18
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:05.910
I don't understand that.
I kind of that,
how'd that work out over there?
Yeah.

19
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.750
I don't know.
So illegal over there too.
It's like Jesus fucking Christ.

20
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:13.860
It's 2019 fellas.
Scary at times when I used to fly over there,

21
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:17.970
we'd have to tape tons of weed to our nuts just,
just to be able to,

22
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.480
and our road cases just so we could smoke over there cause they had dirt,
weed,

23
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.170
you know,
it was horrible.
We'd,
but yeah,
it was a pain in the ass.

24
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:29.070
It's fucking dangerous bringing that stuff overseas though.
If you get arrested,

25
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:33.270
that's,
that's serious.
Yeah.
I brought it aside.
Bring it everywhere like that.

26
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:38.040
And we went to Iran tape,
uh,
like gaff tape,
which is Jesus,

27
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:38.874
man.

28
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.290
I feel like you teared up the first layer of your nuts off when you go to grab

29
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:47.190
your weed.
But yeah,
we would do that.
And then,
uh,
it's a commitment though.
Yeah,

30
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:50.730
I actually brought it,
I made the big mistake of not bringing a bunch,

31
00:01:50.731 --> 00:01:55.440
but I got to Iraq,
we went to Iraq for like right when the war broke out.

32
00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:59.580
What was it like 2003 or 2004 and we were over there and,

33
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.880
and a scandalous Esteban oil,
the photographer,

34
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:06.480
he's over there with us documenting the whole thing and I pull it out cause

35
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:08.580
we're at this,
this airport and ball rain,

36
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.570
but I feel like it's a field and no one's gonna mess with us.
And he's like,

37
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.240
hey bro,
look,
look at,
look at the back of your fucking passport.

38
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:18.480
Look what it says.
And it says right there,
like you're basically like,

39
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.810
they'll kill you if they,
if they find,
you know,

40
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:25.560
you brought any drugs and die Iraq or you know,
where we were a ball rain.

41
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.770
So I did away with everything and I just kind of took up drinking.

42
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.140
And I'm not really much of a drinker,
but do you still smoke weed?

43
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.730
I don't know.

44
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.780
I have a friend who's like a dear friend is like a cool like young doctor named

45
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:44.250
Doctor [inaudible] in San Diego and I called them.
He actually removed my,

46
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.970
my tonsils and then like a week later I found out I had what was called

47
00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:52.210
precancer Barrett's esophagus.
I said,
what does this mean Dr. Beach?

48
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.680
I just like Kinda like Kinda like tone down like how much I'm smoking.

49
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:58.410
And he's like,
no,
this means like this is your warning shot.

50
00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:01.810
Like pay attention,
stop smoking.

51
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.470
<v 1>Cancer is a rough one too.
That's what killed Christopher Hitchens.
Really?
Yeah.</v>

52
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.680
Yeah.
That's a,
that's a rough one.
That kills a lot of fucking people.

53
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.100
Once you get it,
you get it and you're gone.
Basically.
It's cute.

54
00:03:14.101 --> 00:03:18.870
I think kills like think hitch said like 95% of the people didn't get it.
Yeah.

55
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.880
<v 0>Yeah.
So I felt like he,
he's always pretty honest with me and I,
I just stopped.</v>

56
00:03:23.881 --> 00:03:27.300
Like I love CVD.
Yeah.
That's pretty much what I messed with it now,

57
00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:28.650
but that's all.

58
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.250
<v 1>Do you find that a lot of people use CBD and they find that it alleviates</v>

59
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:35.920
anxiety and let them sleep better?
Do you find that?

60
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.161
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

61
00:03:37.161 --> 00:03:40.520
as long as I take like triple or quadruple the amount that it says to take on

62
00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:45.020
the bottle because I feel like would I take,
if I take what the proper dosages,

63
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.430
it doesn't do much,

64
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.630
but I'm one of those people whose minds racing constantly.

65
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.790
I'll get home from the studio at one or two and I'm just like kind of like

66
00:03:55.791 --> 00:03:58.820
figuring out how long I got to sleep before I get to wake up my kids and go to

67
00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:03.020
school.
And I just sat there with my wheel spinning unless I use CBD.

68
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.900
And then that kind of helps.
And then I had,

69
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.680
I have what's called trigeminal neuralgia.
Have you ever heard of that?
No.
Oh,

70
00:04:09.681 --> 00:04:10.640
it's the fucking worst.

71
00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:14.510
It's called the suicide disease because basically all of your nerves in your

72
00:04:14.511 --> 00:04:17.000
face or firing all at the same time.

73
00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:20.780
So it almost feels like what you feel when you think you need a root canal or

74
00:04:20.781 --> 00:04:22.280
you have like a tooth that's messed up.

75
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.960
But I got trigeminal Neuralgia and I've only had four episodes.

76
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.550
But when I do get it,
I use CBD and it,
it's been amazing.

77
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.180
But if you look it up,
a lot of people go actually go to a dentist,

78
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.310
get a bunch of root canals done that they don't need or they don't know how to

79
00:04:40.311 --> 00:04:44.030
treat it.
And usually people kill themselves.
Whoa.
Yeah,

80
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.730
it's nor that didn't really know about it.
I just was home one day.
I was like,

81
00:04:46.731 --> 00:04:49.730
what the fuck?
Like my face is burning.

82
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.533
It's misery

83
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.630
<v 1>pink condition that affects the trigeminal nerve,</v>

84
00:04:56.631 --> 00:05:00.500
which carries a sensation for your face to your brain if you have trigeminal

85
00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:02.660
Neuralgia,
even mild stimulation of your face,

86
00:05:02.661 --> 00:05:06.380
such as from brushing your teeth or putting on makeup may trigger a jolt of

87
00:05:06.381 --> 00:05:10.640
excruciating pain.
Holy Shit Man.
Yeah.
What,
what is the cause?

88
00:05:10.641 --> 00:05:11.480
What causes that?

89
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.860
<v 0>All different things.
They thought like mine,</v>

90
00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:18.861
I maybe got mine from impact like from my accident and then maybe little

91
00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:23.670
sparring that I've done has,
has triggered it.
Um,
also dental,

92
00:05:23.671 --> 00:05:28.500
when I get dental work done,
it triggers it.
So,
but the CBD stops it.

93
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.040
Yeah.
CBD in it.
If it's really bad,
there's,
um,

94
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.940
this medication called Gabapentin.
Uh,

95
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.860
and I feel like that's been a real great way to kind of like mass the pain and

96
00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:45.480
one,
once the Gabapentin calms the nerve kind of Dad's the nerve,
24,

97
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:49.860
48 hours,
it's gone.
If it's a really bad episode of it's not so bad,

98
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.540
CBD just keeps it away.
