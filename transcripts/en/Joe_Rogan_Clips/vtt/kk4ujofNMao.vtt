1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.860
Quantum physics doesn't make sense to me.
Well,
I've tried.
Tried really hard.

2
00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:08.010
It makes about the same senses.
That definition you were just reading Spanish.

3
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.731
Exactly.

4
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:12.210
I'll go over it and over it again and get little chunks of it and that would

5
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:15.850
understand like sections of sentences.
Right,

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.420
and then it would have to try to put them together with the other sections.

7
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.200
It's hard.
It's tough stuff,
but one of the most important things,

8
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:24.840
I think it was the old war who said this,
I'm not quite sure,

9
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.640
but one of the members of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics said

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.620
that basically a particle exists in many states simultaneously and it's not

11
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:37.110
until it's measured that a collapses into one stage.

12
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.370
That's one of the basic principles of quantum physics.
Well guess what,
Niels,

13
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.240
every particle is being measured in some way all the time,

14
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.100
all of its life by other particles that are basically taking its measure and

15
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:53.670
then responding.
Essentially.
Nothing is isolated.

16
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.480
Nothing is isolated in this particular cosmos.
You were talking,

17
00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:01.290
I watched a video where you were talking about that there is essentially a

18
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:06.060
universal brain.
Well,
yes,
because you and I right now,

19
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.710
uh,
we're going to be talking to possibly out of your 500 words,

20
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.040
it's more like 1 million,
uh,

21
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.250
total viewers and listeners more than that.

22
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:19.440
So it's probably closer to three.
Yeah.

23
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:23.790
So we're going to be talking to let's say 100,000 of them or 200,000 of them.

24
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.140
Um,

25
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.430
and they're processing what we are saying right now there are bacteria in your

26
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:33.390
gut and mine who live in enormous colonies and enormous bacterial colony.

27
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:36.030
If you had it on the palm of your hand,
it would be the size of her hand,

28
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.320
but you couldn't see it.
Are you thinking of this while you're saying it,

29
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:42.960
are you thinking of that vast numbers of people that are listening and watching

30
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.230
or are you just relaying the information?
Like are you

31
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.360
cognizant?
Yup,
both.
Both.
Because I want,

32
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.680
remember Einstein gave me my marching orders,
right?

33
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.470
You have to take complex ideas and simplify them so much that anyone with a high

34
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:01.830
school education in a reasonable degree of on intelligence can understand them.

35
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.010
And I want to make good radio for your audience.
But once you,

36
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.580
what I'm trying to get at is once you have got an established in your head that

37
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:12.750
nothing is isolated,
that everything is connected.
When you speak,

38
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.430
are you aware when you're speaking that everything is connected?
I mean,
are you,

39
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.610
are you actually consciously thinking of all of these different minds taking

40
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:26.730
into account all these different mind blowing things that you're saying and then

41
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:31.530
applying them out in the world?
I think so.
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,

42
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:34.920
if you hear it coming out of my mouth,
that's what's churning around in my brain.

43
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.050
I'm just,
you're,
you're such a bright guy.

44
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:40.860
I'm just trying to understand if you are in the moment or if you're in the

45
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:45.810
moment,
as well as being consciously aware of the spread of information.

46
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.610
My obligation is to do both simultaneously.
That's my obligation.

47
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:54.480
That's what I assumed.
Yeah.
So at any rate,
so the,

48
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.310
the entropic theory doesn't make any sense.
The,

49
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.470
I mean,
look there,
I wasn't a bad,
right,
right.

50
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.310
So you would think I'm totally isolate.
I'm not,
you're not.
I'm not.
I mean,

51
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.400
once upon a time I wrote an essay about Descartes.
Well,

52
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:13.510
Descartes came up with the idea of,
I think therefore I am.
Um,

53
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.270
he took a retreat in Amsterdam.

54
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.330
He rented a second floor apartment and he was trying to isolate himself the way

55
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:24.400
that those particles are isolated with the short ministers equation,

56
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:27.880
the particles that were being drawn on Napkins in Moscow.
Um,

57
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.360
and so that he could strip everything away and find out what was the most basic

58
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.200
thing,
the most basic axiom and the most basic thing we take for granted in life.

59
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.940
And he came up with,
I think therefore I am now.
Think about this for a minute.

60
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.000
While he was trying to think this out,

61
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.180
he was needing a rubbery gum eraser with which he erased is inc he was sitting

62
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:53.290
on the second floor,

63
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:56.470
which means somebody had invented the architecture that he was sitting in and

64
00:03:56.471 --> 00:04:00.550
the concept of the floor and the concept of beams that go across from one wall

65
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:02.500
to the other that were holding him up.

66
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.610
He was looking out the window and he was looking at the hats that the Amsterdam

67
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:09.070
men and women were wearing as they walked by.

68
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.700
And he was fucking the cleaning lady who he made pregnant.

69
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.010
So how isolated really was he

70
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.770
<v 1>the universal mind theory this or this concept shouldn't say theory.</v>

71
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.860
Um,
w the way you were describing it,

72
00:04:24.861 --> 00:04:29.861
it's very interesting that there is no individual thought that essentially

73
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.880
there's,
there's lots of individual thought.

74
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.650
It's all connected to all the other people that are around you and all the

75
00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:39.320
people that you've interacted with and all the places you've been and the things

76
00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:43.550
you've seen and all the people that are constantly thinking simultaneously

77
00:04:43.551 --> 00:04:44.440
around you that you're aware of

78
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.920
<v 0>and the people that you're trying to influence because you're trying to</v>

79
00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:48.660
influence people all day long,
right?

80
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.160
If you want somebody to bring you a sandwich,
you have to get across that.

81
00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:54.390
You want that sandwich.

82
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.470
And especially if you want somebody like a wife or an assistant to bring you a

83
00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:00.360
sandwich and that's not normally what they do,

84
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.020
then you really have to work hard and influence going.
But,
but the,

85
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.910
the universe,

86
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.470
at least the living part of the universe and so far we only know of life on this

87
00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:12.180
planet.
It's all interconnected.

88
00:05:12.181 --> 00:05:14.670
Those bacteria I was talking about there in your gut.

89
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.180
They are making your vitamin B,
they are making your vitamin K,

90
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.150
they are making an awful lot of the things that you use to survive.

91
00:05:21.151 --> 00:05:24.570
They're also making chemicals that influence your mind and your moods.

92
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.400
They're manipulating you.

93
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.760
So when you go down to the corner store to buy some chocolate eclairs and you go

94
00:05:33.721 --> 00:05:35.220
home and you eat them.
In fact,

95
00:05:35.221 --> 00:05:38.010
you can only digest a small portion of the chocolate ne Claire,

96
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.350
those bacterial colonies living in your gut.

97
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.660
They do the rest of that I adjusting for you.

98
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.320
So who's really going to the corner store?

99
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.380
Who's really the boss who's really driving you the vehicle of transportation?

100
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.770
Are these bacteria driving you down to the corner store so that you will feed

101
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:58.560
them the stuff that they love,
the or ours,

102
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.960
your will driving you to the corner store.
While the answer's a little of both,

103
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.000
a little of both.
Not as much of both.
I mean there,

104
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:09.380
there's this example of

105
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.270
there's this fungus and the fungus has a very peculiar lifestyle and I'm very

106
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:18.410
curious to find out how it got this lifestyle.

107
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.240
But it lives half of its life in an ant colony and half of its life and a sheep.

108
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.710
So when it comes out of the phase of that,

109
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:30.560
it goes through in the ant colony and is ready to go into the sheep,

110
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.890
it takes over the brain of an ant and it gets that ant to climb to the top of a

111
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:42.440
stalk of grass.
Why?
Because when the sheep come along to graze,

112
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.060
they will inhale the ant.
What you're telling me,

113
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.270
that a fungus can control the mind of an ant in ways that we're just beginning

114
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:56.500
to explore now this year and maybe last year,

115
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.470
a tiny little bit,

116
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.520
that it can actually be that precise in how it takes over the controls of this

117
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.010
site to one of those,
uh,

118
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.400
the fungus that gets inside those ants and the answer aware of it.

119
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:11.510
So they take the ant away because the aunt will explode and spray spores into

120
00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:14.810
the air and affect the infect call.
I'm not aware of that one,

121
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:19.570
but it sounds cordyceps.
Yeah.
Yeah,
but it,
but it sounds similar but,

122
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:21.860
but it's the real deal is okay.

123
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.450
Life on this earth functions the way that a beehive functions.

124
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.750
How does it be high functioning?

125
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:32.170
95% of the bees are conformist peas and they all go out to the hot flower patch

126
00:07:33.901 --> 00:07:38.660
of the day and they mine the nectar and they have a public stomach in which they

127
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:39.710
can carry this stuff.

128
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.750
I mean built into them inside of them and they have these caring hairs on their

129
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:47.450
thighs and they carry pollen in those.

130
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.760
And when they arrive at the unloading bay,

131
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.610
there is an unloading bay and the hive.

132
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.870
And when they arrive at the unloading bay,
if the unloaders no,

133
00:07:56.871 --> 00:08:01.871
that the interior really needs pollen and nectar and they see you carrying that

134
00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:02.751
pollen and nectar,

135
00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:06.050
they stick their tongues down your throat to check out what's in your public

136
00:08:06.051 --> 00:08:09.740
stomach.
They go wild with excitement.
When they discover it's filled with nectar,

137
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.570
they check out your thighs,
the caring hairs on your thighs.
They go wild.

138
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.790
When they see that you're carrying pawn,

139
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.920
they feel you all over with their antenna.

140
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:23.180
They are intensely excited when they are unloading you and that gets you
excited.

141
00:08:23.181 --> 00:08:27.000
You feel like a rockstar because this is the same kind of attention a rockstar

142
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.670
gets.
So you go back out to the flower patch of the day and mine some more.

143
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.950
Meanwhile,
there are these lazy good for nothing.
Bohemian bees.

144
00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:41.951
There are any way from 5% to 20% of the colony and they don't do a single useful

145
00:08:42.891 --> 00:08:45.350
thing at all.
And so far as you can see,

146
00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:48.650
they don't do anything to earn their keep in the colony.
Why?

147
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:53.860
Cause they're out doing loop after loop after loop and lazy eight after lazy

148
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.830
eights after lazy aid.
So they'll fly eight miles just following their whims,

149
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.730
following their whims.
I mean if you were their mother,
what would you say?

150
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.300
You're wasting your fucking life for God's sakes.
Okay.

151
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.010
Eventually you the conformist be start coming back without pollen.

152
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.270
And you're carrying Harris and without nectar and your public summer because the

153
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:18.450
flower patch,
that flower patch of the day has been thoroughly plundered.

154
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.680
And when you arrive at the unloading dock of the hive,

155
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:27.000
the unloading be stick their tongue into your public stomach empty.
Sorry.

156
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.070
They see you're carrying Harris empty.

157
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.510
They turned their backs on you so savagely that you feel as if you've been cut

158
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:35.340
dead and it finally,

159
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:39.360
I mean you can't believe that the old is not delivering anymore and it's not

160
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:40.230
giving you a paycheck.

161
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:44.160
So you keep going back to the same patch over and over again more slowly each

162
00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:48.480
time until finally you give up and you literally crawl into the hive.

163
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:54.150
And Thomas Sealy,
the guy who's done most of the research on this,

164
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:59.040
calls you an unemployed B and you are as depressed as if you were an employee.

165
00:09:59.070 --> 00:09:59.701
How do we know that?

166
00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:04.590
Because your body temperature is down and you're crawling instead of walking and

167
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:07.890
you're begging for food from other bees.
Well,

168
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:12.570
you look for something to perk you up.
Now what a humans use a football game.

169
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:17.790
A movie bees used pretty much the same thing.
What does that mean?

170
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.650
They go to the unloading dock out of the 200 lazy good for nothing.

171
00:10:22.651 --> 00:10:24.990
Bohemian be simply following their instincts.

172
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:30.590
Five have come back having found new flower patches and they are dancing and the

173
00:10:31.661 --> 00:10:35.880
dancing excites you and they're dancing in competition with each other.

174
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.980
Some will dance 27 seconds,

175
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:43.250
some will dance 27 minutes and if you find the dance of one of those dancers

176
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.560
sufficiently persuasive,
it lifts you out of your lethargy,

177
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.680
gets you excited and you fly out.

178
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.200
She's giving a little in a little figure eight dance.

179
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:56.100
She is giving precise instructions on how to get to the flower patch and what

180
00:10:56.101 --> 00:11:00.450
the headwinds are and what the tailwinds are and you pick up her message,

181
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.990
you fly out to the flower patch to that she has recommended and you check it out

182
00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:06.960
for yourself and if you get excited about it,

183
00:11:06.961 --> 00:11:11.640
you come back and you start dancing and ultimately the be who gets the greatest

184
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:15.960
number of backup dancers wins and you all go out,

185
00:11:15.961 --> 00:11:18.120
all you can form us.
Bees were now unemployed.

186
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.560
Go out to the new hot flower patch of the day and the same pattern repeats

187
00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:23.394
itself.

188
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.870
Now that's a collective mind operating on the basis of 20,000 independent bees

189
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:33.380
and the the living world operates and pretty much the same way bacteria are

190
00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:38.010
using you to get them truckload a Claris.

191
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:43.340
You are using them to digest chocolate eclairs they are teasing our scientists

192
00:11:44.701 --> 00:11:48.840
and to wild activity by threatening to develop illnesses that can bypass all of

193
00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:49.800
our antibiotics,

194
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:54.140
which by the way are chemical weapons that microorganisms,

195
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.990
colonies and microsomal organisms used to kill and tire competing colonies.

196
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.920
We stole him from microorganisms so we didn't,
didn't met them antibiotics.

197
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.130
So the scientists are very worth fact that the bees are,

198
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.290
that the bacteria are getting ahead of us in research and development and are

199
00:12:11.291 --> 00:12:14.230
beginning to develop techniques to get around all of our drugs.

200
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.210
So they are researching their ass off.

201
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:21.450
So is there any common brain that links the bacteria to the scientific

202
00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:23.320
community?

203
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.100
You bet they're competing with each other and in the process of competing with

204
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:28.390
each other,
what are they doing?

205
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.510
They are both creating new options for all of life.
