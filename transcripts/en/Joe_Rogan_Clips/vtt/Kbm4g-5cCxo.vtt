00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
By the way.
Did you buy seven Bentley's that were the same color?
No,

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.800
but I put him on seven Bentley's before.
Damn there rolls Royces.
I wanted to ask,

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.860
you did give away one when you crashed it,
right?
Yeah.

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.260
Um,
I was married at the time,

5
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.290
Robin givens and we were in fast food.
Jane,

6
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.930
we order food and she went in my pocket,

7
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.100
I guess to get some money out my pocket to pay for it.

8
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:30.480
And she's asking for from condoms came out and she was mad.

9
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:33.330
So she got in a car and then boom,

10
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:38.331
she crashed the car into another car that was parked here.

11
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.240
Boom.

12
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.680
And she hit somebody and she hurt their arm and then the cops came.

13
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.360
And so the cops came,
the cops are saying,
Hey,
what happened here?
Right.
And um,

14
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:50.790
I was afraid of they were arresting me or a so I said,

15
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:55.230
well nothing happened officer.
Um,
nothing he said and the guy was,

16
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.420
and it was the guy who had broken out my thing,
you know,

17
00:00:57.421 --> 00:00:59.070
so why don't you just take the car,

18
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.110
you know you deserve it because you've been doing a lot.

19
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:02.100
Cause I didn't want to get rid of that.

20
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.980
I didn't have rice and beans and I didn't want my wife to get in trouble.

21
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.510
If you want to just take it,
you know,

22
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.500
it wasn't that it was around 230 at the time.
So why don't you just take it?

23
00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:12.570
It'd be okay.
And was the guy said,
hey,
don't tell me that.

24
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.010
And then once he said that if I got him,
I got him nothing.
Hey Man,

25
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:20.190
taking me through this man,
you deserve this.
Take it.
And they took it.

26
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.790
But before that the guy from guy arm was broken and he,

27
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:26.880
I gave him my money and I'd take the money and then he came back to the police

28
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:27.960
in my arm.
But it kept him.

29
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:30.270
Now he can get away from my knuckle to pay to get away from me no more.

30
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.880
Cause he didn't want to mess this deal up with this car cause the guy,

31
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.350
he is not going to get this car.
That's a little coffee.

32
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.260
Don't fucking come near me again.
That hit me.
The Guy,

33
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:43.920
he's backed off and I said,
go ahead man.
I feel it.
And I took off my work.

34
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:46.510
I didn't want it to get in trouble,
but they made them give away the car.
Right.

35
00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:48.170
They made it real.
He could cause I went back to my office.

36
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.000
I can my fucking car back going to that.

37
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.820
<v 1>Yeah,
he got fired.</v>

38
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.480
He probably hearing his name.
I'm going to get that back to the

39
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.660
Indian giver.
One of my car.

40
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.700
<v 0>Oh No.
Mike Tyson calls you up and says,

41
00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:15.850

42
00:02:15.851 --> 00:02:18.590
