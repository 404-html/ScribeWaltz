Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.220
I want you to see a box or go to the UFC and see how that's going to happen

3
00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:09.860
eventually.
You know what I mean?
We had James,
Tony of course,

4
00:00:09.861 --> 00:00:14.030
but James was way past his prime and it didn't even look like he trained for

5
00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:17.710
that fight.
I think James just took a payday.
If I had a gas,
you know,

6
00:00:17.711 --> 00:00:21.320
and Randy just hit him with a low ankle pick,
took them down.

7
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.940
I think maybe hit a low single,
I forget what it was,
but he,
he went way low.

8
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.140
But either way there's not a chance in hell the James Tony was ever gonna stop

9
00:00:30.141 --> 00:00:32.510
Randy couture from taking them down.
It's just not going to happen.

10
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:36.380
He would have to catch him absolutely perfect coming in for the very first
punch.

11
00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:38.960
And if he didn't,
Randy was going to molest him.

12
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.110
See how his way with them excited about GSP?
Yeah.
I'm,

13
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.420
I mean,
I'm interested to see what happens.
Uh,

14
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.400
quite honestly I wanted to see him at one 70.
I want to,

15
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.550
I as I think him versus Woodley is the fight.

16
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.740
Like Woodley's had two fights in a row where people like were booing him and

17
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.521
three really,

18
00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:01.340
cause he had two fights with Wonderboy that were like chess matches.

19
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.110
And then one fight with Damien Maia,

20
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.020
which was also like just not the most exciting fight.

21
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.260
But I think him versus GSP would be very exciting fight.

22
00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:12.320
I think that's the real fight because that's GSPS real weight class too.

23
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.060
You know,
I'm interested in that.

24
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.750
But I'm interested in the Bisping fight too cause I think it's a tough fight.

25
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.420
It's a tough fight for GSP.
Bisping is a handful.

26
00:01:20.421 --> 00:01:24.140
He's a big fella to fought at two oh five and the ultimate fighter fights in one

27
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:28.790
85 in the UFC.
He's way bigger than George and he's gotten fucking tough man.

28
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:32.990
He's real good.
Legitimately real good.
And George has been out for a long time.

29
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.360
Yeah.
What's he been doing?
And while he's been training,

30
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.050
he's definitely stayed in shape.
He did a lot of gymnastics,

31
00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:42.740
did a lot of exercise.
You know,
he made a shit ton of money when he was fighting.

32
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.670
You know,
he had contracts with Nike and he had some,
he had a,

33
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.170
was it Nike or was it,
um,
I think you had something that we,

34
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.880
I know we had something with Gatorade,
but I want to say Georgia at some would.

35
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.970
Maybe it's under Armour.
I think he's got something with under Armour.
Yeah.

36
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So he's had a bunch of big endorsements and he's at a giant hero in Canada.

37
00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:05.240
I mean,
just giant.
Right?
So I think for,
you know,

38
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.690
a while he's just recovering and then all those wars,

39
00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:12.770
all those years of getting brawls and finally got to a point where his body

40
00:02:12.771 --> 00:02:15.440
started feeling real good again.
He's like,
fuck it.
Let's get back in there.

41
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.660
<v 1>[inaudible]
