Hello Freak bitches.
Well,

2
00:00:03.731 --> 00:00:07.330
also this outright thing that we were talking about,
there's a,
there's,

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.190
there's groups of people that were never interested in politics that are now

4
00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:17.050
treating it the same way they treat sports.
The,
these guys are sports fans.

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.450
I mean,
that's really what it's like.
It's like,
this is my team.
I'm on team Trump,

6
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.680
you know,
and these fucking pussies.
Yeah,
it's a corporation man.

7
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.000
And they're showing up at these Berkeley rallies and they're fighting with

8
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:34.750
people now.
Like now you've,
you've got people responding.

9
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.240
This is one of the real problems with the left.

10
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.970
The real problem with these really hardcore lefties that are outraged and want

11
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:43.900
to do something and they want to be positive.

12
00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:48.400
So they want to shut down all these people like Milo that the think or Nazis or

13
00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:49.690
Ann Coulter and all these people.

14
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.460
But by doing that and by having these gigantic protest and literally shutting

15
00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:56.710
down people,
communicating and talking,

16
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.470
you invite people to resist that.

17
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.000
And then you start eating these antifa people hit people on the head with

18
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:05.330
fucking bike locks.
You see the,

19
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.740
they found that it was a professor that was hitting people in the head with bike

20
00:01:08.741 --> 00:01:13.741
locks and that this is going to have people show up and want to hit you with

21
00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:15.760
something.
And so what you see now,

22
00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:19.990
and I've seen plenty of footage of Trump protesters and supporters beating other

23
00:01:19.991 --> 00:01:23.200
people out.
It's like ain't coming hold on both sides coming from both sides now.

24
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.190
But I almost feel like this is a manufactured thing because I think that there's

25
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.270
been from the Oakland area and I've an Antifa has been showing up at every

26
00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:35.110
protest for as long as I can remember.
And the cops kind of like our hands off.

27
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.970
And so I feel like to provoke the Antifa block where you know that they're like

28
00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:43.500
really strategically oriented and keep going to burglary and he'd going at

29
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:46.810
Berkeley and then making it like this big free speech blowout where it's like

30
00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:50.110
why do you keep going?
And like creating the situation,

31
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.170
you kind of know what's going to happen.
It seems like a manufactured thing.

32
00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:56.800
And then at the end of the day it makes the left easier to demonize.

33
00:01:56.801 --> 00:01:59.860
And end basically protests easier to demonize,

34
00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:04.660
where now you have 200 people facing felony riot charges at the inauguration

35
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:05.350
protests.

36
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.920
And a couple of them are just journalists who are filming and all the Trump

37
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:11.610
people are like,
whatever.
They're fucking writing.
And they're fascists in there.

38
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.800
Antifa it's like,
well,
because this happened in Berkeley now,

39
00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.960
like all protesters are,
you know,

40
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.700
there's scapegoated to these people and to demonize.

41
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.930
It's easy to box people in,

42
00:02:22.931 --> 00:02:26.590
but I think what's going on in Berkeley is it's the most outrageously liberal

43
00:02:26.591 --> 00:02:27.520
place in the country.

44
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.400
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
