Hello Freak bitches.
Hey,
check this out.
I want her to ask you what do you,

2
00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:08.880
what do you think is Trump going to do anything about the stratospheric aerosol

3
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:11.760
injection?
Write that down.
I

4
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.710
run.
We're talking about stratospheric aerosol injection.

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.650
I can't get to you the points that you want.
Let me,

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.760
you know what do you think Trump wants to stop that?
I'm going to chuck.

7
00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:26.610
Write it down.
Write,
write down.
Then the next question,
I'll do it here.

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.471
That's the question.

9
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:32.471
The question he just five before the Alex Jones is off the rails right now.

10
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:36.840
Folks
get the joke.
Why don't have to write it down.

11
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:39.960
I didn't get it because you've been bad.
Listen,

12
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.270
will Trump is Trump

13
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.360
that program to stop the old one?
Well,
what do you,

14
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:51.000
what do you think the program is ending?
What do you think the program,

15
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.650
the director of the CIA,
he's talking about it on Youtube.
Look on your Johno.

16
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.640
Johno Brenda.
They talk about strategies.

17
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.800
They talking about strategy and solid injections.

18
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:05.490
It's going to cost $10 billion a year and there's going to be some countries

19
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.220
opposed to it because it's going to mess up the web.

20
00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:10.070
Telling me about atmospheric manipulation,

21
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:14.100
and I'm talking about stratospheric g s I'd never heard of that.

22
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.460
It's super important when you can break it down to three letters.
Yeah,
let me,

23
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.770
let me go.
John.
Oh,

24
00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:23.771
Brennan admitted last in June of 2016 at the it,

25
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.340
I saw the video comment on it.

26
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.250
Can you play a Jamie John O'Brien talking about this forever?
No,
I'm not.

27
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.450
I'm not bashing you.
But you had your TV show made jokes about it,

28
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.340
which I get because a lot of it to be,
yes,

29
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.480
there is an entire atmospheric terraforming geoengineering manipulation.

30
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:40.860
They don't call it chem trails.

31
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.590
And of course the CIA director admitted they had this huge program.

32
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.730
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation owns the major patents on it from Westinghouse

33
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:51.600
and others.
They use these big antennas to manipulate the weather.
They can,
uh,

34
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.770
like China's like causing huge harp like harsh technology.

35
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.670
It's all declassifying harp manipulates the weather.
They admitted to us.

36
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:03.270
I used to have the head of Harp,
general bitten k part.
Not all the time,

37
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.400
but exactly.

38
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.100
There's giant weather modification systems and there's weather wars between

39
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:09.570
different governments and they,

40
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:12.510
it's all declasse explaining to people that are listening what harp is,

41
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.710
what does it stand for?
High altitude something.
Yeah.

42
00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:19.650
They've got a system that supposedly you don't know what to Harper really was

43
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:21.360
under his classification.
What does it stand for?

44
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:24.670
High frequency active auroral research programs.

45
00:02:24.671 --> 00:02:29.430
So the idea behind this was they wanted to do research on the Aurora and didn't

46
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:32.840
they want to see if they could communicate using it and send radio waves.

47
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.330
They want it out over the horizon radar.
Right.
Yeah.

48
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.410
That and they also wanted is to be able to send radio signals to places where

49
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:41.760
they wouldn't really hard.
It doesn't really go,

50
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.090
what does that have to do with stratospheric aerosol and just really go into the

51
00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:47.160
atmosphere?
Well,
the speculation,

52
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.140
I've interviewed the private head of it.
Okay.
Okay.

53
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.630
Let him work.
How does harp work with the chem trails?
What do they,

54
00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.710
let me check goes on.
Okay.

55
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.390
Only a my chronic amount of small amount of what harp does is in the atmosphere.

56
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.170
It's bouncing off the Aurora borealis and then resonating back through in a,

57
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.330
in a deep earth,
uh,

58
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.870
communication program to satellites and other things through the planet.

59
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.680
So it's still does he communicate satellites through the satellites down to the

60
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:24.730
submarines.
So here it goes.
This is an actual definition.
How harp works.

61
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.480
The facility's transmitters send radio waves upward when,
hold on,

62
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:32.650
let's just read it first waves upwards into the ionosphere between 100 350

63
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:33.970
kilometers of altitude.

64
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.230
The resulting heating effect creates irregularities and the electron density

65
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:38.501
there,

66
00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:43.501
which in turn allows communication signals as from satellites to be relaid off

67
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:46.060
the ionosphere.
And that's not what it really does.

68
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.200
Then they can shoot the shadow light frequency coded through the Earth to

69
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:54.830
submarines.
Now what is this website from then?
The son Jamie bully.

70
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.450
You want the real stuff?
I'll tell you.
Yeah,
sure.
Okay,

71
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.450
let me explain something.
Okay.

72
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:04.350
nature.com I have the head of the heart program on,
I'm just fucking,

73
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.960
I got contacted about 10 years ago and they said the head of the Hart project

74
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:08.794
really lecture work.

75
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.490
He liked to come on interviews online and he liked to come on and tell her buddy

76
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.460
and about 30 minutes in a colonel came on the line and said,

77
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:19.060
sorry during a break and cut the guy off.

78
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.790
Whoa dog,
Tom.
Tom In.

79
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:25.750
This really happened Q spooky music cue.
Spooky music building.
Get back.

80
00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:29.020
I believe that's a true story.
I want to know.
I want to know that.

81
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.590
I want another relationship between like what are the chem trails have to do?

82
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.800
Do you think Trump is going to look into the SIA project at the CIA has

83
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.620
greenlit.
He is starting out with vaccines.

84
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:44.590
As I told people he would do investigating and all the damage they've caused.

85
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:45.850
All this amazing.
Then the ultimate.

86
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.480
That's good to start the vaccines get that shit together too for sure,

87
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.660
but what about the SAI programs at the CIA has greenlit you think he's going to

88
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.530
get into that?
The other gets the next level.

89
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.480
She's really wanting to communicate with these microphones.

90
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.510
Internet shouldn't be like,
I want to have to split it all up.

91
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.950
You're so locked onto this.
It's like,
here's the problem with all this essay.

92
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.150
I saw a shit.

93
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.410
Most of what you see when you see those jets flying around those clouds behind

94
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:15.430
them,
most of that is just a jet engine.
Exactly.

95
00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:19.150
The Jeremiah confusers that with a real newsroom.
What's the real program?
Well,

96
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:21.820
here's the thing.
You're writing,
so as Joe,
because the world is complex,

97
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.310
there are secret and clauses,

98
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.500
Shaker and in public programs to test manipulation of the weather and weather

99
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:28.900
systems.
The Arabs are doing it.
The Chinese are doing it.

100
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:31.870
The Russians are doing it.
People being cloud seeding for a hundred years.

101
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.110
My cloud,
Johnny's redounds to whether manipulation,

102
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.840
but they're doing it for different puddles.
It's not not not to produce flops.

103
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.160
I had been living kick on the head of the U s whether weapon program for 27

104
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:48.190
years on my show first because I saw it was he classified.

105
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.960
I saw that he was in the panhandle of Texas.

106
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.410
I called him running a major clouds city company with his son and got the nine

107
00:05:54.411 --> 00:05:58.070
year old to Austin and then after that he totally freaked out cause the CIA came

108
00:05:58.071 --> 00:06:00.590
to his house.
Do you want the interviews on Youtube?

109
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.390
Do you want to know what he said?
Yes,

110
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.030
he was a World War II fighter pilot and say at the end of World War II he flew

111
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:10.850
the first planes in the hurricanes,
which,
what's your,

112
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.720
you know the Atlantic that's pretty gangster and into typhoons that are even

113
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:19.640
faster in the Pacific.
And then he,
and then he also led squadrons in Vietnam,

114
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:22.490
flooding everything up to 10 feet of water out of clear blue skies with an hours

115
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.250
with their width,
their chemicals on a pass.
You have to be to do that.

116
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.780
Super Bad ass fly into a hurricane or a typhoon.
He's the first guy to do it.

117
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.500
Holy Shit.
Anyways,
he's super bad ass.
Let me know.
He's alive.

118
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:37.940
He's been living at 90.

119
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:41.220
He was still all there and I thought at not he could kick my ass big tex.

120
00:06:41.221 --> 00:06:44.050
And I felt like I was,
the guy was tougher than me anyways,
so,

121
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.510
so we're sitting there and he gives me all this data and I can't believe it.

122
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:50.090
He sent me all these classified photos and stuff cause they just declassified

123
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.960
the file and no one thought to call the old man from Lubbock or whatever it was.

124
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.790
So I call him out getting him on.

125
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.400
They sent a bunch of people to their company and threatened them.

126
00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:00.560
The next week after I hired him and he laid it out,

127
00:07:00.561 --> 00:07:04.850
he said in 1967 we certified at the Stanford Research Institute that he was able

128
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:08.240
to control hurricanes,
create hurricanes and steer hurricanes,

129
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.790
all that got black budgeted shutdown.

130
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.690
And then they got into these arrays where they could use antennas and out of

131
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:17.780
that,
and Westinghouse came,
came the uh,
the,

132
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:20.390
the whole heart program show in the 60s.

133
00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:23.480
They could create control and steer or kill hurricanes.

134
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.110
That's why you Google now bill and Melinda Gates bought all those patents and

135
00:07:28.111 --> 00:07:30.830
the quote,
Bill Gates is going to save the world from bad weather.

136
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.390
Bill Gates wants to stop hurricanes.
Google it.
So I,

137
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.740
so let me deal getting sounds.
The weather machine,
let me pause for a second.

138
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.960
How does the,
how does,
how do they manipulate a hurricane?

139
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.880
So the hurricane's going to happen,
how do they break it up?
Okay.
If it's,

140
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.930
if it was coming into lands there,
problem with,

141
00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:47.420
with Ariel arrays projecting into the sky,

142
00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:51.290
they can break it up or strengthen it or kill it or steer it because it's all,

143
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.720
he's doing that with harp.
Well they've got,

144
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.520
they've got heart-based is all over the place.

145
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:59.210
They call him doppler radar facilities.
Oh the government wants your local city.

146
00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:01.040
They have doppler radar.
I thought that it was like,

147
00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:04.130
so you could ask the guy in front of the waiter the screen,
that's it.

148
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:08.660
Like one 10th of 1%.
They can crank those arrays up that have massive,

149
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.690
your lights might go when they do it a little bit.
Yeah.

150
00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:15.260
Cause they'll use the whole power of your town through the doppler radars then.

151
00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:16.094
Then they control it.

152
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.150
The US has a giant weather weapon hidden in front of everybody in every town and

153
00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:23.320
city and poor Russians and Chinese are just discovering it.

154
00:08:23.321 --> 00:08:26.010
All the U S has one of the weapons that can knock them all out.
Right.

155
00:08:26.011 --> 00:08:27.260
You Know Bill Gate's control,

156
00:08:27.261 --> 00:08:32.150
the weather ideas for barges to pump cold water from the depths of the ocean to

157
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:34.700
create some sort of a roadblock for the hurricane.

158
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.630
Since her gains pull power from the water's warm temperature is cooling.

159
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:42.770
The water could have theoretically theoretical lessons.
Right.

160
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.800
Dismantle the hurricane.
Well it sounds like a good idea though.
None of it.

161
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:48.880
The point is we are loving.
He is it doesn't that sound like a genius idea.

162
00:08:48.881 --> 00:08:52.570
He's spray cold water and cool off the trails.

163
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.720
Johno Brennan in in the front of the CFR is saying we were doing this because w

164
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.320
for global warming and we got to save them.
You are writing,

165
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.100
you are writing about social,
about about Geo Engineering and chem trails.

166
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.780
You were wrong about the dinosaurs not being wrong,
but hey,

167
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.510
what about that they're,
they're coming out saying,
hey,

168
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.460
there's going to be some countries that don't,

169
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.310
that aren't going to be for it and we got to figure out how we're going to deal

170
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:20.490
with them because you want me to have the audience?
Yes,
yes.

171
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.210
Was the big season manipulation.
Keep going with that.
Come on man.

172
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:26.940
Don't change the subject.
Keep going with that.
You're not done with Livingston.

173
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.710
Imagine you're here.

174
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:31.890
But imagine that me and Joe are actually come on and got me off on you want be

175
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:36.290
hear about Ronald Reagan to later finish the s AI pro.

176
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.250
He doesn't know about this.
I know about it,
but it's like a monitor.
Dale,

177
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.590
what do you know about the Sei program?
Look,
let's get this done.

178
00:09:43.591 --> 00:09:46.860
When most of the real programs are just like fronts for something else.

179
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:50.970
It's not even real.
So you don't think they're spraying shit into the atmosphere?

180
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:53.880
No.
There is a program for Geo Engineering.

181
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.720
There's a program in place and you said it's the doppler radar system and a harp

182
00:09:57.721 --> 00:10:01.610
and what else?
And an aerial spraying still the most effective and they,

183
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.710
when do they do have pat?
When you say aerial spraying,
what are they spraying?

184
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.020
Barium salts,
alumina oxide,

185
00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:11.820
radioactive isotopes brain in the air and doing that and he alone was because

186
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.520
because it does a bunch of things or testing a bunch of stuff.
They're,
they're,

187
00:10:15.521 --> 00:10:18.180
they're manipulating things.
Listen,
our pedagogical way.

188
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.160
Why do you have evidence that they're doing this and a spraying aluminum and

189
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.000
Barium,
whatever it is in line and reads the Department of Energy.

190
00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:26.000
It's all public.
Just like he just said,

191
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.400
go online and watch a Chinese dude get jacked by a tiger.
I agree.

192
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.130
That's out there.
You go to the Department of energy.gov right,

193
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.310
and you can watch CFR.
She CIA director at the time.

194
00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:39.320
Brennan it admitting all of this.
This is all public.
Yeah.
He admitted it.

195
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.520
He talked about,
but he'd know I saw it.
I saw the video.

196
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:43.560
We can play the video and go over it if you want,

197
00:10:43.561 --> 00:10:46.410
but he's talking about various options for controlling global warming.

198
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.800
They're laying out the future.
Look if global warming,
there's a guy,

199
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.310
hold on a second.
If global warming is real,
we know it is right.

200
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.830
Don't you think they would have?

201
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.930
You don't believe global warming is real when they keep measuring these

202
00:10:57.931 --> 00:11:01.050
temperatures and scientists keep saying this is the hottest year on record

203
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:05.050
church.
Let's emails.
Well,
let's find out.
Let's find out what the muscle,

204
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.600
Jillian's real.
Okay.
I believe that goes,
it goes high,
it goes cold.

205
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.120
There's always micro temperature is always like to change.
This shift stretches.

206
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.630
The only thing that ever happened.
That's a,

207
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.790
I think we all agree on taxes to Al Gore won't fix it.
Okay.

208
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.280
I think we all agree that's the shifts,

209
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:24.210
but what I'm saying is there absolutely is global warming,
right?

210
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.470
What does a C minus?
We're talking house.

211
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:31.470
When my dad was a kid,
the 1950 [inaudible] for three,

212
00:11:31.471 --> 00:11:32.490
four months out of the year,

213
00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:36.180
it was below zero or freezing and you had to chop wood and he'd freeze your ass

214
00:11:36.181 --> 00:11:40.140
off in all houses had even in the south had had uh,
you know,

215
00:11:40.141 --> 00:11:44.400
had all sorts of of chimneys genom for fireplaces because it was freezing cold

216
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.650
and now there has been a warming period,

217
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.920
but that's part of a normal global cycle based on the sun.

218
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.960
All these astro physicist or,
sure.

219
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.750
The whole thing about claiming it's the carbon we put out the earth is carbon

220
00:11:55.751 --> 00:11:59.530
starve.
There's a carbon cycle.
That's the big point I want to get to.

221
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.100
The globalist want to tax if they can tax oxygen,
carbon dioxide,

222
00:12:03.101 --> 00:12:04.030
water or sunlight,

223
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.640
they have total control over the whole lifecycle of the planet.

224
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.160
Let's play the video.
Let's play the video.
This,

225
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:13.570
this CIA guy talking about it because what I inferred from and decide to come up

226
00:12:13.571 --> 00:12:15.280
with some sort of solutions.

227
00:12:15.281 --> 00:12:18.490
If global warming becomes a giant gay Brennan is a fricking known,

228
00:12:18.491 --> 00:12:21.030
will hobbyist what it was,
yo,
hold on.

229
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.450
What is the CIA that's watch the video first?
Global warming.

230
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.240
It's a good question.
What do they have to do?
I don't know what the CIA does.

231
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:33.190
Intelligent communism.
They were built that stop the spread of communism,

232
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.220
but it's an intelligence agency.
They're part of the environment.
Okay.

233
00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:39.220
They were part of the intelligence community and if they got hired,

234
00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:41.800
I would imagine,
this is just me guessing right off the top of my head.

235
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:46.840
If they got hired to assess a threat and a threat being from global warming,

236
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.300
like what?
What do we have to worry about?
Are we really gonna lose cities?

237
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.550
Do we really have an issue there?
The current goes down.

238
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:56.290
Give George Soros and the UN total power for a 100 trillion per decade.

239
00:12:56.291 --> 00:13:00.330
Global tax to micro manage and surveil everything humans do.
Let's see.

240
00:13:00.331 --> 00:13:02.680
As of carbons toxic,
they've got a surveillance.

241
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.230
Thus they have a jurisdiction who control controller lives.
Okay,
hold up.

242
00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:08.740
Why does it say debunked?
CIA director admits chem trails,
geoengineering,

243
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:13.480
stratospheric aerosol injections.
Uh,
so it says claim guys.

244
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.170
Brandon wrote,
hold on,
hold on,
hold on.

245
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.660
At the counsel admits geoengineering.

246
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.540
In the form of stratospheric aerosol injections.

247
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.430
Sai Is taking a place he Kempter is taking place,
IEE chem trails,

248
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.590
and the rebuttal is nowhere in his speech.

249
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.770
Is there an admission that an sai program has already taken place?

250
00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:36.130
The part where Brennan Mentions geoengineering is just one example.

251
00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:40.780
Out of several not often mentioned issues with the CIA monitors for potential

252
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.910
elements of instability in the world.
A S AI program,
if ever implemented,

253
00:13:45.911 --> 00:13:49.390
could penetrate conflicts and security threats if misused.

254
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.720
The CIA's jobs to consider all types of concepts,

255
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.200
concepts for potential future problems and threats,

256
00:13:56.201 --> 00:14:00.410
including the science oriented concepts.
That's totally fine.
Let me break down.

257
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:04.450
Right,
but isn't that possible?
Done,
but what that guy just said,
is that possible?

258
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.070
No.
That's basically what Brendan said.

259
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.520
But what he's saying is that there are potential threats.

260
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:11.710
You want everyone to watch her mentally it's an issue,
right?

261
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.910
So he's not admitting that he had,
there's an sai hard,

262
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.300
but when we want to tell you,
okay,
go ahead.
Tell me

263
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.500
everybody debates how many programs or are all the specifics.

264
00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:24.430
A lot of that's classified.
You can Google Shyna lodges,

265
00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:28.270
Major Weather Control Operations 10 years ago or Qatar does it,

266
00:14:28.271 --> 00:14:32.610
or Saudi Arabia or UK or for sure people have studied.
No,
no,
there's,

267
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:37.650
they call it study or there's a giant hell in 2005 the Department of Energy

268
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.140
Program for aerosault testing with $5 billion a year.

269
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.120
She'll under US code title 50 Chapter 32 subsection 1,528 paragraph B.

270
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.170
Is that true?
You nailed that,
right?
Yes.
We from Mars under US code.

271
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:54.260
Do you live on that obelisk?
That was fucking insane.
Let me just tell you,

272
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.590
I can't even remember the time.
The last time.
The Cida fire

273
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:05.390
under US code title Finish Hammer 32 1,528 paragraph B.

274
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.680
That's insane.
Hold on.
Say it slow and let Jamie write it up.

275
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.370
Jay was code title 50 chapter.
I say it fast.
Remember us?

276
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:18.371
Code Title 50 Chapter 32 30% section 1,528 paragraph eight subsection 128 the

277
00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:24.360
real fast brain fact speed.
Kenya's speech came and say it.

278
00:15:24.361 --> 00:15:27.980
He has like one thought you,
Jesus [inaudible].
He knows one.

279
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.060
There's restrictions on use of human subjects for testing of chem trails.

280
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.750
Go back,
go back,
back.
There you go.
Or biological agents,

281
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:40.250
right now what they do in this flow is they say it's illegal to test unless it's

282
00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:43.580
for research.
Then you're allowed to leave to kill people.

283
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.960
It was for research purposes.

284
00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:48.170
That's how some of those Japanese whaler vessels get away with killing whales.

285
00:15:48.171 --> 00:15:49.004
Still.

286
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.330
They say it's for research purposes and they kill the whales and tell them it's

287
00:15:52.331 --> 00:15:57.290
from dark shit elites or the mad scientist engineers.

288
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.900
I'm gonna give you the big secret man.
And if you want,
yes I do.

289
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.690
I'm up here in the room.
I know.
I'm not even saying they call.

290
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.920
They're the high priests.
They're scientists,
they're engineers.

291
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.750
They're allowed to kill people,

292
00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:13.280
test stuff on kids and jet black people would shuffle us all the declassified

293
00:16:13.281 --> 00:16:15.680
stuff because they are scientists.

294
00:16:15.681 --> 00:16:18.530
All the real executioners tortures,

295
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.020
or most of them were people making decisions are doctors.

296
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:25.430
And so it's all medical doctors stuff and this big breakaway civilization of

297
00:16:25.431 --> 00:16:28.520
scientist.
Okay.
And so that's what they've built it under,

298
00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:33.230
under under research perse visions.
They could even kill anybody they want.

299
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.050
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
