1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.540
But

2
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.100
<v 1>with dreams that doesn't make any sense.
So I was,</v>

3
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.700
I'm always trying to figure out like what is it about a dream where sometimes I

4
00:00:09.701 --> 00:00:14.701
can remember the dream and sometimes it's so vivid when I wake up I'm like,

5
00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:19.000
holy shit,
that was crazy.
What a dream.
And then I forget it 20 minutes later.

6
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.200
Right.
What is that?

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.830
<v 0>So firstly,
I mean,</v>

8
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.530
one theory of dreaming is that it's just simply a reconstruction when you wake

9
00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:26.681
up.

10
00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:30.220
So you have these fragments of activity and what your cortex does when it wakes

11
00:00:30.221 --> 00:00:32.890
up is what your cortex is designed to do when you're awake normally,

12
00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:35.860
which is try to package everything,
can make a good story,

13
00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:39.460
make logical fit out of the world.
That's one theory.

14
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.350
I don't believe that though.
Um,
your,
your point is a really interesting one.

15
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.650
Do I remember my dreams?
Um,

16
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.770
that doesn't necessarily mean I forget my dreams.

17
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.360
And what I mean by that is accessibility versus availability.

18
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.630
So if you haven't had that experience where you've worked in up,

19
00:00:58.631 --> 00:01:02.440
you thought I was definitely dreaming,
I can't quite grab it,
you know,
it just,

20
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.560
and it's gone.
And then two days later you're in the shower,

21
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.130
you sort of washing yourself,
you see a bottle of shampoo,
you see the label,

22
00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:12.710
and it just triggers the unlocking of that dream memory in.

23
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.390
It sort of comes flooding back or someone says something to you and you think,

24
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.590
oh,
that was the drink.

25
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.870
What that tells me as a brain scientist is that the memory is there,

26
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.650
it's preserved,
it's available.
But what happens when,

27
00:01:26.651 --> 00:01:30.730
most of the time when we wake up is that we lose the Ip address to the memory.

28
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.320
So it's present,
but it's not consciously accessible,
available,

29
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.230
not accessible.
If that's true,

30
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.140
what it means is that this type of information we know can have nonconscious

31
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.100
impacts on our behavior all the time.

32
00:01:45.101 --> 00:01:49.150
It's great brain science about this nonconscious memory processing.

33
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.290
It's possible that we store every one of our dreams.

34
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.450
We just don't consciously have accessibility to it,
but nevertheless,

35
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.840
it's changing how we behave,
how we feel each and every day.

36
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.950
No evidence for it.
It's a theory I'm still wanting to test,

37
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.730
but that's possible too.
And it's only that anecdote where I can think,

38
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.140
I just don't remember the dream.
I forgotten it.
I don't think that may be true.

39
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.370
It may still be there.

40
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.850
I just need to find the keys to sort of access that memory.

41
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.710
<v 1>What's stunning to me is how quickly the dream evaporates.</v>

42
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.300
The memory of the dream in relation to a,

43
00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:27.350
an actual experience.

44
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.390
Like if we went outside and we saw some lady walk up to some guy and kick them

45
00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:36.080
in the balls,
we'd be like,
whoa.
We would remember that and that.

46
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.820
You'd be able to tell your friends like,
yeah.

47
00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:40.850
Some lady just randomly walked up to some guy and kicked him the balls.

48
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.270
Like we would remember that.
And you would remember it 10 minutes later,

49
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.580
good member in an hour,
you'd remember it.
Yes.

50
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.970
Next day you'd be telling your friends.
Yeah,
she just walked right up to him.

51
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.720
I remember it like it was yesterday because it was right,
but a dream,

52
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.910
it can be 10 minutes ago and you wake up and dude it was King Kong and he was,

53
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.030
he was swinging from my ceiling and somehow or another they've,

54
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.890
he fit in the room but the room got bigger and yet you have these crazy dreams

55
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.660
and then 20 minutes later you forget all of it.
Like what is happening there?

56
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.930
<v 0>So one,</v>

57
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.700
one current explanation is that the chemistry of the brain when you go into

58
00:03:16.701 --> 00:03:18.680
dream sleep is radically different.

59
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.400
So one of the chemicals called noradrenaline in the brain,

60
00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:25.520
which downstairs in the body,
it's sister chemical is called adrenaline.

61
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.170
Noradrenaline actually plummets to the lowest levels.
It's actually,

62
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.920
it's a stress chemical in the brain or to one of them that get shut off during

63
00:03:33.921 --> 00:03:38.060
dream sleep,
which is even if you're panicking liquid,
if you fall off a building,

64
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.710
well what's interesting is that that chemical is low wealth.

65
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.530
You're having that dream,
but when you wake up at from those,

66
00:03:45.531 --> 00:03:46.790
and some people often wake up,

67
00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:48.890
that's when you have the spike of Nora [inaudible].

68
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.470
So it's still low when you're in dream sleep.

69
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.130
But there's another chemical that goes in the opposite direction.

70
00:03:55.131 --> 00:03:56.810
It's called acid tile Coleen.

71
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.020
It's the chemical that is actually an altered in Alzheimer's disease and these

72
00:04:02.121 --> 00:04:05.960
two chemicals will change.
Essentially the input output,

73
00:04:05.961 --> 00:04:10.520
direction of information flow into the memory centers of the brain sends.

74
00:04:10.521 --> 00:04:13.990
That makes sense because people take that as a nootropic.
They do.
Yeah.

75
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.350
That's actually an Alpha brain

76
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.260
<v 1>when when you take that it's,
there's been clinically proven to enhance memory,</v>

77
00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:24.460
especially verbal memory and recollection of words and things like that.

78
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.550
That's right.
So that's happening while your sleeping.

79
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.480
<v 0>Okay,
well see you're in rem sleep.
Yeah.
But what may be happening,</v>

80
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:32.400
our current models,

81
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.230
if you sort of build these neural models to sort of mimic dreaming,

82
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.510
it may be that during dreaming it's principally about the outflow of information

83
00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:41.740
to generate dreams.

84
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.540
And in fact the chemical profile is oppositional to input,

85
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:47.710
which is about saving.

86
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.390
So it's about sort of pumping out information rather than committing
information.

87
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.460
And so when you come out of a dream sleep,

88
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.490
you still get this sort of lingering after sort of taste of chemistry as it

89
00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:04.240
where in the brain that means that the dreaming brain is more programmed to be

90
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.430
outputting a narrative and an experience rather than actually committing it to

91
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:12.970
memory,
which is the opposite direction,
if that makes sense.
It does make sense.

92
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.980
Um,
how aware are you of dimethyltryptamine?
I'm somewhat aware of it.
Um,

93
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.040
scientifically not,
not,
not personally are essentially,
yeah.
Yeah.

94
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.090
<v 1>Um,
the,
one of the things about psychedelic experiences with [inaudible] trip,</v>

95
00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:29.790
to me,
first of all,
it's Indogenous your,
your brain produces it.
Your lungs,

96
00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:30.630
your liver produce it.

97
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.960
But when you have a DMT experience after it's over,

98
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.550
the memory fades very rapidly and it seems just like a dream in that regard.

99
00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:43.420
We're,
while,
while you're having it,

100
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.700
what's bizarre is that you're having it while you're awake.
Yeah.

101
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.710
And then after you have it within 10,
20 minutes,

102
00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:53.640
it is just like a dream that you can't remember.
It's very,
I,

103
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.550
I remember like little flashes of experiences that I've had and there's been a

104
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:01.430
lot of speculation that that's one of the things that you were experiencing

105
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.570
while you're in heavy rem sleep and that could be responsible for the crazy

106
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:09.020
visuals that you have.
That seems so vivid.
I mean,
there,

107
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:14.021
there's been times where I've had dreams where I was 100% convinced that I was

108
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:17.640
awake.
Yeah.
And then something happened.
Like,
uh,
I,

109
00:06:17.641 --> 00:06:21.980
I do this thing sometimes where I'll,
if I do it consciously a lot,

110
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.240
I think I saw him one of those wacky movies,
like a what the bleep do we know?

111
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:29.510
I think I saw it in that when you walk up to a door,

112
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.230
as you walk them through the door,
you knock on the side of the door and go,

113
00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:37.880
am I awake?
Nope.
Not Awake.
Or Am I asleep brother?
Yeah,
no,

114
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:40.220
I'm not asleep.
Um,
cause I'm knocking on the door.
Well,

115
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:42.950
I did that in my hand was just like going right through the wall and I'm like,

116
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.130
Oh,
I'm fucking sleeping.
Uh,
and then I woke up and it was like,
whoa.

117
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.620
But the feeling that I had while I was in that dream,

118
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.820
it was so vivid.
I mean,
everything seems so real.

119
00:06:55.821 --> 00:07:00.821
Like what could possibly be causing me to construct this artificial reality in

120
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:07.130
my mind that at the moment at least was indistinguishable from the reality of

121
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:08.060
that experience right now.

122
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.340
And I'm assuming because I just knocked on this table that I'm awake.

123
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.860
<v 0>Yeah.
I really hope I'm not just a yeah.</v>

124
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.900
A fictive character in your dreams gave you were sharing a dream.
Yeah,

125
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.540
very inception.
Like possible,
uh,
not based on the science so far.

126
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.990
Um,
but I think you know what you're speaking about there.

127
00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:28.940
It is almost why would,

128
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.680
why would mother nature create this thing called the dream experience?
You know,

129
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.770
what would be the function of essentially every night going into what sums up to

130
00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:44.381
be about two total hours of virtual reality experience and testing.

131
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.210
One possibility,
which is deeply unsatisfying,
is that it's just a byproduct.

132
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:51.080
It's just Epi,

133
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:55.580
phenomenal that when your brain goes into this thing called rem sleep and all of

134
00:07:55.581 --> 00:07:58.160
the different patterns of brain activity that we described,

135
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.640
an offshoot is this thing that we called dreaming in the same way that a light

136
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:04.041
bulb,

137
00:08:04.041 --> 00:08:06.950
the reason that we construct the operators that's a light bulb is to produce

138
00:08:06.951 --> 00:08:10.970
light.
But when you produce light in that way,
you also produce heat.

139
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.130
It was never the function of the light bulb.

140
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.650
It's just what happens when you produce light in that way.

141
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.220
Maybe dreaming is just sort of the heat of rem sleep and rem sleep serves lots

142
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:24.500
of other functions,
but wow,

143
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:29.180
that doesn't feel to me right though.
Why?
Well,

144
00:08:29.181 --> 00:08:29.601
firstly,
