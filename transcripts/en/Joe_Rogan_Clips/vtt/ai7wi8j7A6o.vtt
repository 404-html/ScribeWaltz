1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.790
The joe rogan experience.
Like I'm watching the show Vikings,
right?

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.410
And uh,
Oh man,
it pissed me off.
Episode two,

3
00:00:08.411 --> 00:00:12.640
this guy puts his feet up on the table and he's got rubber bottom soles of his

4
00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:15.740
shoe.
My Cue motherfuckers,
he has a healed,

5
00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:20.741
it's clearly made in a factory and there's like this textured plastic bottom to

6
00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:23.830
his shoe.
I'm like,
how did no one catch this?

7
00:00:23.831 --> 00:00:27.430
You guys have is an amazing wardrobe and all these ships.

8
00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:30.340
And I'll take a picture of it and I'll put it up on my Instagram later.

9
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.660
I was so dumb.
It made me angry.
But I'm watching this and I'm like,

10
00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:36.760
how do we know who this was?
How they talked?

11
00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:39.130
How do we know this is what they did?
How do we,

12
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.250
this is some weird interpretation of some historical events really to interpret.

13
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.200
And of course thoughts don't fossilize so I started off early in the book about,

14
00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:50.411
you know,

15
00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:54.190
who were the first people to figure out we're going to die and become aware of

16
00:00:54.191 --> 00:00:56.050
our own mortality in a way that,
well,

17
00:00:56.051 --> 00:01:00.880
maybe I can conceive of being somewhere else.
I don't actually die.
So we,

18
00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:01.870
we know,
uh,
you know,

19
00:01:01.871 --> 00:01:06.820
an elephant's grieve and mammals grieve and Cetaceans,
dolphins,
whales,

20
00:01:06.821 --> 00:01:10.480
and so on.
And,
and,
and chimps,
they,
you know,
they feel these mothers are just,

21
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.690
just depressed and almost suicidal when they're infants die.

22
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.570
But that's different from,
you know,
conceiving of like,
well,

23
00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:20.510
I know I'm going to die because I see people around me going to die that I

24
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.960
conceive of maybe some other place to go.

25
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.280
So I started off with something of a paradox that if I asked you to imagine

26
00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:31.210
yourself dead,
you can't do it because to imagine anything,
you have to be alive.

27
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.080
So it's not going to be like falling asleep and waking up the next morning

28
00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:36.670
because you have dreams or whatever.

29
00:01:36.671 --> 00:01:40.120
It's going to be more like general anesthesia where it's,
you know,
10,
nine,

30
00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:45.120
eight boom,
boom lights out and you,
and,
but you just never wake up.
So,
and we,

31
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.560
it's,
we talk about things like,
well there's nothing after death but,

32
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.120
but even the word no thing implies there's a thing or you know,

33
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.900
you're going to this place,
this [inaudible] there's,
there's nothing,

34
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.120
no thing or where it implies that there is aware that you're not going to,

35
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.230
but there's not even aware that you're not going to.
And it's like,
you know,

36
00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:07.750
with Lawrence Krauss and some of these cosmologists,
you know,

37
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.770
what was there before the big bang.
So when you say,
well,
imagine no universe,

38
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.890
you know,
no stars or planets or galaxies,
no light.

39
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.430
But there's not even any space or time.
And at some point you just,

40
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.610
we don't have the words to even say what it is we're trying to talk about.

41
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.100
There's,
there's nothing before the big bang.

42
00:02:24.101 --> 00:02:28.300
You can't even ask actually talk about it.
Well,
don't they think now though,

43
00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:32.260
that it's important,
it's entirely possible that the big bang is like a cycle.

44
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.921
Yeah.
As well.

45
00:02:32.921 --> 00:02:36.910
I think it's something like that I think expands and contracts infinitely

46
00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:40.950
forever.
That that's a preferable,
well,
again,

47
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.490
we have to come up with some way to talk about it.

48
00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:47.491
So we also have this weird biological idea based on our own limitations,

49
00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:50.450
that there's a birth and a death of everything.
Right.

50
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:53.380
So actually I have a chapter devoted to Deepak Chopra and yeah.
Destroys,

51
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.470
don't tradition.

52
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.530
I work were kind of buddies now and yeah,

53
00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:01.630
I went to his center down in Carlsbad and spent some time there.

54
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:04.780
And you think he's all right?
He's a good guy.
Yeah.
No,
he's totally a good guy.

55
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.490
He's been,
and at times in the past,
uh,

56
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.720
either misleading or misled.
Yeah,
sometimes that's right.
Um,
you know,

57
00:03:14.721 --> 00:03:18.410
some of his recommendations for dietary things or whatever perhaps,

58
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.930
but I know for sure,
cause I've gotten to know him pretty well,

59
00:03:20.931 --> 00:03:25.810
that he totally believes this stuff.
He says,
uh,
it sounds like we was,

60
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.190
I used to call it a,
but a lot of it,

61
00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:32.300
if you interpret it from a kind of a Buddhist,
western Buddhist position,

62
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.920
you know,
when he says,
uh,
you know,
consciousness is the ground of all being,

63
00:03:36.921 --> 00:03:40.910
it's the ontological primitive.
These things that sound nonsensical,

64
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.890
but if you think about it,
um,
sort of from a simple perspective,

65
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.520
the entire universe is in your brain.
And when you cease to exist,

66
00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:54.250
the university says to exist,
or you,
but you are in your brain,
you know,
like,

67
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.270
I'll call it the week consciousness principle.

68
00:03:56.271 --> 00:04:00.080
It's just sorta true by definition.
Now he goes a little bit further and says,

69
00:04:00.081 --> 00:04:00.291
you know,

70
00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:05.270
that consciousness is everything and that we bring into existence material stuff

71
00:04:05.271 --> 00:04:07.220
by thinking about her observing and or whatever.

72
00:04:07.221 --> 00:04:09.740
And here's some quantum physics experiments that are really spooky.

73
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.670
And it's like,
okay,
timeout.
You know,
quantum physics is weird and spooky.

74
00:04:13.671 --> 00:04:16.550
Consciousness is weird and spooky.
That doesn't mean they're connected now.

75
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.500
He thinks they are.
So it's a debatable point.
Okay.
Uh,
but still,
um,

76
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.980
the,
the experience of going in and so we,

77
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.570
I did the meditation thing and all the massages and the teas and the food and

78
00:04:29.571 --> 00:04:32.390
all that stuff,
and it's,
you know,
it's this beach side resort in Carlsbad.

79
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.210
You can't help but feeling better.
Like,
yeah,
this stuff works.
We're,

80
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.730
whereas Carlsbad,
it's down by Encinitas.
North of San Diego is a beautiful area.

81
00:04:40.731 --> 00:04:43.160
Totally beautiful.
Yeah.
He's kind of deep box,
not done,

82
00:04:43.161 --> 00:04:46.760
and he's got a good thing going and not just the buck,
you know,

83
00:04:46.761 --> 00:04:48.300
there's other people like Sam Harris.

84
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.060
Bob Wright has a new book out called why Buddhism is true.
Okay,
so it works.

85
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.630
So we're back to,
does it work?
What do you mean by does it work?
Not just for me.

86
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.220
I had an experience and I felt better.
We got to do better than that for science.

87
00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:06.221
So what Deepak and a brighter talking about is that is that the Western version

88
00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:11.330
of Buddhism may actually work medically,
may lower stress hormones in your body,

89
00:05:11.331 --> 00:05:12.470
but the lower blood pressure,

90
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.290
these kinds of things that are measurable because that's what we want to know

91
00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:18.350
from a western scientific perspective.
Not just do I feel better,

92
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.100
but 67% of the people who did this particular treatment,

93
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.030
they got better by these measurable criteria.
Okay.
That's,

94
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.900
that seems fair enough to me.
I'm open to that.
Hmm.

95
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.370
Now this idea that there's nothing or no thing that we can't even,

96
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.680
we can't even wrap our head around nothing because we would think of a thing

97
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.320
that there's no thing,
but there's never a thing.
Right,
right.

98
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.480
But how do we or why,
why don't we just say we don't know.

99
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.320
Why don't we speculate on the possibility of consciousness being some sort of

100
00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.530
ethereal thing or thing that exists outside of the Bible?

101
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:04.210
We don't know.
We really don't.
That's what I say.
I conclude.

102
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.690
I don't know if there's an afterlife or not.
The very end of the book,

103
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:10.040
we can come back to this later.
I just said,

104
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.770
it doesn't really matter whether there's an afterlife or not because we don't

105
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:14.510
live in the afterlife.
We live in this luck.

106
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.270
So this is the time you got to do whatever you got to do.

107
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.920
I called this Al V's error.
Uh,

108
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.640
Alvey is LV singer Woody Allen's character in Annie Hall.

109
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.420
I remember the scene early in the movie where he has a flashback as a young boy

110
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.780
and his,
he's in this psychiatrist's office with his mom.
And you know,

111
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:32.480
what's the problem?
He won't do his homework.
You won't do your homework.

112
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.380
Why won't you do your homework album?
He says,
the universe is expanding.

113
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.560
He says the universe is expanding,
goes to the universe,
is everything there is,

114
00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:41.810
and if it's expanding one day it's all going to blow apart.

115
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.510
So nothing really matters.
I'm not going to do my homework.

116
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.330
And his father yells at him,
what does the universe got to do this?

117
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:50.330
We live in Brooklyn.
Brooklyn is not expanding.

118
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.900
So that's my sort of take home message.

119
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.380
We don't live in the afterlife or before the universe or after the,

120
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.870
none of that matters.
I mean,
it's interesting to talk about,

121
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:03.410
but we live in this life,
so this is what really counts.

122
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.130
They're fascinating things to contemplate,
but ultimately you really,

123
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:11.840
for practicality sake,
you really should be paying attention to life.
Totally.

124
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.910
I mean,
this is what I tell deep puck all the time when he says,
well,

125
00:07:13.911 --> 00:07:14.421
you know Michael,

126
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:18.230
this table is actually made of atoms that are mostly empty space and the quantum

127
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:21.980
physicist,
Sean Carroll,
that's not correct.
Or was there,
right?
Yeah.

128
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:25.850
He explained that this idea of empty space,
he's like,
that's no,

129
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:28.310
that's just a poor way of describing.
Okay.

130
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.950
And R I would defer to him and let him describe it.

131
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.240
He also described the superpositions like particles,

132
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:38.780
subatomic particles being super position where they're in a state of moving and

133
00:07:38.781 --> 00:07:39.890
not moving at the same time.

134
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.960
He explained that in a way that completely fucked my head up too.
I'm like,
well,

135
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:47.960
I thought I had figured out sort of,
I thought I had,

136
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.610
I didn't think I had to figure it out,

137
00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:54.170
but I thought I had a definition that it least was like,
okay,

138
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:56.690
well it's this even though I don't understand.
And he's like,
no,

139
00:07:56.691 --> 00:08:01.130
it's not even that.
Okay.
So yes,
referring to please,
if you're interested,

140
00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:04.390
go to this Sean Carroll podcast.
Well,
as I understand it anyway,

141
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.280
that it doesn't really matter because the atoms are jiggling in a way that this

142
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:10.430
is solid.
You can tell it solid and this is the level we live at sell.

143
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.060
If somebody drops on your head,
you're in trouble.
That's right.
Yeah.
So again,

144
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:15.320
we don't live in a quantum world.

145
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:19.370
We live in a macro world where this kind of stuff does matter.
Okay.
So,
um,

146
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.300
you know,
to,
so for de Puck,
the whole Western way of thinking scientifically,

147
00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:27.530
there's a beginning and an end time as a linear thing that we can measure and

148
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:30.770
there's birth and death,
all that is the wrong way to think about it.

149
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:33.910
That the Buddhist way is that it's just all consciousness.
And when you die,

150
00:08:33.911 --> 00:08:36.890
he returned to the conscious state you were before you were in before you were

151
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:38.040
born.
So,

152
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.930
so the physical body is just an instantiation of this conscious thing,

153
00:08:41.931 --> 00:08:46.070
whatever this is.
And okay.
I,
you know,
I don't know,
uh,
you know,

154
00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:48.530
I'd be surprised,
but I'd be pleasantly surprised.

155
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.000
I'll tell you that if it turns out,
you know,

156
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.980
close my eyes for the last time and I wake up and,
you know,
there's deep pocket,

157
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.840
you know,
whoever my friends,
Carl Sagan and Stephen Jay Gould and all the greats,

158
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:02.310
Asimov are there.
Everybody's there hitches there.
You know,
it's like,
oh boy,
okay,

159
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.250
this isn't,
this isn't hell.
Uh,
if that's true,
you know,

160
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:06.690
I'm not against any of this.
Just like,

161
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:11.010
I'm not against Ray Kurzweil in these guys figuring out that we can live 200

162
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:15.300
years or 300 years.
Great.
If you can do it,
you know,
but let's just,
you know,

163
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.570
when they say to me,
Sherman,
don't you want to live to be 500 is like,

164
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:23.370
just get me to 80 without prostate cancer.
Give me the 90 without Alzheimer's,

165
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:27.210
you know,
a hundred uh,
gimme no hundred so I'm not on a morphine drip and a bed,

166
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.660
you know,
just quality of life incrementally year by year.

167
00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:35.190
And if it turns out you solve these problems and we lived to 150 209 we have a

168
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:37.440
bunch of other problems we don't even know about yet.
Okay.

169
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.090
Well I think there's some beauty in temporary things that we,

170
00:09:42.091 --> 00:09:46.740
for whatever reason we're,
we're avoiding that concept.

171
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.080
We were terrified of things ending.

172
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.310
There's beauty and things being temporary,
right?

173
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.630
You don't want to go to see a movie that's a hundred hours long.

174
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.530
It's running a movie's a great movement.
It's 90 minutes you're in,

175
00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:00.720
you're out maybe two hours if it's three hours,

176
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:02.310
if it's blade runner or something,

177
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:05.970
something crazy like what Christopher Hitchens in my book is a love his analogy.

178
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:06.481
First of all,

179
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.390
you're at the party and death taps you on the shoulder and says you have to

180
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:10.710
leave.
And worse,

181
00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:13.290
the party is going to go on without you and they're going to all have fun.

182
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:17.790
It's like,
oh no,
but if the Christian version of Heaven and Hell is real,

183
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.420
you're tapping on the shoulder at the party until you can never leave the party.

184
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:23.550
It's like,
oh,
that's even worse.
I don't want to,

185
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.890
I don't want to do anything forever.
Right?

186
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:30.950
And imagine the classical version of what heaven is like a guy with a harp and

187
00:10:33.211 --> 00:10:36.810
there's a bunch of babies with wings.
Like what?
Or even that aside,

188
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:40.380
that there this y hitch called it a celestial North Korea.

189
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.330
You have a dictator that knows all of your thoughts and everything you're going

190
00:10:44.331 --> 00:10:47.670
to do.
It's like,
wait a minute,
that that does not sound like fun to me.

191
00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:57.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>
