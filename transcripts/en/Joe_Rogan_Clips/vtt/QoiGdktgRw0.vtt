Hello Freak bitches.
Now speaking of smoking,
good stuff.
How did you get,

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.240
how did you find out about DMT and how'd you get involved?

3
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:13.920
Cause I read something about you having these positive DMT experiences.

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.370
Wow.
How strange is it reading about,
you know,

5
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.080
this massive bodybuilder now getting into psychedelic drugs while um,

6
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.570
and speaking openly about it that first time I did the Ios

7
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.310
<v 1>that on in Brazil I met my wife who was outside.
She lived in Brazil.</v>

8
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:33.960
So we went to out to the Amazon and then,
but this was like
10 years ago,

9
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:37.510
you know,
so people weren't really not like now people know what I,

10
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.800
Alaska is because so much information out there yourself talking about I'm

11
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:45.210
talking about is,
it's a ton of stuff on the Internet.
It wasn't so much then,

12
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.090
but I heard about it and I heard about this.

13
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.560
It's a life changing experience and all that stuff.

14
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.540
So we were out in Brazil and we've got this guide and ask him for Io Asca and

15
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:57.780
he's like,
bring me these two balls of brown stuff.

16
00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:00.180
I don't even know to this day if it was really why Alaska,

17
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.130
but I just got really sick and then see any great revelations apart from I got

18
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.440
this thing in my head,
stop poisoning herself.

19
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.130
Well the night before I'd been out drinking and getting drunk and everything.

20
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.250
So you know,
that was my experience with that.

21
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.810
Then a friend of mine out here in California,
actually I knew about DMT.

22
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:23.040
I used to live in Amsterdam and like I read the TMT spirit molecule and all that

23
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:23.940
stuff.
So I knew about it,

24
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:27.510
but I had no idea to get the stuff away you can get it from and everything.

25
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.050
So a friend of mine got it.
And uh,

26
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.300
that was my first experience of like

27
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.310
leaving the room,
so to speak,
and the planet.

28
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.040
And then since then I had uh,
some very positive I Alaska experiences,

29
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:48.800
but with a shaman and do it properly and prepare in like five days of,
you know,

30
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.220
restricted diet and no sex and all these kinds of things you do to prepare.

31
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:55.680
And also afterwards.
Um,

32
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.020
so DMT is like blow the fucking doors off your perception and realize that this

33
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:05.250
world we're in is like,
you know,
it's nothing,
it's just a little illusion,
right?

34
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:09.090
There's so much more outside of it.
Um,
so there was that.

35
00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:10.410
But with the DMT,

36
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:15.411
I think it's like you got a computer with like so much storage space and you've

37
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:20.550
got,
it's like a thousand times more than you can retain.

38
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:23.040
So you see all this stuff and while you're there you're like,
ah,

39
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.113
I know everything.

40
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.613
<v 0>Yes.</v>

41
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.940
<v 1>But when you come back,
how much of it can you hold onto your not right?
Uh,</v>

42
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.910
so you've seen it and that's like,
makes you look at everything differently.

43
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.160
What the IOS SCA is over hours.

44
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:39.150
So I feel like from the Ios or I have to be benefited more.

45
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.120
It was like going through therapy or something cause it was much slower and I

46
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:45.960
couldn't digest it,
you know?
So,
um,
but doing it with a Shaman,

47
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.900
uh,
I did it with a guy called Gmo,

48
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.890
other relo and he's one of the top guys in the world from Peru.

49
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.680
It comes to Spain a couple of times a year.
So I did it with him and um,
yeah,

50
00:02:57.681 --> 00:02:59.040
it's probably,
I dunno,

51
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.500
it was probably two or three years since I did DMT because I sat down one day

52
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.130
and I said,
right,
I actually,
I fasted for three days before,

53
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.450
so I'd be like just in the zone.
And I said,
right,
I'm going to sit down.

54
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.650
I've got my DMT here,
I've got my vaporizer.
Yeah.

55
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.380
I'm going to fucking smoke as much DMT as I possibly can to like,
like,

56
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.530
you know,
to I go on and pass out.

57
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.530
So I had that experience and since then I just,

58
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.290
I don't feel any need to do it.

59
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:28.050
I don't think there's anything more I can take from it.
You know,

60
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.450
<v 0>I've had many people tell me the same thing.</v>

61
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.140
They had such a profound breakthrough experience that they're like,
okay,

62
00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:37.880
I get it.
Yeah.
I had a crazy one in around tooth,

63
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.880
I want to say like 2008 or nine or some point pat and I took a long time off.

64
00:03:44.011 --> 00:03:47.010
I didn't do it again till like five years later maybe.
Yeah.

65
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.180
It was pretty intense,
man.

66
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.791
<v 1>I mean the,</v>

67
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:53.270
the ILS SCA is nice cause it comes in Nice and subtle and you go through hours

68
00:03:53.271 --> 00:03:54.110
of this thing.

69
00:03:54.111 --> 00:03:58.250
But DMT is like last time I did to feel very anxious when you'd like,

70
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.500
like it's almost like you're leaving your body and the [inaudible] and you know,

71
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.400
so you get that bit of anxiety,

72
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.870
<v 0>but once you go,
oh yeah,
yeah,
that's cool.</v>

73
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.180
But if you've done it more than one time in a day,

74
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.590
like multiple times in a night,

75
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.170
<v 1>Nah,
I just,
you know,
just blast it as far as it could go.
And that was it.</v>

76
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:21.100
<v 0>I've done it several times over the course of a few hours and uh,
you know,</v>

77
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.940
you're more comfortable letting go that way and some sort of a strange way,

78
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:26.590
but it never gets less alien.

79
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.900
<v 1>Oh,
he had a,
uh,
I'm not gonna mention his name,
I don't know his name,</v>

80
00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:34.860
but we had an experience with me and my friend a few months ago,
um,
I,

81
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.460
that I've never seen before because usually people take DMT,

82
00:04:37.461 --> 00:04:41.210
they've very calm and sit in the chair and you'd go off and you might start

83
00:04:41.211 --> 00:04:44.990
laughing,
but you know,
you don't move much.
Right.
And this guy,

84
00:04:44.991 --> 00:04:49.190
he just like freaked out,
like it wasn't for 10 minutes with her,
half an hour.

85
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.770
My friend was a former MMA fights,
used to fight with shamrocks and so,

86
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.570
but he know he knew wrestling techniques.

87
00:04:56.571 --> 00:04:59.480
So we had to hold this guy on the floor to stop him from hurting himself because

88
00:04:59.481 --> 00:05:02.450
it was totally freaking out.
So I could see the guy was going through some,

89
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.310
something traumatic from the past.
So today I message him and say,
Hey,

90
00:05:07.311 --> 00:05:10.460
did you ever find out what the guy,
what,
what,
what was that?
You know,

91
00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:15.370
cause it was,
he said,
yeah,
it was from his birth.
What's his,

92
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.740
from his birth when he was born,
he had the cord around his neck.
Oh Jeez.

93
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.440
And he went back and relive this and like,

94
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.520
so that had been in the back of his mind all his life.
Subconscious,

95
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.570
subconscious has a huge effect on us,
but we don't know it's there.

96
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.980
So now he opened that box and let it out and that's gone now,
you know,

97
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.230
so it can be therapeutic.
I thought this guy is like,
wow,
he's going to,

98
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.070
but when it came back,
he was like,
Hey,
I'm like,
you're good.
He's like,
yeah,

99
00:05:43.071 --> 00:05:46.430
I'm good.
I'm like,
do you know what just happened?
He's like,
no.
I said,
good thing.

100
00:05:46.431 --> 00:05:48.290
We filmed at them and then go home and watch this.

101
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.930
<v 0>I had a friend of freaked out too.
He freaked out.
He threw up,
took his shirt off.</v>

102
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.980
I was running around saying a bunch of crazy shit and then after he came

103
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.180
<v 1>down,
you know,
we calmed him down and took like 10 15 minutes.
He goes,
okay,</v>

104
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:04.340
well obviously I'm a work in progress.

105
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.690
<v 0>I'll never forget that it did it.
Did he know what it was that was</v>

106
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.340
<v 1>well,
he had a bad childhood for sure.</v>

107
00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:16.910
Everything is like most of our shit is from there.
Right?

108
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.910
From the developing Yos no,
for sure.
Yeah.

109
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:23.420
I mean it's in especially like real traumatic ones,

110
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:28.421
abuse and being beaten by his Stepdad and a bunch of fucked up shit that was

111
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:32.960
just haunting him.
But he,
you know,
it helps you to come to terms with that.

112
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.300
Especially the ILS because it's longer.

113
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.180
I felt like the first time I did Iowaska property with a Shaman,

114
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:40.820
I felt like I was a different person.

115
00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:44.120
The next day I felt it was like for 10 20 years or fucking therapy or something

116
00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:45.950
and just a lot of stuff at work time in my mind,

117
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:50.600
I could even see other people's point of view on things and that I couldn't see

118
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:53.750
before.
And that's huge.
Right?
See other people's point of view,

119
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.200
especially a guy like you who so determined and goal oriented and just cut out

120
00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:00.950
all the bullshit and get it done.

121
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.300
It can be a little insensitive to other people's feelings around it cause it's

122
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:07.910
just like
nothing

123
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.700
<v 0>my way.
That's a male thing in particular anyway.
Right.
And then,</v>

124
00:07:11.701 --> 00:07:16.701
and it's like steroids and bodybuilding and intensity and competition and then

125
00:07:17.251 --> 00:07:20.040
being the best,
arguably the best ever,

126
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.740
and just fucking grinding every day.
My son time,

127
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:24.030
<v 1>yeah,</v>

128
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.290
a couple of weeks ago he's was like that you don't see yourself as other people

129
00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:29.570
see you.
So what do you mean?
He said,

130
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:34.400
I remember when I was a kid as first of all the size,
you know,

131
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.890
it was fucking huge,
but it's your persona.

132
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.170
You might've said to me something very like normal,
like,
uh,
you know,

133
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.560
you know,
whatever you,
what are you doing with a dog?
Like,
just something normal.

134
00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:49.370
And he said,
no,
I'd be like,
because just your,
your,
your,

135
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.530
your presence made me feel like that.
You know,
Brian,
that's gotta be weird.

136
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.910
You're a little tiny kid and your dad's a gorilla.
Yeah.
I remember he did a,
uh,

137
00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.420
it's a kickboxing,
right?

138
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.510
So he got his black belt when it was about 11 or something like that.

139
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.890
And that was my thing.

140
00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:08.750
I used to take into kickboxing and pick him up and he's like,
Dad,
can you just,

141
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.640
can you wait outside?
I'm like,

142
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.510
what do you mean you want me to come in and be like,
can you just wait outside?

143
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.010
I like don't want it to come.
It's like,
yeah,

144
00:08:16.011 --> 00:08:18.260
but everyone's like freaking out and looking at you.

145
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.870
<v 0>Well,
it's gotta be nice though.
I know.
I'm fucking coming inside man.</v>

146
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.200
Semi anonymous in crowds now.
Yeah.
Yeah.

147
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.350
Unless someone's a hardcore bodybuilding fan.

148
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.720
<v 1>Well,
there's the thing,
uh,
not necessarily slow because,
uh,</v>

149
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.110
because of the interviews I did on London Real,
um,

150
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.060
and I talked about ios gear and DMT and spirituality in reality and all this

151
00:08:43.061 --> 00:08:47.830
stuff.
I get so many people coming up to me like,
then they're not from the gym.

152
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.260
I get housewives that young kids,
like,

153
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.560
it's almost like you're the guy from London real.
You're the guy that I was.

154
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:59.100
So I got whole bunch of other people that appreciate what I'm saying about

155
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:03.240
spirituality,
about reality and life.
And they're like,
fuck man.
What'd you said?

156
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:04.011
That really helped me.

157
00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:07.500
And so I got so many letters and emails and stuff to people,
you know,

158
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:12.180
like they just took something away from what I was saying.
So,
I mean that's,

159
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.070
that's really why I do these interviews.

160
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:17.850
It's just trying to help the whole general vibe and the,
you know,

161
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.870
put it out there and uh,

162
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.480
there's a whole consciousness awakening and revolution going on now and I'm just

163
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:29.130
want to push some dominoes,
you know,
and like create that effect.

164
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.320
And then,
you know,
if you touch one person,

165
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.630
they touch somebody else and it's like,
you know,

166
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:36.930
the butterfly wings flap here and the other side of the world was uh,
you know,

167
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.500
yeah,
it really ami or something.

168
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.800
<v 0>It does seem to be working in that,
in that regard.
Right?
It is,
it is the time,</v>

169
00:09:42.801 --> 00:09:43.090
man.

170
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:48.090
<v 1>The time is so many people that are more aware now than like 20 years ago</v>

171
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.980
<v 0>isn't it kind of like mean there's parallels to bodybuilding,
right?
It Net,</v>

172
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.090
when Arnold first started doing it,
there was very little information,

173
00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:01.130
Farley and you guys got to see what they did and build upon that and more

174
00:10:01.131 --> 00:10:03.200
information came out.
And now because of the Internet,

175
00:10:03.201 --> 00:10:06.380
there's so much information,
too much information,
more aware,

176
00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:10.190
more of what it's all about.
Well with Psychedelics,

177
00:10:10.191 --> 00:10:11.750
I mean 2030 years ago,

178
00:10:11.751 --> 00:10:15.740
there's so much ignorance and so little understanding of,

179
00:10:15.741 --> 00:10:17.420
and also so little understanding,

180
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.060
especially when it comes to something as extreme as Dmt,

181
00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.780
there's still a giant percentage of our population doesn't even know what it is.

182
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.020
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean,
they should all take it,
especially the fucking politicians.</v>

183
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.450
I'd like to get those politicians,
man,

184
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:35.160
I'm fucking get them in a room and forced them to take DMT and then see how

185
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:36.510
they're going to behave afterwards,

186
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.800
how they're going to look at the world and treat people after they've had that

187
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:45.060
experience.
I don't,
I don't think it can be,
uh,
you know,

188
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:49.980
so self centered and on feeling as most of them are after you've had that

189
00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:50.814
experience.

190
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.990
<v 0>I think that any breakthrough psychedelic experience,
whether it's silicide been,</v>

191
00:10:54.991 --> 00:10:58.810
or LSD or DMT,
there's all pretty much,
you know,

192
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.250
ego dissolving roads to the same place.
Well,

193
00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:05.480
Terrence Mckenna used to say the DMT is the center of the Mandola.

194
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.410
The way I described DMT is it's like mushrooms times a million plus aliens.

195
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:14.130
Yeah.
That it just seems so titanic,

196
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:18.120
Lee bazaar that there's like,
I've tried to describe it to be bold,

197
00:11:18.121 --> 00:11:20.390
but I always say,
look,
I'm going to tell her how to do it.

198
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.440
I'm going to give you some bullshit words.

199
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:28.980
<v 1>ECON,
it's no way.
I don't have the words to put it into words,
you know,</v>

200
00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:32.960
you can attempt to do,
I went to this place where it's not a place,
but,
right.

201
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.330
I don't have the word for it.
The places everywhere,
uh,
is like,

202
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.650
and this color is this numbers,

203
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:43.620
shapes and people think things and there's just like is old one fucking thing.

204
00:11:43.621 --> 00:11:48.240
And what I noticed is like my breath was connected to it.

205
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.230
I don't know how it happened.

206
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:54.310
I was in the trip and I went like that and the whole thing moved is I really let

207
00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:58.120
me try this then.
And then the whole thing moves.

208
00:11:58.121 --> 00:12:03.030
And then there was music playing and the music was part of the thing as well.

209
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.830
Like the thing,
I don't even know what to call it,
that thing,

210
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:06.780
the place I don't have it.

211
00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.120
<v 0>Do you know,
we played a bunch of,
uh,
these,
uh,</v>

212
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.260
showman eco rose and the Shama,

213
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.470
cause this is the last time I did it and the sham and rose like literally made

214
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:19.540
the DMT images dance.
Yeah.

215
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.560
Like they had figured out a way with these sounds and songs to integrate these

216
00:12:25.781 --> 00:12:29.560
beats into DMT trips.
And as you would take these trips,

217
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.870
these shamans had figured out the right sounds and songs and how to make the

218
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:38.590
trip more intense and sort of guide it in a strange way.

219
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.100
<v 1>What I had with um,
with a shaman,
with the Ios [inaudible],</v>

220
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.340
he comes around and he sings,

221
00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:49.360
he's a Kairos and this like change his tone and then it goes deeper base in his

222
00:12:49.981 --> 00:12:53.760
chest and it's like,
it's,
it becomes part of it,
you know,

223
00:12:53.761 --> 00:12:58.320
and I was even moving and voluntarily I was my arms,
it's going up,

224
00:12:58.321 --> 00:13:01.380
my body was moving and it's like,
I'm not doing this.

225
00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:02.610
I don't even know how it's happening.

226
00:13:02.611 --> 00:13:05.700
It's like somebody is picking my arms up in the movement.
I was,
you know,

227
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.930
started dancing around with this becoming part of this rhythm.

228
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.873
<v 0>Wow.</v>

229
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:15.380
I had experienced once one of the first times ever did DMT where I saw the

230
00:13:15.381 --> 00:13:17.390
difference between negative and positive thinking.

231
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:22.160
Like I started thinking negative and there was all this like black and dark

232
00:13:22.161 --> 00:13:26.780
green,
these uh,
threatening shapes and colors.

233
00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:32.080
And then something recognized what was going on in my brain that these shapes

234
00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:36.260
and images were connected to negative thinking.

235
00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.550
And I relaxed in the shapes,
kind of like settled down.

236
00:13:40.551 --> 00:13:42.740
And then I started thinking positive.

237
00:13:42.741 --> 00:13:46.070
Like I heard all these like expressions of love,

238
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.530
but like you're hearing it but you're not really hearing it.

239
00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.390
It's like the thoughts are getting into your head.

240
00:13:50.391 --> 00:13:53.270
Like someone's trying to say it without using words.

241
00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:58.660
And then I started thinking positive and from those dark images blossomed.

242
00:13:58.911 --> 00:14:00.080
He's like beautiful,

243
00:14:00.081 --> 00:14:05.081
like geometric flowers and colors and impossibly spectacularly beautiful images.

244
00:14:06.321 --> 00:14:08.700
And I was like,
oh.
And I,
I,

245
00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.700
I've recognized in my mind there is an actual thing that happens when you think

246
00:14:13.701 --> 00:14:15.240
negatively and an actual,

247
00:14:15.241 --> 00:14:18.440
it's not just some sort of an abstract idea to affect the program.

248
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:19.520
They're in a program.

249
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.570
<v 1>Yeah.
And your thoughts,</v>

250
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.270
the program's coming towards you and your thoughts are going to,

251
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.550
and it's interacting with the program.

252
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:31.400
<v 0>And that's why conflict like interpersonal conflict between people can be so</v>

253
00:14:31.401 --> 00:14:32.210
negative.

254
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.340
It's not just as simple as you and some person getting into an argument.

255
00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.200
It's those dark images and those negative forces,

256
00:14:39.201 --> 00:14:41.510
it becomes a part of your system.

257
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.640
<v 1>I had exactly the same thing,
so,</v>

258
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.160
but it was almost like a tunnel.
I was in this tunnel and it was the same thing.

259
00:14:49.161 --> 00:14:53.720
I was like,
yeah,
all these images around and scary and everything.

260
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.810
And I was like,
I instinctively,

261
00:14:56.811 --> 00:15:01.811
I knew it'd be very relaxed and I started laughing like fuck you and not even

262
00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:03.620
real.
You're not even real.

263
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.430
And when I said that it went away and I just got this thing that came into my

264
00:15:07.431 --> 00:15:12.230
head.
You've just been in the valley.
Um,
what's it called?

265
00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.720
The Valley of the shadow of death.
As soon as the Lord's prayer,
I think.
Yeah,

266
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.980
you're though we walk through the Valley of the shadow of death.

267
00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.380
I fear no evil because God's part aside,

268
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.260
I vaguely remember it from school or something,

269
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.890
but I got this thing and that you were there and you're in the valley of the

270
00:15:27.891 --> 00:15:31.910
shadow of death and because you like fuck,
you would like,
oh,
it's not even real.

271
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.990
It just,
it just disappeared.
And then it went to somewhere really nice.

272
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.130
Wow.

273
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.380
<v 0>Yeah.
I just wonder how much is real.
You know,
it's,
it's a,</v>

274
00:15:41.381 --> 00:15:45.470
it's such a hippie thing to say like,
how much is real?
I don't know.
You know,

275
00:15:45.471 --> 00:15:48.980
I've been having these thoughts a lot lately.
I'm like,
how much of,

276
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.480
how much of live do you manifest?
How much of life is real?

277
00:15:53.481 --> 00:15:55.340
Because it's such a bullshit thing to think.

278
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:58.610
It's such a hippie thing to think in so many people that say that are so

279
00:15:58.611 --> 00:15:59.210
annoying.

280
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:03.380
<v 1>Yeah.
But scientists are saying the same thing now.
Quantum physicists of saying,</v>

281
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:07.510
uh,
it was a fingers,
his name's professor guides.

282
00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.560
I know if you're familiar with them,
professor gates.
And uh,

283
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.600
he said that they've broken down reality into the smallest level and it's a

284
00:16:17.691 --> 00:16:21.650
computer code.
Yes.
I've seen that guy.
He's a computer code.

285
00:16:21.651 --> 00:16:26.651
It's a specific computer code of Zeros and ones and it was invented in the 1940s

286
00:16:26.781 --> 00:16:27.390
by somebody.

287
00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:30.140
<v 0>Yeah,
I've seen that guy being interviewed.
Um,</v>

288
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:33.570
we actually talked about it with Neil degrasse Tyson and he,

289
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:37.830
I tried to get him to sort of break it down and explain,

290
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:43.070
but what it is is essentially that when you break reality down to the smallest

291
00:16:43.291 --> 00:16:46.530
level,
it mimics a self correcting computer code.

292
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.590
Not just not just a computer code,
but a computer code that self-correcting,

293
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.430
which is right there.

294
00:16:53.431 --> 00:16:56.100
I just had a bunch of noises that I don't even understand that,
you know,

295
00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.420
it's just,
it's gone beyond my,

296
00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.520
<v 1>now you're getting a spirituality and science,
right.</v>

297
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:04.350
He's coming together because the scientists are saying what spiritual masters or

298
00:17:04.351 --> 00:17:07.260
the already telling us is that we live in an illusion and everything is inside,

299
00:17:07.261 --> 00:17:11.760
not outside.
They were saying that thousands of years ago,
but it's real

300
00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:15.290
<v 0>like you have to work hard or you don't get results,
right.
Like your,</v>

301
00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:20.430
your hard fast pragmatic reality of being the best bodybuilder in the world

302
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.300
revolves around actual work.
Real results

303
00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:29.260
<v 1>in this,
in this reality and this program,
but also to do physical stuff.
Yeah,</v>

304
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.490
<v 0>probably there was a lot of mental shit going on there too.
Absolutely.</v>

305
00:17:33.491 --> 00:17:36.690
The work was being done,
but also there was probably a four.

306
00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.400
<v 1>It's all day.
I mean,
that's all I thought about it literally all fucking day.
So,</v>

307
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.170
you know,
I had to have the physical goods to make it happen.

308
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.120
I could dream about being a basketball player,
old.

309
00:17:48.121 --> 00:17:51.450
I probably help me because I'm not built to be a basketball player.

310
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.450
What those thoughts were just going out all the time.

311
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:56.430
And I was a kid in Birmingham,

312
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:01.050
industrial city in England,
and I was thinking,

313
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:03.360
I'm going to go to America and I'm going to be a bodybuilder.

314
00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:08.080
And everyone around me was like,
the fuck you talking about.
Um,

315
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.230
so yeah,
that was,
it was those thoughts all the time.

316
00:18:10.231 --> 00:18:14.430
So I think it's like a holographic program.
We're in,

317
00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:18.480
what we influenced that we interact with it,
with our thoughts.

318
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.800
That's kind of where I'm getting that now in some way.
