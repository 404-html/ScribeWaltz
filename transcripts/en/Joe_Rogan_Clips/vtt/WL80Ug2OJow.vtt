00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.150
My main objective and everything I've been embarking on and being a father

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.760
myself with,
it's all been kind of a fresh start.
I feel fresh.

3
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:12.120
It filled newer fields not in cause stopping that and could be in my way and

4
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:13.410
it's just awesome feeling.

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.680
So this is from doing that one DMT experiences sent you until I did one time,

6
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:22.920
but I didn't meet many times that,
that you know,
but yeah,
this really,
um,

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.900
I don't know what it is.
I'm trying to figure it out,
but I've changed but it's,

8
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.310
don't figure it out.
I just don't know how.

9
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.750
<v 1>Yeah.
Um,
I describe it for a lot of people.
It's like resetting a computer.</v>

10
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.310
You reset a computer,

11
00:00:36.311 --> 00:00:39.820
you have a fresh new desktop and there's only one folder on the desktop and that

12
00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:41.490
folder says my old bullshit.

13
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.150
<v 0>Listen,
stop.
I'm finding my thought right now.</v>

14
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.290
Sometimes I'm wondering this new feeling that I'm possessing right now,
if it,

15
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:51.120
I'm a real feeling this stuff really help.

16
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.940
Am I lying to myself again till the next moment,

17
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:57.140
the next feeling come to do some drug,
but the B,
it was somebody else.

18
00:00:57.141 --> 00:00:59.550
And what's really going on as that feeling going to come back,

19
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.460
there's this moment that feeling feel like it never coming back.

20
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.410
<v 1>It can never come back if you decide that it's never coming back,</v>

21
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.040
but you have to make that decision pretty much every day,
but you can,

22
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.850
you can never come back if you want or you could slip into the old ways.

23
00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:15.350
That's what a lot of people do.
One of the,

24
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:19.760
when a lot of people fall into drug additions,
relapsing,
when they relapse,

25
00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:21.920
they're not physically addicted.
When they're relapsed,

26
00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:24.530
obviously they're clean and then he decided to go back in.

27
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.970
It's cause there's comfort in those old patterns because this new way of life is

28
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:33.200
just,
they get anxiety.
They feel like it's a lot of pressure to stay clean.

29
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.120
<v 0>Well,
that's explained it.
I hate that.
I always hated that.</v>

30
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.900
Oh well I never wanted to do,
but then I do him again.
I never wanted,

31
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:41.470
I hated thousand now.
No,

32
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.580
no.
Come on.
You understand what I'm saying?
No,
I don't want to fuck.

33
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.190
I don't want that.
And then once you,
and once you do it,
then he's going all out.

34
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:56.280
Now you got the liquor there,
the girl,
ah man,

35
00:01:56.281 --> 00:02:00.120
this is just a dark dog.
Vicious cycle.
It's real dark.

36
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.210
It's self destruct dog.
Yeah.

37
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.280
It's all about ego inflating and self deprecating enough to structure.

38
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.130
It also alleviates

39
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.210
<v 1>you from the responsibility of improving the hundred percent.</v>

40
00:02:13.211 --> 00:02:17.050
That pressure of like keeping it together,
staying sober,
you know,

41
00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:20.870
being disciplined,
all that stuff.
Once it's gone,
it's gone.
Like,
hi,

42
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:23.740
I'm just fucking crazy.
I'm crazy.
This is just what I do.
I'm crazy.

43
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.010
And it's easy to fall into that trap and that's what happens to a lot of people

44
00:02:27.011 --> 00:02:30.820
who relapse with drugs.
I never want to go back to that again.

45
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.790
It's just no win situation.

46
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.840
That's one of the great things about marijuana that people don't understand.

47
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.150
They think that a drug is a drug as a drug.

48
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.040
They're all falling under the same category,

49
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.460
but you can use marijuana and just be peaceful and not chaotic.

50
00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:52.090
And the opposite of make you think more about the consequences of ruining your

51
00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:52.540
life.
