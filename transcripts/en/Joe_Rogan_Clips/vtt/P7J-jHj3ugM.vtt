1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.140
Speaking of sustainable are you have a showtime special coming out tomorrow

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.370
night?
Wow,
that was a great segue.
It's pretty good.
I was,
I should be on radio.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.150
I should get a radio real radio show.
Yeah,

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:13.801
yeah.

5
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:18.770
Joseline sequitur Rogan Ted.

6
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.310
Yeah.
Yeah.
So do I.
A showtime special tomorrow.
Friday.

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.320
What's tomorrow?
The OLED 10th the 10th,
sorry.
Uh,
Friday,
August 10th,

8
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.170
10:00 PM East Coast.
West Coast,
showtime.
It's called keep talking pal.
And so the,

9
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.750
there it is,
10 seconds on that.
They said,
what are you going to name it?

10
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.290
And I said,
keep talking pal.
They go,
what does that mean?
It's just,

11
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:42.510
it's how you talk yourself in and out of trouble.

12
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.500
Like you're about to get punched out.
Like keep talking pal.
You'll,

13
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:49.740
if you don't get a laugh,
you're not getting out of this bar.

14
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.670
And that's kind of how I came into talking shows was being as a young guy,

15
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.570
skinny on Ritalin,
not a good fighter,
not a good fighter at all.

16
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.900
Just not into it.
And you know,
the local bully,

17
00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:05.900
I've said something snarky or funny and you know,

18
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.450
all of a sudden he's got me by the scruff of my shirt with a fist in my face.

19
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.410
And the only thing you can do is like imitate him so much that everyone else

20
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:16.350
laughs and like he has to drop you because he's now like drop ball,

21
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:20.970
drop your collar,
not your body because you're now making him laugh.

22
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.740
And so when in doubt,
keep talking pal.
And the fact that I have a quote,

23
00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:30.600
comedy special on showtime is so unlikely from some guy from the minimum wage

24
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:33.780
working world,
I don't believe it myself.
And so they said,

25
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:36.520
what are you going to call at night?
A lot of these,
you know,
people,

26
00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:37.510
they have a lot of confidence.

27
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.490
I'm going to call it like just truck me and my mighty Wang take this.

28
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.340
Like I don't have any of that.
So like keep talking pal,

29
00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:46.080
because I know I'm really not supposed to be there.

30
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.360
So how did you do your first show?
Like what,

31
00:01:49.361 --> 00:01:52.780
what made you do your first talking show?
$5.
Um,

32
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.630
in 1983,

33
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.930
a little one you on Hudson right off of like about 10 paces north of Santa

34
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.490
Monica Boulevard.
It's like a treat.
The dead ends on to Santa Monica Boulevard.

35
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.541
It was an art space.

36
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:08.541
They're called the Lasa club and there was a local promoter in town,

37
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.650
amazing guy.
And he would get like 25 people on stage in one night.

38
00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:16.140
Everyone gets five minutes,
it'd be the singer of that band,

39
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:18.900
the drummer of that band,
that artists,
that poet,

40
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.820
like real artists who speak for a living.

41
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.540
And then the guy with the funny toward journal or the guy from the band that we

42
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:27.000
all like and he's going to be an idiot for five minutes.

43
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.980
And these shows were really fun cause it just,

44
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.050
people are offstage all night long,

45
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.170
like running off stage and the bass player in black flag truck to cal state and

46
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:40.350
the Fed,
fantastic intellect.
He would get invited onto these bills.

47
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.570
I would go with him because we were beached guys.

48
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:45.150
We lived in the sticks and the gigs were in Hollywood.

49
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:47.610
So we'll go into the big smoke.
We'll go see the big city.

50
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.140
I'd go with him because he had the band van,
he'd go into town,
I'd tag along.

51
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.890
So He'd read out of some notebook has apocalyptic rantings and one night the

52
00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:00.970
promoter said you got a big mouth next week,

53
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.670
you five minutes or like would have seven minutes,
five bucks.

54
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.450
All I could think of was the five bucks and like what I could,

55
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.120
because we're starving.
Yeah.
As any band was.

56
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.600
And so the next show I got onstage at Lasa told a story that what had happened

57
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:19.510
at band practice the day before where a white supremacy in a car tried to run

58
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:20.680
over our guitar player.

59
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.520
Cause we had brown skinned people at our band practice.

60
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.210
And so he yelled,

61
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.230
he accused our guitar player of being a lover and tried to run him over on his

62
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:33.070
way to the liquor store to get some orange juice.

63
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.340
So our guitar player comes back a little shaken and nearly got run over by a Neo

64
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.200
Nazi and let's go back to practice.
And so for us,

65
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:45.360
that was as Tuesday and the life of black flag for an audience,
they're like,
oh,

66
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.030
you,
your jaws hit the ground.
And then I read something I'd written,
I go,
well,

67
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:50.680
my five minutes are up,
or whatever it was,

68
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:53.500
and I left the stage and it felt right.

69
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.130
I felt like a fish dropped into water for the first time.
Like,
Hey,
I'm a fish.

70
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.240
Like I didn't have a band,

71
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.970
but I had no stage fright and this me and a microphone,

72
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:04.600
it felt more natural than music ever felt,

73
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.590
which was cool to do,
but never felt natural.
Just felt like,

74
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:10.450
is it this thing is in me,
has got to come out.

75
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.340
I'm serving a monster where the talking shows like,
yeah,
this is me.

76
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.330
And after the show people came up and said,
what's your next show?
I said,
well,

77
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:23.500
I'm leaving on tour.
They go,
no,
no,
no,
when you're just talking.
I said,
well,
no,

78
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:26.170
that's a one off.
I got this $5 bill.
I'm Outta here.

79
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.540
And so the agent that the promoter guy said,
okay,
you're very good at that.

80
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.980
You're a natural.
So how about this?

81
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.880
I promote all these different poets and performance artists.
I'll get you,

82
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:41.680
I'll give you 20 bucks,
you'll do 20 minutes opening for this guy.
Okay.

83
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.753
So I,
you know,

84
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.110
did 20 minutes and then after a handful of those shows,

85
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:52.060
those poet types we're opening for me because the black flag aspect kicks in

86
00:04:52.061 --> 00:04:56.830
like almost a dude from black flag people show up.
And I guess I was good enough.

87
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.600
And so those poets weren't that happy like I Mao opening for this guy.
Okay.

88
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.080
And that was 83 turning into 84 by 85 I had gone to Europe for some poetry

89
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:11.710
festival,
which I kind of blabbed on to in Holland.

90
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.600
I had done a cross country tour,

91
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.810
12 to 50 people in night's sleep on the promoters couch go by Amtrak and started

92
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:23.440
my little book company or 83 84 self published to this day.

93
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.820
That's awesome.

94
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.470
And it went from strength to strength and now it's a 14 month tour that takes in

95
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:34.000
20 countries,
multiple nights in cities at nice theaters.

96
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.980
Do you only use yourself for your publishing company or do you publish anybody

97
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:43.180
else's books?
We used to,
uh,
many years ago we,
I uh,

98
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.270
people I knew who I thought were great writers,
I put them out.

99
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:50.410
We licensed nick caves books from his publishers in Europe.
Uh,

100
00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:52.180
we licensed a few different titles.

101
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:56.740
We did photo books and a couple of novels,
short story collections.

102
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.860
And it's very hard to,
uh,
have a book company.

103
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:05.120
It's hard to sell a book in the world unless it's like Stephen King or Danielle

104
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.950
Steele x Mega,
you know,
at the,
at the cash register at the airport store.

105
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.910
Uh,
if you're selling poetry books,
different kinds of literature,

106
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:18.110
you are nothing but uphill.
My books did okay.
They still,
they always do.
Okay.

107
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.030
Everyone else's books is like trying to sell dead animal guts,

108
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:25.070
you know what I mean?
Like no one,
no one's that interested.

109
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:28.920
They'll look but they don't want to take it home.
And so,
um,

110
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.880
we stopped signing new writers,

111
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.240
sold through the press runs,
let the licenses run out.

112
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:36.590
Everyone got to keep their masters.

113
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.370
And then we just concentrated on me because a,

114
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:45.140
I keep a whole staff busy with all this stuff I've got going.
And so we publish,

115
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.750
but we publish me and I've done a bunch of books.

116
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.490
How many books have you written?
About 27.
Holy Shit.
I got nothing else going on.

117
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.490
Uh,
all the two of them.
Uh,
we,

118
00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.320
I wanted to do a photo book a few years ago and Heidi,
who runs all my company,

119
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:03.110
she's the smart one.
So I showed her the manuscript,
she goes,
okay,

120
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:03.944
the book is great,

121
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.150
but let's not do it on our company cause it's a lot of startup money for a photo

122
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:09.770
book.
It's just a lot of setup costs.

123
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.700
Let's get you a literary agent and do it somewhere else.

124
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.380
And so smart idea.

125
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:19.310
And so we got a literary agent and we did get a book deal with a very good,
uh,

126
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:24.080
Chicago,
uh,
as a Chicago Company,
um,
Chicago review,

127
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.400
I'm forgetting.
Um,

128
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.760
and they put out the photo book and that was a learning experience.

129
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.670
Like working with an editor.
Like I'll go,
go,
well,
here's the cover.
And they,

130
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.800
well we're going to have a meeting about that.
And I'm like,

131
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:36.500
you're having a meeting.
It's my book.
It's my book cover.

132
00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:39.080
Cause I'm used to owning my own machine.

133
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.700
But when you work with other people's money,
everyone has a big opinion.
So that,

134
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.420
that book came out and did and continues to do very well.

135
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.670
And many years ago I did a kind of a best of,
if I have any best of material,

136
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:55.700
I did a best of for random house many,

137
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:58.850
many years ago that you still see it.
It's in print.

138
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.930
And that's a lot of people's first book of mine cause it's in stores.
