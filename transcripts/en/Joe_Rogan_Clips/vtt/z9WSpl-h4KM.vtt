1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.720
George.
Yeah,
George coming in.
I'm,
I asked George,

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.420
so my work,
they're like,
hey,

3
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:09.690
can you see what's up with George and this Nate Diaz?
And I'm like,
oh,
ask.
But,

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.470
and I'll ask honestly as a friend in it,

5
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.170
and he knows that I'm also employed by somebody who I have a little
conversation,

6
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:16.590
but,

7
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.590
but I will never ever sacrifice a friendship or like a longterm relationship to

8
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:26.770
like find something out of it.
Yeah.
I don't care about,

9
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.570
I don't care about Twitter beefs and I don't care about the breaking news and

10
00:00:31.571 --> 00:00:34.090
all that.
Just not interesting.
It's not anything to do with my life.

11
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.140
But I'll go ask George.
So I asked George,
who we are friends,

12
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.620
we talked yesterday and uh,
we will,

13
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.680
he will tell me the truth and then,

14
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.210
and something as simple as all,
you know,
not as fucking bullshit.

15
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.780
Maybe not in exactly those terms,
but he would say.
But when I asked him about it,

16
00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:57.460
he's like,
no,
Bro.
Uh,
I haven't signed nothing.
And I looked at that and like,

17
00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.920
oh my God,
that's George tried to be deceptive.

18
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.460
Like George would normally go as be,
man,
that's not happening.

19
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.450
I know I haven't signed anything.
Well,
I know they've offered him,

20
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.360
but that was George,
who's Shitty at being deceptive,

21
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.410
trying to be deceptive like he,
yeah,
so like you said,
they've offered it to,

22
00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:17.080
they've offered it to him and by saying I haven't signed it means he's

23
00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:17.830
considering it.

24
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.940
<v 1>I think he's considering it,</v>

25
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.870
but I think he's also considering could be number Grumet off and then there's

26
00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:27.830
always the great Irish Leprechaun,
you know?
I mean,

27
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.180
I think those are the two big fights.
The two big fights or could be,

28
00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:33.600
but at one 55 or even one 70 yeah.

29
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.990
GSP wants to winner of Conor McGregor versus could be not Nate Diaz insider

30
00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:42.310
drops bombshell and this is May 19th Saturday.
Oh yeah,

31
00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:43.330
I'm sure he wants that.

32
00:01:43.331 --> 00:01:46.600
But that fight would have to take place first and who the fuck knows when Connor

33
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:50.860
or it could be,
but fight afterwards,
if it's Connor,
he might be a decade later.

34
00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:52.960
I mean,
who the fuck knows what that guys going to do?

35
00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:56.770
Now when you give a guy like Conor a hundred million dollars,
you know,

36
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.030
I mean this is what happens.

37
00:01:58.031 --> 00:02:02.260
He's throwing dollars at bus windows and losing his fucking mind and yeah,

38
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.920
it's come out of Jamie that UFC inside of a shop,
was it?
Yeah,

39
00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:10.040
it was on his podcast.
I did saw that as I just scrolled down since UFC inside,

40
00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:14.650
I just was Brendan shot those who Brendan Schaub as you fucking idiots.

41
00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:18.960
That some obscure insider.
Yeah,

42
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.010
well I'm sure he does want that,

43
00:02:21.011 --> 00:02:24.340
but if they offer him a fat paycheck and they really should,
if they want.
Look,

44
00:02:24.341 --> 00:02:28.780
the UFC is in a weird position.
They,
they bought the company for $4 billion.

45
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.100
I don't know what it's worth,

46
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.100
but I would guess it's probably not really worth $4 billion.

47
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.250
They have a giant monthly,
not,
it's fucking huge.

48
00:02:36.251 --> 00:02:40.690
The monthly nut that they have to make caused them to fire a hundred employees.

49
00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:43.810
I mean there's a lot going on and there's been some,
you know,

50
00:02:43.811 --> 00:02:47.260
great fights and it's obviously still incredibly popular,

51
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.390
but you want to make those big paper view bucks,
you need the big name stars.

52
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.600
GSP was always a big name star became even bigger when he came back and beat

53
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.580
Bisbing and one by finish.

54
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:03.040
And so you've got them in a rear naked choke and put them to sleep.

55
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.420
I mean he's still a giant star.
However he hasn't fought in a while.

56
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:09.730
Vacated at title,
doesn't have the title anymore.

57
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.770
So it's not as big of a deal to the public size when his hit though.
It is,

58
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.960
it is.
People are dumb as shit man.
Yeah.

59
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.940
<v 0>The funny thing to me is like,
I always feel like,
and,</v>

60
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.010
and I almost feel like a lot of these mechanisms,
title shots,

61
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:30.250
rankings,
belts,
uh,
you know,
Twitter beefs,

62
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.400
they weren't intended to be there as a short term solution to give people a

63
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:40.390
talking point until they saw how,
till they got deeply invested in connected.

64
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.590
Right.
And I think that was,

65
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.830
but yet somehow these sort of extra outside distractions became the focus.

66
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.350
Who the fuck cares?
Who's the number eight guy?

67
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.250
And who cares if these guys are mad at each other on Twitter?

68
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:58.330
And the belt itself has a mechanism for discussion.
What matters is the fight.

69
00:03:58.331 --> 00:03:58.360
Yeah.
