WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.150
And did you become involved with certain,
so that would be,

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.600
I started doing particle physics in 95 and when was,

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.210
when did the large Hadron collider go live?
That was,
um,

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.760
I remember it was 2000 and

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.950
2007 I think it was a 2008.
It's so long ago.

6
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.920
I was about 10 years ago.
But he started up,

7
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:26.370
we started up and then we had a problem with it and then it took a while to fix.

8
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.160
Um,
so has it been taking data that long?

9
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.210
But it's a tremendously successful thing now and it's,

10
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.990
it's operating beyond its design capabilities.
It's quite incredible.

11
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.670
It's so stunning.
Is the thing that this,
I mean,
how large is it?

12
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.690
How large?
The largest,
he said he's 27 kilometers,
so I'd say about 16 miles.

13
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.680
16 miles.
And it's a circular.
Yeah.
Sort of a building.
Yeah.

14
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.360
Well you see it's a big tube.

15
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.510
And when you think basically it's mo mainly under France and partly into

16
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:59.400
Switzerland.
And he accelerates protons around in a circle.
Now both ways.

17
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.710
They won't.
One beam goes,
well,
my one goes the other way.

18
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.970
And they go round 11,000 times a second cause that's the very close,

19
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.600
the speed of light in 99.999999% the speed of light.

20
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.960
And then we crossed the beams and collide the particles.

21
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.640
And in there's collisions,

22
00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.940
you're recreating the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a

23
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:21.750
second after the big bang.
So we know that physics,

24
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.570
so going back when you said about the carbon and the oxygen,

25
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.100
we can trace that story back way beyond the time when they were protons and

26
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:34.101
neutrons to when they were quarks and gluons around and then go all the way back

27
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:39.351
and the Higgs Boson doing its thing back then so we can see all that physics in

28
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:45.030
the lab.
So that's why we have some,
a lot of confidence in that story.

29
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.620
It's so fascinating that they were able to talk someone into funding that,

30
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.610
that they got a bunch of people together and that you,

31
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.070
you were able to explain to politicians and,

32
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.310
and you know,
regular people what you're trying to do.

33
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.630
It's a great example of how you get something done.
So it was the night,

34
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.040
the 50s when certain was established,
I think it was 53 or 54,

35
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.050
can't quite remember.
It's something like that.

36
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.670
And then it was bill from the Second World War,
so say,
yeah,

37
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:19.020
you're up at the end of the war.

38
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.900
And it was realized that the only way forward for your,

39
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:26.901
it was collaboration to rebuild the scientific base and in for peace for

40
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:28.890
peaceful purposes.

41
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.030
And so cern was set up as an international collaboration in Europe initially

42
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.070
with that political ideal that it would,
it would explore nature,

43
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.630
uh,
just for,

44
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.590
for freely and for peace,

45
00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:48.450
for peaceful means and peaceful reasons.
And so that was,
uh,
the Poli,

46
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.800
the politics was right.
So we set it by international treaty so that the men,

47
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:57.801
the states are bound together by treaty and they pay a small man relatively

48
00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:02.320
small amount each into cern every year,
which is a percentage of their GDP.

49
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.680
And that's the money they used to build the experiments and build the

50
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:09.490
accelerators.
So it's very hard to get out of it.

51
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.480
And you wouldn't really want to because it's a small amount of money per country

52
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.270
and certain doesn't get extra money to build things.

53
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.780
It just takes his money and basically saves up and plans itself.

54
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.290
But because it's got a regular stream of money,
it can do it.
They can say,

55
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:26.350
we're going to build this machine and it will take eight years because that's

56
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:27.730
how much money we've got.

57
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.760
Now we're building in eight years and we know how much money we've got so we can

58
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:34.180
do it.
You know,
it's the lesson.
I mean the reason that the u s collider,

59
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.190
the SSC failed is because it's the problem you have in the us with the funding

60
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:42.490
system as you've seen in the last few weeks,

61
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.650
is that it's very arbitrary and it's open to political maneuvering and things

62
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:50.560
can be shut down and take an answer.
And he's not like that.

63
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.680
Cerner has got a guaranteed stream of funding small from each country,

64
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.430
and so you can do these projects.

65
00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:00.730
And the one in the u s that was during the Clinton administration as I would,

66
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:04.000
it was a,
yeah,
it was closed.
Was it Clinton here?

67
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.060
It was closed down for by Congress on a very slim vote and it was,

68
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.930
it was in Texas,
so it was,

69
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.680
it was one of those things where you've got states vying for money and he was

70
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:18.280
half built and everyone was there,
you know,
and the thing,

71
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:23.080
it was bigger than the LHC and it was closed down.
So you waste a lot of money.

72
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.900
Is that a huge disappointment for scientific community?

73
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:28.470
Like where people are very hopeful that this was going to go alarm,

74
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.180
it was being built.
So it Doug,
half the tunnel.

75
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.110
What would it be able to do that the LHC couldn't,

76
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.490
it was a higher energy accelerated than the LHC.

77
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.050
So it would have discovered the Higgs particle first.
Uh,
had it been running,

78
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.480
but the,
the half bill part,

79
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:46.870
is it useless now or can they I think sort of filled the,
charge it up again now.

80
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:51.400
I think they filled it in.
I think so.
I mean it was just half a tunnel,
you know?

81
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.850
That's the thing,
it,

82
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.960
you can do these wonderful things for not a lot of money if you just do it over

83
00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:03.490
many years now.
Stable funding and just commit to doing it.

84
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:06.670
The filling and end part hustler and you look at certain as well and people,

85
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.030
yeah,
people ask me now,
I think the UK pays a bow.

86
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.160
It's about a hundred million dollars a year.

87
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.700
That's what the UK pays in and it's that same for Germany.

88
00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:18.940
Same for France and so on.
And some people say,
what do we get for that?
I mean,

89
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:19.780
first of all,
it's not,

90
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.040
the whole budget of cern is about the same as a budget of a medium sized

91
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:28.360
university.
So it's not a lot.
It's about a billion dollars a year or something,

92
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:31.060
which is what a university has.

93
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.860
So it's not a lot in the scheme of things.
What's it done though?

94
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.440
While we invented the World Wide Web,
as we've just said,

95
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.060
a lot of the medical imaging technology that we use comes from cern and has

96
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:46.450
pioneered the use of these very high field magnets,
which is what it needed.

97
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.380
So it's,
it's engineering at the edge and engineering at the edge,
uh,

98
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.560
generates spinoffs and expertise to get used in other fields.

99
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.430
So as cancer treatments,
so called had Ron beam therapy.
So you got a brain tumor.

100
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:02.420
Now it's quite likely that you'll have one of these targeted particle beam

101
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:06.580
therapists,
which is like very highly targeted sort of chemotherapy.

102
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.371
It's not chemotherapy,

103
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:11.810
it's just radiation that you can target in a beam into your head and attack the

104
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:15.350
tumor.
And those,
those are particle accelerators.

105
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.030
So most particle accelerators today are in hospitals and in medicine,

106
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.460
but they came from doing particle physics that,
so the,
the,

107
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.470
the spin offs of these big experiments at the edge of our capability are always

108
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:35.090
immense,
which is why they're worth funding at these very low levels.

109
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.010
But it's not just the knowledge,

110
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.250
it's the engineering expertise that there is a practical application for every,

111
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.470
every day.
They're always,

112
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.190
it's just finding out how to do hard things is usually useful.
