1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.040
That you guys have.
Yeah,

2
00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:05.850
way lower health care and s student,

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.090
we pay for it with taxes,
right?
Yeah.
But it's worth it.
I mean,

4
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:10.480
I've said time and time.
Look,

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.450
I believe in a hybrid form of,

6
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:20.180
of governing in a hybrid form of,
of culture.
And I think that,
um,

7
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.710
I've supported a lot of socialized ideas.

8
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.190
And one of the reasons why is because I see socialism work with the fire

9
00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:28.590
department,
with the police department,
with,

10
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:31.760
with things that we all agree that we're going to chip in and pay for.

11
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.550
And the fact that we don't do this with healthcare,
that,
you know,

12
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:39.960
if my neighbor gets sick,
the community has to chip and God dammit,

13
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.850
that guys have been paying taxes his whole life.

14
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:45.930
He's a viable part of the community.
We should be taking care of our own.

15
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:49.530
This should be a primary thing like this to strengthen our community,

16
00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:52.610
to strengthen our civilization.
One of the primary things is you,

17
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.720
we should be taking care of each other physically,
right?
It should be like,

18
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.880
but above all right?
Education.

19
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.000
You shouldn't have to fucking be in debt a quarter million dollars if you get a

20
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.000
fucking education.
Don't we want less losers?

21
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.840
Don't we want more people to have education though we might more people to have

22
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:14.770
some sort of pathway to success.
Wouldn't that just logically lead to a,

23
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.710
a stronger economy,
a stronger communities,
stronger civilization,

24
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.120
wouldn't it?
It was in that logic.

25
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.230
<v 1>Let me give a devil's advocate advocate answer to the extent that there are now</v>

26
00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:29.920
no longer any barriers to entry to get into university.

27
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.890
Certainly in Canada at least not a financial one.
You get,

28
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.100
I think a misallocation of talent and resources where everybody feels compelled

29
00:01:39.311 --> 00:01:41.710
to go to university,
where in reality,

30
00:01:41.711 --> 00:01:43.420
many of the folks in question and believe me,

31
00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:45.870
I'm the last guy to argue against education,
right?
I'm,

32
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:47.320
I'm all about lifelong learning,

33
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.420
but it doesn't have to be through the formal channels of getting a degree.
Right.

34
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.730
That's not compulsory.
I,
well,

35
00:01:54.731 --> 00:01:59.731
it is compulsory unofficially in that it is now no longer acceptable to not have

36
00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:02.880
at least some entry level the Gri.

37
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.620
<v 0>Well then we should concentrate on that as an issue.
Right.
Okay.</v>

38
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.540
That shouldn't be the issue.

39
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:11.190
Not this idea that somehow or another education should be expensive.

40
00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:14.670
So it should be difficult.
So it should be something that's only sought out by

41
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.550
<v 1>fair enough.
Fair enough.
So,
so I agree it should,</v>

42
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.380
the barrier to entry shouldn't be that,
you know,

43
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:23.460
it's the finances that don't allow you to pursue your interests.
But I know,

44
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:25.980
I mean,
just as a professor for 25 years now,

45
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.620
there are students that I see very early in a,

46
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.650
in a given semester that I know they're not there or they're not there for

47
00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:36.130
intrinsic reasons.
Right.

48
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.230
They just don't have the sparkle in their eyes and no amount of coaxing on my

49
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:42.640
part because ever going to bring them out.
I mean,
I try,
I,

50
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.040
I think everybody is redeemable,

51
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.940
but you can tell that they're there because they don't have,

52
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.200
maybe those people would have had a much more lucrative trajectory where they

53
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.470
pursuit trade school.
Uh,
so,

54
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.590
so I think we have to also be careful about how to allocate the talent that we

55
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:00.360
have.

56
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.360
<v 0>I know that that absolutely makes sense and I think that is most likely played</v>

57
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:08.740
out over the difficulty of pursuing an education.
Right?

58
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.990
Just like it is with everything else,
every everything else,
like whatever,

59
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.720
whatever you try.
If you want to be a standup comedian,

60
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.860
it's not everybody gets to do Carnegie Hall.
Like there's,
there's uh,

61
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.430
there's a weeding out process of the difficulty of achieving success and there's

62
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:25.780
a lot of people that fall by the wayside and don't make it.

63
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:27.880
And this is just natural.
It's a natural part of the process.

64
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:30.880
But if you say not everybody is a comedian,
that's true,

65
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.970
but open Mike nights available to everybody.
True.

66
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.420
And that's why there's so many comedians that actually are good because they do

67
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:41.830
find it through because there's no financial barrier to entry.
If it costs,

68
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.090
you know,

69
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.090
$35,000 a year to pursue an education in comedy and you had to be $200,000 in

70
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:50.230
debt before you could make a living on the road,
right.

71
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.540
There wouldn't be a goddamn thing to laugh at.
There wasn't be none of us.
Right.

72
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.790
There'd be zero of us.
And that's not a good x.

73
00:03:58.791 --> 00:04:02.500
It's a not a good example because obviously comedy is one of the rare things

74
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:05.680
that is a self educated process.
You have to yourself taught.

75
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.630
There's no other way,
right?
You just have to pursue it.

76
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.900
But I think this is the rigidness of university studies,
you know,

77
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.740
the,
the rigidness of courses of,

78
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.670
of determining what people should and shouldn't learn what they should and

79
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:22.080
shouldn't be educated in who you know.
And the also the,

80
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.700
the randomness of the professors that you get.

81
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.300
Like you could get you and get a wonderful education,
I'm sure.

82
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.780
Or you can get some dipshit and get taught about,
you know,

83
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:34.960
how gender is a social construct and you know,

84
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:37.720
and you're sitting in class all baffled,
looking at your penis going,

85
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:40.240
what have you done to me?
Fucking monster.

86
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.270
The rigidness of university studies,
you know,
the,
the rigidness of courses of,

87
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.210
of determining what people should and shouldn't learn what they should and

88
00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:50.910
shouldn't be educated in who.
