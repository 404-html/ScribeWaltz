1
00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.050
Sort of,
um,
it's,

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.650
something's just take a lot of time to sort of get used to and other things sort

3
00:00:05.651 --> 00:00:09.820
of wants.
It's,
it's there.
You kind of used to it in a second.

4
00:00:09.821 --> 00:00:14.420
There's the example earlier this week,
he was driving a,
um,
uh,

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.940
a Tesla on,
on autopilot and um,

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.470
as driving it for five minutes and then already you're kind of doing your emails

7
00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:26.830
and then when you take it off,
it just feels like you're,

8
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.730
you're back in the stone ages when you're just kind of have to drive this

9
00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:31.564
yourself.
It's so weird.

10
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.480
<v 1>So,
so you,
you do your email while you're driving,</v>

11
00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:37.360
you're not even paying attention to the machine and make sure that doesn't hit

12
00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:42.030
some homeless lady who steps out off the median.
Uh,
yeah.

13
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.720
Like one thing that did happen yeah.
With the over a car.
Um,

14
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.540
<v 0>yeah.
I mean I think this,</v>

15
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.290
things like this will come up more rapidly than people think and I think people

16
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:57.380
will be very,
very quickly that we'll use

17
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.310
<v 1>what aren't you doing?
What you're supposed to like look at the road,
right?</v>

18
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.860
Not supposed to be staring down at your laptop.
Yeah.
Okay.

19
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.650
I just erase everything I said for the past minute or to,

20
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.460
have you ever seen the video of the guy that's falling asleep in San Francisco

21
00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:12.010
traffic?
No.
He's completely asleep.

22
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.600
He's behind the wheel of the tussle like this and the cars like slowing and

23
00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:17.870
going with the pace of traffic.

24
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.090
It's really fascinating because this happens so quickly.

25
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.110
I remember a buddy of mine got a Tesla a couple of years ago and he's like,
dude,

26
00:01:26.111 --> 00:01:29.920
I let my hands off the wheel on the highway on like really like that's happening

27
00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:33.760
already.
But it's not just happening like people plug into their navigate here.

28
00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:34.594
This guy look at him.

29
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.930
This guy is stone dead asleep in his Tesla in bumper to bumper San Francisco

30
00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:43.990
traffic and the car is performing flawlessly

31
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.630
<v 0>sad.</v>

32
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.580
This Dutch guy and actually just went to the back of his like on the back seat

33
00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:52.670
and started changing his clothes and oh God.
Yeah.

34
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:56.060
And then apparently they did and now included the safety feature that you kind

35
00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:57.760
of have to touch the wheel every minute.

36
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.780
<v 1>Oh,
that's a new thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Bmw I believe has a similar system,</v>

37
00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:05.190
but you have to have your hand on the wheel at all times.
Yeah.

38
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.800
It's pretty better until it's flawless.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I would imagine.

39
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.701
Yeah.

40
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:13.790
People probably do an all kinds of freaky shit in their cars while this thing is

41
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:18.080
on autopilot.
It's really not what I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's quite amazing how,

42
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.880
I mean,
there was,

43
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.570
you were just about to show a video of Tesla autopilot crash compilations.

44
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.920
They,
it's saving people from crashes is what it's,
Oh,
oh,
I'm sure it does.

45
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.930
What's unbelievable is how few crashes there are and they said they've been two

46
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:34.400
fatalities so far.
Okay.

47
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.620
How many fatalities per capita versus non,
uh,

48
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.770
autopilot cars?
I mean,
I would imagine it's far less.

49
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.910
<v 0>Yeah.
Obviously these cars are also just safer in general.
So,
uh,
they're not,</v>

50
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.260
they're much safer then at an,
uh,
uh,
uh,
1990s Toyota Corolla or something.

51
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:55.940
So in terms of the way the construction,
yeah,
just safer when they crashed.

52
00:02:55.941 --> 00:03:00.910
So I dunno how they compared the sisters statistics,
but,
um,
yeah,

53
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.810
I'm,
I'm very impressed too.
It was fun trying it out.

54
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.610
<v 1>Yeah,
I'm impressed and I'm very hopeful.
The only,
my only concern I had,</v>

55
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.680
my friend Matt Farah was on last week,

56
00:03:10.681 --> 00:03:15.630
and he's a car expert and they've actually started an organization to save human

57
00:03:15.631 --> 00:03:16.800
driving there.

58
00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:21.801
They're literally going to be like lobbyists to to stop.

59
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.390
It doesn't get Ben,
right?
Yeah.

60
00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:27.270
Well that's the concern is that one day they're going to say,

61
00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:30.780
you cannot drive your own car,
and they're really worried that,

62
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.280
what was the name of his organization?
Do you remember?
Okay,
so,

63
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.850
but the,
the,
you know,
they're very serious.
He's like,

64
00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:41.220
it's going to happen quicker than you think you're going.

65
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.030
It's going to be very difficult to drive your own car and then it's going to be

66
00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:45.600
illegal.

67
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.500
<v 0>Yeah.
Maybe they should keep areas like the highway one or things like that.</v>

68
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.480
<v 1>It's just something,
some freaky road where people can get crazy and looking at,</v>

69
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:57.300
hey man,
I'm steering.
I'm hitting my own brakes.
Ooh.
Yeah.

70
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.920
I mean,
again,

71
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.180
these are just things that it's most likely inevitable.
I mean,
this,

72
00:04:03.181 --> 00:04:05.910
this technology,
the way it's progressing,
it's going to be safer.

73
00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:08.100
It's going to be healthier,
lower emissions,

74
00:04:08.101 --> 00:04:10.560
all these variables that are going to come into play where people are gonna say

75
00:04:10.561 --> 00:04:11.394
no,
there's just,

76
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.840
there's the benefit of driving your own car is not worth a detriment to society.

77
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.580
<v 0>Yeah.
And next to that,
uh,
just if you think about the,</v>

78
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.620
the normal rate of converting the entire car fleet to electric,

79
00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:29.280
it would be around 20 years because that's sort of how long cars last.

80
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.760
And you only produce a few hundred million cars a year and there's billions of

81
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:37.470
cars.
So,
um,
so yeah,
if you don't want that to take 20 years,

82
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.890
well I think autonomy then really has to come into play because if you have

83
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.600
autonomous cars,
you need much less cars out there,
then you would,

84
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.550
if you would have to drive themselves,

85
00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:52.500
because obviously cars are just driving maybe 3% of their time,
uh,

86
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.060
the time there,
they're just being parked so they can drive themselves.

87
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.350
I think the utilization of the number of cars would be much higher.
And,
um,

88
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.010
I think that the whole transition to electric cars would happen much faster.

89
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.280
<v 1>So human driving association.</v>

90
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.900
A human driving association is what it is here.
It pull it,

91
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:14.750
pull it back up again so you can look at it.
Yeah.

92
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.750
The war on driving is here.
A little paranoid.
Yeah,
they're a little paranoid,

93
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:23.580
but you've got to remember Matt Farah is an automotive journalists,

94
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:28.581
so his livelihood depends on talking about cars and he's a real legitimate car.

95
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.850
Nut.
What does this wrong answer?
Troy?
What does that pick?
The electric car.
Oh,

96
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.200
you clicked.
It says wrong answer.
You go there,
it takes you to their shop.
Well,

97
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.820
why is this a shame?
Oh,
I get it though.
It's just a joke.

98
00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:47.590
But why would it be the wrong answer?
It's just an an answer.
Yeah.
Do you drive?

99
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.130
I do.
You do?
You drive an electric car.
A regular car.

100
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.690
<v 0>Actually,
I don't have a car.
I don't know.
In Holland you don't read any cars?</v>

101
00:05:53.691 --> 00:05:55.430
You just have a,
I have a bike

102
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.790
<v 1>can phrasing.
Yeah,
you have a coat.</v>

103
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.460
He just wrote a coat on and just drive.
Yeah.
Wow.
Okay.
Hardcore.
Listen,

104
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:07.070
I'm a big fan of Holland because I kickbox.

105
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.370
So you guys have some of the greatest kickboxers of all times.
Yeah.

106
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.190
Came from this one small place.
Yeah.
It's very unusual.
