1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.330
You know,

2
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.330
I think that allowing marijuana to become legal should not have allowed.

3
00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:09.570
The type of taxation that's been allowed in California.

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.240
Colorado was at one point in time was 39% yeah.
What does it in California,

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.330
I don't know,
but it's high enough that I seen an owl.

6
00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:21.240
So we go from about $150 to 320 bucks.
I think that's terrible,

7
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:23.910
but I would like it if all that money went to a good purpose,

8
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:27.480
but we know it's not.
Yeah,
that's
right.

9
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.870
You're counting shit.
You know what I'm saying?
It,
it never lands where it should.

10
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:36.060
It never does what it's supposed to do.
Right.
That's what I'm,
that's,

11
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:38.960
that's what I'm getting to it.
That's why I say it went to Syria.
When I say,

12
00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:39.870
you know,
I don't want to be that guy,

13
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:43.050
but usually I don't go back for bribery just because you're just like,

14
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:44.340
God fucking damn.

15
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.690
Like why isn't good happening in the immediate cause so much money is pushed

16
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:53.430
into the immediate,
well,
if we does become legal worldwide,
it's in Thai.

17
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.540
I mean countrywide.

18
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.630
It's entirely possible that it's going to stimulate economies and a lot of very

19
00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:02.580
poor places.
It's going to have some real positive benefit.
I agree,
but,
but,

20
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.930
but what,

21
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.600
what I'm saying about capitalism is why are we not ensuring that the people who

22
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:14.160
have suffered since 1937 have a fair shot?

23
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.820
Right.

24
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.590
We've allowed so many laws to come in with marijuana legalization that it does

25
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:24.591
not allow for the spa businessman to have the type of ingenuity is set up that

26
00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:29.580
are small liquor store had at the end of prohibition or bar.
You know,

27
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.580
Jamie was telling me that in Ohio they were setting it up so they were trying to

28
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:36.150
make it legal,
but only two guys can grow it to enormous corporations.

29
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.220
That was the bill,
right?
Is that how it worked,
Jamie?

30
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.490
I believe it might've been four or something like it wasn't a lot.

31
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.130
Some small amount of people.
They were the only ones who could grow it in.

32
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.350
I'm saying Bro,
like that we know.
We know that's fucked up.

33
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.300
That's so crazy that he wouldn't even ask for them.

34
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.110
We notice fucked up when it should just be,
you are allowed to grow it with a,

35
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.660
with $100 state,
federal tax,
state tax stamp,

36
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.590
you gotta stay tax,
they have 100 bucks,

37
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.600
you can grow up to three acres with marijuana.
Bam.
Love it,
love it.

38
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.860
Perfect.
Lovely.
Do Your Shit.
And then the growers have to buy from you.

39
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.710
So if a farmer wants to make a collective with,
for the farmers,

40
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.030
they're making that collective,
but we shouldn't be able to,
to,

41
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.700
to allow that type of domination because essentially then you're just giving

42
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:21.430
people,
you know,
monopolies of sorts.
You know,
so it's,

43
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.020
it's like I just,
I don't trust us to,

44
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.700
to be on our shit enough with the people we leave in charge.
Right.
Well it also,

45
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.160
it wouldn't make sense in any other relationship.

46
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.510
And then the of the relationship we're,

47
00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:37.440
all someone is saying is if I let you sell something,

48
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.490
you give me a certain percentage because you're basically saying that all of
the,

49
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.800
the frameworks of our government and the city's roads that you drive on and all

50
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:48.630
that stuff takes money to maintain.

51
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.970
So we're just going to take a little piece now.
They'd taken 39% yeah,

52
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.580
that's so much should.

53
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.880
But if that 39% went all to public schools and paying teachers money and paying

54
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:04.780
cops and paying firemen and community centers,
but beyond just pain,

55
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.790
good son of a former cop,
cousin of car cops,

56
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.540
policemen should be from areas that they're policing or areas like those.

57
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.140
They should be offered no interest loans to live at.

58
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:24.460
And around those communities,
teachers should be also,
and the fire department,

59
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.690
they should almost hold a special place because of the nobility of those jobs

60
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.070
and how important they are.

61
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.460
We all should do stuff like tax freeze is once you retire,

62
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.090
whatever your taxes are,
once you retire at 65 years old,

63
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.110
we should knock baby 10 20% off.
And that's what you pay until you die.

64
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.650
You know what I mean?

65
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.420
We should do everything we can to make the the class of people you're saying

66
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:50.170
about affluence possible and we're not doing it like that's,

67
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:52.890
I guess that's the only button I'm pushing when I seen,

68
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.900
cause I'm a very optimistic person,
but my pessimism,

69
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
my pessimism comes more from the lack of what I seen us be willing to do to make

70
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:05.830
sure that each one another treated fairly then I have seen for.
Right.

71
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.510
You know what I'm saying?
