00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.980
You started a company when you started Twitter,
when you guys first started,

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:06.140
did you have any I look,

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.300
there's no way you could have added any idea what it would be now.
No,

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.560
but one of the things I was trying to emphasize with people and then people are

5
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.020
like,
ah,
Twitter is crazy.
And like,
how could it not be crazy?

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.570
There's never been anything like it before.

7
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.610
Like imagine trying to predict the kind of,

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.560
the president of United States uses Twitter to threaten other countries.
Yeah.

9
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.650
I mean,
who the fuck saw that comment?
Nobody saw that coming.

10
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.290
What did you think it was going to be when you first did it?

11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.860
<v 1>Well,
you know,
we were building this thing for ourselves and that's how that,</v>

12
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.420
that's how everything starts.
We wanted to use it.
We wanted to,

13
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.090
we wanted to,
you know,
stay connected with each other.
We text like a group text.

14
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:53.050
We loved our phones.
We loved,
um,
technology.

15
00:00:53.051 --> 00:00:58.051
We actually started this as a hack week project out of a failed company called

16
00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:03.280
Odeo.
There's podcasting,
I remember that super early on.
We were,
uh,

17
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.620
were really creative folks,

18
00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:10.240
but we weren't that passionate about where podcasting was going in our

19
00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:14.800
particular,
um,
domain.
We just got a lot of competition early on.

20
00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:17.200
Itunes just released their podcast directory.

21
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.430
But we knew we wanted to work together.
We knew,
um,

22
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.960
we love this idea of one button publishing.
We love this idea of collaboration.

23
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:29.250
We love this idea of uh,

24
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.240
being anywhere and being able to share what was happening.
That was,

25
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.320
that was the idea.
I mean,
that,
that was it and that's what we wanted it to be.

26
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.190
And I think the most beautiful and also sometimes uncomfortable aspect of

27
00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:47.350
Twitter is it,
um,

28
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.950
we really learned what it wanted to be and the people helped create it.

29
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.730
Like everything that we hold sacred now,
the at symbol,

30
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.800
the Hashtag the retweet,
those were not invented by me or the company.

31
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.820
Those were things that we discovered,
things that we discovered people using.

32
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.730
And we just observed it and we,

33
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.110
we noticed what they were trying to do.
They're trying to talk with one another.

34
00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:15.880
They were trying to,
um,

35
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.240
collect tweets around topics with the Hashtag.

36
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.790
<v 0>Has anybody figured out when the first use of Hashtag something</v>

37
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.800
<v 1>was created?
Yeah,
it was,
um,
he was actually our lead designer.</v>

38
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.690
Uh,
Robert Anderson who leads our design of the cash app,
um,

39
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.490
hired him for a square,
uh,
later on.
But,
uh,
he was the first one.

40
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:40.910
He was actually communicating with his brother and uh,

41
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:42.500
he put at buzz,

42
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.560
his brother's name is buzz and it just kind of spread.

43
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.780
It wasn't in mass,
but people were doing it.

44
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:54.560
But what was most interesting is not what they're doing,

45
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:58.430
but what they wanted to do with it.
They wanted to address each other and that's,

46
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.310
that changed the company completely.

47
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:04.330
That changes the service because they went from just broadcasting what's

48
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:07.660
happening to conversation and to being,

49
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.220
being able to address anyone publicly out in the open,

50
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.060
which came with it.
A lot of power and also a lot of issues as well.

51
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.630
<v 0>Yeah.
The,
the use of hashtags like,
uh,</v>

52
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.440
looking up Hashtag you know,
fry fest or Hashtag,
you know,

53
00:03:24.441 --> 00:03:27.500
anytime there's something weird that's in the news that's a,

54
00:03:27.501 --> 00:03:31.010
that's such a unique way to find things but to go on Twitter and to,

55
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.240
to utilize that.
It's a,
I mean it's,

56
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.540
it's interesting that your f that this guy just did it just to contact his

57
00:03:38.541 --> 00:03:39.374
brother.

58
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.950
<v 1>Well that would,</v>

59
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.100
that was the symbol of the Hashtag was this Guy Christmas ina and he was trying

60
00:03:43.101 --> 00:03:46.600
to,
he was trying to tag um,
here's uh,

61
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.230
trying to tag around topics that he was tweeting about.
And again,
that spread,

62
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:54.080
all we did was made it easier.
We made it more accessible.

63
00:03:54.081 --> 00:03:57.530
We enabled everyone to do it.
Uh,
with the at symbol,

64
00:03:57.531 --> 00:04:02.531
we made a page that collected all mentions of your name with the Hashtag we

65
00:04:02.721 --> 00:04:06.680
allowed people to search a immediately so you could tap on the keyword and you

66
00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:10.430
would see everyone talking about that or tweeting about that specific Hashtag.

67
00:04:10.431 --> 00:04:15.290
So these things were just emergent behaviors that we didn't predict and they

68
00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:17.030
became the lifeblood of the service.

69
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.770
<v 0>What's fascinating to me about something like Twitter or even something like</v>

70
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:24.970
youtube is that there's not a lot of other ones like it.

71
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.500
There's just this one thing like how does that happen where this one thing sort

72
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:33.460
of gets adopted by everybody and takes over and then just becomes this

73
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.840
overwhelmingly massive platform.
I mean there's really,

74
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.230
there's Vimeo and this is a few other videos,
services,

75
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:45.220
but nothing on the scale of youtube.
And that's the same thing with Twitter.

76
00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:48.010
There's nothing on the scale of distributing information in a quick,
short,

77
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.960
280 character form like that.

78
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.810
<v 1>We,
um,
I,
I don't think we could plan for it.</v>

79
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.710
I don't think we could necessarily billed for that.
I,
uh,

80
00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.410
someone said recently to,
uh,

81
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.980
we just gathered a bunch of our leadership last week in palm springs for an

82
00:05:03.981 --> 00:05:08.540
offsite and someone said recently the Twitter was discovered.

83
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.940
And I think what's behind all that is that it,
it,

84
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.020
it hits something foundational.
It hit something essential.

85
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.740
And my cofounder Biz likes to say that Twitter can never be uninvented.

86
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.810
It's here.
It changed everything though.
The use of it has been revolutionary,

87
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.750
and it's just a simple idea of,
you know,

88
00:05:32.751 --> 00:05:36.560
if you could text with the entire world,

89
00:05:36.561 --> 00:05:39.110
if you could actually reach anyone in the world,

90
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.960
or anyone could see what you're thinking,

91
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.280
which I think is also the beautiful thing about,
about text and the,

92
00:05:46.281 --> 00:05:48.440
and the medium,
you can actually get it.

93
00:05:48.441 --> 00:05:53.441
Someone's raw thoughts and anyone in the world can see that instantaneously.

94
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.700
It becomes a subconscious.

95
00:05:55.701 --> 00:06:00.170
It becomes this like global consciousness and it a,

96
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:05.171
it gets to some really deep places in society and some of those places are

97
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:06.290
pretty uncomfortable.
