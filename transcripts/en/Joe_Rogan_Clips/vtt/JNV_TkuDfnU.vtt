00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.920
Uh,
in,
in my forthcoming book,

2
00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:06.060
I have a section where I talk about professors who got into Trelawney.

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.080
We've all heard about the comedians getting into trouble for violating some

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.250
politically correct dictum,
but professors,
many cases,
very,

5
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:18.480
very high profile professors getting in trouble for incredibly innocuous jokes.

6
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:21.600
And actually I brought a list of names cause I thought I might not remember
them.

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.790
Can I mention a few?
The few of the cases.

8
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.660
So Lasar Greenfield who was the president elect of the American College of

9
00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:36.870
surgeons and the Editor in chief of a journal called surgery news.

10
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.270
W had written an editorial a few years ago where he was talking about the

11
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.540
antidepressant benefits of coming in contact with sperm and other words,

12
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.940
it,
and this was based on a peer reviewed scientific paper.

13
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.960
Actually two of the authors of that paper are folks that I know quite well,

14
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.393
friends of mine.

15
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.960
And they had demonstrated that women who have protected sex versus unprotected

16
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:08.310
sex and up scoring differently on these depressive measures.
In other words,

17
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:12.870
there was some sort of protective element to actually being exposed to sperm.

18
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.130
And so in his,
um,
editorial,
he made a joke.

19
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:19.050
It was during Valentines,
he said,

20
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:23.460
so now there is a gift that a man can give a woman that's beyond flowers or

21
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:25.050
chocolates or something to that effect.

22
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.780
He had to step down from being president of the American College of surgeons.

23
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.590
He had to step down from being editor in chief because a whole bunch of women

24
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.950
were very offended by that sperm joke.
Now the,
the,

25
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.000
the authors of the paper and question wrote a brilliant response.

26
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.990
The response where they said,
how,

27
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.090
how could he be treated in this way when all he was doing is actually literally

28
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:54.300
reporting the data,
the findings from our peer reviewed study.

29
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.010
So that's one example.
Another example is a certain,
uh,

30
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.340
I think his third Tim hunt,
who was a Nobel Prize winner in 2001.

31
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.750
I remember this one.
Yeah,
right?
Uh,
who,
who he basically,
he was a speaking,

32
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:09.050
I think had in Korea at a,
you know,

33
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.080
gee women in science conference where he varied in a jocular way,

34
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:17.640
said,
you know,
it's a real problem when you have women in your lab.

35
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.760
They fall in love with you,
you fall in love with them.

36
00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:24.510
And so it's better to have segregated labs.
His wife,
by the way,

37
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:27.450
as a staunch feminist,
who's a very prominent scientist,

38
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.500
and she confirmed that he's hardly,
you know,
a rabid sexist.

39
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.710
He went through all sorts of hell.
Yeah,
I remember that.

40
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.190
And he was joking and he was joking.
And I,

41
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.200
in the book I discussed several other other of these examples.
So,

42
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.380
so imagine you would think that a unblemished exemplary career as a scientist up

43
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:50.940
to getting a Nobel prize,
good,
potentially protect you,

44
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.690
but one comment that someone decides can,

45
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.540
can unleashed a tsunami of outrage and you're dead.
