1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.100
I dated a girl,
worked at uh,
Newport cream.
Are you with me?
Okay.

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.750
<v 1>What's that like a like a cold stone ice cream place.</v>

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.370
<v 0>Hamburgers?
Yeah.
Who's that?
You remember me?</v>

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.230
That's me.
This fucking phone.
I've uh,

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.460
got a phone that for whatever reason turns itself on to ring all the time.
Yeah.

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.790
Like even when I don't,
it turns the cell phone to ring.
It's done that like

7
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.170
<v 1>twice.
You know what?
I think it's this case,
this leather apple case.</v>

8
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.640
I think it's a piece of shit.
Look at your volume buttons.
Look at mine.

9
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.290
They're sunk in the middle.
Like this suddenly had this like,
uh,

10
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.370
for a week and it's already falling apart.

11
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.370
None of it and not join in it overheats your phone.

12
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.450
I think because of the leather.

13
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.960
There's no way for the air to get out so that my shit's running slower than it

14
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:45.550
should.

15
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.490
<v 0>You don't have to do the other day I put a battery pack on this like a madman.</v>

16
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.440
Yeah.
Pulling them thick ass battery packs on it.
It felt like a superhero.

17
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.190
I could just go all day.
Why don't you have it on now?

18
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.100
Because I took it off because I feel like I was relying on it too much.

19
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.440
I should just charge it at night.
I'm using my,

20
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:08.260
my phone less and less after my trip to Hawaii because my phone broke.

21
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.490
I dropped it the first day there and I had an order,
a new one,
but I mean,

22
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:14.620
mine just stop working.
The whole thing.
Yeah.

23
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.300
Duty would just randomly call people.
I would hold up,
I would hold up like my,
uh,

24
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.190
contacts and it would just start calling people and then I would hang up and it

25
00:01:24.191 --> 00:01:25.930
would start calling another person.
No,
hang up.

26
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.810
It was dark and I was showing people,
it's like my friend John Duffy.
I was like,

27
00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:32.150
watch this,
watch what it's doing.
And then I'd hang up.
It would do that again.

28
00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:35.320
It was like,
what the fuck?
I just dropped it and just went haywire.
That's crazy.

29
00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:39.490
Yeah.
I broke it.
And so,
uh,
what I'm,
when I got a new one for three days,

30
00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:42.550
I wasn't doing anything.
So for three days waiting for my phone to come,

31
00:01:42.551 --> 00:01:46.480
I didn't use any APPS,
any nothing.
And I felt better.

32
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.180
I felt better.

33
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.960
<v 1>But you were in Hawaii?
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you were in Van Nuys,</v>

34
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.930
but as soon as I got the phone back then like,
hmm,
let me check Instagram.

35
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.590
Anybody put any cool pictures of cars up there?

36
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.570
If technology is so fragile and like that,

37
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:03.870
then why are we still so scared of like AI?
If we could just fund it,
smack it,

38
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:07.050
and the bread's a silly way to look at nuclear bombs.
Jamie,

39
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.150
that's technology to remember.
I know I said it was silly.

40
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:14.830
I started off by saying smoke

41
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.110
<v 0>too much.
Do Do da or not enough?</v>

42
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.640
Mm hmm.
Hmm.
We should be worried.

43
00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:25.800
Don't you think if Elon Musk thinks we should be worried?

44
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.140
<v 1>I A,
he's like in the business of that though of worrying people.
No,
no,
no,</v>

45
00:02:30.141 --> 00:02:33.780
but I mean of technology.
He,
yeah.
Well also,
yeah.
Yeah,

46
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.720
100% no,
not 100% but like that's his business.

47
00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:42.530
35% future of all technology.
He's,

48
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.180
he's the one figuring out the problems.

49
00:02:44.181 --> 00:02:47.090
He's the one here to save us from all of this shit.
That's his business.

50
00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:51.170
As He created
all those Tesla's got recalled.

51
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.610
I mean did you saw that right?

52
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.940
Like 130,000 model s has got recalled cause they're steering column was fucked

53
00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:57.050
up or something.
Is that what happened?

54
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.100
I don't know exact problem but a lot of them cause I remember

55
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.440
<v 0>seeing something.
How crazy is it?
Ford canceled all their cars.</v>

56
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.940
Ryan Callan loves his,
he fucking loves it.
Yeah.

57
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:11.941
Ford decided to stop making cars except the motherfucking Mustang and SUV is I

58
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:16.420
think,
well the SUV is are awesome.
They make that Lincoln town.
What does it not?

59
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.590
I'm good.
Why did they make it Lincoln navigator?
There's new navigator.

60
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.380
It's a fucking incredible car.
It's incredible.

61
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.590
It's like they saw all these other cars like you know that luxury SUV family

62
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:31.600
wagon market is a weird market.

63
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:36.601
Like there's range rovers and there's a bunch of Mercedes SUV is and BMW SUV is.

64
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.680
But this is like the first other than the Cadillac Escalade kind of.

65
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:46.681
But this was like another level like super high tech family luxury sled that

66
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:49.930
hauls ass.
It's pretty dope.
Dude.

67
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:52.570
I watched some of the videos on it and how they make these things and like all

68
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:56.530
the different features that they have in them.
Huge screens now.

69
00:03:56.531 --> 00:03:59.260
Everything has giant screens.
Like a lot of these cars now,

70
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:03.270
they don't have a dashboard.
They just have a screen and you know you could just,

71
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.340
you could customize it in different ways.

72
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.390
In my mind is a fake screen or scowling [inaudible] screen virtual virtual

73
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.390
gauges,
right?
Yeah.
It comes on and sub rainieri man.
It's crazy.
It's weird.

74
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.950
It's weird to see.
I got a video.

75
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:20.200
We should watch this coming up from the Google io thing.

76
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.980
It might counter contradict what we were just,
it says,
no joke.

77
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:27.040
Google assistant will start making phone calls to small businesses to make

78
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:31.900
appointments on your behalf.
It's called Google duplex.
The API call or even ads?

79
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.140
Oms and EMS.
Oh Jesus.

80
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.610
<v 2>Hi.
I'm calling about the woman haircut.
I'm looking at becoming a maker.</v>

81
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.490
It's not a real voice.

82
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.730
We do not have,
if

83
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.080
you have anything that Pete can am and 12:00 PM

84
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.480
she would buy
hair cut for now.

85
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.040
Okay.
You have the
headache.
Okay.
We're here.

86
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.800
The first thing that we thought.
Okay,
perfect.

87
00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:27.150
So I will be lead by 10 o'clock on May 3rd okay,
great.

88
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.620
Great.
Have a great day.

89
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.730
<v 0>That's awesome.
I love that.
All right,
cool.
You're freaking me out.</v>
