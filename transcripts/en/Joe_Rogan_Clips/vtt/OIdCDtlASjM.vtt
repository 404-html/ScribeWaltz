1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
You gotta be so much kinder to people when you just thinking shit like that.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.140
It helps you understand how people are like you are on in to just about anybody,

3
00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:07.441
man.

4
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:12.441
And it's like so easy to have someone in your life and enjoy the idea that there

5
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:16.380
are asshole and they deserve it.

6
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:20.250
But if you spend just a speck of time thinking about it,

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.390
it's like we really were.
It's sad in a weird way.
It sucks.

8
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.600
We'll just wait until you have kids.
Then it gets really,

9
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:30.900
really interesting because you start looking at people like they used to be

10
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:35.460
babies.
That's what happened to me.
I kept a Bobby boy common man.
No,
you do.

11
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.610
I don't.
I like,
yeah,
this is the first place I have said it.
Holy Shit,

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.180
Daddy.
She said,
it's okay.

13
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.920
You know you can win when you're in the early months here.
I don't know why,

14
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:51.810
but like you're scared.
It's such a sacred thing,
you know?

15
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:54.740
It's a vulnerable thing to talk about.
It makes you feel vulnerable.

16
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:58.080
It makes you feel nervous and because of that energy or you're worried about

17
00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:03.000
talking.
I fucking love it.
Dude,
it is the most transformative,
like you know,

18
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:04.920
like you hear,

19
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.050
oh the time to the point where I was like suspicious of it.
Like I was like,

20
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.160
you know,
I don't stand up has done this joke for awhile,

21
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.700
so I think I'm allowed to say it.
Are you not shy?
Not even,
or what,
what's,

22
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.260
what's the rule?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He doesn't do any of the old stuff.

23
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.760
He's got some of my favorite jokes of all time.
Many of them.

24
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:28.761
But he's got this killer fucking joke about Alva like a pregnant people are like

25
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:35.100
heroin addicts,
you know?
They're like,
just try it.
You'll love it.
Just try it.

26
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.720
And then,
and then when you do it,
like you know,
you're stuck,
you're trapped.

27
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.690
Which is how I used to think.
But man,

28
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.720
it's like so humbling to realize that all this shit you heard was true in the

29
00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:54.360
sense that you hear people say,
oh no,
it's psychedelic,
it's psychedelic.
Now I,

30
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.110
I always associated that with like when the baby's born,

31
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.430
there must be some serotonin or dopamine that gets released,

32
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:03.300
not just in the woman.

33
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:08.010
We know the woman's brain is flooded with oxytocin in a variety of things.

34
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:11.640
The mother,
the bonding chemicals.
But you know,
I thought,
well,

35
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:14.910
that are clearly what happened for the father.
Maybe just not in the same level.

36
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:19.620
So when people say it's Psychedelic,
that must be what they meet.
But now I know,

37
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.660
you know,
the birth is,
hasn't happened yet to it,

38
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.960
but just being in the presence of a person who's growing a life inside of their

39
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.853
belly

40
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.610
and realizing that like the bonding that's happening there and like the sacred

41
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:40.611
duty is coming up if you being a father and that a soul is coming into this

42
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:44.230
dimension that is going to be,
um,

43
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.510
completely dependent on you and my wife,
of course,

44
00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:51.660
wanting to keep her safe and then man,
it,

45
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.690
the combination of all these things is so incredibly psychedelic in the most

46
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.750
beautiful way and humbling because it's like,
boy,

47
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.810
oh boy did I fucking tell myself that I had figured out something really smart.

48
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.640
And that was like w reproduction is a trick of the DNA.

49
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:20.581
And this marriage thing in the baby thing is some kind of vast digital societal

50
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:27.190
Oregon,
like the appendix.
We don't need to do that.

51
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:30.850
There's nothing to it.
Obviously I wasn't using that voice,

52
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:35.851
but like it was such a pretentious fucking pompous,

53
00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:38.960
ridiculous place that I was standing at,

54
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.190
which is to judge,
okay.

55
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.900
People for reproducing,
having,

56
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.220
enjoying the ability to judge because my parents reproduced.

57
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.660
You know what I mean?
So it's so humbling to realize like,

58
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.720
oh,
I was wrong,

59
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.150
but I wasn't just like Kinda wrong.
Like I was deeply,
fundamentally,

60
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.360
completely wrong about this phase of life in this,

61
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.410
uh,
what's the word for it?
This,
um,
well,

62
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:17.890
I like in Hinduism they call it an Ostrom,
like a monastery.

63
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:20.590
It's called the Green Hosta.
Ah,
Schrom.
It's like a temple.

64
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:25.090
It's considered to be like a temple.
The family.
Holy Fuck Man.

65
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.280
It's real.
The rubbers hit the road man.
And it's like,
it's really,

66
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:31.840
really beautiful though.

67
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.290
<v 1>Obviously a little scary.
Yeah,
it's love.</v>

68
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.080
It's real love.
And it's love where you know,

69
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.230
you know you're going to be able to love your children unconditionally in a,

70
00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:45.470
in a very strange way that we really have a hard time with other people.

71
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.510
And I think the thing about it is not just that you're bringing a life into this

72
00:04:50.511 --> 00:04:52.160
world which is very psychedelic,

73
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.510
but that your love bond with this kid is so ultimate.
It's so,

74
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.680
it's so intense.

75
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.820
The love that you have for each other to raising the kid together.

76
00:05:01.821 --> 00:05:03.790
There's a thing that happens with,
with,

77
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.850
with people when they are just really deeply connected at a DNA level.

78
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.660
Like this is a little person that is literally come out of nowhere from two

79
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:23.470
bodies.
It makes you realize how precious life is,

80
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:26.740
how vulnerable we all are.
And it makes you realize that,

81
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.480
I mean it's such a cliche phrase,

82
00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:33.460
the actual power of love and it's not just the love of this kid or the love of

83
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.030
yourselves,
the two together and the family together and all the other,
you know,

84
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.460
people that you love.
It's a love of all people.
It's the love.
It's just,
it's,

85
00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:44.650
we just really have a hard time loving people.

86
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.430
We have a really hard time trusting that people are going to love us back.

87
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.590
They're not going to get in our way and they're not going to be overly needy or

88
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:51.280
annoying,

89
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.640
or they're not going to be intrusive or they're not going to tell you what to
do,

90
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.470
which is why people hate their fucking parents telling them what to do.
Oh,

91
00:05:57.471 --> 00:06:00.830
block comes with this bullshit.
Love comes with this nonsense.

92
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.400
Love comes with fucking rules and I have to be annoyed all the time and I have

93
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:09.300
to wear my suit on Sunday.
Yeah,
fuck love.
Fuck it.
I don't want it.
Right.

94
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.480
Then that carries on.
You develop these,

95
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.940
these shields that you put up for the whole world because of that.

96
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.000
That's one of the most common things that people do when,
uh,
when,

97
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:19.130
in terms of like our definitions of love,

98
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.760
we define it by the people that were supposed to be the lovers in our lives,

99
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.840
but they're just unconditional kindness and love.
So,

100
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:30.650
so few people are balanced in the,
the beginning of the relationship.

101
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:31.730
It's just lust.

102
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.520
And then after awhile you get annoyed with each other and you can't wait to get

103
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:36.680
free and find somebody else who's going to make you happy.

104
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.120
And they don't make you happy either.

105
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:42.920
And most of us in the early years of our lives in particular,
we bounce around,

106
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:47.690
you know,
we try to find a new person that's going to make us happy.
That's right.

107
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.700
And we attract the kind of people that are the most destructive for us.
I mean,

108
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.330
for some strange reason,
we're always looking to be distracted.
Yes.

109
00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:01.390
And when I think when you can learn how to abandon that,

110
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:05.090
and it's not a learned,
like now I know it's a slow,

111
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:10.091
gradual process where the instances of continuous occur less frequently,

112
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.360
less and less and less and less frequently to your more and more and more kind.

113
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.920
And then you,
you know,
you get it as good as you can get it on any given day.
