00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
Guys,
he's legit.
It's amazing.
These longer body types have been so good.

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.590
Anderson Silva Bounce Jones.
Yeah.
A lot of these guys have,
you know,
you,

3
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.260
I wouldn't think that,
you know,

4
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:12.810
you'd think someone may be shorter stockier and getting the inside.

5
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:17.070
But did he seize up long?
Seems like a huge,
he's a beat Saturday night.
Yeah.

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.820
Sharapov say that five times fast.
Like I said,
came on to podcasts.

7
00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:23.820
As soon as it came on,

8
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.140
I'm going six to one 45 two couldn't find a skinnier guy I thought.

9
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:31.200
And then I saw him fight and man,
he was just so impressive,

10
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.180
but fast and strong at one 45 and six two I guess voice was,

11
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:40.290
you know,
he wasn't real tall,
but he was like six one.
Right.
But he was one 75 mm.

12
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.041
And you know,

13
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:44.100
he was obviously fighting in the unlimited class and it was fighting guys like

14
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:48.810
Dan Severn at the time.
It was two 65 is thing.
But he's got muscle on him.

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.020
Like he's kind of jacked.
Like when you looked at it like a perfect frame,

16
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:55.350
he's all slides.
Awesome.
A little tiny Luke Rockhold and a lot of ways,

17
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.350
but with a way more dynamic game.
He could do everything.
That guy,

18
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.590
he was really interesting to watch this first time I ever saw him.

19
00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:05.310
Fight Dot guy is fucking phenomenal.
He's so talented.

20
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.180
That was the first time I saw him fight live and it's a different thing when you

21
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:11.460
see someone live.
Like if you see someone in a video and you go,
wow,

22
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:12.294
that guy's good.

23
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.650
But then you see him live and you know your brain has like a little computer

24
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:20.250
where it's seen or you know you've got a database,
especially me,

25
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.420
I've seen so many fights,

26
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.610
have a database of how people move and then you see that I'm moving like,
Whoa,

27
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:29.340
what are we looking at here?
Because I love seeing that.

28
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:32.820
I love seeing this next level shit,
that next level thing.

29
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:37.080
Like whether it's you know,
Connor or whether it's a Tyron Woodley or these,

30
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:41.310
every now and then you see next level and you go,
oh,
like Tyron Woodley to me.

31
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.930
He fought Carlos condit and there was a moment in the condit fight where he

32
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:50.010
stepped forward and snap Carlos with a a straight right hand.
I was like,
Whoa,

33
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:53.200
that's like 10% faster than it should be.
You know what I mean?
Like you,

34
00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:58.201
you get used to world class athletes moving and then you see someone like Edson

35
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.390
Barboza switch kick.
That's another one.
You're like,
Whoa,
whoa baby.
You know?
