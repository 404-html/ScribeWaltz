Hello Freak bitches.
How does the Academy Awards work?
I don't know how it works,

2
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.390
but I would assume it's a bunch of people that are experts in the business.

3
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.680
We're in the business.
Good idea,
Joe.
That's a great idea though.
That's different.

4
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.690
The Weinstein sizes.
Oh Man.

5
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.740
Crazy right documentary and an open secret watched that shit.

6
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.980
I keep hearing about the open secret about,
it's about politics.

7
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.710
It's about Hollywood managers who manage kids.
It's a racket.

8
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:34.730
Ma'Am.
Did you hear the term kid from strange and these kids?
Dude,

9
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.280
strange things.
Strange stranger things.
He date just left.

10
00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:42.890
He just left his manager and they're alleging sexual abuse.

11
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.690
They'll just let their agency,
if you could find that Owen bench truly here kid.

12
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.170
Oh yeah.
Just put it on his uh,

13
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.210
Instagram today because Olin is been taken a lot of heat online because he said

14
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:58.400
that a three year old kid shouldn't be fucking transgender.

15
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.200
And people giving him a hard time seeing he's a bigot.

16
00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:03.560
Like are you out of your fucking mind when you're top three transgender show

17
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.600
stranger things act or dropped agent because of sec accused of sexual assault.

18
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.100
Disney star fall suit.
Jesus Christ.
This is nuts.

19
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:15.320
Watch an open secret and they tell you,
they go through,

20
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.670
do they pick their people?
It's on.

21
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.010
It's for free I think on Vimeo.
Yeah.
You can go watch it for free.

22
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.110
Just secret stuff.
Youtube or some genius.

23
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.190
You know what a Sturgill Simpson told me.
He said the same thing exists in music,

24
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.481
in music.

25
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:33.500
There's a bunch of pedals and pet rap music as well as entertainment business

26
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.270
all the way through music that this was,

27
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.880
this was about music and movies and TV.
It's about the whole women,

28
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.790
women and kids.
Most of the,
and sometimes dudes,
you know,

29
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.090
Terry Cruz said that he was attacked,
well not attacked.
Some dude grabbed,

30
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.980
grabbed his dick in front of this white famous dude,
grabbed his dick.

31
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.940
You know what I sold that.
Um,

32
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.500
who was that fucking big time football player that was in that weird movie with

33
00:01:57.501 --> 00:01:59.420
John Travolta?
Howie long,

34
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.910
Howie Long said the exact same shit was happening to him.

35
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.640
Perhaps Dick guys were coming after how we long guys were,

36
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.070
were propositioning him,

37
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.760
trying to tell him this is what you have to do to make it in the movie business

38
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.410
suck Dick [inaudible] who else?
It happened to haul Cogan same thing.
Yes,

39
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.740
coating up all the Logan got proposition by high level movie person that told

40
00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:25.190
him this is how the game is played and did he do it and that's why he's not in

41
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:28.670
movies or why are you using today?
We got guys who are killing it.

42
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.720
Super Skeptical hip.
What do have been coming out now?

43
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.960
Donald Sterling.
Look at these beautiful black bodies.
What does that,

44
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.930
<v 1>it's something that I heard about before he got in trouble that this is why a</v>

45
00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:42.650
lot of players didn't want to play for him because he was known to bring people

46
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:46.090
down in the locker room to look at his players showering and whatnot.
Just like,

47
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.980
<v 0>why is everyone so fucking creepy?
Be Cool,</v>

48
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.360
be cool man.
Hey Man,
my idea about we go back to your kids,

49
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.500
watch your motherfucking,
don't let your kids be around.

50
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:00.910
Weird fucking agency taking.

51
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.430
Don't let your kids get into acting.
Do not let your kids get into,

52
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:07.840
does it ever worked out?
Well,

53
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:10.920
you know the other thing is like look at what happened with that uh,

54
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.790
Sandusky guy.
That guy was taking care of kids.
Like his whole thing was like,
hey,

55
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:18.330
I do charitable work with children.
You know,

56
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.880
I do charitable work and I take care of them.
Are Kids.
Yeah.
I'm just,

57
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.600
I'm just all about helping kids.
It's all about helping kids.
They're our future.

58
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.800
How about Calvin?
Went to summer camp does sucked my counselor,

59
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.000
I think he got jacked off his friend guys dig.
So

60
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.920
it's funny cause it's Callan.
What's,
I'm not advocating any of the famous guys,

61
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.100
a famous in the UK who died and then they found out what does that,

62
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:45.370
what's that guy's name?
A shimmy.
Seville.
What'd he do?

63
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.690
Like he was super famous.
Super famous.

64
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.100
He had a big talk show in,
in England.
Bring Him Benny Hill.
Yeah,

65
00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.130
that's the guy.
No shower.
No Shit.
He fucks.
Look at the picture above him.

66
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.010
Look at that picture above with the red glasses above with the crazy hair.

67
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.440
One more the,
Oh my God,

68
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.250
that fucking guy you should be slapped.

69
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.850
Imagine that guy putting his dick in your mouth.
Is there a documentary on him?

70
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.720
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's that call?
Cause they,

71
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.200
she kept this a secret for a long time because this guy was like a,
uh,

72
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:24.330
a big star over there.
Look at his motherfucking team.

73
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.350
Kept the secret like the media,
the people that occurred with him,

74
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.390
like everyone knew that.
Like what about the rose?
We'll go to that.

75
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:34.750
Go back to that.
What about law enforcement in the UK?
You know what I mean?

76
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.430
The roos knew Jimmy Seville.
Seville is that,
I say it's Seville.

77
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.000
Documentary is a horrible misstep.
Oh,
Louis Theroux is awesome.

78
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.360
I doubt that he fucked anything up that kind of make some of the best fucking

79
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:50.960
documentary's going.
He's a monster.
It's probably some,
yeah,
someone was a hater.

80
00:04:50.961 --> 00:04:54.760
Who exactly.
That is so heavy haters out there.
And think about that.

81
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:59.030
Think about Don
don notes.

82
00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:02.500
Sub No ne.
Yeah.
Suddenly,
fuck yeah man.

83
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.090
There's a lot of Jimmy Savile gropes teenager in newly released Louis Theroux

84
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:10.190
footage.
Ugh.
Powerful show.

85
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.250
Have you seen the stuff that Joe Biden,
Joe Biden,
the former vice president do?

86
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:18.400
There's videos on him like at the White House and taking pictures with kids.

87
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:20.650
Did you know looking at,
we've seen that.
Really?
I haven't seen,

88
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.470
have you seen that shit?
He's like,
he's groping them and shit.

89
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.660
It just think he's super awkward with this guy's running.

90
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.680
When you're untouchable,

91
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.110
when there's no way you're going to get busted for anything.

92
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:31.930
Murdered child molestation.
Did he don't give a fuck.

93
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:36.930
He just don't give a fuck who you are.
You grabbing my kid anywhere appropriate.

94
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.720
There's a lot.
And he's like,
dude,
I got sick bastard.

95
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.930
It looks like we said there must there and just pulled her secret.
Yeah.
Shit.

96
00:05:43.931 --> 00:05:48.931
The problem is you've taken like a screenshot because I've heard the audio.

97
00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:52.960
You could hear that.
What he says to these,
he say creepy ass shit.

98
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.230
Like get like what?
Like do they just keep,
just keep,
he's taking pictures.

99
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.390
All these kids and he's just like,
ah.
I just whispering in their ear and Oh,

100
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:03.200
you're beautiful.
Gruffy of a big government creep.
Oh,

101
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.030
video of this.
These are stills.
But there's actually video this shit,

102
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.450
and this is by the way,
what you've seen in public,
right?
Yeah.

103
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.450
He don't care that don't give a shit nuts not to deals and care.
It's just,

104
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:17.780
that's a small version of probably what he's like behind closed doors.

105
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.160
If you're a big Hollywood act or maybe you're not and you didn't get sexually

106
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.140
harassed or like pissed off right now,
know what I'm saying?
Like what the fuck?

107
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.670
If you're an actress and you worked with Harvey Weinstein,

108
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:32.520
he never tried to suck his dick.
You like,
what you,
what's wrong with me?
Yeah.

109
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.040
You ugly.
Fuck is wrong with my face.
They're really going after him.

110
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:39.340
That seems weird.
It doesn't seem weird,
dude.

111
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.300
You're going after a guy's entire business.
Here's the thing,
he's one of many.

112
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.250
There's gotta be like a bunch of people that ran their business that way.

113
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.030
Weinstein,
they say like in Hollywood,
like just like,
oh no.
Yeah,

114
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:55.160
it's about time you got caught.
I'm like,
what the fuck?

115
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:59.750
Everyone knew this one knew it was in his contract.

116
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.700
The way he had his contract set up was like they had a certain amount of money

117
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:08.360
that he would have to pay if he had a sexual harassment claim against him.

118
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.070
It was like,
it was a thing for him.

119
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.150
Like he had so many claims that's like first offense was a hundred thousand

120
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:19.040
second offense.
My 250003rd defense was $750,000 for third.

121
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.890
Fourth offense was a million.
Who would get it written into his fucking contract?

122
00:07:22.891 --> 00:07:25.730
Come here,
Max.
His contract with the Weinstein company,

123
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:29.660
like his own Merrimack to explain that contract like they'd have to,

124
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.530
he'd have to pay a hundred thousands yes.
Could,
they're protecting themselves.

125
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.350
Ras,
when they signed him,
they go,
okay.

126
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:39.460
The first time he fucked with one of these guns can be 100,000 second time and

127
00:07:39.461 --> 00:07:44.380
see it's not shit.
Yes.
I mean,
he was prominent.
It was such a huge,

128
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.330
it was so known of what he would do.
And look,

129
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:51.140
even Quentin Tarantino said that he did it to his ex girlfriend quieter and Tito

130
00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:54.050
said he knew about it.
Yeah,
he did it to Mira Sorvino.
Dude.

131
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.920
And could Harvey Weinstein get any fucking uglier?

132
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.760
[inaudible] young ass wise.
So he looks like a troll.

133
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.510
He know what he looks like is a sexual Predator and a Harvey Weinstein movie.

134
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.690
Correct?
Like it.
Like it was a shitty lifetime movie.
Like,
come on,

135
00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:11.870
let's do a little bit on that.
Legs unrealistic.
He's hideous.
I think.

136
00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:16.220
You know what I,
it's so bad.
Look at the girls that he's harassing them.

137
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.880
Most of them bitches are fucking trash anyways.
You know what I mean?
No,
no,
no.

138
00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:23.660
Here's what he says.
Christ distracted.
What about the kids?
Fuck them bitches.

139
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:26.420
What about the kids that's going on?
I don't focus on that.
Those girls are trash,

140
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.010
just actress.
But here's the question.

141
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.910
Here's the problem was what Whitney told me when he says yes,
she,

142
00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:34.010
she knows her shit.
What she said is she,

143
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:38.690
there's a lot of girls that aren't saying a word because they did fuck them and

144
00:08:38.691 --> 00:08:42.640
they caught them for parts.
They fucked him for like editing,
of course,

145
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.430
did them for a lot of things that Donald Trump,
that's the rumor.

146
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:52.220
But that this is like a standard thing that Weinstein would do and women agreed

147
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:56.600
to it because he was a power from mother fucker that could get the world hold
up.

148
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.360
However many,
whatever,
50 girls that come out with claims against him,

149
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.900
he's probably fucked 5,000 who aren't coming out.

150
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.470
I think that's probably a real number and ridiculously hot girls we all know

151
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:11.730
about now what?
I suck his dick to be the next Batman.
Yeah,
probably,
man,

152
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.820
Donald's,
Ronnie,
Darren,
you don't focus on the kids.
Here we go.
Well that's,

153
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.210
that's certainly an issue,
but it's an Rv,

154
00:09:19.211 --> 00:09:21.870
but then that's kind of fucked for parts.
You know what I mean?

155
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:25.830
Don't you remember Brian Singer?
I remember that guy who is the x men guy.

156
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:29.430
That guy got busted because some 17 year old boy was saying that he got used by

157
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:32.580
him at a party and they would pass them around to all their friends and they had

158
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:36.750
all these buoys.
What guy?
Bryan singer and the guy goes,
no,
no,
no x men.

159
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:41.800
Oh my bed x files is talking about the guy with the x files.
No X men.
Right?

160
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.230
The famous director.
Yeah,
that's the guy.
He's in the movie.
Oh,
an open secret.

161
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:48.480
I'm sure it's about,
it's about him.
Hold up.

162
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:53.270
He would and he was just some dude like the director here he goes,

163
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.210
look at that.
The sad turn behind La Party scene that took down Brian Singer.

164
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.890
Like he would have all these like young boys with them and there's a picture of

165
00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:06.110
them at a pool.
It is fucking hilarious.
There's drop,

166
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.780
scroll back up.
Look at this picture like look at him and all these young boys.

167
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.800
The Tim on the right.
It's him above with the glasses or no,

168
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.790
the one with the arm wrapped around us.
Like yellow bathroom for the glasses.

169
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.340
See Him with his arm wrapped around.
Got You wrapped around that boy.

170
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.620
Put his hand on that guy.
The kid's chest.
What the kid looks like.

171
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:23.670
He's off 16 right.

172
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.570
So there's a picture of him at a party that he threw at his place.

173
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.930
That is hilarious because that party has all these young twinks in a pool and

174
00:10:34.081 --> 00:10:36.360
the pool's lights are red.
Like,

175
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:40.680
like they butt fuck so much that they just bled out and the whole pool became

176
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.940
red right there.
Look at that.
Tell me what doesn't look like that.
Fuck man.

177
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.410
That's party of Brian's at all.
Uh,

178
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:54.010
are they all under age?
No,
probably not,
but we'll does that.
Nothing's wrong with,

179
00:10:54.011 --> 00:10:55.470
if I,
anyone know how many of them were,

180
00:10:55.471 --> 00:10:58.200
but some of them apparently were under age.
Holy Shit.

181
00:10:58.201 --> 00:11:00.120
It just seems like that's a cock fest.

182
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.770
If you're a young boy and you're trying to be an actor in Hollywood or a singer,

183
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.760
how are you going to avoid that shit?
Look at these fucking parties.

184
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:13.040
All these guys that hands on each other.
Well,
if the thing about gay guys,
right,

185
00:11:13.041 --> 00:11:18.041
it's like a lot of gay guys like guys that look younger,

186
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.980
they like,
like cute guy.
Twinks they don't,
they call them twinks.

187
00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:23.790
You don't have a lot of hair,

188
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.750
which really funny because a nd what the fuck's his name from?
Uh,

189
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:33.000
the guy from a,
that runs bravo.
What does that guy,
oh,
Andy Collins.
Yeah,
that guy.

190
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.540
He got in trouble for saying twink and he's gay.
Really?
Yeah,
he's getting shit.

191
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:38.490
He's awesome at doing everything.

192
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:43.491
Twink is like a thin hairless like young,

193
00:11:43.651 --> 00:11:46.680
young skin,
young shape kids.
They call them twins guy.

194
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.900
Sorry Darren till walking into the octagon.

195
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.660
Let's actually watch this fight cause he,
I get creeped out.

196
00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:55.420
We all have kids and I feel after all the time it makes,
it makes me sick.

197
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.730
Jesus Christ,
man.
Yeah.

198
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.010
Well Corey Feldman apparently has been talking a lot about it too.
Not Adam.

199
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.370
It's crazy.
It's crazy.
But the question is why is he crazy?

200
00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:11.440
Is he crazy?
Because he was molested him.
It doesn't say he doesn't name names,

201
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:12.310
but maybe he will.

202
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:17.490
If someone said 80% of kids in Hollywood or in the entertainment business have

203
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:21.820
had some kind of run in with,
uh,
someone tried to molest him,

204
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.750
would you believe it?
Yes.
80%.
Yes.
I would say a day.
I don't know.

205
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:29.230
I don't want to give out crazy numbers.
I would say a large number.

206
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.390
I wouldn't be cycling Olympic team

207
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.130
because I think there's legitimate agents.
This is what we've been gentlemen,

208
00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:38.740
managers and I think Disney has a pretty great record.

209
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.200
Probably just never getting worse.
They're probably legit,

210
00:12:41.201 --> 00:12:43.850
but those ones don't get any work.
It just seems like it celebrates,

211
00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.920
like they just hook each other up and they're just looking for,
uh,

212
00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.150
they're only going to know.
Some of them do.

213
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.310
There's definitely predators that are organized.

214
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:56.650
Definitely no one ever made any advances at you,
Joe?
No,
never.
Nothing.
Not like,

215
00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:58.030
Hey,
come give me a better comic.

216
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.960
John said he got molested in Hollywood when Alex Jones,

217
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.510
Alex Jones talked about that,
correct.

218
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:13.630
<v 2>[inaudible]
okay.</v>
