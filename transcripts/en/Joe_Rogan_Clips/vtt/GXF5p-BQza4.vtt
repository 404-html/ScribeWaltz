00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.430
Hello bitches and it,

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.080
it's not so easy to sort out who's the good ones and who's the bad war.

3
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.580
Sort of like what you were talking about,

4
00:00:09.581 --> 00:00:12.580
this people that have this simplistic idea that all you have to do is get Donald

5
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.200
Trump high on DMT and he's gonna see the light.
It's not necessarily the case,

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.570
not necessarily the case.
I think it would be wasted on him.

7
00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:24.571
I think we would have to do at least at least an indwelling catheter,

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.800
maybe two or three hours of continuous DMT fusion that,

9
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.730
sorry,
sorry.
Wrong,
wrong term,
intravenous,
but it's very,

10
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.370
very Freudian.
He decided to go through his dick.
Right.
That is hilarious.

11
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.290
Not that we'll,
we'll go through the vein.
I don't know man.

12
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:52.880
I think you might have nailed it the first time.
Tom Might be the way to get it.

13
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.950
Maybe the way to get it to them in some perfect Russian robot fuck doll who just

14
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.310
locks him up and you know,
right when he gets inside of her,

15
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.830
she gets him in full guard,

16
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.850
locks him in place and a catheter like delivery.

17
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.190
Wow.
Yeah.
Maybe they can program it like,
like Dmt,

18
00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:16.110
like little nanobots that go right through the hole,

19
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.430
right through the penis hole right into the system.

20
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.350
They just run out of her right in there and he's ball.
He just takes off.

21
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.090
But again,
there has to be something there.
Somebody animate that have an effect.

22
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.510
Please.
So many anime thing.
I know there's somebody out there that wants to,

23
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.000
that do it
the way to do it.

24
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.220
Just some perfect,
Huh?
Super Hot.
10 Russian hooker looking chick.

25
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.460
No offense to Russian hookers,
right?
Or Donald Trump or Donald Trump.
Even.

26
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.330
Look,
Donald Trump was a baby at one point in time.
You know,
and you and I,

27
00:01:52.331 --> 00:01:56.140
we both have children.
We know this.
It's a delicate process of turning an adult,

28
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.640
uh,
making an adult out of a child.
And a lot of factors come into play,

29
00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:03.670
but almost all babies are born.
Well,

30
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.660
they'd certainly have their own personality.
They're in many ways a blank slate.

31
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.790
And so they're in a lot of ways,

32
00:02:09.791 --> 00:02:11.890
a victim of the environment that they're raised in.

33
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.500
And that's one of the weird things that I've developed in my own self over the

34
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.620
last few years is just thinking about people as babies.

35
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.660
I think of everyone has a baby now.
Like since I've had kids,
I don't,

36
00:02:25.661 --> 00:02:27.700
I mean obviously I think of them as being adults,

37
00:02:27.701 --> 00:02:31.630
but I think of them as an adult that used to be a baby and I never used to do

38
00:02:31.631 --> 00:02:35.080
that before I had children.
I used to think of people as being in a static state.

39
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.510
I mean,
you and I go,
well,
this is Dennis Mckenna.

40
00:02:37.511 --> 00:02:40.240
This is how Dennis Mccann has always been,
and now I go,
oh,

41
00:02:40.241 --> 00:02:44.500
Dennis used to be a little boy.
You know,
Dennis was a baby.
He used to,
you know,

42
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.280
and then he saw a lot of things in the land,
a lot of things.

43
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.080
But you know what I mean?
I know Trump,

44
00:02:50.081 --> 00:02:55.000
he's almost as much of a victim as he is of a perpetrator.
In a way.

45
00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:58.060
He is.
If Trump's a good example of somebody,

46
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.040
I mean in some ways he's still a child.
I know he never really grew up.

47
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:05.830
I mean that's part of the problem.
They'll and everyone,

48
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.600
because he has so much power and money,
everyone kowtows to his impulses.

49
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.740
But you know,

50
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.770
I mean in some ways like Jared and Ivanka or maybe a stabilizing influence on

51
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:20.410
him,
although,
although even though I'm sure there are agendas,

52
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:23.350
totally evil as well,
so confused at,

53
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.860
they definitely don't deserve the amount of power that they're wielding,

54
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:27.880
nor does anybody.
What's,

55
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:32.110
what's more fascinating about him than anything is that what he holds up to the

56
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:35.590
golden standard is success,
right?
I mean,
this is the guy that,
you know,

57
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:38.740
everything has to have his name on it.
So on Trump this and Trump that,

58
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:43.090
and if you looked at like the great American vision of success,

59
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:46.000
it's to become some sort of super rich ultra billionaire.

60
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.410
But even though everybody knows he's a super rich ultra billionaire,

61
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.460
he still is deceptive about his own success.

62
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.510
He still has to lie about it.
He still has to distort it far past,

63
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.090
whether it's the numbers that came to the inauguration,

64
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:03.760
whether it's the numbers that he won the electoral college by.

65
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.270
He lies about all these different things.
And it's an,
it's inherent.

66
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.490
It's a part of him,
this intense lack of satisfaction with any result,

67
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.270
any,
any result,
even if it's winning by a mile,

68
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.650
he must win by a hundred miles.
Right.
You know,
and that's childish.

69
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.180
That's like a intense,

70
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.680
but it's that same intense dissatisfaction that's inherently very dangerous in a

71
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:30.010
leader because it's leading him to make these,

72
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.930
these critical judgments that aren't based entirely on reality,

73
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.280
but rather an di what he wants people to perceive.
Right.
That,

74
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.240
that's quite right.
I think that's dangerous.
That's what we were saying before.

75
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.660
No thoughtfulness.
There's no thoughtfulness on the man.

76
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:50.470
There's no reflection,
reflection,
a lack of humility.

77
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:55.090
So this is a,
this is not what you want and you know,
leaders,

78
00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:59.020
because we see what's happening.
Like the,
you know,
um,

79
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.930
he's going back and forth with the Soviets.

80
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:06.931
He's going back and forth with North Korea and it's like a schoolyard spat,

81
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.730
you know,
but these people have nuclear weapons to throw,

82
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:13.810
so we need to back off from that.
Donald,
you know,
it's just,

83
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.770
but he can't do that cause he has to respond.

84
00:05:17.771 --> 00:05:22.000
He has this impulse to respond.
I mean,
I think that,
uh,

85
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.440
you know,
I don't know.
I mean it,

86
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.610
he's not going to be exposed to Iowasca pretty sure unfortunately.

87
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:35.380
Cause it would help him.
And uh,
you know,
what,
what is disturbing to me,

88
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.390
many things about Donald and this sort of reality distortion and he's created

89
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:44.320
his people,
you know,
they take it seriously.
I mean,

90
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.930
they're sort of like intimidated by it.
None of them.

91
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:51.610
People are standing up and saying,
well,
this is not true.
This is not true.

92
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:55.750
You're completely diluted about this here.
You know?
Uh,
I mean,

93
00:05:55.751 --> 00:06:00.751
there's a some sort of impulse to show some risks backed when no respect is,

94
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.020
is,
do you know,
I mean,
respect for the office,

95
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.020
the Office for whatever,
some,

96
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.310
but then when he comes out with these things that are obviously not true,

97
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.670
I'm sorry.
There are no alternative facts.

98
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.130
Alternative facts are lies.

99
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.570
There's only fas are candy coating of bullshit.

100
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.960
Alternative facts is the most hilarious candy coating of bullshit ever.

101
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.410
My hope is that we get through this without nuclear war and then we realized

102
00:06:32.411 --> 00:06:35.780
that we can't have a fucking president and the idea of having one alpha champ

103
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:40.580
run the entire group of 300 plus million people is insane and it doesn't work

104
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:42.410
when you have technology,

105
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:45.290
when you have this ability to communicate instantaneously,

106
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.400
globally with everybody constantly.
It's just,

107
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:54.350
it's an archaic idea that served its time but needs to be revamped.

108
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.450
How would you do that?
That's a really good question.
You know,

109
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.700
I'm not the guy that to be the architect of the future civilization,

110
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.590
but I would think that putting as much power as we put into one individual is

111
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:09.400
insanely problematic.
It's just you,
you,

112
00:07:09.401 --> 00:07:11.600
you're dealing with all these ego issues,

113
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.160
decision making issues and also the camps that two separate camps,

114
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:20.720
the right left camp.
That's crazy too.
That's crazy too.
Right?
Right.
No,

115
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.890
I mean,
I think one way to approach it wouldn't have to be such a,

116
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.730
such a tremendous shift from what we've got would be to go to a parliamentary

117
00:07:32.121 --> 00:07:35.510
system like Canada has,
for example,

118
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.690
where you represent your party and if the other party gets enough,

119
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.790
you know,
they can vote,

120
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.780
vote you out without going through the whole impeachment process.

121
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.490
There is no impeachment process.

122
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:54.110
The parties can form a coalition and vote the prime minister out,

123
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.350
you know?
And it's much easier to topple a government.

124
00:07:57.351 --> 00:07:59.450
And in some ways that's a good thing.
You know,

125
00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:03.680
it's more resilient and Canada's a good,
you know,

126
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:08.120
there are many parliamentary democracies,
but that's the one that's closest.

127
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:13.540
I think there's also an issue with dealing with the real problems of the world

128
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.470
in a,
in a time where they're the,

129
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.790
the realities of say,

130
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.740
Syria and what's going on over there are so horrific and they're so far removed

131
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.800
from the realities that we deal with here.
You,

132
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.300
you almost need to have someone who has some sort of experience with those

133
00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:35.740
people and those lands to understand and put it into perspective.
Yeah.

134
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:40.550
And I think we're entirely lacking of that perspective.

135
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.010
Like a,
in terms of our culture,

136
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:48.310
I don't think we understand what a brutal military Terry dictatorship is.

137
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:53.330
Like.
I think we see it on television and it seems almost too abstract,

138
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.930
but the president has to deal with that in a,
in a very real way.

139
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:02.700
And then no one person can.
But that's what advisors are.
Exactly.

140
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.360
But if you don't have good advisors or if you choose to ignore them,

141
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.080
then you're in deep shit.
Right.
Or I mean,

142
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:15.170
I mean Donald appoints and visors who already share his delusions of course.

143
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.470
So there's nobody there to say,
wait a minute,
you're wrong.
You know,

144
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:22.110
and based on experience and expertise and all of this,

145
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:24.750
you're wrong and you need to rethink it.

146
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:29.751
That's what bothers me about one among many things about the ways that he

147
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.640
proceeds.
I mean,
you know,

148
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:38.690
the thing that bothers me most about the change in administrations is that they

149
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:43.590
have basically looked at climate change.
They said,
we don't believe it.

150
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.400
It's not happening.
We're not,
it's not even on the table.

151
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.300
And actually that needs to be the thing on the table.

152
00:09:51.301 --> 00:09:54.030
That should be the primary thing we're talking about.

153
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.230
All this other stuff is important,

154
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.030
but we're talking about the accelerating changes that are,

155
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.890
that are essentially under,

156
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.690
under mining the mechanisms that keep,
uh,

157
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.800
the earth habitable by life.
This is a pretty important issue.

158
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.180
And to have people that say,
well,
it isn't,
you know,

159
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:21.930
we don't believe in climate change.
Well I'm sorry,
climate change is real.

160
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:26.400
I don't care what the fuck you believe it is real.
And for,

161
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:31.550
for this administration to not only ignore it but then roll back all these other

162
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:36.170
measures that were put into place is,
uh,
you know,

163
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.900
it's just the stupidest idea.
I can imagine not just roll back,

164
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:43.680
but removing the funding for monitoring.
Yeah.
Remove,
which is really scary.

165
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.670
Suppressing the information and all this.
So,
you know,

166
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:51.270
if you look at the people in the,
in the Trump administration,

167
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:55.320
they're either from the energy industry,
Rex Tillerson,
you know,

168
00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:01.010
I think the government has become essentially a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil and

169
00:11:01.281 --> 00:11:05.700
Oh,
and not the other way around.
And so you know,
that's a,

170
00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:07.920
that's what they're doing and that's terrifying.
You know,

171
00:11:07.921 --> 00:11:11.370
it's Goldman Sachs or Exxon Mobil.
I mean,

172
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.820
corporations run the world.
We've known this for a long time.

173
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.450
Governments are just,
puppets does this.
In some ways it's this,

174
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:22.260
it's just too eerily parallel to what we're talking about with the rain forest,

175
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:23.940
with all these,

176
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.530
all this potential in the rain forest and almost this race,

177
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.300
the race to see like,

178
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:34.560
can we get to these incredible new plants that we haven't discovered before?

179
00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:38.310
We fuck it up by cutting down all the hardwoods and burning all the forest.

180
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.520
Can we get to this potential future utopia of people being able to read each

181
00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:49.470
other's minds?
Being able to communicate simultaneously all throughout the,

182
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.380
of understanding each other regardless of language.

183
00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:57.220
Can we get to that before we blow ourselves up before we get into a nuclear war

184
00:11:57.221 --> 00:11:59.950
with fucking North Korea and it is crazy shit,
right?

185
00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:04.960
This insane administration that's existing in this sort of chaotic manner

186
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.220
alongside some of the brightest minds and most innovative people that have ever

187
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:13.240
walked the face of the planet that are influencing things in a way today that

188
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:16.180
it's really unparalleled in terms of human history,

189
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.500
the potential that any new invention or innovation can enact,

190
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.910
whether it's understanding new compounds that we discovered in the rain forest

191
00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:29.050
or some new technology that's made in Silicon Valley.
I mean,
it's an amazing,

192
00:12:29.051 --> 00:12:32.110
amazing parallel.
Yeah,
no,
I agree.

193
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:37.111
It does seem like it does seem like a race in some ways between idiocy and

194
00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:38.620
genius.
Yeah.

195
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:43.710
They're incredibly brilliant people and they're developing,
and I mean,

196
00:12:43.711 --> 00:12:47.800
there are solutions to the problems that face us.
Right?
But they have,

197
00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:50.620
on the other side,
you have the,
no,
nothing's,
you know,

198
00:12:50.621 --> 00:12:55.150
horror marching into the future.
Eyes firmly fixed on the rear view mirror.

199
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.020
It's like,
oh yeah,
coal technology.
That's the greatest thing.

200
00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:03.530
Let's go back to that.
I mean,
is that stupid or what?
You know,

201
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:08.170
coal technology is obsolete.
It's stupid.
You know,

202
00:13:08.171 --> 00:13:12.010
there are better solutions,
you know,
or the whole attitude toward drugs.

203
00:13:12.011 --> 00:13:15.970
All the war on drugs.
The war on drugs was great.
Let's go back to that.

204
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.620
I mean these are people who are not living in the present for one thing,

205
00:13:20.621 --> 00:13:24.460
not planning for the future and they don't really want to know.

206
00:13:24.461 --> 00:13:28.270
It's like our minds are made up.
We know drug abuse has got to be bad,

207
00:13:28.271 --> 00:13:31.390
so let's prohibit it.
Let's go back to the old model.

208
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:36.400
They're not capable of entertaining new ideas and that's a problem.

209
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.940
You know,
what do you think about the idea and then I've,

210
00:13:38.941 --> 00:13:40.240
I've heard this brought up and I've,

211
00:13:40.241 --> 00:13:45.241
I've entertained at my own self that maybe we need some sort of enemy or some

212
00:13:46.421 --> 00:13:51.421
sort of thing to resist in order to rise to the full potential of innovation,

213
00:13:51.611 --> 00:13:55.660
of ideas of that we almost need some sort of mountain to conquer.

214
00:13:55.661 --> 00:14:00.100
We need some sort of a force to be aware of.
It really makes people rise up.

215
00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:01.330
Like I've,
I've seen more,

216
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.840
more people politically active and politically engaged now post election than I

217
00:14:07.301 --> 00:14:10.930
ever did before the election because I didn't expect Trump to win.
Right.

218
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.460
And now that he did,
it's like,

219
00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:17.320
it's raised up this resistance to this insane level that I've never experienced

220
00:14:17.321 --> 00:14:21.460
before in my life.
I mean,
it feels to me like Kent State all over again.

221
00:14:21.461 --> 00:14:26.160
It feels no where we,
it was a real shock that he won.
And it's,
yeah,

222
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.030
I agree.
It's been a wake up call.

223
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:33.400
So now there is this strong resistance,
um,
movement.

224
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.130
Um,
and they're,
and,

225
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:39.850
and that's a good thing that that's happened that also journalism.

226
00:14:39.851 --> 00:14:44.530
How suddenly found itself again,
you know,
some journalists,

227
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.890
some sectors of it are beginning to,
you know,

228
00:14:47.891 --> 00:14:50.680
for so long they were essentially stenographers.

229
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:53.780
They would repeat whatever the mouthpieces of the government.

230
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:59.080
Now the journalists are questioning everything and asking tough questions of

231
00:14:59.871 --> 00:15:03.560
these clowns and expecting answers.
And it's kind of like,
you know,

232
00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:06.530
when I was young,
I wanted to be a journalist.
Right?

233
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.190
I thought Walter Cronkite was the pet cats pajamas.

234
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:14.840
I wanted to be like him.
I wanted,
or I wanted to be a foreign correspondent.

235
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.600
You know,
I just admire journalism.

236
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:22.100
And for a long time I have not found anything to admire in it.
It's like they're,

237
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:27.410
they've all been lobotomized or something,
but they're rediscovering it,
you know,

238
00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:31.970
the good ones are rediscovering it and the reemergence of investigative

239
00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:35.630
journalism.
And right now I think that's the,
you know,

240
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:40.220
that's our best hope because I think that,
uh,
these guys,

241
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:41.930
they'll just keep digging.

242
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:45.890
There's going to be so much bad stuff come up about Trump and the oldest

243
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:49.400
collusion with the Russians and,
you know,
um,

244
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.210
potentially enough to impeach him.
And the question is,

245
00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:57.950
will the Republicans find enough and enough spine to,
uh,

246
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:02.460
you know,
to do that?
But they did with Nixon.
Yeah.
You know,

247
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.190
and I think some,
I mean,

248
00:16:04.191 --> 00:16:08.240
what he did was not nearly as bad as what Trump is doing,

249
00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:11.270
and so we'll see where it goes.
But,
you know,

250
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:15.530
shameless in a way that Nixon never watched shameless.
And,
and,
uh,
you know,
I,

251
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.680
I take a certain comfort in the thought that,

252
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.610
uh,
you know,
they have all these draconian things they want to do,

253
00:16:25.611 --> 00:16:30.530
roll back all the environmental regulations,
whole immigration thing,
uh,

254
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.790
you know,
uh,
Warren trucks,
but none of it is going to happen.

255
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:39.560
None of it actually will happen with the stuff's pretty real here in California.

256
00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:44.030
I mean,
I see showing up at home depots,
they showed up at home depot is,

257
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:47.830
I have a friend who was born in America,
he's Mexican and a,

258
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.150
they asked him where he was born.
They pulled me,

259
00:16:50.151 --> 00:16:52.970
he's a veteran and he knew like how to deal with this.

260
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:55.550
And he knew what's legal and what's not.
And He,
you know,
a grown man,

261
00:16:55.551 --> 00:17:00.170
he's in his fifties and they a citizen and a citizen and a veteran.
I mean,

262
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.320
he served the country in,
in our Iraq.

263
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.280
And so they're coming up to him and ask him,
you know,
where are you born?

264
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.070
And he's like,
you can't ask me that.
I was like,
you don't,

265
00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:13.070
you're not allowed to ask me where I'm born.
And then,
you know,
he says,

266
00:17:13.071 --> 00:17:14.100
who are you?
And like,
what,
you know,

267
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.450
we're immigration and whatever the ice stands for.
And he goes,

268
00:17:17.451 --> 00:17:20.030
let me see some documentation.
The guy shows him his badge and it's Kinda goes,

269
00:17:20.031 --> 00:17:22.880
that's not your fucking documentation plot you God damn documentation.

270
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.270
And he pulls out his military id.
It's like,
look,
here's my documentation.

271
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:29.780
This is me.
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you asking people where they're born?

272
00:17:29.781 --> 00:17:31.340
I was born in California.
Okay.

273
00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:33.980
You're not allowed to just go up to people and ask them where they're born.

274
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.700
But people that don't know that they're,
they're getting arrested,

275
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.530
they're getting taken and they're getting deported.

276
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.860
They're taking people that are dropping off their children at school,

277
00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.540
the grabbing people.

278
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:48.290
And there's a bunch of cases of this and you're just hearing about the cases

279
00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:50.000
that get to the press,
right.

280
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.180
So many of them that you're never going to hear about.
And this is just rampant.

281
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.890
And this never existed before.
Not In the Bush administration.
No,
I mean,

282
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.450
not in Bush senior.
I mean,

283
00:18:00.451 --> 00:18:03.420
it just didn't happen before in any conservatives administration.

284
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.440
They didn't treat it like this.
This is a weird time.
Yeah,

285
00:18:06.441 --> 00:18:10.330
it is a very weird time.
But I think it's temporary.
Well,
I hope so.

286
00:18:10.331 --> 00:18:13.570
But what you said about journalism I think is important to point out that the,

287
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.810
they're just as they,

288
00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.420
they fucked up just as hard with the left as they did with the right.
I mean,

289
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.010
they,
they let the Clintons get away with a lot of horse shit.

290
00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.400
They gotta let Obama get away with a lot of horseshit.
They,
they,

291
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.110
they said talking points,

292
00:18:26.111 --> 00:18:29.320
they were given talking points and they ran with those talking points so that

293
00:18:29.321 --> 00:18:32.290
they would get access to the president and they would get access to congressmen

294
00:18:32.291 --> 00:18:35.110
and the senators.
And they did it forever and it wasn't journalism.

295
00:18:35.111 --> 00:18:39.030
And you're right.
And the,
they're the reason why this guy got into place in this,

296
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.090
in this situation right now,
it's just as much of a fault of them,

297
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:47.890
of not holding the left to the fire as it is to,
you know,

298
00:18:47.891 --> 00:18:52.590
what's going on right now.
Yeah.
I mean,
journalism house a lot to answer for it.

299
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:57.250
There's no doubt about it.
I just have a,
you know,

300
00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.370
maybe it's a delusion.
I would just,
I would just,
I liked,

301
00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:04.180
I would like to think that journalism is finding its voice and finding its

302
00:19:04.181 --> 00:19:08.680
function.
Again,
it's function is to,
you know,
as somebody said,
I think it was,

303
00:19:08.681 --> 00:19:09.760
I have stone,
you know,

304
00:19:09.761 --> 00:19:14.380
the function is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.
Right.

305
00:19:14.381 --> 00:19:19.270
And that's offense essentially the journalistic mandates or express the truth

306
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:24.190
and the truth,
speak the truth and form.
Don't assume,

307
00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.100
you know,
play the propaganda game.

308
00:19:27.101 --> 00:19:31.270
Be able to look beyond it and they have to be in this environment and the,

309
00:19:31.271 --> 00:19:34.180
where people keep calling fake news,
they have to be undeniable.

310
00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:37.810
And I think in that sense they are reinvigorated.
Yeah.

311
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.360
I mean that's one of the things that,
you know,
you're,

312
00:19:40.361 --> 00:19:43.420
you're seeing that's one of the things that the times talked about,

313
00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:47.310
like after it was over,
after the election was over,
they were like,
we are,
we're,

314
00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:51.970
we're going to reinvigorate,
refocus our dedication on journalism.
Yeah.

315
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.930
And I think that's a good side.
Yeah.

316
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.360
Then the other side of it is that we can just,
you know,

317
00:19:58.361 --> 00:20:03.160
the way the Trump administration proceeds with all these things,

318
00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:04.060
they wanted to,

319
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:09.130
they inevitably just get bogged down in the litigation protest to the,

320
00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:13.990
you know,
at some point they do have to answer to Congress.
So I think,

321
00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:14.880
you know,
I'm,

322
00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:19.020
the wheels were already coming off before even took the oath of office.
Yeah.

323
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.820
They've continued to come off and it's just going to get,

324
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:27.300
it's kind of like just a sort of a degenerate into litigation acrimony and the

325
00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:32.950
ability to get anything passed,
uh,
you know,

326
00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.430
which is all good.
I mean,
it's essentially,
in this case,

327
00:20:36.431 --> 00:20:41.240
chaos is our friend because they won't be able to advance this draconian the

328
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.690
agenda.
Thank God.
And you know,

329
00:20:43.691 --> 00:20:48.520
hopefully circumstances will enable us to get rid of them quickly.

330
00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:58.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>
