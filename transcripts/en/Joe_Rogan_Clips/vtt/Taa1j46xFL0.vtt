00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.820
People ask me,
how do you define wealth?

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.400
You defined wealth when your young daughter,

3
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:10.070
before you step on the Joe Rogan Platform,
writes this to you.
She wrote,

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.650
I love you.
That's very cute.
That's wealth out a billionaire.

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.630
Yeah.
Um,
it's a valuable,

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.980
wouldn't say it's wealth.
I think not being accurate with your words.
By the way.

7
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:26.100
I will probably keep this forever born.
You should.
Yeah,

8
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:28.470
definitely don't put in your pocket.
What if you sweat on it?
Okay.

9
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:32.530
I'll leave it here.
So,
uh,

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
we were talking right before the podcast started about what I was just talking

11
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:43.110
about in the previous podcast about Patriarchy and what Patrion is done to a

12
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:48.111
deep platforms Sargon of a cod in what I think we both agree was sloppy use of

13
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:53.400
language on his part.
But he was,
I don't believe he was saying something racist.

14
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.780
He was using a racist word though it was using it to describe someone.

15
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.100
He was actually using it against white nationalists against white supremacists

16
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:07.830
and and saying how ridiculous they were being in that they were being exactly

17
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.110
what they describe and when they're using racist terms to describe black people.

18
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.600
But he did it using those terms and it,

19
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.750
it wasn't a good speech like what he said.

20
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.280
And one of the things that I'd said on the previous podcast is when you do

21
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:26.790
podcasts,
you're not mapping out what you're going to say,

22
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.690
you're free flowing.
Sometimes words come out clunky.

23
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.070
And I think that was what,

24
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.720
what was going on in the case with him in this particular conversation that he

25
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:41.040
had,
there wasn't even on his page and patron decided to ban him.

26
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.100
And I think for him that was something to tune of like a $12,000 or more a

27
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.060
month.
Yeah,
quite a bit of his income.
You know,

28
00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:54.900
a lot of us then suggested that people move to subscribe star,

29
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:59.520
which was a and other platform that came out of nowhere and they've now been

30
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.450
shutdown.
How'd they get shut down?
I don't know the details,

31
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:07.451
so I hope I'm not misspeaking but I think pay pal and stripe decided that

32
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:11.840
somehow they're violating their terms of their terms,

33
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.600
their terms of service for whatever reason.
And uh,

34
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.650
apparently any payouts that have gone out are safe,
but you,

35
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.640
it won't happen through paypal or through stripe.

36
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:26.440
So they have to find some alternate platform,
I think Payoneer or something.

37
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.670
So it's getting difficult to even receive the generous donations from people.

38
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.600
So a lot of people,
um,

39
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.130
that are doing podcasts and doing these youtube shows,

40
00:02:38.131 --> 00:02:40.800
they operate on donations,
which is

41
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.040
a really fair way to do things because you're,

42
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.850
if say if you have a subscription based service and your uh,

43
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.550
asking people like saved for Sirius satellite radio or something like that,

44
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.540
you might not be happy with the content and you might,

45
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.700
you might choose to cancels your subscription,

46
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:04.870
but these people can get what they get already for free.
Right.

47
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.080
They choose to donate because they think it's valuable to them,

48
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:12.910
which is really interesting.
I liked that,
that format,
that model,

49
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.630
because for the longest time people were trying to figure out how could you make

50
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:17.860
money off the Internet?
Well the,

51
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:22.780
the idea was advertising revenue and Sam Harris has a lengthly rant that's very

52
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:26.130
accurate about this that he puts on his podcast.

53
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.360
Ma often it's like a seven minute rant explaining why he doesn't use ads and why

54
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:34.570
he prefers to have people just donate what they would like.

55
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.630
And he was one of the biggest patrion people.

56
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.080
He was one of the biggest accounts on Patriot.

57
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.810
He pulled his Patriot on two days ago.
Right.
And you know,

58
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:47.920
that was a huge statement because to him that is incredibly valuable.

59
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.900
I'm really curious to know what Jack Conte,
the founder of the,
of Patriot,

60
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.440
what his ultimate trajectory is going to be as,
I mean,

61
00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:59.150
as someone who will teach his psychology of decision making,

62
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.930
we studies decision making who's housed in a business school.
Uh,

63
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.300
I think it'd be a wonderful case analysis down the road.
Probably Harvard,

64
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:10.570
we'll teach it of whether he just doubles down,

65
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.810
which it seems like this is what they're doing because they released a statement

66
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:18.670
that didn't seem to suggest that there was any sort of possibility of reflection

67
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:19.504
on their part.

68
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.780
Do you have a sense of whether the market will allow him to sort of realign his

69
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:27.550
thinking or do you think he's just going to double down all the way to hell?

70
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.060
I think he's going to weather the storm if I'm going to be completely honest,

71
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.590
not what I would like.

72
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.790
What I would like is for them to support free speech and for them to make a

73
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:41.530
differentiation between what is the actual hate speech and what is a clunky use

74
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:45.010
of language,
which is what I think Sargon did.
Right.

75
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.130
It was a clunky use of language.
And I think Sargon is a very intelligent guy.

76
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:51.310
I've had him on the podcast,
I've talked to him.
He's a very bright,

77
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.720
and he made on the show several great points.
Yeah.
He's a very smart guy.

78
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.250
Um,
when he was on it,

79
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:05.080
just what he's on someone else's show doing that.
Uh,
you know,

80
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:07.630
I felt like,
and this is one of the things I said in the last podcast,

81
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.850
I feel like if people decide that what he did was offensive to them,

82
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:17.851
to the point where they decided to not renew their subscriptions or not continue

83
00:05:17.931 --> 00:05:19.510
to send him money through patriot,

84
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.100
that's probably the best use of that format and the best way for them and the

85
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:29.080
market to decide.
That's really,
I think,
how it should be done.
Incidentally,

86
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.300
regarding the n word,

87
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.500
and I'm sure Jamie will now double check what I'm saying as he always does.
Uh,

88
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.050
there was a dean at some university,
I think out in Seattle.

89
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.730
I could be wrong,
that at some point had suggested,
uh,

90
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.300
someone had asked which book a student that asked which book should I read or I

91
00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:50.400
can't remember the exact same story.

92
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.340
And I think the title of the book was the n word.

93
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.850
And she had,
I think the dean a was a woman.
I,
if I'm not mistaken,
uh,

94
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.980
had simply recommended that book,

95
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.940
but she said the word out loud and she,
he or she,

96
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:12.620
I can't remember again to the person's sex got into trouble.
So,
you know,

97
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:17.000
I wonder if we shouldn't just sort of demystify this word in an if,
if,
if,

98
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.990
if people weren't so,
I mean,
we have to now say the n word.

99
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.510
We have to say the r word.

100
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:28.511
I got banned from Twitter for 12 hours because at one point I was interacting

101
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:33.950
with some schmuck who I called retarded,

102
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.360
the generate a
schmuck,
whatever it was.

103
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.920
I can't remember the exact combination of consults and I was banned for using

104
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.040
the r word.
So I mean,

105
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.280
where does this anime w how many more words do we have to remove from the

106
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:53.000
lexicon?
I mean,
don't give these words so much power.
Don't,
don't be so sensitive.

107
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:55.610
I mean,
I know we've talked about these kinds of issues in the past,

108
00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.200
but does it not seem too outrageous that someone who recommends a book with the

109
00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:03.860
title being the n word gets into trouble?
I mean,
it's insane.
Well as even better.

110
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:08.390
One Netflix,
there was an executive at Netflix that was forced to resign,

111
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.220
uh,
due to my friend Tom Segura is comedy special.

112
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.700
And my friend Tom Segura has a bit in his act about how there's certain words

113
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:25.880
that are just gone you can't use anymore.
And he says,
retard.

114
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.550
He's like,
that word,
you can't use that word anymore.

115
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:33.140
And he goes out and it's not about using that word.
He what?
He's basically,

116
00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:36.950
he's not like,
he's not justifying the use of the word,
he's just,

117
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.670
it's simply stating that this is a word that you could no longer use.

118
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.460
So they get attacked a bunch of letter writing campaign from mental health

119
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:48.240
organizations and you know,

120
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.520
people dealing with people that have disabilities and they're saying that
you're,

121
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.520
you're being able list and your being discriminatory and all these different

122
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:57.650
things and they're,
they're basically trying to silence him.

123
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.260
Even though if you look at the actual bid itself,

124
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:02.390
he's not using it to describe a person.

125
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.110
He's just essentially it acknowledging that the word exists.

126
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.330
So this guy who was an executive at Netflix says in a meeting,

127
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.900
you can't use that word because that word,

128
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.980
it's like saying nigger around black people,
right.

129
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.800
Just says that you're going to get in trouble.

130
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.810
Now I set it in the earlier show too.

131
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:28.450
I'm just saying when I read Sargon of our cards thing,
like I said,

132
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:33.510
it's preposterous to say the n word and I've said the n word before and in most

133
00:08:33.591 --> 00:08:34.910
cases I will say it,

134
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.470
but he actually said the word and the reason why he said the word and the reason

135
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:43.850
why I just said the word is because he was trying to demonstrate that this is an

136
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:44.750
offensive thing,

137
00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:49.751
like saying retard is just like saying that he gets fired for that,

138
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.530
for simply making this comparison that you know,

139
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:59.070
and we're talking about uncensored standup comedy.
By the way,

140
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.870
this is a network that features that word prominently on several different

141
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:08.850
comedy specials in multiple situations,
whether it's cat Williams,

142
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.750
multiple uses of the word Dave Chappelle.

143
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.460
I mean that word gets thrown about like a beach ball at a fucking concert.

144
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.070
That word gets tossed around a lot.

145
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:23.940
But this guy saying it because he's white,
they're like eee.

146
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.520
Nef of your work here,
sir.

147
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.870
Speaking of comedy and sort of political correctness with comedy,
uh,

148
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.220
in my forthcoming book,

149
00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:36.340
I have a section where I talk about professors who got into Trelawney.

150
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.380
We've all heard about the comedians getting into trouble for violating some

151
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.520
politically correct dictum,
but professors,
many cases,
very,

152
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:48.780
very high profile professors getting in trouble for incredibly innocuous jokes.

153
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:51.900
And actually I brought a list of names cause I thought I might not remember
them.

154
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:57.120
Can I mention a few?
The few of the cases,
so Lasar Greenfield,

155
00:09:57.121 --> 00:09:58.160
who was the,
uh,

156
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:03.440
president elect of the American College of surgeons and the Editor in chief of a

157
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.660
journal called a Gr surgery.

158
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:11.661
News w had written an editorial a few years ago where he was talking about the

159
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.840
antidepressant benefits of coming in contact with sperm and other words at it.

160
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.240
And this was based on a peer reviewed scientific paper.

161
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.260
Actually two of the authors of that paper are folks that I know of quite well,

162
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.693
friends of mine.

163
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.230
And they had demonstrated that women who have protected sex versus unprotected

164
00:10:34.231 --> 00:10:38.610
sex and up scoring differently on these depressive measures.
In other words,

165
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:43.170
there was some sort of protective element to actually being exposed to sperm.

166
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.430
And so in his,
um,
editorial,
he made a joke.

167
00:10:47.431 --> 00:10:49.320
It was during Valentines,
he said,

168
00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:53.760
so now there is a gift that a man can give a woman that's beyond flowers or

169
00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:55.410
chocolates or something to that effect.

170
00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:01.140
He had to step down from being president of the American College of surgeons.

171
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.920
He had to step down from being editor in chief because a whole bunch of women

172
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.280
were very offended by that sperm joke.
Now the,
the,

173
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.360
the authors of the paper and question wrote a brilliant response.

174
00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.370
The response where they said,
how,

175
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:19.430
how could he be treated in this way when all he was doing as actually literally

176
00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:24.630
reporting the data,
the findings from our peer reviewed study.

177
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:29.340
So that's one example.
Another example is a certain,
uh,

178
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.670
I think it's third,
Tim Hunt who was a Nobel prize winner in 2001.

179
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.240
I remember this one.
Yeah.
Right.
Uh,
who,
who he basically,

180
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.420
he was a speaking I think had in Korea at a g women in science conference where

181
00:11:42.661 --> 00:11:45.600
he very in a jocular way said,
you know,

182
00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:49.710
it's a real problem when you have women in your lab.
They fall in love with you,

183
00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:54.370
you fall in love with them.
And so it's better to have segregated labs.
His wife,

184
00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:54.831
by the way,

185
00:11:54.831 --> 00:11:59.410
is a staunch feminist who's a very prominent scientist and she confirmed that

186
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:04.370
he's hardly,
you know,
a rabid sexist.
He went through all sorts of hell.
Yeah,

187
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.520
I remember that.
And he was joking and he was joking.
And I,

188
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.540
in the book I discussed several other of these examples,
so,

189
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.720
so imagine you would think that a unblemished exemplary career as a scientist up

190
00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:21.280
to getting a Nobel prize,
good,
potentially protect you,

191
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.030
but one comment that someone decides can,

192
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.390
can unleashed a tsunami of outrage and you're dead.
Well,

193
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:33.330
I think the problem is reacting to the people that are reacting to the common,

194
00:12:33.331 --> 00:12:34.990
right.
It's not the common itself.

195
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.870
It's the cowards that are running things that give into that.

196
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:42.790
And the Netflix thing is particularly disturbing because it was internal.

197
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:47.020
It was people that were working in this department that apparently went and

198
00:12:47.021 --> 00:12:51.880
protested and they just decided that his use was egregious and he shouldn't be

199
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:53.980
able to say those sounds with his face.
