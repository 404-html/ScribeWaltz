WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.920
I tell people I might be the smartest guy in the world.

2
00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:05.610
And I figured out how to drink beer and play with cars.
Pay for it.
Yeah.

3
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:08.420
But it's like,
it's a fun show.
It's like you,

4
00:00:08.421 --> 00:00:11.610
you're not taking yourself too seriously.
You having a good time.
You know,

5
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:16.030
you're buying and sell an awesome cars.
Oh yeah.
For sure.
It's a,
it,

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.640
it was a dream of mine to get it done.
It took eight years to get it sold,

7
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:23.340
but here we are now did it really started to,

8
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.440
I started pitching the show in 2004.

9
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:30.090
We didn't start till a 2008 or 2012.
What were you doing before that?

10
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.700
Uh,
before television or before gas monkey.
Yeah.
I kind of had two stages in life.

11
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:39.300
I was a firefighter,
police officer and medic before I was old enough to drink.

12
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.180
I mean,
I'm talking 19 years old,
carrying a gun.

13
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.210
I'd probably want the smartest thing for them to let me do.
And then,
um,

14
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.310
I'll let you ever grown when you were at 19.
I had a badge.
I was a cop.
I mean,

15
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.180
literally I was a police officer and uh,
so by the time I was 20,

16
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:55.870
I just also a firefighter.
And,
uh,

17
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.140
so I did that for awhile and then moved into printing and advertising and then

18
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:02.940
sold that and got into this.

19
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.380
So was it just like something you just always into cars and that's what led you

20
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:11.850
to the show?
You know,
how would I tell the story diplomatically?

21
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.380
Um,
realistically I was watching the shows that were on TV at the time.

22
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:19.590
I'm always been a car nut and a motorcycle guy and what have you.

23
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:23.880
And I realized one night that my kids are never in the room watching it and my

24
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:27.960
wife's not in the room watching it,
you know,
and uh,
the shows that we're on,

25
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:32.040
we're a little bit too much bravado and,
and I'm a tough guy and you know,

26
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:35.070
so I dug it and all my buddies dug it,
but the wives and stuff,
and I was like,

27
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:37.380
golly,
they're missing a big chunk of the market here.

28
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.520
If you could tone down that part of it a little bit and still have a cool brand

29
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:45.870
and still be a cool guy,
you know,
and get the moms and the kids in the room.

30
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.660
Hopefully it's a lot more successful.
And so that's,

31
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.450
that was kind of where the idea came from and I just went out and started it.

32
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.830
That's interesting.
So the marketing side,
have you kicked in?

33
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.330
So the marketing side of you went,
ah,
I think there's another way to do this.

34
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.740
Yeah,
I mean I'm still a tattooed guy,
was some jewelry,
but you know,

35
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.710
I got a pit bull in poodle on a leash,
not a pit bull on a chain.

36
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.920
Well the show,
it doesn't seem compromised.

37
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.130
That's what's interesting about it cause it seems like a kind of a guy's show.

38
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:15.240
I never thought about that.
Why?

39
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.860
Well the way I approached it was just like when I was a kid and my dad had a

40
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:24.530
garage,
a not a,
you know,
not open for public garage buddy.

41
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.230
I plays that.

42
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.860
We kept his car and the neighbors would come over and they tinker and they drink

43
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:30.180
beer.
And that's what car guys do.

44
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:33.060
So we kind of took that approach of that's what gas monkey does.

45
00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:36.210
We just drink some beers and play some cars and goof around.

46
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:38.850
It's just like Saturday afternoon,
but all week long.

47
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.200
Did you have any of a background in,
in automobile knowledge?

48
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.950
Did you know like how to fix things or did you yeah,

49
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:50.880
I've never really been the full fabricator.
Uh,
you know,

50
00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:52.230
I understand everything and how it works,

51
00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:55.200
but I'm probably more of a business guy.
Uh,

52
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:57.500
so I was able to go out and hire good guys to,

53
00:02:57.501 --> 00:02:59.950
to do the fabricating stuff and we've got a great team.

54
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.520
But I did have the car knowledge and I,
and I had,

55
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.710
I had the eyeball for what was good and keeping up with what was going to be

56
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:09.370
happening and things like that.
And that's kind of my strong suit is saying,
okay,

57
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.300
<v 1>okay.</v>

58
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.060
<v 0>Porsches are predicted to be popular,
so we're gonna get into three 56 is,</v>

59
00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:17.090
or Broncos,
like the one he drove it is,
you know,
or what have you.

60
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.310
And I keep my eye on the market.
That's interesting.
So you,

61
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.010
but you still do keep your eye on the market.

62
00:03:22.011 --> 00:03:25.270
I saw that 68 that you have outside of the 68 Chevelle.
Yeah.

63
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.120
68 [inaudible] 68 convertible.
God Damn,
that's a nice car.
It's a good,

64
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.480
it's probably the best one I've ever seen.
I mean,
from an original standpoint.

65
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.650
Yeah.
It's meant,
I mean it's got little scuffs up.
It's,
it's driven,
you know,

66
00:03:36.651 --> 00:03:38.210
but it's,
it's in perfect condition.

67
00:03:38.211 --> 00:03:41.390
It doesn't have any dents or anything wrong with it is literally a little old

68
00:03:41.391 --> 00:03:42.320
lady from Pasadena.

69
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.920
I mean the lady bought it brand new and she passed away a couple of years ago

70
00:03:45.921 --> 00:03:48.740
and I bought it from her grandson.
Wow.
What a cliche.

71
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.190
52,000 original miles and uh,
never been wrecked.

72
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.020
Never Old lady from Pasadena is a cliche.
I know,
right?
He was technically Pomona,

73
00:03:57.021 --> 00:04:01.040
but you know,
same shit.
Wow.
Yeah.
That car,
those uh,

74
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.290
I mean I've said this on the show a million times.
I'm a giant fan of like the,

75
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.320
the time period of 1965 to somewhere around like 71 they fell apart.

76
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.330
Yeah,
I know.
Like you still get a 71 challenger,

77
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.740
a 71 barracuda is still pretty sweet for sure.

78
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.060
But then you get into like 72 73 they had to start putting,

79
00:04:20.061 --> 00:04:22.040
the big bumpers are there with the shots.

80
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.340
Everything just fell apart.

81
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.330
Then he got the gas crunch and then everything got four cylinders and it was,

82
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.900
it was a bad time in the late seventies for sure.
It was a bad time,

83
00:04:32.901 --> 00:04:35.600
but it's a good time now.
It's a really interesting,

84
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.300
really interesting time now for muscle cars.
It's,

85
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.830
the race is so crazy that they're putting out street legal cars.

86
00:04:42.831 --> 00:04:47.360
You could buy from a dealer with 700 plus horsepower and almost every dealer has

87
00:04:47.361 --> 00:04:50.790
one now.
Oh yeah,
for sure.
I mean,
I've got a demon myself.
That's crazy.

88
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.800
Eight horsepower.
That's fucking crazy.
And now the new gt 500 does out.

89
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.010
That's going to have over 700 horsepower.
You know,
you have the,

90
00:04:58.011 --> 00:05:02.920
the Camero l a um,
what is it?
One Ellie?

91
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.310
It's the no one.
Was it [inaudible]?
No.
What does it,

92
00:05:08.311 --> 00:05:09.930
what the fuck is the name of the,

93
00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:13.850
like the [inaudible] one zero one one Ellie,

94
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.560
which is 650 horsepower and then the new um,

95
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.980
Zr one that's 750 horsepower.
They just preposterous.
Oh,
it's,

96
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.850
it's uh,
I think it could be a little dangerous.

97
00:05:25.851 --> 00:05:27.350
You know what everybody out there thinking,
Hey,

98
00:05:27.351 --> 00:05:31.310
I can drive a 700 horsepower car because it's completely different than you
know,

99
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.400
a normal one.
Well,
did you see the video of the guy from,
uh,

100
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.830
one of the head guys at GM who took it on track?

101
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.310
Like one of the first days they were released in the car and he spun out on the

102
00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:43.910
first turn and slammed into the wall.
Well,
I can't say much.

103
00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:47.150
I wrecked a brand new hell cat the other day racing at Woodward.
Did you really?

104
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.230
Oh No.

105
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.740
I went to Woodward Dream cruise and they had a little celebrity match up and I

106
00:05:51.741 --> 00:05:56.390
was racing and just lost it and hit the wall.
Took out the whole side of the car.

107
00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.050
Were you on a track or where you on a strip?
It was a street track,
uh,

108
00:06:01.051 --> 00:06:03.080
that they had right there on Woodward Avenue.

109
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.910
So they put up the blocks and you take off.
Yikes.
Yeah.

110
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.970
Yeah.
Those,
uh,
those hell cats are beautiful,
but they're not,

111
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.200
they're not that great at corner and that's,
it's still a giant car.
Big Car.
Yeah.

112
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.460
Mustang and the Camaro going to do better in the corners for sure.
Yeah.
The,

113
00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:22.070
the hell can have so much front.
There's so much out in front.
I mean,

114
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:25.460
it really does remind you more than any of those other cars though,

115
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:30.410
of those 1970 cars,
you know,
really has that,
that shape is more,
I kinda like,

116
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:34.760
if you look at a 1969 Camaro and then you look at a 2019 Camaro,
you're like,

117
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.280
ah,
I don't see it.
That's not the same thing.

118
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.600
But the challenger really does look like that old car.
Well,
Kim,
uh,

119
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.190
Tim can ask is killed it.
I mean,

120
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.640
that was his whole passion project to the whole time he was running dodge and he

121
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:50.870
just absolutely nailed it.
Yeah,
no,
they did.
They made a great looking,

122
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:55.010
modern muscle car.
The other ones are just great looking cars.
I mean,

123
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:57.350
they are still muscle cars,
but they don't really think,

124
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.020
you don't really think about the old days when you see him.

125
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.050
Now they've tried but they didn't get it as good as dodge.

126
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.890
Now you guys make some fucking great builts too.
You know,

127
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:09.560
you guys have done some really sweet custom builds.

128
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.420
Like you were telling me outside that the longest you do a build for is 25 days.

129
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.340
Uh,
we've got it down to about 25 from 32 ish when we started.
Uh,

130
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:21.880
so when you see a car on the show,
um,

131
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.120
if it's a single episode that we built that car in 25,
26 days,

132
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.820
that's crazy.
Start to finish paint interior everything.

133
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:29.840
How do you do it so quick?

134
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:35.140
A lot of planning and we've learned over seven years now and 130 of them that,

135
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:37.100
um,
you know,

136
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.880
we've just got our process in and the crew that I have at the shop now is

137
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.760
unbelievably phenomenal and there's only six guys doing it.

138
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.930
There's six guys that do it.
25 days we're done.
That's insane.

139
00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:51.620
But what about like if you're going to do are custom suspension or you know,

140
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.160
art Morrison chassy or something like that.
It just takes some planning.

141
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.030
So literally what we do is we build the car three times.

142
00:07:58.031 --> 00:08:00.110
This is what I tell everybody will say,
okay,

143
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:02.480
we're going to build this 68 Chevelle.
Uh,

144
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.840
and so we decided how we're going to build it and what kind of parts we're going

145
00:08:04.841 --> 00:08:06.960
to use,
what kind of suspension wheels,
motor.
We,

146
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:11.150
we put all that down on paper and then if it works mathematically for the

147
00:08:11.151 --> 00:08:15.290
project we want to do,
then um,
I go find the car.

148
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.700
Then when I find the car,

149
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:21.260
we order every single part and we don't start that car until every single thing

150
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.250
that was on that list is in house has been checked and we're ready to go.

151
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.660
So now we've got his actual fabrication time and human error and we're ready to

152
00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:31.070
go.
Still.

153
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:33.980
Seems like such a short amount of time and all the builds that I've seen take

154
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:38.060
seven months,
nine months,
a year.
It's just the shops are set up differently.

155
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.580
It may be one or two guys,
or maybe they've got kind of,
you know,

156
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.690
assembly programs going on or what have you.
But we get in there like,

157
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.490
you'll love the way that we're building right now.
Uh,

158
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.660
we're building a 77 international scout and,
uh,

159
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:54.710
started with a really nice one.
Orange,
white stripes,
plaid interior.
I mean,

160
00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:59.711
the whole ball of wax whack the chassis out from under it put in a full Chris

161
00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.830
Austin Chassis works chassis with,
uh,
only two wheel drive.

162
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.080
And it's all 2018 Hellcat,

163
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.320
eight speed automatic Jesus in it and slammed on the ground,

164
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.110
but it's still removable top.
And it was a great California truck,

165
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:16.230
I would guarantee you that.
Oh,
wow.
So you made it so you lowered it.
Yeah,

166
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:20.340
we're calling it the health gap.
Ah,
wow.

167
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.500
That's pretty bad ass.
It's going to be wicked Gar.
Yeah.
Those,
uh,
hello.

168
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.400
Chassies um,
uh,
Jonathan Ward,

169
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:32.960
the same guy who's doing this is a who do,
who did my bronco,
the icon.

170
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.920
They're doing that with uh,
one of the,

171
00:09:36.921 --> 00:09:41.600
I think it's a super bird and one of the,
one of those iconic mopars Yup.

172
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.970
From the late sixties,
early seventies.

173
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.870
They're doing a full Hellcat chassis and the whole deal with that.
Oh really?

174
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.020
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
what,

175
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.140
what company was the first one to really get stupid with these cars?

176
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.260
I guess it was kind of corvette with the Zr one with horsepower.
Fig.
Yeah,

177
00:09:58.261 --> 00:09:59.310
for sure.
Corvette.

178
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.860
God stepped out there with the Zr one and started cranking it up.
Uh,

179
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.320
everybody was kind of in production.
You had,
you had the resurgence of Shelby.

180
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.370
Yeah,
there it is.
There's John [inaudible] wards.
Oh Wow.
Look at that thing.

181
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.900
That's good looking.
That is like literally like trying to have a block,

182
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.710
like a city block on wheels.
They take around a corner.

183
00:10:18.711 --> 00:10:22.100
Look how long that damn thing is.
Yeah.

184
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.890
That's going to be a fresh card for sure.
Bad Ass.

185
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.650
He does some awesome shit over there too.
He's a,

186
00:10:27.651 --> 00:10:30.260
he's doing some while he's doing one that I don't think he can talk about and I

187
00:10:30.261 --> 00:10:33.110
think he's,
he's keeping it under wraps,
but he's got a bunch of cool shit.
Yeah,

188
00:10:33.111 --> 00:10:35.900
for sure.
Easier been there.
I have not been on the street.

189
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.250
I now go visit afterwards.
We might,
I don't think I'm going to make my flight.

190
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.840
When's your flight?
I don't know.

191
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.690
I've got a couple of them aren't hold notice I said say,
Hey,

192
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.260
I've got a couple of on hold because I don't think I make enough money for a

193
00:10:48.261 --> 00:10:50.180
plane yet.
Got To talk to disco.

194
00:10:50.181 --> 00:10:53.470
And that was like a private planes that we were saying.
Yeah,
I don't,

195
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:58.500
I mean we're all scrambling for something.
Yeah.
That's the ultimate scramble.

196
00:10:58.501 --> 00:11:01.410
The private jet money.
But that,
that is just so much fucking money.
That's,

197
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.680
that seems to be is a little ridiculous.
Yeah.

198
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.340
But I'd like to have a tricked out one gas McGee on it and lit big old monkey on

199
00:11:07.341 --> 00:11:11.870
the tail gasoline with a CAG in it somewhere.
Oh yeah,

200
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:12.853
for sure.

201
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.170
Now when you do these shows and you bargain people down and then they watched

202
00:11:18.171 --> 00:11:22.860
the show to people ever get pissed.
I've had a few,
um,

203
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.980
and uh,
in the first,
uh,
first few years,
they were just excited,
you know,

204
00:11:27.981 --> 00:11:30.530
that we were going to be doing something with the car and,

205
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.280
and is it always an element of a,
of a cinnamon to it,
you know,

206
00:11:34.281 --> 00:11:38.240
it was their dads or their moms or grandmas or whatever and they want to see it

207
00:11:38.241 --> 00:11:41.870
go to a good home.
So you got several different kinds of people.

208
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.050
They are wanting you to not do anything or if you're going to fix it up,

209
00:11:45.051 --> 00:11:47.420
we want to see it,
you know,
all kinds of things like that.

210
00:11:47.421 --> 00:11:52.160
But nowadays it's a little more harder for me to get a decent deal because,

211
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.780
cause we didn't know the success of the show and I show up and they're like,
oh,

212
00:11:55.781 --> 00:12:00.430
you're that guy on TV.
No,
I didn't say 10,000 and I said 13,
you know.
Ah,

213
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.260
yeah,
yeah.
Well,

214
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:05.440
I would imagine when people see what you sell them for after you fix him up,

215
00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:08.230
then they get a little upset.
Yeah,
they can.

216
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.960
But I mean they don't understand the amount of work and time and money that

217
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:13.960
we've put into it.
Most of the cars that we're building on the show now,

218
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:18.220
we're putting it a least a hundred grand in and sometimes as much as 300.
Really,

219
00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:21.310
you know,
I mean we're building everything we're building now.

220
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.520
This is when the new season comes out in June.
Uh,

221
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:28.090
people going to be amazed cause you know,
we're building this kind of stuff.
Wow.

222
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.470
And,
uh,
it's wicked cool.
And you're doing that in 25 days.
Yeah.
Fuck man.

223
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:35.040
Just put together a good plan and execute it well.

224
00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:39.430
Must be like a thing now because the show that people want to get a gas monkey

225
00:12:39.431 --> 00:12:42.580
bill car.
They do.
But,
um,

226
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.350
how would I say this diplomatically?
If it weren't for employees,

227
00:12:47.351 --> 00:12:51.940
vendors and customers,
business would be great.
So we,
we,
uh,

228
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:56.830
we don't do a lot for the,
the customer,
uh,
until we've built it for ourselves.

229
00:12:56.831 --> 00:12:59.980
And then we sell it to them.
But as far as coming in off the street,

230
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.800
we just like building what we want to build,

231
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.020
hone in our skills and then we find a buyer.

232
00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.530
Every once in awhile I'll have god come in and go,
look,
I can,

233
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.620
this is what I want,
but I can,
I won't call you.

234
00:13:11.621 --> 00:13:15.610
I won't come in there with a new steering wheel.
All you know it's like it gets,

235
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.580
that's why a lot of times cars do take seven months or a year or cause the guy

236
00:13:20.581 --> 00:13:23.800
that's having its built is in there every other weekend going out.
I don't know,

237
00:13:23.801 --> 00:13:28.600
maybe we move this over here and painted purple.
Oh yeah,
I get it.

238
00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.970
Yeah,
no,
it does seem like it would be way better.

239
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.450
Just build it how you like it and then sell it.
Well,
yeah,

240
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.740
I mean it's still a business decision.

241
00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:38.840
I'm trying to build it to where I think it's going to do the most,
you know,

242
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.280
the most money at the end of the day and stay true with a,

243
00:13:42.281 --> 00:13:45.970
what's going on as far as that particular car and what's going on in the

244
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:49.240
marketplace and technology and what have you.
Um,

245
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.730
and we do get a lot of calls where people come in and go,
okay,

246
00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:55.750
I want that exact same thing,
you know,
and so we'll build another one.
Well,

247
00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:56.540
sometimes you,

248
00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:01.480
you do buy cars and then just sell them without doing anything to it,
right?
Yeah.

249
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.230
That's what we call our bs stories.
You know,
we'll buy something and bring it in,

250
00:14:05.231 --> 00:14:08.170
maybe just put some wheels on it or whatever.
But usually it's just clean it up,

251
00:14:08.171 --> 00:14:09.940
get it running and sell somebody else the dream,

252
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:13.850
because not everybody can afford a fully built car and,

253
00:14:13.851 --> 00:14:16.780
or they want to do it themselves.
So we get them a good project.

254
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.680
I don't think people realize how much money is involved in a fully built car.

255
00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:21.730
Ticketless yeah.
