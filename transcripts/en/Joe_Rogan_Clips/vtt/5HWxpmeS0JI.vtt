1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.410
So were undeniable.
They were,

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.830
they were experiencing like very vividly the same things.

3
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.640
And the government's obviously obsessed with this and isn't worried about,

4
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:12.150
but here's the problem.
Here's the problem that that term,
the government,

5
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.490
are you talking about the post office?
No,
I'm not talking like police officers.

6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.471
Are you talking about the fire?

7
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:20.670
The Fire Department ruling Techno Tronic who are these people?

8
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:23.940
But I think the government is a shitty term.
I know who they are.
Okay,
but that,

9
00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:26.580
that term,
the problem with that term is it lumps you into like,

10
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.600
you know that Mel Gibson movie conspiracy theory was a wacky dude was driving a

11
00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:34.950
cab,
have believed in fucking tin foil hat type shows.
He'd been tortured.
Yes,

12
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.490
exactly.
You've been departmentalized.
Yes.
But,
but that kind of stuff,

13
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:41.430
when you say the government is doing it,
like who is doing this?

14
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.050
Who's working on these experience?
We don't have to say names.
No,
no.

15
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.270
Like is it the,
obviously maybe you want to say the gutter.
No,
I'll tell you.

16
00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:51.750
It's a broad brush.
You,
you're right.

17
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:54.840
It's dumb to say the government and the big question is who runs things?

18
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.880
That's a smart question.
That's the thing is they,

19
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.280
when everybody says they don't want you to know,

20
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.610
do you remember that fucking guy who is ripping people off like weight loss

21
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:05.340
secrets that they don't want you to know Kevin to Trudeau and they put them in

22
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:06.174
jail for that.

23
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.090
He's in jail right now cause he won't give up the money cause he's got a pile of

24
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:11.240
cash somewhere and he said he would do that.
They was the,

25
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.070
I think they said they would give them time off is a con man.

26
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:15.000
I've met him a few times,

27
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.300
very manipulative but I think he has a right to Shay healthcare cures or natural

28
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:23.260
periods.
I don't want you to know about,
there are some,
there are some,

29
00:01:23.261 --> 00:01:25.140
but the point is they don't.
Look,
I,

30
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.020
I have some love in my heart for Kevin Trudeau because he started the

31
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.770
international pool tour.
It was a,

32
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.870
he was putting a lot of money into professional.
Cool.
Here's the deal.

33
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.970
The oxycontin company,
the documents came out.
Shit.

34
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:39.210
We're going to totally addict people and then we're going to sell him drugs to

35
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:41.190
get off of it.
Yes.
That's pure fricking either.

36
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:43.830
So lock your ass up and then we'll get to Kevin Trudeau lighter.

37
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.500
I agree with you.
And I'm not even defending catheter though,

38
00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:46.690
cause I met with evergreen for your time.

39
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.550
I know all about him and it was like he was 100% about him and a one way free of

40
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:51.180
straight.

41
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.570
Well I didn't get that experience with him with me and him just talked about

42
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:58.620
pool.
I was doing some stuff with him when he was first starting the pool tour.

43
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:02.100
I came to a couple of his events,
but he,
that day,

44
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.720
this thing is like,

45
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:06.480
you always have a good way of asking questions instead of saying who runs it.

46
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:09.530
All right.
You wait till I do the cliche the government and then you correct me.

47
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.010
What I'm doing is playing devil's advocate and I'm also looking at it from the

48
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.860
perspective of hours.
They're still,
Eddie's come,

49
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.550
let's do another hour and get out of here.
Okay.

50
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.910
Let's let Johnny will become a two.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
not yet.

51
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.610
Do you want him to come at two instead of one 30?
Whenever you want.

52
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.240
I'm gonna text him.
Right.
Anyways,
let me,
let me try to be clear.
Joe,

53
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.560
I'm having a good time with you.
I just want you to know we've tried to be clear.

54
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.510
I can't say all of this on here.
Okay.
Okay.
And I'm going to leave it at that.

55
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.690
But um,

56
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.350
I'm on record 20 years ago before anybody else was talking about the clockwork

57
00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:43.440
elves and other global listening to her in touch with these entities and things.

58
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.700
Only because,
and I don't want to get,
I'm not in the CIA.

59
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.360
The CIA's bigger than Coca Cola.
It's like bigger than Walmart.

60
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.820
I'd never been an intelligence agency.

61
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.620
I've ever been a part of any of this stuff.

62
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.850
But I had family that was advanced Darpa research projects that I don't know all

63
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:07.300
the details about.
And,
um,
when I was a kid,

64
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:09.880
my dad told me about some of it not knowing how to be a talk show host layer,

65
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.460
but like when the deputy director of the CIA,

66
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:16.100
he did have a tooth pulled to cater to my dad.
Okay.
Show.

67
00:03:16.101 --> 00:03:18.040
Then I was like the doctor to,
you know,
these guys.

68
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:20.330
And I remember sitting around the kitchen table and I'm like seventies,

69
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.170
like Carol,
I can't tell you all about it,

70
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:27.580
but it's a classified program in Maryland and an underground base.
And uh,

71
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.170
they won't give me all the details,
but it's double.

72
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:31.450
The money I'm making now is international security.
But I think,

73
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:33.640
I think it's basically,
you know,
we're going to,

74
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.450
we're building cyborgs and we've got special forces that have volunteered if we

75
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:40.570
could infiltrate the Russians and get to codes and systems in,

76
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:43.570
I believe it's in planting,
but messages in their teeth.
And I,

77
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:45.670
and I also think it's,
I do implants,

78
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:49.850
I think it's a brain surgery program for microchips.
And so I'm hearing,
am I,

79
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.681
Carol's like,
David,

80
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:54.340
I'm sick of these people and you've already done so much for the government.

81
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.040
And look what they've already done to you and a met my,
my brother,

82
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.060
you're not going to be,
you know,
I want you out of this.
So this is like,
you know,

83
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:02.510
seven,
eight years old.
You're not hearing about the,

84
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.370
you're hearing about the cyborgs.
Okay.
Okay.
So,

85
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.060
so that's the kind of stuff that I grew up seeing and you know,

86
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:13.180
Oh let's go get your uncle.
He's come off of [inaudible],
you know,

87
00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:16.480
Army Day in an army uniform from Guatemala.
You know,

88
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:19.950
there's like armed guys with machine guns.
I mean,
I don't know.
Okay.
And I,

89
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.610
and I don't need to know.
Okay.
The point is,
is that's what I grew up,
you know,

90
00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:29.611
the type of stuff I saw and my dad never told me about all this stuff when I was

91
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:34.300
older till it was like 12 years ago and I was finishing in game blueprint for

92
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:35.134
global and enslavement.

93
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.440
That's free still online and it's all about the world government and now the

94
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:40.630
cell phones watching you and everything's,
everything's proven in it.

95
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.190
It didn't come true.
It was already true.

96
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.640
And the plan for one world government and don't have kids and all that and

97
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.010
attack on the family and we were going to go to a ballet recital for like my

98
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.850
three year old daughter.

99
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:56.650
She's like 14 now or whatever and they sit out for like an hour and watch the

100
00:04:56.651 --> 00:05:01.480
end of the film three our film and my mom goes,
tape it.
That's not true.

101
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.520
He goes,
yes,
it's all true.
When I was in junior in high school,

102
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:09.640
they recruited me into the program there and they brought us in and they said

103
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:11.660
the Nazis were wrong because they were only targeting certain groups.

104
00:05:11.661 --> 00:05:14.380
We're going to talk to everybody and it's a planetary breakaway and world

105
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.970
government and blah,
blah,
blah.

106
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.250
There's a nuclear reactor under ut and all this other stuff,

107
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.230
which later when research is actually true,
it's not even hidden,

108
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.390
but the point is,
it's not that my dad was even that special.
They get,

109
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.610
my dad was like

110
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.030
score like the six smartest in Texas and they got a group of less than 10 kids

111
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:34.180
and they brought him in as juniors in high school and shed.

112
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.110
We're going to do all this.
Like they recruited them cause I wanted to be a NASA.

113
00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:40.210
That's why we're in the natural shirt.
So when it gets in here,

114
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.880
cause because Eddie's right,
NASA is a big secret group.

115
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.470
It's the other side of the breakaway government.

116
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.060
There's the CIA breakaway government in 1947 and there's Kennedy setting up NASA

117
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:53.230
in 1961 so they're two different competing breakaway governments.

118
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:54.990
And those are the real governments in the U S..
