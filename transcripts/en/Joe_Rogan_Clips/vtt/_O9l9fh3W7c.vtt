00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.390
Well,
Jamie was talking about something yesterday and I started listening to this

2
00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:08.391
recent Sam Harris' podcast and it is fucking fascinating how much Russian troll

3
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:14.310
farms and all these fake accounts and what they're trying to do.

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.640
And one of the things they're trying to do is what Jamie was saying was that

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.180
that kid with the Maggot hat or the native American beat the drum in front of

6
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:21.780
them.

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.160
The image of that was posted by this website that turned out to be a Russian

8
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:27.930
troll farm,
but it was in Brazil.

9
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.150
Was it June as a blogger in Brazil when they'd CNN looked into it.

10
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.460
They just kinda asked Twitter what's going on with this account.

11
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.240
And by the time they'd asked them,
they just suspended the council.
It's gone.
But,

12
00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:42.850
but you said they suspended account because the account was a fake account yet

13
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.860
they had a,
they thought it was posing as like a California teacher.

14
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.500
Her name is Talia,
but it was,

15
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.390
it was an actual blogger in Brazil.
Oh,
so it was Brazil wasn't rushing?

16
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.270
No,
I,
I wasn't sure.
No,
I just was,

17
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.870
I was saying like it was sewn into a fake account if someone's,
but yes,

18
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:04.680
they sow seeds of,
yeah,
well they're trying to get people against each other.

19
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.210
They're doing that in a minute.

20
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:09.310
Like people need to understand that this is actually really happening and there

21
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.240
we need their help.
Hurley will,
we turned against each other day.

22
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.820
We need the Russians help.
Well,
if you stop and think about it,

23
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:16.860
has there ever been a time with the left and the right were more,

24
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:18.430
it chose throats and right and ends enough.

25
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.410
You don't need to rush it was Arabic but,

26
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.040
but our CNN enough to really get people turned against each other like this.

27
00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:30.360
No fucking way.
You need angry discourse online and the way that comes from,

28
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.433
there's,

29
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.300
there's an amazing Radiolab podcast about this where they talked to people that

30
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:40.050
actually worked in these troll farms and that these people were,

31
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.470
they would both be left wing and right wing and this is one of the things that

32
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:46.710
they're talking about on the Sam Harris' podcast.
It's,

33
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:48.630
I think it's called a war of information,

34
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.100
but they'll pose as like a pro choice people and say ridiculous shifts like over

35
00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:57.660
the top.
Ridiculous.

36
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.310
And then they'll pose is pro life American flag.
And you know,

37
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.540
Magda in the,
in the,
you know,
the Hashtag man they're,
they're heading,

38
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.830
but they have nothing to do with that.

39
00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:11.700
They're just Russians and they're just trying to get people riled up and you see

40
00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:15.630
people jump on board and of course chime in.
But,
um,

41
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.770
I was talking to a comic that we were talking about that I won't bring his name

42
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:23.430
up,
but he referred me to this,
this Russian guy.

43
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.980
I can't,
I'm not going remember his name,

44
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:30.210
but this is a clip of this Russian guy who worked for the KGB defected over
here.

45
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.920
And he was explaining how Russia does that.
Yeah.
And this was back in the 80s.
Oh,

46
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:38.790
well we do it too.
Everybody does it.
They all do it.
Everybody does it.

47
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.850
They fuck with the system in any way,

48
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:44.730
shape or form in order to achieve a desired result.

49
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.400
I think the Russians are the best at it apparently.
Well,

50
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.950
I just think they're way more dedicated to it.
And then,

51
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.250
I mean it's a sneaky way to go about doing things too because Russia doesn't

52
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:57.690
have the,
the kind of money that the United States,

53
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.650
so they get nothing.
They have their economies the size of Texas.
Yeah.

54
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.700
All's I have is nuclear weapons there almost like a third world and a brutal

55
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:08.920
dictator,
a dictator.
That's all it takes.

56
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:12.720
But as a far as the economy and everything,
they were like a third world she had.

57
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.100
It's,
well they're like a small European country.

58
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.800
But it's really interesting when you,

59
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.560
you listen to these podcasts about how much effort they put into sewing

60
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:24.010
discourse or discord to getting people upset with each other,

61
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.120
to starting arguments and to saying things that are going to upset people in

62
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:31.430
order to get the right versus the left to like sure.

63
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.110
To undermine democracy from the inside.
Yeah.
It's really interesting.

64
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.910
I mean it's,
it's weird that it works,
but it makes sense that it works.

65
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.900
It's a sneaky ass strategy.
Yeah.

66
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.380
You think CNN does just as good a job.
They really do harm.
But you're so,

67
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.040
you're so right wing,
you can't,
I'm not so right when John,

68
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.760
how right wing far right.
Meetup.
Middle,
right.
I'd say center,
right.

69
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:01.060
Of Center.
Right.
Of Center.
Right.
Of Center,
yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
