1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.930
I'm a big proponent of meditation and mindfulness and just trying to,

2
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.050
and it's sad.
That's all those are toxic words right now.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.980
Meditation and mindfulness.
Yeah.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.220
I've been thrown around by too many knuckleheads.

5
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.680
Like there's something about it that it's like,
oh,

6
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:16.890
that's kind of a bull shitty word.
You kind of,
you know what I mean?
You're like,

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.820
oh,
I'm just all about mindfulness.
Like,
oh,
you're annoying.
That's what you are,

8
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.200
dude.
You're the annoying guy.

9
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.710
<v 1>I,
I,
I saw a book just yesterday and one of these like boutique stores,</v>

10
00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:28.330
someone had made it star cast at kids,

11
00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:33.130
but called the grownups guide to mindfulness and whoever wrote that fucking book

12
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.770
hates the word mindful.
Hey,

13
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.060
this is definitely has an obnoxious friend who's into mindfulness because of the

14
00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:42.120
book is just like a,
first of all,
they,

15
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.370
the guy doesn't seem to really understand what it is in the book.
Like it's a,

16
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.520
he seems a little confused about the nature of it,
but,
uh,

17
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.130
and I remember looking at that and be like,
oh,

18
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.220
I guess people are getting annoyed with the word mindfulness now.

19
00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:57.160
Like the pendulum swinging that way.
Yeah,

20
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.471
<v 0>yeah.</v>

21
00:00:57.471 --> 00:01:02.471
It's one of those words that people love to say it sounds good and it makes you

22
00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:05.870
seem like a,
like a spiritual person.
So again,

23
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.950
when work gets moved around and used too much,

24
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.980
like something happens to it where it gets icky.
Yeah.

25
00:01:12.981 --> 00:01:16.700
Cause it's like it becomes popular and then people start using it and then you

26
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:20.240
see like a bunch of phony guru type dudes at seminars using it.

27
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.050
What's important here is mindfulness.
Very important that,
you know,

28
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:28.940
there's like typically unique behaviors.
You know what I mean?
There's,

29
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.180
there's,
there's,
especially when it comes to like,
people are full of Shit.

30
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.880
I was like a typical uniqueness.

31
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.620
Like there's a just a thing that a lot of people adopt and it sounds like

32
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:44.570
everyone else and it's just a way that people get wet.
And uh,
I,

33
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.760
I hope you understand like what are you doing?
Why are you doing that?
You,

34
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.100
you're adopting this weird,
funky thing.
And you know,

35
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:55.820
I think it's really important that we practice mindfulness.
It falls into that.

36
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.150
It falls into that even though it's an excellent practice.
Well,

37
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:00.010
it's very important,

38
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.530
<v 1>but people,
you know,
it's called an,
um,
I just,</v>

39
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.500
and now I took on,
for lack of better word,

40
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.560
I'm working with a actual teacher of the you lineage of Buddhism,

41
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:17.850
which is like choke him,
is lineage of Buddhism and he's amazing and he's,

42
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.650
and he's teaching me mindfulness meditation practice,
this Guy David Nichtern.

43
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.170
But um,
how does he deal with masturbation?

44
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.930
What's cool about him is if you asked him,
he'd,
he would tell you.
I'm sure he,

45
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.940
there's no like,
yeah.
With,
you know,
that he wouldn't be like,
well,

46
00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:35.860
how dare you ask me that question.

47
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.510
But I think that probably I don't,
I can't answer for him.

48
00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:43.390
I think of a phone line with what you're saying with balance,
you know,

49
00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:47.830
which is that,
it's really like,
uh,
sort of the,
the,

50
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.840
the concept with it is the thing that is happening right now,

51
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.530
whatever it may be,
you can just,
you know,

52
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.500
apply mindfulness.
It,

53
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:04.150
you could apply like a being in the moment and being with the thing that's

54
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:08.200
happening right now.
And so the,
the thing that he's teaching me,

55
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:11.020
I love it so much dude.
Because it isn't,

56
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.220
we will we or like out there crazy.

57
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.430
It's literally this very simple way that you meditate,

58
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.910
the way that you sit,
which is you sit on a cushion,

59
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.430
you put your hands on your knees in and you sit back and that he,

60
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:34.450
the word they use in this Cargill,
in each Ford is the warrior pose.

61
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.630
And what that means is that it's a kind of confidence.

62
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:40.870
It's the way like people who are like confident sit.

63
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.180
So you sit like that when you're meditating,

64
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:46.720
you're legs across and you sit in a chair if you want and you look straight

65
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:50.740
ahead about eight feet,
nine feet,

66
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.920
and you watch your breath and when you're going to your thoughts,

67
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.040
which happens of course you go,

68
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.020
you think thinking and then you go back to your breath.
That's it.

69
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.920
You say thinking,
you don't say it,
you think it.
Thank.
Thank you.

70
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.850
Thinking just so cause what,
what's all these,
so like what,

71
00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:15.851
what you start realizing when you start this practice and full disclosure here,

72
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:17.950
man,
you know me Joe,

73
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.950
I have problems with discipline and I have problems with like sticking to stuff

74
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:24.670
over and over again and working with this guy has been incredible because it's

75
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:29.500
actually getting me to,
to do it right?
Uh,
but still I have like,

76
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.840
I did it today,
didn't do it yesterday.
I'm just,

77
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:36.400
I don't want to get out there and some nonsense that I'm like spending all day

78
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.234
long meditation.

79
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.850
But what you start seeing is when you're doing it is you realize like,

80
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.480
oh,
there's a cycle happening in my consciousness.
In my mind.

81
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.250
There's a cycle that's happening in my life,

82
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.110
which is that I kind of blink into the moment following the breath and I blink

83
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:55.900
out of the moment into the thought realm,
right?

84
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.760
We're like little fireflies wee flicker into the moment where here now we're

85
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:02.350
here.
We're not lost in our thoughts.

86
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.750
We're not thinking about the next thing we're going to say.

87
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.430
We're not thinking about the next thing we're going to do.

88
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:11.150
We're just here in this moment and then we're off,
you know,
often running,

89
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.220
like thinking about the bills,
figured about the girl,
thinking about the thing.

90
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.890
They get about that.
And then that leads to another thought and another thought.

91
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.190
Next thing you know you've been thinking for three years straight,

92
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.770
you know what I mean?
Or three minutes or five hours or whatever,

93
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.690
and then you come back and that's the cycle.
This is a cycle that happens.

94
00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:36.691
So mindfulness is starting to pay attention and,

95
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.560
and,
and,
and to that cycle.
And,

96
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.650
and the breathing thing is kind of like a respiratory mnemonic device,

97
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.550
which is that suddenly what's been happening to me now is I'll just be like

98
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.790
walking down the street and then notice my breath.

99
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.050
Oh Shit,
I'm back.
Oh,
I'm

100
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.460
<v 0>here.
I was totally over in my head.
Oh,
I'm back.
That was thinking,
you know,</v>

101
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.180
that's all.
It's very,
very,
very simple.

102
00:06:06.181 --> 00:06:08.370
But he's just teaching me the basic shit right now.
It does.

103
00:06:08.371 --> 00:06:12.730
I think it pretty interesting on my own thinking about my own life and observing

104
00:06:12.731 --> 00:06:16.360
other people's lives.
I've come up with this thing that I bring up all the time.

105
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.360
The momentum of your past,
like your,

106
00:06:19.361 --> 00:06:23.170
your like so many people as they're going down the street.

107
00:06:23.171 --> 00:06:25.090
So many people as they're interacting with people,

108
00:06:25.091 --> 00:06:29.530
they're carrying the momentum of all the fucked up things that are going on,

109
00:06:29.531 --> 00:06:34.531
bills that they have to pay and things that they forgot to do and a career they

110
00:06:34.721 --> 00:06:37.210
never chase.
And a girl they never called back.

111
00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:41.050
And the thing that they lied about and the thing they stall and the reason why

112
00:06:41.051 --> 00:06:42.100
they got fired from work.

113
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.030
And maybe if I call my boss and all this craziness you're bringing with you into

114
00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:49.060
everything that is so hard to escape.

115
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.750
It's so hard for people to escape the momentum of the past.
You know,

116
00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:54.550
people sort of a,

117
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.230
they get into this thing of defining themselves by failures,
by past failures.

118
00:06:59.231 --> 00:07:02.650
And it never just learning from them go,
oh,
I'm that fucking loser.
You know,

119
00:07:02.651 --> 00:07:03.670
it's a real problem.

120
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.390
It's a real problem with people to be able to learn from something and to just

121
00:07:07.391 --> 00:07:09.910
look at yourself.
And it's painful to look at yourself.

122
00:07:09.911 --> 00:07:13.420
So everybody wants to pretend that they didn't do anything wrong right there.

123
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.700
Everybody else is an asshole and that,
yeah,
and so you,

124
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.250
when you're doing what you're doing by doing that is you're stunting your own

125
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:24.370
growth.
You feel like you're protecting yourself because you protecting your ego.

126
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.060
You're like,
you know,
I didn't do anything wrong.
Fuck him.
He is the asshole.

127
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.510
But you know,
you could've avoided that.
You know,
you could've done better.

128
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.390
Like everybody has moments like that and their life.

129
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.990
The more you avoid those and don't take credit for the ones that you actually

130
00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:38.824
fucked up,

131
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.270
the more you actually hurt yourself in this ironic thing because it seems like

132
00:07:43.271 --> 00:07:46.930
you're protecting yourself.
Know your ECOMM exonerating myself from guilt this,

133
00:07:46.931 --> 00:07:51.670
fuck it.
It wasn't me.
I wouldn't do it.
But you know,
you did.
So in your head,

134
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:56.170
you're the guy who lies about making mistakes instead of you're the guy who mans

135
00:07:56.171 --> 00:08:00.520
up to your mistakes and realizes it was a mistake.
And then vows to do better.

136
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.010
Yeah,
man,
that's beautiful.
That's beautiful.

137
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.680
You have to just have to be able to say you're wrong.
You have to be able to say,

138
00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:07.870
I'm sorry.
Yeah,
you have to be able to,

139
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.230
and you gotta be able to look at yourself like all the time,

140
00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:14.420
not even just when you fuck up because you can avoid some of those fuck ups.

141
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.900
Just look at yourself critically along the way.

142
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:22.050
But we all have to understand that are we are all in evolving process.

143
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.430
Like I had this conversation with Dennis Mckenna.

144
00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:27.250
It's a crazy conversation because it's a ridiculous thing to say.

145
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.520
And he was talking about Donald Trump and I was saying d isn't it possible that

146
00:08:33.371 --> 00:08:36.760
he could grow and learn?
Like why do we give up on people?

147
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.860
Why does a guy get to a certain age?
And we say,
oh,
he's 60 he set in his ways.

148
00:08:41.861 --> 00:08:44.170
He's 70 he'll never change.
He'll never evolve.

149
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.420
You don't ever say that about a 20 year old.

150
00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:48.190
You see some asshole who's a 20 year old.

151
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.790
He say he just needs discipline and just needs love,

152
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.860
finds the right PR people in his life,
right person until to love.
He'll be okay.

153
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.560
He's going to mature and eventually it's going to be a solid man.

154
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.610
But you get to a certain age we just give up on you.
Yeah.
We just like,

155
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.730
you're still alive,

156
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:07.731
but you've passed the cycle that I usually enjoy people to be ready to like sort

157
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:12.660
of interact as valuable,
creative,
loving members of society and pass that by.

158
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.040
You're still thinking about yourself.

159
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:16.770
Only deepen your sixties this is stupid shit.

160
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.330
This is shit he's supposed to do when you're 17 by the time you're 70 you're

161
00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:24.560
supposed to be going,
oh my God,
I don't have much time left.
Oh my God.

162
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.960
What have I done while I've here?
What do,
what is important?

163
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:29.340
What do I feel the best about?

164
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:33.990
I feel the best about love and companionship and friendship and real warmth and

165
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:38.220
interaction between people that you care about.
This money thing,
man,
this is not,

166
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.420
it can't keep chasing this.
Can't keep chasing power.
Can't keep chasing money.

167
00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:42.930
It's,

168
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.860
you're gunna reach a point where it's not going to matter because you're going

169
00:09:45.861 --> 00:09:48.930
to die.
So you really want to be that guy from the bumper sticker.

170
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:52.380
He who dies with the most toys wins because this is literally what you're

171
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:54.600
working towards.
You're working towards a joke.
