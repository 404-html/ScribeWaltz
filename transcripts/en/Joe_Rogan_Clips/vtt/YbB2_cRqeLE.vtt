1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:00.790
Yeah,

2
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.790
it's worth more for other fights because the whole card was so amazing.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.750
It's going to get more people to what is your favorite card?

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.420
Favorite moment of the night.
Was it Derek Lewis?
Derrick Lewis,
Tony,

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.880
Derrick Lewis.
Derrick Lewis winning by knockout.
Yeah,

6
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.060
and and in a fight where he said that thing about Derrick Lewis is he can always

7
00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:25.980
just land one punch and we had just got done saying that like 10 seconds before

8
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:29.640
he lands his fucking Howitzer on the top of that dude's head.

9
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:30.870
And then the post fight interview,

10
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:35.040
we say it takes his shorts off and I'm standing here,
what are you doing man?

11
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.480
It was my balls was hot.
I'm like,
oh my God.
But me,

12
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.910
I always knew Derek is hilarious.
He's always hilarious.

13
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.540
So I always look forward to talking to him.
But his Instagram,

14
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.310
if you want to know what Derrick Lewis is about,

15
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:50.280
you've got to see his Instagram and I brought that up and now he's got like,

16
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.420
he's got a million more than a million.
What does he at now?

17
00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:56.570
500 some thousand and just a couple of days after that.

18
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.910
That's so awesome.
But it's true.
It's fucking,

19
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.810
Instagram's all motorcycle accidents do the jumping off roofs and landed on

20
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:07.110
their heads,
but it's a false fucked up Instagram of all time.

21
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.810
But he's just a funny dude,
man.

22
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:14.811
He's really funny and him and Daniel Cormier like them promoting a fight is

23
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:20.320
going to be a breath of fresh air because like did you see the thing where you

24
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.150
know like Dan,
he was joking around.
He said,
he say he's going to knock me out.

25
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:25.490
He's like,
yeah man,
he was disrespecting Popeye's.

26
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.190
Let's play this cause it's so funny.

27
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.870
Eric Lewis told me that he was going to knock me out right before we walked.

28
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.440
<v 1>Hi
there.
What's your issue with Daniel?</v>

29
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.890
I want to know too

30
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.710
<v 0>this suspect that Popeye's chicken on it</v>

31
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.510
<v 1>together.
This is a bad version of it,
but</v>

32
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.270
<v 0>this is all music and stupid editing,</v>

33
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.510
but he's just a funny guy,
man.

34
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.890
He's just a funny guy and he's look,
I mean,

35
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:04.110
and he joked around about it with DC.
He's like,

36
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:06.550
she at 1.3 million followers now that it's hilarious.

37
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.550
You just gained a million followers because I've been following him for years

38
00:02:09.551 --> 00:02:13.240
now.
Yeah,
I think he gained a million followers and he,
you know,

39
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.570
they were talking about it and he,
and,
and he said to Daniel,
you know,

40
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.760
Dennis said,
he goes,
you want it,
you don't really want to hit me.
And he goes,

41
00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:21.370
motherfucker,
fuck off.
Fight anybody for money.

42
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.901
It's just classic.

43
00:02:25.901 --> 00:02:30.520
It's just a funny guy and there won't be any of that do opening nonsense,

44
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.560
but it'll still sell a lot because it's fun.
So a lot of Popeye's too,

45
00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:38.020
it's going to sell on everything and it's going to sell a lot of everything,

46
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.690
but it'll definitely sell a lot of paper views.
The real question is,

47
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.530
is it going to be able to deal with Cormier's wrestling coronaries experiment.

48
00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:49.480
This is the level of fighting that Columbia is experience is just significantly

49
00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:54.040
higher.
But Derrick Lewis has unbelievable power.

50
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.950
I mean his power,
his fucking no joke man.

51
00:02:56.951 --> 00:03:01.390
If you look at some of his Kao victories,
he's a puncher.
Brutal.
He is.

52
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:04.060
But I think if he and I,
I'm a big Derrick Lewis Fan,

53
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:08.710
but I think if he fights DC like he fought Volkov it's going to be a tough night

54
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:10.570
for him.
Um,
I know that,

55
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.700
I know that it could go anyway and that one shot from Derrick Lewis can put DC

56
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.180
out or anyone in the world out.

57
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.880
But I just see dcs wrestling has is dirty boxing.
I mean everything.
If,

58
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:25.600
if you,
if,
if Derrick Lewis is turning his back to DC,

59
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:28.030
like he wasn't Volkov and he's going to close the distance,

60
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:29.680
he's going to take his back,
he's going to exploit that.

61
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.550
He's going to take them down.
Sure.
There's a difference between six foot seven,

62
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.790
five foot 10 though it's true is a giant difference in size between Volkov and

63
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.281
DC.

64
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:43.540
DC's a real light heavyweight who in my opinion could fight and Raphael's weight

65
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:46.210
class.
I mean I think DC really got his diet in order.

66
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:48.730
He can be a one of the fiber.
It's true,
but it can flip over.

67
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:52.480
Josh Barnett over his head,
all sorts of guys.
There's something about that,

68
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.850
that round body type though.
I mean there really is like a barrel,
the,
you know,

69
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.420
the ability to kind of be ungrabbable you know,
and uh,

70
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.320
of course he has the power and he has the wrestling.
So I mean,
he,

71
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.240
he's like a version of feed or you know,
very similar,
very similar.

72
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:14.440
Seen him knock out Steve Bay with one shot.
Like that was stunning.
It's like wow.

73
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.150
And he was saying that he was doing that and training,

74
00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:17.950
he said he hits way harder as a heavyweight.

75
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.970
I think just the way he likes to live his life and how he likes to eat.

76
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.690
He just has more energy as a heavyweight,
you know,

77
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.010
he might be a better down through a whole life of cutting weight.
I mean,

78
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.560
the entire life of it.
And uh,

79
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.780
how to withdraw from the Olympics because if kidney failure from weight cutting

80
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.340
his life should be a movie for sure.
I mean,
the way the stuff that he's overcome,

81
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.840
the stuff that has happened to them,

82
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.780
the missed opportunities and wrestling and not miss opportunities.

83
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:47.530
He was one of the,
I mean,
he's so great.
Yeah.
But not being the champion.

84
00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:48.610
That being the world champion up,

85
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:52.390
being the Olympic champion and then coming to in the life stuff that he's gone

86
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:53.330
through.
Um,

87
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.560
I'm just happy that people like him now cause you remember he was getting booed

88
00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:59.800
for so long.
She was ridiculous.
Every time he got booed,
like broke my heart.

89
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.120
It took a while for people to understand him.
And now I think that people,

90
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:04.660
you know,

91
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.920
after people seeing him choke out rumble Johnson and then seeing him knock out

92
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:13.870
Steve pay people like,
oh he's a bad motherfucker and he's a really nice guy.

93
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:16.900
He's a great dude.
One of the best commentators now.
He's hilarious.
Yeah.

94
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.930
That's also what,
what made him grow on people as well.

95
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:23.650
Like you hear him and commentary and you realize like he's not an EGOMANIAC.

96
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:26.560
He's a really good guy who knows a lot about fighting,

97
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:30.400
knows a lot about wrestling.
And I'm a man.

98
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:33.580
I'm so looking forward to John Jones coming back to John John's fighting

99
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.180
Gustafson.
That is very fascinating.
Is that going to a,

100
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.380
I know they're going to strip DC.
So is that,
does that fight for a title or,
yeah,

101
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:44.620
I guess interim are the real deal.
I think that's the real deal deal,

102
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.500
which is weird,
right?
Yeah.

103
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.500
Like why let the guy be champ champ if you're not going to let them.
I mean,

104
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.030
I dunno.
It's like,
I dunno.

105
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.730
I mean I'm a time I'm so torn on all this waste.

106
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.450
Probably going fight the winner anyways and then it will be for the belt.

107
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:02.840
So maybe let them keep the belt.
I mean look,
I love the UFC.

108
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.940
Obviously I've been working for the UFC forever,

109
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:09.941
but I think there is an obvious conflict of interest when the promoter is also

110
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:15.500
responsible for who holds titles and who gets to fight for titles.

111
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.870
It's weird,
you know,

112
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:22.871
I mean in every other sport there's like a sanctioning body that decides this

113
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:26.450
is,
you know,
Rafael Lovato one five fights in a row.

114
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:31.010
He's the undisputed number one contender.
He will be next in line for the title,

115
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.090
you know,
not,
oh Logan.
Paul's sold 5 million.

116
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:39.560
Youtube buys seeds next.
You know what I mean?
It's like,
it's weird,

117
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.460
like it's,
it's weird that commerce,
I mean,

118
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.550
it plays a giant part in any sport,
right?

119
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.090
But should it be the ultimate decider in what,

120
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.860
what happens and what doesn't happen.
