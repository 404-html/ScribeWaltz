Hello Freak bitches.
I grew up also as a surfer,
you know,

2
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.490
it was grown up to growing up surfing.

3
00:00:06.491 --> 00:00:09.940
And so there's definitely a pecking order and a respect there that you have to

4
00:00:09.941 --> 00:00:14.900
learn,
uh,
or are you going to learn the hard way?
Um,
and,

5
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.080
and that's,
I think that was a good thing,
you know,
ultimately,

6
00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:21.730
cause it kind of humbles you and makes you,
it makes you know your place.

7
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.830
Mm.
Um,
which is good.
Did you start training Jiujitsu there?

8
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.450
Uh,
I started,
uh,
you know,
actually,
um,
my,
one of my good buddies,
uh,

9
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.300
who passed away,
Paul Walker got me into a Jujitsu.
Uh,

10
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.940
he got me about six years ago.
Six maybe plot,
maybe more now.
Yeah.

11
00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:41.860
He was like a Purple Belt Ryan or a brown belt or something.

12
00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:46.660
He was a brown belt when he died.
Um,
and so,
yeah,
he,
he was,

13
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.020
I mean,
he was,
you know,
die hard.
I mean,
he had a place in Hawaii actually,

14
00:00:50.021 --> 00:00:53.680
and he had,
uh,
he would,
he would go get Matt and he would get his place,

15
00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:57.940
outfit it so he could practice at home.
Oh,
wow.
Um,
and he got me,

16
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.420
he got me involved.
And that's,
you know,
that's another thing that's great about,

17
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.610
uh,
over there.
It's like,
you really realize like obviously,
you know,
uh,

18
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.520
jets is like the ultimate humbling.
Yeah.
You know,
for people,
uh,

19
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.351
especially for,
you know,

20
00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:15.520
I think for men carry a lot of ego around or carry a Lotta,
you know,

21
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.790
you know,
I think as men we're trying to figure out who we are,

22
00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:20.690
especially when we're young.
Um,

23
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.580
it really calms your ego down cause you always know,
you know,

24
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.500
I'm going to choke some people out and people are going to choke me out.
Yeah.

25
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.910
And it's just no matter what level you're at,
you also get it out of your system.

26
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.120
Like though though,
sure.
Big Part of what men do,

27
00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:36.760
they puff their chest up because they weren't prove themselves and they haven't

28
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.670
yet and they don't know.
And so they want to like put up this air.

29
00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:43.870
Like there's some bad motherfucker because they're insecure,
they don't know.

30
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.250
And once you've done it a bunch of times and you know,
trained for a few years,

31
00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:51.730
it just,
it all calms down.
Yeah.
At you notice like all the,

32
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.140
all the guys who do it consistently or the high level guys just socom.

33
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.160
SOCOM.
And that's actually one thing I noticed about Cameron too.
He's like,

34
00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:05.161
he's a common motherfucker cause he's spends a lot of time out in the wilderness

35
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.810
and I think that as,
I'm a big,
uh,
you know,
with the world we live in now,
today.

36
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.980
Yeah,
we're,
yeah.
And we talked about,
we talked about this some,

37
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.280
some of the experiences,
the stressful experiences in the hard,

38
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.550
I mean life here is never hard.

39
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.210
Really the challenges we face in the regular everyday world traffic dude,

40
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.130
sometimes the line at Starbucks is huge.
I know that,
that's hard.
Okay.

41
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.330
So size tough spelled with a k.
Right.

42
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.230
But so I mean it puts it in perspective.
It's just kinda like what you're saying.

43
00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:39.970
But yeah,
you need to experiences like that.

44
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.300
Just you kind of simulate those and training or,
and you know,

45
00:02:43.301 --> 00:02:45.340
the Hans that I do or the races that I do,

46
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.330
and it keeps it in perspective so you don't get wound up over the,

47
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.830
the little stuff.
It's like,
no,
no biggie.

48
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.830
<v 1>[inaudible]
okay.</v>
