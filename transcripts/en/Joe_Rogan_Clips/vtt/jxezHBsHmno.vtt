00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.670
The joe rogan experience in Australia though in it like kickboxing,

2
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.700
kickboxing.
I Bula Vinnie says watch his fights.
Amazing.
I'll watch it.

3
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:13.530
I won't go on.
I'm aware to what Jake,
I don't know.

4
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:15.330
I just thought this dog isn't that interesting.

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.770
He likes what he likes or not.
So you know.
Well that's how,

6
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.020
this is a big thing with a lot of Americans.
You know,

7
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:25.200
when it comes to like I've tried to show American fight fans,

8
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:27.000
Moy Moitai even like good buddies of mine.

9
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:31.740
Like how the fuck can you not like this?
Yeah,
he split up.
But people like it.

10
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:35.460
He's like,
I used to like watch boxing,
but now I've been watching uh,

11
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.050
like movement specialists,
you know,
I've been doing all that movement and stuff.

12
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:40.280
I've,

13
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.280
I've started doing it and especially with the guy called dom met and now and

14
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:49.620
he's a student of Edo Porter and I like watching that and find myself just sat

15
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:52.790
there watching Manin men swinging around and rings for,

16
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.840
you know what that's called?
It's called mental pause.
Is it ball?

17
00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:59.320
Certain stuff or,
that's definitely,
definitely true.

18
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.040
I worked with done not long buck and some of the stuff he does it.
He's amazing.

19
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.060
Especially for Muy Thai law.

20
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:08.250
Obviously your hip flexors and stuff like that are working all the time.

21
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:09.840
Some of the like the different stuff that you're doing.

22
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.260
Obviously I get really tight run heaps and stuff when I'm kicking all the time

23
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:15.420
and that's some of the stuff that he showed me and we worked with it were

24
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:18.120
unbelievable.
It felt so much looser.
We love that guy.
Yeah.

25
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.410
Have you ever done any yoga?
No.
I did a hot yoga once and I nearly died.

26
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.320
I don't think,
oh,
I'll do that one again.
Oh,
I should do to be fair,

27
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:32.370
but I think now that I've found done and all the different stuff that he show
me,

28
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:34.860
I think not a whole lot of that can replace any,

29
00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:37.230
any sort of yoga it shouldn't be doing because this stuff is is amazing.

30
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.380
Well you,
I think it would be a good compliment to your style.

31
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:42.570
Cause your style fucking,
yeah.

32
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:46.800
You're so like tense and powerful that I would think that like maybe that will

33
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.080
open you up a little bit loose.
That stuff that Dan does,

34
00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:53.700
he does it like he's open and using different joints and stuff and putting me in

35
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:56.640
positions that I'm not used to and three fairy is it is hard,

36
00:01:56.641 --> 00:02:00.710
but after you've done it and you,
after you've done the workout,
join you,

37
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.530
you just feel loose.
He feel amazing.
This is brilliant.
It really,

38
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.730
every Wednesday morning and I don't want to go,
I'll fucking tell you the truth.

39
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:12.150
I'm driving down that it's an hour away from me and I'm thinking,
fuck this,

40
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.630
and then I get there and it's just,
it's just a very,

41
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:20.400
very special illegal is weed in England.
I'm not intuit me,

42
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.263
listen bro,

43
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.360
take two solid hits and then go to yoga class hitch up behind and run back on

44
00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:29.010
myself or I'm telling you it's not familiar to see American.

45
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:34.011
We get ahold of some of this California shit orbit serious noise,

46
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.490
two hits and then go to a yoga class.
It's like you're on a journey.
You're like,

47
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.450
you get out of their hour and a half late,

48
00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:42.690
it's perfect because an hour and a half into the sweating,

49
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.930
the parts worn off and you'll like it,

50
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:46.380
come back down and put in the middle of it.

51
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:49.440
You feel like the world's going to end any second now in the middle of the
class,

52
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:51.180
like there's no way this can be sustainable.

53
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.220
There's no way I'm not going to survive.

54
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.900
Did the whole way you'd stick about everything that's going on and Tracy get on

55
00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:59.680
with Joe where like a house on fire.
Been One my dad,

56
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.720
I'm not me.
I can't do it.
I don't agree with me.
I love it for Yoga.

57
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.790
This of my favorite things.
Ever take two hits and go to yoga class.

58
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.890
When you stone,
you can't not be on stone quick.
He just like,
Oh shit.
No,

59
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.270
there's no wearing off quick.
Yeah,
caffeine helps a little bit crazy.

60
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.120
I remember Jordan give me a drop of cannabis.
I will be fine.
I like Mel.

61
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:19.441
He didn't know.

62
00:03:19.441 --> 00:03:22.750
He saw for for about six hours and I couldn't move and I'm thinking I'm dead.

63
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.500
I'm Sam.
I'm Donia countless time.
Last time I was a high at someone,

64
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.850
I add some cannabis oil and I was sat there watching TV and then I was like

65
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:32.170
fucking hell of those mine.

66
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.730
And then it got the remote control from the TV and this guy was going to La and

67
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:41.140
I turned him over and it went,
Huh.
To be fucking self.

68
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:42.170
And then I knew for not,

69
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.730
it's not for you say well it's just one of those things like anything else

70
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:49.830
you've got to ease into it.
I understand what you said was it's a story.
Yeah,

71
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.490
I'd like that for just relaxation reflection,
you know?
Yeah.

72
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.060
I think it's also great for like pain management and you know,

73
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.130
after you're done training,
everything's sore.
Your shoulders,
your elbows.

74
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.540
When my Mama died,
they both love it.
But I've just never been able to remember.

75
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.660
I tried to drag before phone,

76
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.620
I nearly at the fucking paranoid Toccoa cause he had to go hide you to dig a

77
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:12.130
little bit.
But those are those type of guys.
I'm all on north India.
I mean,

78
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:12.760
so yeah.

79
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.620
I'm sure we've every aspect of if approach when you approach Moitai that could

80
00:04:17.621 --> 00:04:19.080
be a real fucking quick stick.
Yeah.

81
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.900
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
