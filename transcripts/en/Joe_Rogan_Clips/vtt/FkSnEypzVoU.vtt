1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.550
Yeah.
That whole 3,485 pound division.

2
00:00:02.551 --> 00:00:06.690
It's kind of crazy cause they're promising if a style bender fights Anderson,

3
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:07.770
they're saying to Anderson,

4
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:12.390
if you win you get a title shot and everybody else in the division is like what,

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.303
what?

6
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.540
Like you think that that's like some trickery to get Anderson to fight style

7
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:23.190
bender?
I that's exactly what I think it is.
That's exactly what I think.
I um,

8
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.560
does it they offer style bender a title shot if he beats Anderson.
Dan Hook is,

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.560
I don't believe so.
And that uh,
Dan Hooker,
Dan Hook a posted that on it,
on his,

10
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:33.800
on his Instagram and I,
I just like,

11
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.270
I like hookah and I just had to say something.
I was just like,
look,

12
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:40.620
we know that his style and my thought was we know when style Ben and wins this

13
00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:42.330
fight cause I really believe style when it was,

14
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:44.190
how bad is going to win that fight.
When he wins this fight,

15
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.010
he's not going to get that title shot.
And I,

16
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.510
for me as a form of fighter and knowing who Addison is and what he's done for

17
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:55.300
the sport and for the UFC,
I'm just like,
I feel like that's,
that's,
that's,

18
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.640
that's so disrespectful.
She asked me,
um,

19
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.650
that's my opinion.
It's an opinion.
It's mine.
And I stand by that,
that,
you know,

20
00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:07.710
we want to make this young guy a star and we're going to,

21
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:10.260
we're going to sacrifice you into the wolf to get that done.

22
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.550
But Anderson still feels like he can compete at the highest level.
Man.

23
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.560
We all go to feel like we compete.
If you put enough money in front of me,
I will,

24
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.480
I will fuck Khabib up.

25
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.100
Right.
You put something in front of me that I really want.
Like that's the thing,

26
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.240
they give you a goal.
I'll give you a time period to train and prepare for it.

27
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.610
Yeah.
Anderson's what,
43 now.
Yeah.
So,
so that's,

28
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:41.100
that's the thing of the realm of possibilities.
The same age as you are.

29
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.810
Well or close to it.
Yeah.
It's,

30
00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:48.910
you all know at least 40 oil's at least.
Yeah.
He's the one,
the words might be 41.

31
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.900
I mean it's not
the problem with an,
I mean,
and then Anderson,

32
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.720
we started failing drug tests.
You're like,
okay.

33
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:01.650
So he's probably struggling just trying to get that edge,
you know,
trying to,

34
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.770
trying to recover and training.
So he's taken a bunch of weird supplements.

35
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.950
Some of them are tainted and I bet you if you go back to just go back to what

36
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:11.994
you used to do,

37
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.650
go back to what it was you did when you became the Anderson Silva that everybody

38
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:19.110
loves.
You know,
before,

39
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.560
before he got to the point where like before the Forrest Griffin fight,

40
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.860
because I believe that's when it started to decline for him.
Yeah.

41
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:29.850
He still look good and he's still still performed well,
but he got away from,

42
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.660
from the fundamentals,
you know,
um,
and that Forrest Griffin fight,

43
00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:37.500
he was able to take forest out without the fundamentals,
moving his head doing,

44
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:41.210
doing these weird things and just pop it back.
Um,
the fundamentals of what,

45
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.200
what's the strongest thing in the game for sure.
That fundamental.

46
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.740
The Forrest Griffin is an interesting example too though,

47
00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:50.880
because forest had been kao twice in training for that fight.

48
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.560
Like he had no business being in there and he just couldn't take a shot.
