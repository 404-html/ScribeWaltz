00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.910
When you see,
uh,
you know,

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.020
these all these folks that are on medication today,
I mean,

3
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:10.290
how many of these people do you think legitimately should be on medication?

4
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.560
I mean,
I mean,
is it something that you can assess?

5
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.260
<v 1>You know,
I,
I can't answer that in terms.
I mean,</v>

6
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.010
I'm sure there's research of people,

7
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.140
how many people are on medication.
But in my personal experience,

8
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.100
most of the people that I see on medications,
in my opinion,

9
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.350
don't need most of the medications they're on now.
That's just anecdotal.

10
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.161
That's my opinion.

11
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:44.000
You asked me to hand you a research survey or study to support that.

12
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.740
I can't hand it to you or I can't point you to when I used to tell you after 45

13
00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:53.270
years in this experience,
I see people that are on medication,

14
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.360
they've usually seen someone for six or eight minutes and said,

15
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:05.600
you know,
I'm really feeling kind of down or blue.
Yup.
Here's some PROZAC.

16
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:07.580
Here's this,
here's that.
They give it to them.

17
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.830
They don't even really ask why and they just give it to them because medicine

18
00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:18.680
has become a high volume business.
Um,

19
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.500
and that's not necessarily the doctor's fault.

20
00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:25.220
I mean the way that it's now funded and Medicare and Medicaid,

21
00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:26.850
you got to turn them and burn them and yeah,

22
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.730
or you can't stay in business and so it's a high volume business and so they

23
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.230
throw pills at them because they don't have an hour to sit down or don't take an

24
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.080
hour to sit down and talk about and say,
well let's find out what's going on.

25
00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:40.760
Is there a reason?
Like I said,

26
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.680
if this guy's got five parts of his life that have gone down or a woman has got,

27
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.030
you know,
three or four areas of her life that have really gone down in quality,

28
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.350
then they should be having poor mood.

29
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.180
So why mask that?
Let's come up with an action plan and change it.

30
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.840
So most of the people I see on medication,
not all,

31
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.380
but most of the people I see are on too many medications in too high a dose or

32
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:13.880
either don't need it at all.
And I'm really bothered by polypharmacy.

33
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:16.310
That's where I really get frustrated.

34
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.160
<v 0>Yeah.
This is what you're saying is a very common sense approach,</v>

35
00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:23.310
but it's not the norm today.
No.

36
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.670
It seems like more people are treating this,
you know,
air quotes,

37
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:29.430
depression issue as if it's a medical disorder,
like,

38
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.640
like diabetes or something where you need medication.

39
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.240
<v 1>Yeah.
And,
and look for a lot of people that works.
I mean,
yeah,</v>

40
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.430
you give people a mood elevator and they say,
hey,
I feel better.

41
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.320
<v 0>And then maybe they change their life.</v>

42
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.600
Maybe they move their life into a more positive direction.

43
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:46.740
They can wean themselves off of it.

44
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.220
<v 1>Because one of the things about depression,
for example,</v>

45
00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:52.220
you're using that as an example,
is you get a,

46
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.170
what's referred to as psychomotor retardation.
There's a,

47
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.800
there's a lessening in activity level.
Um,

48
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.510
and I think old sayings get to be all sayings because they're profound.
Like,

49
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.710
you're not going to get a hit if you're not swinging well.
Um,

50
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.930
if you're depressed and so you think slower,

51
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.030
less actively,
you behave less actively,

52
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.390
your chance of getting rewarded goes down.
Right?

53
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.080
You don't get out there and you don't mix it up socially as much.

54
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:30.610
You don't apply for jobs as much,
you're not as productive on your job as much,

55
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.750
so you're less likely to get strokes.
You're less likely to get rewarded.

56
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.000
Well maybe you go take a pill and it lifts your mood up so you get more active.

57
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:41.920
And so now you can start getting pats on the back.

58
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:44.080
You start getting people to engage with you more,

59
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.200
so that lifts your mood and is that takes care of it.

60
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:51.670
So you took the medication short term,
you're lifted back up in your,
okay.

61
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.180
Short term,
it can be an alternative,

62
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.050
but I've seen people on everything from opioids to mood elevators for years and

63
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:05.410
that's where you lose me.

64
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.340
<v 0>Yes.
Don't get it.
Yeah.
I'm,
I'm,</v>

65
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.290
I know people that have been on things since they were five years old and

66
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.650
they're in their forties.
Yeah.

67
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.270
<v 1>And then you have wastebasket diagnosis like add and ADHD where you know what</v>

68
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:24.010
used to be a spoiled brat is now add or Adhd.

69
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.160
So they start prescribing,
um,

70
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.000
these Ritalin neocortical stimulants like Ritalin.

71
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.980
And if you give a kid that does not need a neo cortical stimulant,

72
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.110
a stimulant,
you're really going to throw him off the charts now cause you're,

73
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.170
you've got an normally active brain that you're now making hyperactive.

74
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.280
So you're creating a problem that didn't exist before you gave him the

75
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:53.800
medication because you didn't do the proper diagnosis.

76
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.050
<v 0>Yeah.
I had my old neighbor had a situation like that.</v>

77
00:04:57.051 --> 00:05:00.320
They had a kid and the kid was just had a lot of energy and they weren't paying

78
00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:05.210
attention to them and so they started medicating him.
It's insanely common.

79
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.830
Yeah.

80
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.430
And you cannot chemically babysit your children and who knows where these kids

81
00:05:10.431 --> 00:05:11.960
are going to be 20,
30 years from now.

82
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.920
I mean we're just looking at either this rash of people being treated,

83
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.200
these ailments,
air quotes,

84
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.950
and then when we're not seeing how this all turns out in the long run and how

85
00:05:21.951 --> 00:05:24.060
much damage we're doing to these people.
No

86
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.430
<v 1>miss on the other end of the continuum,</v>

87
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.560
I have seen some people that are clearly psychotic,

88
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.530
uh,
schizophrenia,
delusional,

89
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.160
that without medication are absolutely impossible to manage.

90
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.880
But if you put them on anti psychotics and so you can lower their delusional

91
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:51.580
behavior there,
hallucinatory behavior,

92
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:56.581
so you can now have a meaningful conversation with them so they can respond to

93
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.450
talking therapies.
It makes all the difference in the world.

94
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:06.920
And without those anti psychotics you would be lost without them.

95
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:11.921
So there are some medications for some disorders that are absolute miracles that

96
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:15.320
without them you wouldn't be able to do the work you need to do to get the

97
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:16.610
person back where they need to be.

98
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:17.590
<v 0>Yeah,
unquestionably.</v>

99
00:06:17.591 --> 00:06:20.350
I mean there's definitely a lot of great pharmaceutical drugs that helped a lot

100
00:06:20.351 --> 00:06:21.184
of people.

101
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:26.020
Do you get pushback from a lot of these positions from the established medical

102
00:06:26.021 --> 00:06:26.854
community?

103
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.230
<v 1>You know,
sometimes,</v>

104
00:06:28.231 --> 00:06:33.231
but mostly when you talk to people about it thoughtfully.

105
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.340
Um,
they agree with,

106
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.680
with what I'm saying.
I mean,

107
00:06:40.681 --> 00:06:44.260
most people will agree that you need to be thoughtful about,
uh,

108
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.850
prescribing medications and that medications are too readily administered.

109
00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:56.430
I mean,
that's certainly what we've seen in the opioid epidemic right now.
Um,

110
00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.270
opioids are so readily prescribed right now that there are enough opioid

111
00:07:00.271 --> 00:07:04.680
prescriptions for every man,
woman,
and child in America to have their own bottle.

112
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.660
And if you renew that prescription one time,
one time,

113
00:07:12.661 --> 00:07:16.290
if you are taking those opioids at the seven day mark,

114
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.030
your chance of being addicted at one year is one in 12.

115
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.290
And if you renew it at,
if you're still taking them at 30 days,

116
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.210
your likelihood of being addicted is one in three.
Wow.

117
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:36.260
And these things are getting written with way too high appeal count.

118
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:42.190
And it's,
and so the addictions,
uh,
we're,

119
00:07:42.191 --> 00:07:47.191
we're seeing a whole different kind of addiction now coming out to the suburbs

120
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.230
and they take them for a while and they're very expensive and actually take him

121
00:07:52.231 --> 00:07:57.180
for a while.
Heroin's cheaper.
So they dumped the opioids and start taking heroin.

122
00:07:57.181 --> 00:07:58.500
So you're saying soccer mom,

123
00:07:58.501 --> 00:08:03.501
heroin addicts that you weren't saying 10 years ago because they get started on

124
00:08:03.811 --> 00:08:06.180
prescription opioids and then they can't afford them.

125
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.670
Or finally the doctor cuts them off,

126
00:08:08.671 --> 00:08:11.820
but they're addicted and so they start taking heroin because it's cheaper.

127
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.370
<v 0>Now,
this is obviously a very disturbing pattern,
but where do you see this going?</v>

128
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.090
Like when you look at the future and mean it looks bleak in that regard.

129
00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:22.150
I mean I've known several people that have had real problems with pills.

130
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:23.500
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

131
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.500
The problem that that I think people have is they think because a doctor gave me

132
00:08:28.691 --> 00:08:31.810
this because it's on a prescription pad that this is safe.

133
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.160
Your body doesn't know whether you got that in a back alley or you got it from a

134
00:08:36.161 --> 00:08:40.330
doctor.
Um,
it still has the same addictive quality.

135
00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:45.130
And I think it is at an epidemic level and I've testified before Congress about

136
00:08:45.131 --> 00:08:50.131
this and I think there are several levels of accountability at the manufacturing

137
00:08:51.221 --> 00:08:55.290
level and at the prescription level and at the educational level.

138
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:57.810
So people understand,
uh,

139
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.530
I think everybody has to take part of it and I'm doing everything I can to raise

140
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:04.560
the awareness about it as well.
When you testified before Congress,

141
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:06.740
what was the reaction?
Uh,

142
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.840
they're very much aware that this has become a serious,

143
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:17.170
serious problem because the cost as,

144
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.280
as you see the last labor in the workforce is in the billions of dollars.

145
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.440
You see the,
the,
uh,

146
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:31.610
demands on the healthcare system that this is creating a young mothers with,

147
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.590
with children and babies born addicted to these opioids.
I mean,

148
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:40.380
the numbers are just going through the roof.
So I mean,

149
00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:45.150
it's putting a strain financially on healthcare system that it just can't stand.

150
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:50.151
So you start costing money and it starts getting politicians' attention.

151
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.980
So they start saying,
okay,
now we gotta start doing something.
So they,

152
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.860
they get it.
They get that there's a problem.

153
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.700
What could they do though once it seems like once that genie's out of the
bottle?

154
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.820
Well,
clearly you've got to start educating people and

155
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.500
the manufacturers have to be required to start labeling this much more clearly.

156
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.440
Physicians have to be much more

157
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.990
conservative in prescribing.
Um,
you know,

158
00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:25.600
I just had to shoulder surgery and um,

159
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.300
I took like one,
one opioid,

160
00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:32.370
one pill they gave me in the hospital.

161
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:38.180
And after that you can manage it with like Tylenol or something.

162
00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:43.200
Cause the surgeons now are so good with the arthroscopic surgeries and stuff.

163
00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:48.060
It's so,
it's so much less of an insult to the body,
uh,

164
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.730
that with ice and Tylenol and stuff,

165
00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:54.180
you can manage it if you just kind of focus on it a little bit.

166
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.240
And uh,
and I'm not saying if,

167
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.980
if you've had surgery and you're having organic pain,
for God's sakes,

168
00:11:01.981 --> 00:11:05.430
get ahead of the pain and stay ahead.
But when you,

169
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:09.360
as soon as you can get off of it,
get off of it and understand what's happening.

170
00:11:09.361 --> 00:11:09.601
Yeah,

171
00:11:09.601 --> 00:11:13.300
there's is no sense of being like Macho Bioni leather strap between your feet

172
00:11:13.301 --> 00:11:17.130
and go have some surgery.
I mean,
shit,
if it hurts,
take the pill and get past it.

173
00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:21.510
But realize the minute you can get away from that,
you need to get away from it.

174
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.200
But you know,
they don't need to give you a 30 day supply.

175
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:29.100
They need to give you three or four days and then you've got to go see your

176
00:11:29.101 --> 00:11:33.840
doctor again.
If it's still a problem,
discuss it.
I mean that's what,

177
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.320
that's what I think needs to happen to just be a lot more conservative about

178
00:11:37.321 --> 00:11:41.310
what you're giving is promise.
These pharmaceutical companies make so much money.

179
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.740
Yes.
They don't want to,
they don't want to back off that.

180
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.470
They got private chats and yachts to pay for.
Yeah.

181
00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:48.420
And they're starting to shut down some of these,

182
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:53.540
they had some of these pill clinics in pain clinics in Florida where you could

183
00:11:54.551 --> 00:11:58.420
go in without an x ray without an MRI and just say you had back pain and there

184
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:02.350
was a doctor there that would give you a 90 count prescription on the spot.

185
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:07.150
No questions asked 90 and you're out the door and you go down the street to the

186
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:10.330
next one.
Yeah.
Cause there was no database,
no database.

187
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:14.980
And that doctor might be a foreign doctor that flew in from offshore road.

188
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.410
All the prescriptions during the day flew off again at night,

189
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.820
and now they're shutting that stuff down so that the hammer's coming down.

190
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.070
Well,
one can only hope.
