WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.280
Projects like that.
And then just sharing it with the world at large,

2
00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:04.920
people going like,
this is impossible.
I mean,
how many guys do you know?

3
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:07.530
That was like,
one day I'm going to do this cool thing,
but like never do it.

4
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:10.530
Right.
And so actually going after that and sharing it away,

5
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.660
it's like you might not want to walk across Antarctica,

6
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:15.930
but like you probably have some hope or some dream or some goal that you want to

7
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:19.110
accomplish in your life.
Like fucking go and do it.
Like get after it.

8
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:21.150
And so for me,
doing this,
it's funny,
I've,

9
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:24.450
I've started to think of myself less as an athlete and actually more of as an

10
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:27.030
artist in my canvas really is just in sports,

11
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:30.720
but creating these art projects in the world that I can create and share with

12
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:33.060
people through storytelling tope we inspire them to do that.

13
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.640
So what was I thinking in that first hour was,
you know,
I don't,

14
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.920
I don't want my art project to blow up right in my face,
but more so there was,

15
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.760
this was bigger than myself.
And that's really what kept me going forward.

16
00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:46.980
It's like I can't let these kids in these public school classrooms think that I

17
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:48.240
could after the first hour,

18
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:51.270
like these other people that are driving inspiration from this,

19
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:54.630
hopefully like I want to do this for this larger purpose.
And honestly,
that's,

20
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.540
that's what really kept me going forward through the really hard times was that,

21
00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:00.660
that that connection to a larger purpose of what I want to put out in the world.

22
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:03.210
And that ripple effect,
the positivity.
That's awesome.

23
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:07.260
And then of course you have a giant team that prepared,
let them,

24
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.690
oh yeah.
You know,
it's,
it's,
it's a lot.
Lot goes into it.
So get,
get into that,

25
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.090
getting to that starting line and having that doubt.
But I think,

26
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:17.800
I mean on one level it's also,
it's a human element.
It,

27
00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:20.190
it's really easy for me to come in here and tell the story.
Like,

28
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.430
you know what Joe,
like I'm the biggest bad ass in the world.

29
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:25.980
No one's walked across Antarctica and like I did it.

30
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.600
Even though these people died trying whatever.

31
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:30.450
Like those are the facts of the situation.
But like the truth is man,

32
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:33.840
like I'm human.
Like I have the wave of human emotions.

33
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:36.840
I've figured out how to tap into my mind in a way to do these things.

34
00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:40.410
But like I still experience fear.
I steer,
it's feeling experienced,
doubt.

35
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:42.330
I still experienced the ups and downs,

36
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.260
but I have a way of actually being able to repo purpose or refocus that energy

37
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.440
into positive,
forward momentum.
I think that's what the difference is.

38
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.160
But I believe all of us,
all of us humans have the capacity to do this.

39
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:55.080
Like you're looking at me,
I'm like a pretty like regular,

40
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:58.380
like size of the regular looking guy.
Um,
but I think you know,

41
00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:00.540
the muscle between my years is what separates a difference.

42
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:02.190
And they allowed me to do this more than anything.

43
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.330
You don't seem to have the darkness that I usually see in people that do things

44
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:08.870
like this.
Do you know what I'm saying?
This,

45
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.030
I then met a bunch of people that have done some fucked up things and they all

46
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:15.330
have some weird darkness.
Yeah.
You know,

47
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.250
I hear what you're saying.

48
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:21.030
I think for me there's a lot of this strength come from a dark moment in my
life.

49
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.260
Um,
you know,
right after college,
uh,
I was traveling around the world that,

50
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:27.330
you know,
I had no money as a kid growing up,
you know,

51
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.720
we're working class background,
painted houses every summer,

52
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:32.700
but always dreamed of traveling the world.
So I was like,

53
00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:34.260
one day I'm going to travel the world.

54
00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:38.490
So I finished college buddies of mine are getting like real jobs and whatever

55
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.500
Wall Street and things like that.
And I was like,
you know what?

56
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:43.290
I saved up $10,000 over the past six years.

57
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:46.470
I'm going to take a surfboard and a backpack and go see the world with my life

58
00:02:46.471 --> 00:02:50.730
savings.
And so I went and do that.
I'm 21 years old,
you know,
go to Fiji.

59
00:02:50.731 --> 00:02:52.860
I served through Australia,
hitchhike through New Zealand.

60
00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:57.210
I ended up in Thailand and Europe at a time.
Yeah,
yeah,
of course.

61
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.330
Um,
and you,

62
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.750
so you're familiar with how much fire and fire dancing and various crazy

63
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:03.580
departures things that happen over there.

64
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.510
So I'm on a beach in rural Thailand and I decided to jump this flaming jump
rope.

65
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.690
And unfortunately it goes terribly wrong for me.

66
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.310
The rope wraps around my legs and at nights my entire bio body on fire to my

67
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:18.700
neck.
Um,
and you know,
in an instant my life changed.
You know,

68
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:22.780
fortunately for me the water's edge,
the ocean was 10 steps away.

69
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:25.840
So kind of instinct takes over and I dive into the ocean,

70
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:28.750
which extinguish the flames.
My Body's on fire to my neck,

71
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.710
but not before about 25% of my body is severely,
severely burned.

72
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:36.250
So my clothes were on fire.
Um,
but mostly we got severely burned,

73
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:39.750
was my legs and feet.
And so I'm in a place,
I want a beach.
There's,

74
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:42.340
there's no hospital on this and I'm on an island.
There's no hospital.

75
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.130
Instead of an ambulance,
ride them on the back of a moped,

76
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.540
driving down a dirt path.
You know,
I'm,
I'm in a one room nursing station.

77
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:50.590
Literally like the size of the room,

78
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:52.780
we're sitting in there like this is our sort of hospital,

79
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:56.530
it's like one bed and I'm just completely devastated.

80
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.530
And so that they put me under eight surgeries over the next week in the middle

81
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:03.550
of nowhere,
rural Thailand surgeries in a tiny little shack.
And the,

82
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:06.970
basically there's a cat running around my bed every time I come out of there,

83
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.350
you know,
quote unquote Icu,

84
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:10.900
there's a cat running around my bed and across my chest.

85
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.400
And the doctors are literally saying to me,
you know,
in the,

86
00:04:13.401 --> 00:04:17.200
in the broken English is they're saying,
hey,
you'll probably never walk again.

87
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:21.420
Normally.
Like you're probably never gonna walk again normally.
Um,
yeah,
there,

88
00:04:21.421 --> 00:04:24.640
there's a photo of that.
I think if you click over on,
on that to the second one,

89
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:29.200
it actually shows,
um,
you know,
there,
there's,
what the legs,
um,

90
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.010
so,
you know,
I was that,
that photo there with those legs,

91
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:35.920
that's actually eight weeks after I was burned so that,
believe it or not,

92
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:39.220
that's like,
it's starting to look a little bit better.
Um,

93
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.150
all things considered there.
So,
as you can probably imagine,
I mean,

94
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:45.820
just the darkest time of my life,
I've been,
you know,
an APP,
you know,

95
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:49.660
I swam through college and I thought of myself as a physically active person.

96
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.690
And here I am like doctor saying,
Hey,
you know,
22 year old kid,

97
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:54.790
like you'll never walk again normally.
Um,

98
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.370
and to me that they're the hero in this story,

99
00:04:57.371 --> 00:05:00.580
which is maybe why you don't see the darkness in my eyes and it's more the
light.

100
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.210
But you know,
my mother is really the,
the heroine of this tale,
which is she,

101
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:06.490
she arrived to my bedside around day five,
you know,

102
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:10.210
flies all the way over to Thailand,
finds me.
Um,
are you,
are you a parent?

103
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:12.250
I don't know.
Do you have kids?
Yeah,
I don't have kids yet,

104
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:15.850
but I can only imagine as a parent what it's like to walk into a hospital room

105
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:19.240
and see your kid halfway around the world and this state.
Nothing you can do.

106
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.750
And she admits now that she was crying in the hallways,
you know,

107
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:26.590
pleading with the doctors for good news,
like he's going to be all right,
right.

108
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:30.670
He's going to walk,
she's crying every time she walked into my hospital room,

109
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:33.970
she walked in with a smile on her face and it's just air of positivity of being

110
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:35.950
like,
okay column like this is bad.

111
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:38.770
Like what do you want to do when you get Outta here?
Like let's set a goal.

112
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:41.680
Like let's get Outta here and do something positive.
And I'm like,
mom,

113
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.470
are you crazy?
Like the doctor say,
I'm never going to walk again.

114
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:46.810
Normally like my life is,
I know it.
It's over,
you know,

115
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.730
just in this really dark place in my mind.

116
00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:52.090
But she just kept at me day after day with this positivity,
this,
that.

117
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:54.850
And I finally was like close my eyes and I just pictured like,

118
00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:55.840
what am I going to be?

119
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.720
And I closed my eyes and I had this visualization of myself crossing a triathlon

120
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:01.820
finish line,
which is not something I'd ever done before.

121
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:04.850
I had swam in college but never biked to run competitively.
Nothing,

122
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:06.140
but I was like,
you know what,

123
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:10.490
the able bodied me sometime in the future is going to be not only walking again,

124
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.760
but doing a triathlon race.
And so I said it too.
I said,

125
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:16.820
my goal is to race a triathlon one day and instead of her looking at me going,

126
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:18.080
like I said,
set a goal,

127
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:22.170
but maybe something more realistic but it doesn't require you to be running.
Um,

128
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.870
she was like,
great,
let's learn about it.

129
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.320
Pulls out her computer and just literally starts reading me like triathlon races

130
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:30.110
are this,
they're this far there.
This distances.
Like I didn't know,

131
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:32.930
I knew nothing about the sport other than just like popped into my mind.

132
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.570
It's something I thought I maybe wanted to do.
Um,

133
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.400
and so that's what I focused on.

134
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:40.250
I literally have this photo of me with the Thai doctor.
I'm,
you know,

135
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:44.030
my legs are bandage to my waist and the Thai doctors like looking at my crazy,

136
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:47.150
but I'm lifting these like 10 pound barbells bells in my head going,

137
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.640
I'm training for a triathlon now.
That guy's like,

138
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.950
you're in Thailand in a hospital and I'm telling you,

139
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:55.820
you're never going to walk a good normally.
Um,
and so,
you know,
flash forward,

140
00:06:55.821 --> 00:06:56.720
you know,
two or three months,

141
00:06:56.721 --> 00:07:00.470
I finally get released from this Thai hospital folks.
Yeah,
yeah.

142
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.830
And when I got released,
I still hadn't walked,
you know,
I'm in,

143
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.700
I'm in a wheelchair.
Um,
I got carried on and off the flight back to Portland,

144
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:11.780
Oregon land back home.
And uh,
you know,
still it's still bandaged up.

145
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.160
And my mom says to me,

146
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:15.950
I wake up the first morning back in my parents' house and my mother's kitchen,

147
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:19.760
the house I grew up in and she looks at me and she goes,
all right Colin.

148
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.590
Now I know you've got this big triathlon goal,

149
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.170
but today your goal is to take your very first step.

150
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:28.100
And so she actually grabs a chair from our kitchen table and place it one step

151
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:30.350
in front of my wheelchair and she says,
today,

152
00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:32.840
you need to somehow figure out how to get out of that wheelchair,

153
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.360
take one step and step into the chair in front of you.

154
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.390
And I'm looking at it like,
I don't know if this is possible,

155
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.160
but three hours later,
four hours later,

156
00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:43.070
I'm still staring at this chair and I finally work up the courage and strength

157
00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:44.300
to get out of this wheelchair,

158
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.030
take the one step and get into that chair in front of me.

159
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.230
And is the problem that because of the burnt skin,
it's not flexible.

160
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.840
You can move it and bend it and now it's a good question.

161
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:57.710
So basically what happened with the burn is it burned me so deep that two things

162
00:07:57.711 --> 00:07:59.570
happen.
One is there was ligament damage,

163
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:03.170
so ligament damage to my ankles and knee joints.
And then the way that this,

164
00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:03.560
the heat,

165
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.580
the scarring in the skin is healing essentially over these mobile joint.

166
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.400
They don't think I'm going to regain full flexibility,
um,

167
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.620
at full range of motion essentially in my leg.

168
00:08:12.621 --> 00:08:16.640
So they're not saying you'll never walk as and you won't be able to stand up at

169
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:20.450
all.
Although that was like extremely painful,
but they just didn't think,

170
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:20.690
you know,

171
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.240
it'd be a magnet walking around without being able to bend your knees or your

172
00:08:23.241 --> 00:08:25.520
ankles with like full mobility.
So it just was like,

173
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:29.510
you're not going to be able to have that back basically.
So sure enough,

174
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:31.790
I take that first step,
get in that chair the next day.
My mom,

175
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:32.750
it doesn't take it easy on me.

176
00:08:32.751 --> 00:08:35.580
She just moved the chair five stiffs way the next day,
10 steps away,
you know,

177
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.890
every day a few more steps of,
and not to go on and on,

178
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:43.070
but basically 18 months after,
you know,
getting released from that hospital,

179
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.820
I find myself in Chicago.
I finally,
you know,
took a job in finance,

180
00:08:46.821 --> 00:08:48.350
just trying to get out of my parent's basement,

181
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:51.290
like get on with my life at 23 years old.
Like,
yeah,
I got to get like a real job,

182
00:08:51.291 --> 00:08:53.960
get out of my parent's basement,
you know,
move to Chicago,

183
00:08:53.961 --> 00:08:56.880
take a job in and uh,
um,

184
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.120
try to get my shit together basically.
And I,
I honored that course.
I,

185
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.730
you know what,
I'm going to sign up for the Chicago triathlon.
I live here now.

186
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.280
Join a local gym.
Knew nothing about the sports still.

187
00:09:05.281 --> 00:09:08.940
I'm like asking random guys at the gym.
Like anybody here race a triathlon?

188
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:11.310
Like I'm going to spin class.
Like how do you,
like,

189
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.820
how do you like take your shoes off and like run afterwards?
How do you,

190
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.150
like how does it even work?

191
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:21.690
I asked these questions and sure enough through that process I like train at

192
00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:23.860
this gym,
sign up for the Chicago triathlon,

193
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.130
ended up racing the race across the finish line.

194
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.730
And to my complete and utter surprise,
I didn't just finish the race,

195
00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:32.600
but I actually won the entire Chicago triathlon PDE,

196
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.710
4,000 other people coming first place.

197
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:39.210
So first try ever.
Wow.

198
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.510
What kind of training did you do to prepare yourself for that?
I mean,

199
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:45.210
like I said,
I,
you know,
I had been a collegiate swimmer,

200
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:50.100
so I was a division one swimmer,
swim at Yale University.
Uh,
but then,

201
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:54.030
you know,
the biking and running was completely new to me.
Um,

202
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.110
anybody show you how to do it or just start running and biking?
Yeah.

203
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.150
I literally walked into this spin class,
I guess,
but not like a,
like a hidden,

204
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.350
actually ride a bike.

205
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.950
So I went to the spin class and like start like met a guy and he was like,
Oh,

206
00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:07.650
I've done one triathlon before.
And he was like,
I can hear you.

207
00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:09.990
So he took me out on a couple of bike rides with his buddies.

208
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.850
I had this like steel frame bike,

209
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:14.430
I didn't know all of these like carbon wheels and aero helmet,
you know,

210
00:10:14.431 --> 00:10:16.860
all these like fancy like triathlon type of things.

211
00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:19.460
Like didn't know much about it.
And literally for a summer,

212
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.930
just kind of like ask people some questions.

213
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:23.590
This and what's funny about triathlon,

214
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.110
I don't know how familiar you are with this sport,
but um,
in a,

215
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.950
in a race like the Chicago truffle and there's,
you know,

216
00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:30.750
for more than 4,000 participants.

217
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.930
And so unlike a marathon where everyone just starts at the same time,

218
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.350
you actually have to start in waves like a hundred people every five minutes.

219
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:42.351
And I was the 39th wave of 53 and so I dive into Lake Michigan and there's

220
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:45.210
people that are already started like two hours before me and there's people

221
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:49.170
starting two hours after me.
And so when I finished the race,
you know I swim,

222
00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:53.160
I bike,
I run was Olympic distance triathlon so it was a mile swim,
25 miles pike,

223
00:10:53.161 --> 00:10:55.890
6.2 mile run.
I crossed the finish line.

224
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.460
I don't still know I won the race because like people started before me,

225
00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:03.000
people started after me and they take the cumulative time at the end and so I

226
00:11:03.001 --> 00:11:06.420
like my grandma's there cause she lived in Chicago like gives me a big hug.

227
00:11:06.421 --> 00:11:07.500
Like I'm so proud of you,

228
00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:10.320
you weren't able to walk again and who you are finishing triathlon,

229
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.620
let's go get lunch.
And so like you know,
grab my wet suit,
my bike,

230
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.680
my grandma and I sit down to have lunch and as we're walking back to the car

231
00:11:16.681 --> 00:11:19.560
she's like,
do you want to see like what place you came in your age group?

232
00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:22.560
And I was like sure.
Like that would be cool.
Like,
let's go see how I did.

233
00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:26.550
And we won.
Drove her to like the scores table.
And the guy's like,
I'm like,
Oh,

234
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.620
you know,
I'm trying to figure out a place,
or what's your name?
I was like,
Oh,

235
00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:29.454
I'm calling,
I'm ready.
They're like,

236
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.610
we've been calling your name over the loudspeaker for the last 20 minutes.

237
00:11:32.611 --> 00:11:36.030
I'm like,
oh,
why did I like do something wrong?
And they're like,
you won,
like,

238
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.970
like my age group.
And they're like,
no,
you won.
Like the whole race.

239
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.710
It was just this surreal,
surreal moment in my life.
I mean,
it was,

240
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.690
it was wild.
But it,
um,
you know,
for me in that moment what I thought back,

241
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.970
I was like,
it was cool to pat myself on the back.
Like,
Holy Shit.

242
00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:52.260
Like I just did this crazy thing,

243
00:11:52.261 --> 00:11:55.990
but it was more going back to your initial question about the darkness versus

244
00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:58.600
the light,
at least in my journey was I was like,
wow.

245
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.520
Like this is a sliding doors moment.
Like what had happened,
had my mom not,

246
00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:02.860
you know,

247
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.190
come in with this air of positivity and forced me to set this tangible goal.

248
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:10.090
Like I'm certain my life would be nowhere where it was today,
but then it's not,

249
00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:13.330
I wasn't like,
Oh wow,
I'm some superhuman freak that can do these things.

250
00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:15.160
I was like,
wow,
humans,
all of us,

251
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:19.150
we all have these reservoirs of untapped potential inside of us and can achieve

252
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.840
extraordinary things when we set our minds to it.
And so what it did for me,

253
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.000
it's just sparked this curiosity like,
well,

254
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:28.120
what else can I do if I set my mind to it?
So sure enough,

255
00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:32.890
it was a Sunday when I raised the Chicago triathlon,
coincidentally,
um,

256
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.730
met who became a huge mentor and influence my life that afternoon.
Um,

257
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:39.880
a guy named Brian Gelber who ended up being my first sponsor and he said to me,

258
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.800
you won the Chicago triathlon today.

259
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:44.050
Do you think you should maybe do something about that?
And I was like,
yeah,

260
00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:46.990
but I've got a job and I don't have any money.
Like I would need a sponsor.

261
00:12:46.991 --> 00:12:47.824
He's like,
he's like,

262
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.680
I'll be your first sponsor if it's something you want to take seriously.

263
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.900
And so literally that was on a Sunday.

264
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.100
Monday morning I walk in and quit my job immediately.

265
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:58.423
Got It.

266
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.750
Two weeks later I'm living in Australia trading triathlon fulltime and ended up

267
00:13:01.751 --> 00:13:04.870
racing triathlon professionally for the USA national team,
you know,

268
00:13:04.871 --> 00:13:06.550
all over the world for the next six years.

269
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:10.090
So it was this crazy moment.

270
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.960
What happened ultimately with the injuries that you sustained from the fire?

271
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.880
You know,
all things sincere.
That was,
so that was January 14th,
2008,

272
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:23.860
so it's a just over 11 years ago now.
Um,
and I,
uh,

273
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:28.030
you know,
I ultimately have been pretty all right.
I mean I've got some scars,

274
00:13:28.031 --> 00:13:29.530
but it's pretty faint.
Um,

275
00:13:29.531 --> 00:13:32.740
was able to gain back most of the full flexibility in my legs.

276
00:13:32.741 --> 00:13:35.290
If you look at my left foot is where the worst worst burns,

277
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:39.550
but where the rope really just like sat on my foot for a long time must have,
um,

278
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.400
that's still pretty thick with scar tissue.
Um,
you know,

279
00:13:42.401 --> 00:13:44.290
when I'm in the mountains,
when I'm in places,
you know,

280
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:47.140
like climbing a mountain every second.
I did like pulling across an article.

281
00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:50.560
The things I have to be really aware cause my skin regulates heat not in the

282
00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:53.950
best way he and cold,
it's still just like,
no,
not like normal scans.

283
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.020
The scar tissue,
the scar tissue just is,

284
00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.230
it's just carries the heat a little bit different for some reason I guess.

285
00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:03.910
I don't know exactly why that was porous because it's exactly in the,

286
00:14:03.911 --> 00:14:06.430
I'm actually in the early days for the first five years,

287
00:14:06.431 --> 00:14:09.280
I don't get this so often anymore,
but in the first literally five years of this,

288
00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:11.750
if I bumped my legs until like a table or someone just,
you know,

289
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.840
bumped a chair and immediately no,
nothing like lightly,

290
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.570
I would usually get a little cut there.
So it was just super fragile.

291
00:14:16.571 --> 00:14:19.270
It was almost like,
you know,
class skin kind of,
um,

292
00:14:19.271 --> 00:14:21.820
what's the but not the same sort of flexibility that you'd normally have,

293
00:14:21.821 --> 00:14:26.050
but you know,
10,
11 years on now I would say it's pretty much 100%.

294
00:14:26.051 --> 00:14:29.020
I mean the things I've done with my legs and body in the last 10 years,

295
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:33.040
I think proof,
at least that that my body is doing all right.
So I feel extremely,

296
00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:36.670
extremely fortunate to ever cover it as,
as well as I did.
And you know,

297
00:14:36.671 --> 00:14:39.110
more than anything,
I test that too.
Of course,
the,

298
00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:42.880
the physical ability for my body to recover and the way it did,
but I think that,

299
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.600
at least for me,
started with the mine,

300
00:14:44.601 --> 00:14:46.390
started with that positivity of my mother and,

301
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.450
and the duration of the many different things I've done done since then.
