WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.510
I mean,
it is a bad thing that the loser wins.
I mean,

2
00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:06.300
that's just not the way an election supposed to work.

3
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:10.400
So that's happened twice in our lifetime.
Yeah.
Um,
and uh,

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.990
it happened to a hundred years before that and it's going to happen more

5
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:15.630
frequently going forward.
We can show that demographically,

6
00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:20.490
but that's not the real problem.
The real problem is that in every election,

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.170
the presidential candidates are focused on just 14 states.

8
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:27.060
The battleground states,
the purple states,

9
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.570
and those 14 states are the only states that matter to those candidates.
And,

10
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.870
and what scholars have demonstrated as the presidents and campaigns bend

11
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:40.230
themselves and their policies to make those states happy.

12
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.910
And those states don't represent America.
They're older,
they're wider,

13
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.310
they're industry has kind of 19th century industry.

14
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.060
There are seven and a half times the number of people in America working in

15
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:53.490
solar energy as mine coal.

16
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.390
But you never hear about solar energy and a presidential campaign because those

17
00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:59.130
people live in California and Texas.

18
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.530
They don't matter to the presidential election.

19
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.280
What you hear about his coal mining because the 50,000 coal miners left in

20
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:07.920
America happened to live in these battleground states.

21
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.220
So this is just a product of the way the electoral college or the way states

22
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.370
count their votes to allocate their electors.

23
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.140
Something called the winner take all system.

24
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.680
So all but two states say that the winner of the popular vote gets all of the

25
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:29.580
electoral votes for that state.
So,
you know,
in 2000 in Florida,
um,

26
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.640
George Bush won that state based on a stop to recount by 531 votes.

27
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.400
Uh,
he got all the electoral college votes in that state,

28
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.830
even though he just barely won that state.

29
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.540
And so winner take all is what makes it so that it doesn't make sense for

30
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:46.650
anybody to stay,

31
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.120
pay any intention to any of the non battleground states and Penn all of your

32
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:53.100
time in the battleground states in 2016,

33
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.200
99% of campaign spending was in 14 states,
90,

34
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.590
99%,
95% of time.

35
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.120
But the only reason they were not 99% in those battleground states is the other

36
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:09.210
5% they were in New York and California raising money.
Right?
So,

37
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.280
so this is a system designed to give power to these battleground states.

38
00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:18.540
And then you say,
well,
why is it something the constitution requires?

39
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.330
And the answer to that is absolutely not.

40
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.780
The constitution does not say how the states will allocate their electors.

41
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.673
And indeed,

42
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.330
when states started adopting this winner take all system,

43
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.180
many thought it was an outrageous perversion of the constitutional design.

44
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.830
So Jeff to Jefferson was outraged.
But then he said,
well,

45
00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:43.020
some states are going to do it,
then all states have to do it.

46
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:47.400
Because if you're a state that allocates all of your electrodes to the winter,

47
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:50.790
you're going to have more power than your neighboring state can only get half

48
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:53.880
the electrodes to the winner.
So very quickly there was a race to the bottom,

49
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:55.350
and that's kind of where it's stuck.

50
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.140
And so the question is about what we can do about it.
Well,

51
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:01.060
they're too big reform efforts out there.

52
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.180
One of them's called the national popular vote compact.
I mean,
I should say,

53
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:09.070
you know,
you can imagine amending the constitution,

54
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:12.790
but it takes three fourths of the states to change the constitution.

55
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:16.000
And three fourths of the states are not going to agree with abolishing the

56
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:16.661
electoral college.

57
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:19.450
So this is not going to happen anytime soon in through the constitution.

58
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.900
But there are two ways.
Without amending the constitution,

59
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.790
we could fix this problem.
Won The national popular vote pro,
uh,

60
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.940
compact is basically states who say,
look,

61
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:32.080
we're going to pledge our electors to the winner of the national popular vote.

62
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.160
So,
um,

63
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.380
the state looks at who won the national popular vote and then picks the slate of

64
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:42.940
electors from their state with the party of the person who won the national

65
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:45.460
popular vote.
So in a state like New York,

66
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.550
if the Republican won the national popular vote,

67
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:50.470
even though most people in New York and democratic,

68
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:54.490
they would allocate their electrodes to the Republican,
vice versa.
In Texas,

69
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.660
that's,
that's the way that system would work.
And you know,

70
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:01.450
I personally like the system because I believe in the idea of one person,

71
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:01.811
one vote.

72
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:04.750
Everybody's vote is an American citizen for the American president should be

73
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:05.584
equal.
It shouldn't,

74
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.320
shouldn't matter that you're having to live in Wyoming versus Pennsylvania

75
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:10.710
versus a New York.
Um,

76
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.720
but there are people who are worried about this because they fear that it will

77
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:15.520
become a kind of fly over democracy.

78
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.580
But the only places that candidates will care about will be places like la or

79
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:24.910
New York or Chicago.
I actually don't think that's right,

80
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:26.110
but I get the understanding,

81
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.120
I think they're wrong about the way the campaigns work,

82
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:29.650
but I understand why they're anxious about it.

83
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.460
So then that leads to the alternative solution,
which is something,
you know,

84
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.440
my group equal citizens.
Dot Us is litigating this right now.
Um,

85
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.440
we're just trying to declare this winner take all system,

86
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.920
violates the constitution because it basically says that if you're a Republican

87
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.950
in California,
your vote never matters.
If you're a Democrat in Texas,

88
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.640
your vote never matters because we just count your vote up and then we throw it

89
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:59.641
away because we allocate all the electors to the dominant party in your state.

90
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.130
And so we've got,
um,
David Boies is our chief litigator.

91
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:07.540
We've got a case in California,
Texas,
South Carolina,

92
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:11.590
and Massachusetts asking the courts to declare a winner take all

93
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:15.280
unconstitutional and instead say that electrode have to be allocated

94
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.520
proportionally.
So if you get 40% of the vote in the state,

95
00:05:18.521 --> 00:05:22.120
you get 40% of the electors.
If you get 50%,
you get 50% of the doctors.

96
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.720
And what that would do overnight is it would make every state in the nation

97
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.553
competitive.

98
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.000
Like there'd be a reason for a Democrat to go to Texas because you're not going

99
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:35.750
to get all the electoral votes.
You're hiking,

100
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.770
you're going to have the electoral votes,
but you'll get 40%,

101
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.440
maybe 45% and that could matter.
Um,

102
00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:44.620
or a Republican would go to California because you know,

103
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.480
you're not going to get all the votes in California,

104
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.840
but you're going to get a lot.
There are a lot of Republicans in California.
Um,

105
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.560
so this change would immediately make every state in play.

106
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.220
But unlike the national popular vote alternative,

107
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.410
there are many people who look at this and say this would be better because

108
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.840
small states would still have a pretty important role,

109
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:05.360
like an elector as an elector.
And if I can get it from Arizona,

110
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:07.640
I'm going to care about Arizona.
If I can get it from Arkansas,

111
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.320
care about Arkansas.
Um,

112
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:13.100
so it's not going to just be the big states are the big population centers.

113
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:16.550
It's going to be every state.
And so if we can get,
you know,

114
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:19.640
a court to say this violates the constitution,
um,

115
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.090
then you can have states forest to allocate their electors proportionally.

116
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.810
And if they did that,
then the problem that you identified at the start,

117
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:32.930
which I think is the problem,
could be solved overnight.

118
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.260
You would no longer have these battleground states deciding everything you'd

119
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:39.230
ever president who cares about getting elected by all of America.

120
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:43.970
And that would be an incredible improvement though that seems like in and of

121
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:46.870
itself would be a game changer.
Yes.
If they could do that,

122
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.990
that would change a lot.
But one of the things that you said,
uh,

123
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.800
you said you don't think that it's possible that we would ever vote out the

124
00:06:54.801 --> 00:06:58.610
electoral college,
but is there support for the Electoral College?

125
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.490
Is there a good argument for it?
Um,

126
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.600
so there is support for the idea that every state have a role and there's this

127
00:07:09.551 --> 00:07:12.830
support for the idea that small states get to kind of thumb on the scale,

128
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.220
which is what the electoral college does.
So there is some support it,

129
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.810
but most people,
you know,

130
00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:22.811
70% of people don't like the idea that the president is not chosen from the

131
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:26.960
majority of voters vote.
Right.
So most people would oppose it.

132
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:29.150
But the point is to change the constitution,

133
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.740
you need the state legislatures or state conventions to agree with the change.

134
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.380
And what many states,
at least 13 states I fear would say is that,
you know,

135
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.880
we actually win more under this system,
then we lose.
Yeah.

136
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.300
So we're not going to change the system.
Uh,

137
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:51.320
and so unless you get like some overwhelmingly popular movement to support it,

138
00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:52.320
or again,
you know,

139
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.670
you can imagine a presidential candidate who kind of made fixing this part of

140
00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:57.690
the democracy part of the plan too.

141
00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.980
I don't see how you're going to build a political movement to get there.

142
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.060
Another way of putting it,
as you know,
this national popular vote compact,

143
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.620
which is going around state to state and getting states to join right now has

144
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:10.400
about a hundred.

145
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.400
And so the way this works is that when the equivalent of 270 electoral votes

146
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.950
have been committed,
then the compact kicks in.

147
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.580
So when they get to 270,
the problem goes,
oh,
you know,

148
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:24.200
the problem of this electoral college goes away.

149
00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:26.720
We'll kind of add to 70 according to the plan,

150
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.330
the winner of the popular vote wins the electoral college.

151
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:34.160
They right now have 172 electors pledged,
right?

152
00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:35.750
So they have less than a hundred more to go.

153
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.770
But the problem is they've got to convince states to join the compact and

154
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:43.280
they're kind of,

155
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.760
they kind of hit this red wall now because many Republicans thing,

156
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.760
the only way to win the presidency is through the electoral college.
Now,

157
00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:52.550
so many state legislatures,
why do they believe that?

158
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.800
I think many Republicans just think that,
uh,

159
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.290
they're great benefit is from the electoral college.

160
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.800
It's not surprising because the battle ground states are primarily Republican

161
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.810
because the base number of Republican states is so high,
right?
Because,
um,

162
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.061
you know,

163
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:11.061
these small rural states get disproportionally more electors then states like

164
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:12.400
California.
So you know,

165
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.260
Wyoming has three electors disproportionate in terms of the population,
right?

166
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.130
So they liked the system as it is.
And you know,
you look back and you say,
well,

167
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:21.240
they got George Bush,

168
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.420
even though he didn't win the national vote and they got Donald Trump,

169
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:25.680
even though he didn't win the national vote,

170
00:09:25.681 --> 00:09:29.400
it's not hard for to understand why they're there.
I think,
again,

171
00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:31.650
I don't think they're right about this.
You know,

172
00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:36.651
in 2004 if 50,000 votes had switched to John Kerry in Ohio,

173
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.950
then John Kerry would have won the electoral college,
but lost the popular vote.

174
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.880
And if that had happened in 2004,
I think the electoral college,

175
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:51.990
we'd be dead today really because a Republican won in 2000,
uh,

176
00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:55.320
Democrat Ron in 2004 people would say,
this system is just crazy.

177
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.260
We got to get rid of this system.
But now people think,
well,

178
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.140
Republicans benefit from this.
So I'm a a Republican,

179
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:03.180
I'm going to block the change.
And if that's true,

180
00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:06.630
then it's never going to happen at a constitutional level because the

181
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:10.350
constitution requires three fourths of the states to support the reform and the

182
00:10:10.351 --> 00:10:13.230
reinforcement of the does that Donald Trump won without having the popular ones.

183
00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:16.540
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you know,
of course,
nothing,

184
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.320
there's no hypocrisy that touches this president.

185
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:23.280
But remember in 2012 when,
um,

186
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.600
there was a moment for about 10 minutes when the national media was reporting

187
00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:31.260
that,
uh,
that Romney was going to win the popular vote,

188
00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:34.230
but Barack Obama was going to be elected by the electoral college.

189
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.760
Trump started tweeting vigorously about how this is a denial of democracy.

190
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:42.690
We have to march on Washington to end this banana republic like system,

191
00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:45.120
because the electoral college was the worst possible thing in the world.

192
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.960
And of course,
after 2016 he had different views about the electoral college.
