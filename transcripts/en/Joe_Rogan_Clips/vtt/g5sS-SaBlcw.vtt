1
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.850
Gear for La.
So let's find the one that we disagree on.

2
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.870
I think you believe the official story of the JFK assassination.

3
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:14.790
Do you more or less?
Yeah,
more or less.
My belief,
and this is um,

4
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.590
this,
uh,
changes over time.
I think that Lee Harvey Oswald was in on it.

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.300
I think he was a part of it,

6
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.900
but I think there were multiple people that were in on it.
That's what I believe.

7
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:26.760
Do you think the multiple shooters?
Yes.

8
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.760
And the one of the reasons why I believe that is because of the formation of the

9
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:33.870
single bullet theory and the single bullet theory was formed because the fact

10
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:38.610
that they had to account for one bullet that hit the underpass ricocheted off

11
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:40.980
and put some man in the hospital.
Um,

12
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.250
and that before that they did not have an explanation for why all of these

13
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:49.620
bullets bullet holes,
all these wounds.

14
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.210
We're in all these different people's bodies.

15
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.960
The other reason why I'm inclined to believe there's a conspiracy was the fact

16
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:58.800
that they found that bullet on Connolly's Gurney when they brought him into the

17
00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:03.270
hospital.
It's too convenient.
And the bullet itself is fairly pristine.
Now,

18
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:07.260
knowing as much as I know about bullets from personal experience of hunting,

19
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.400
you can't hit anything with a ball.
I pulled a lot of bullets out of animals.

20
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.490
When you shoot an animal and you hit bone,
those bullets,

21
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.070
they distort brutally.
I mean,
they don't look like that.

22
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.780
If they go through to people and hit all sorts of bone,

23
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.130
that's the bullet that came out of Connolly's body or Connolly's Gurney,

24
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:29.730
excuse me.
And that's the bullet that they're attributing to this,

25
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:31.640
a single bullet theory.
Uh,

26
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.120
if you look at the path of the bullet that goes through Connolly or goes through

27
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:39.330
Kennedy and then goes through Conley,
that to me is,

28
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.220
is not unbelievable.

29
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.580
It's not unbelievable that what it is that you've got to look at the other one,

30
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.830
but even that one,
but no,
no.
See what I'm saying?

31
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.990
Even that one is not unbelievable.

32
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.130
It is believable to me because I know that bullets do strange things when they

33
00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:53.720
hit things.

34
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.260
<v 1>Right.
But you,</v>

35
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.430
you got to combine that with the fact that the bullet came out fairly pristine,

36
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.100
which meant it didn't actually go through a kind of a bouncy path light that it

37
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:05.250
went through a straight path.
This diagram is from a conspiracy theorist,

38
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.320
but essentially,
yes.

39
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.270
But the other diagrams that will show the actual path with him,
you know,

40
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.550
they've got them the butts,
they're on the same level and you know,
that uh,

41
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.130
Kennedy was actually sitting here was elevated.
Yes.
Yes.

42
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.040
<v 0>So,
um,
see if we can find one that has,
uh,</v>

43
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.060
the actual seating arrangement or more accurate seating.
The,
well,

44
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:25.520
the one right there with the red line and the right hand side,

45
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.710
the one on the right hand side,
that's a more accurate,
um,
from above,
from above.

46
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.720
Yeah.
There's,
there's also the,
the fact that there was particles,

47
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.780
there was more metallic particles from the bullets,

48
00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:41.570
more fragments from the bullet in Conley's body.

49
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.190
Then we're missing from the bullet.
I do not believe that was the bullet.

50
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:48.680
And I think that that is a very reasonable assumption.

51
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.500
<v 1>Well,
you know what you should do?
You should get one of those guns.</v>

52
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.990
Get the same bullets.
Okay.
Some ballistic dummies,

53
00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:56.720
which some bones inside and start shooting.
They've already done that.
Yeah.

54
00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:58.300
The Penn and teller did that.
Yeah.

55
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.350
Some people have it and they have found pretty close to what actually have

56
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.970
<v 0>no,
they did within,
within the rounds.
No,
no.</v>

57
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.400
Every bullet that hit bone got distorted.
That's just what happens.

58
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.010
The you and the shoot those bullets into water or you shoot those bullets until

59
00:03:13.011 --> 00:03:14.430
like fluff or something like that,

60
00:03:14.431 --> 00:03:17.910
that doesn't have a lot of impact to slow the bullet down.

61
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.360
Then you get a bullet that looks like that.
If you shoot a bullet into bone,

62
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.540
they distort wildly where the bone was,
the last thing that it hit,

63
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.140
but it doesn't matter.
It's still hitting bone.
But he stopped to that point.
Yeah.

64
00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:31.260
But I mean,
didn't it hit bone in,
in Kennedy's body as well?

65
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.460
<v 1>MMM.
[inaudible]</v>

66
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.810
<v 0>the odds of it hitting only soft tissue and it's going to go through his neck.</v>

67
00:03:38.811 --> 00:03:41.840
And he came out here that didn't clip one of his vertebrae or something like

68
00:03:41.841 --> 00:03:46.610
that.
I don't think that's real.
I think also there's a difference between,

69
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.720
and this is fact from David Lifton's book best evidence,

70
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.770
which was a book by a,
an accountant to went over,
um,

71
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.630
the Warren Commission report and found all these factual inaccuracies and all

72
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.520
these,
um,
uh,
contradictions.

73
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.710
He found that there was a difference in the autopsy report at Bethesda,
Maryland,

74
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.480
the feds,
the naval hospital versus the,
uh,
the show.

75
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.540
What they had reported on the scene in Dallas,

76
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.860
the first doctors that got ahold of Kennedy's body in Dallas before they flew

77
00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:23.000
him to Bethesda,
said that the hole in his neck was an entry wound.

78
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.550
When they got to Maryland,
they changed that to a tracheotomy hole.

79
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.560
They changed the,
the impact and they said that it was a,

80
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.140
they said that this was not an impact from a bullet,

81
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.490
that it was from something else.

82
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.780
<v 1>Yeah.
Someone said they enlarge the hole.
Insert a trek cube.
Yeah.</v>

83
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.520
Well,
I think,

84
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.860
<v 0>well there was,
uh,</v>

85
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.080
there was also a lot of pressure on these people to try to wrap this up nice and

86
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:52.510
tight and say that Lee Harvey Oswald was the shooter.

87
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.180
<v 1>There was,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
There's this big thing about the CIA,</v>

88
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.630
the CIA inventing the,
uh,
the FBI,

89
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.170
the FBI will inventing the term conspiracy theory.
He was a CIA thing.

90
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.430
I think it was the CIA.
Yeah.

91
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.380
And this was a couple of years after the assassination.
They,
uh,

92
00:05:09.381 --> 00:05:11.980
there was a memo that went out where they were concerned about all this

93
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.470
conspiracy theorists that were coming out and they used the term conspiracy

94
00:05:15.471 --> 00:05:18.560
theories and,
and they,
they said they should try to,
uh,

95
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.360
basically debunk them and yeah.
Make the people who,
uh,

96
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.040
spread them around look like a conspiracy theorist.
Basically.

97
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.300
The theory is that the term conspiracy theory came from,
uh,

98
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.800
that particular memo,
but that memo,

99
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.180
they never actually encourage people to use the term.
Uh,
but yeah,

100
00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:43.181
there was a huge concern from the CIA that they would be,

101
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.250
they would lose the trust of the public if people,

102
00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:48.830
everybody started believing that it was a conspiracy theory.

103
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.560
At least that's what they said.
I mean,

104
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.900
maybe there is a conspiracy and maybe they are just trying to cover it up.
But

105
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.290
<v 0>did you see the most recent dump of a information,</v>

106
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.880
the Kennedy assassination that Jack Ruby had stated to people that before the

107
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:03.440
day of the Kennedy assassination,

108
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.580
keep an eye out today that's going to be fireworks.
I didn't say that.
Yeah,

109
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.170
those Jack Ruby who eventually wound up shooting Lee Harvey Oswald in front of

110
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.004
the police officer.

111
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.380
<v 1>Yeah.
But you know,
something like that,
you know,
this is dead obviously.</v>

112
00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:20.320
Say you kept asking him what he actually meant,
uh,

113
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.030
and things like that take on a special significance after an event.
True.

114
00:06:25.031 --> 00:06:27.910
Whereas he could be just talking about it like he was going to go visit his ex

115
00:06:27.911 --> 00:06:31.540
wife or something or he was going to go to the bar or he was looking forward to

116
00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:34.420
shouting at the parade or whatever.
Could have been nothing.

117
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.090
People say things and you know,
after something happens,

118
00:06:37.091 --> 00:06:40.270
people go back and they look at everything that happened and then they say,
well,

119
00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:44.590
that sounds like something significant.
Right?
Like with the Vegas shooting,
uh,

120
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.690
there was a woman walking around the crowd in the Vegas shooting,
uh,
saying,

121
00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:52.300
you know,
you're all going to die.
This,
this is what some people said,

122
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.080
and this was like half an hour before the actual shooting itself.

123
00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.390
So people take that event and then,
you know,
since a lot of people did die,

124
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.200
they think that this woman actually knew what was going to happen and she was

125
00:07:05.201 --> 00:07:08.700
trying to warn people.
Right.
But you also get crates,

126
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.680
people wandering around saying things all the time,
especially in Vegas.

127
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.060
<v 0>Yeah.
And the,
the problem with you're all going to die is that,</v>

128
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.170
that's a common one.

129
00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:21.070
Some guy was yelling that we took pictures of him when we were in Vegas long

130
00:07:21.071 --> 00:07:25.570
before the shooting.
It was a few months ago.
Um,
we were,
uh,

131
00:07:25.571 --> 00:07:27.970
standing,
no,
we were in a car.

132
00:07:27.971 --> 00:07:30.910
He was standing on the corner and he had a stack of signs.

133
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.510
I put it up on my Instagram.
I know I did because there was many,

134
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.020
there was stacks of signs.
He had not just one sign.

135
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:42.130
He had like a long totem pole of signs with all these different things and I was

136
00:07:42.131 --> 00:07:45.160
taking photos of it and the guy was yelling out,
everyone's going to die.

137
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.210
I mean he was yelling it out that you know God's wrath and all this,

138
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.740
you know crazy religious stuff.

139
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.950
That's a common thing for Christ's people to shout.
Yes.
What they do shout,

140
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.880
it's not like this woman was saying specifically someone's going to shoot

141
00:07:57.881 --> 00:08:01.750
everyone at this concert,
get out of here.
This is a dangerous area.

142
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.240
If she was trying to well and then she would have been a bit more specific.
Yes,

143
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.830
very specific.
Right.
If she knew something.
Do you see that?
Do you find it?
No,

144
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.320
it's,
I know I put it up there cause we were mocking it.

145
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:15.280
Maybe I put it on my Instagram story and it went away.
I don't think so though.

146
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.640
I think it's,
it's there from,
I want to say,

147
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.130
I want to say it was at least six months ago,

148
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.710
but we were mocking this guy cause I like this guy.

149
00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:26.140
I've got a lot of fucking signs.
Like one side's not enough.

150
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.860
I go was this is the guy,
this is the reason why Twitter only has 140 characters.

151
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.090
Motherfuckers like this.

152
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.030
I think I remember it was like July cause there's like 120 degrees out too,

153
00:08:34.031 --> 00:08:38.770
wasn't it?
Yes,
it was very hot.
This goofy ass hole had this giant stack of signs.

154
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.600
Um,
so the,
the back to the Kennedy family,
what do you think happened?

155
00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:46.120
Do you think the Lee Harvey Oswald probably acted alone?

156
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.150
<v 1>I think it probably acted alone.
I think led the physics of what happened,</v>

157
00:08:49.151 --> 00:08:53.560
like is fairly consistent with,
uh,
the single shooter theory.

158
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.440
Now admittedly the

159
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.140
<v 0>magic bullet is a bit strange,</v>

160
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:03.570
but I don't think it's out of the rounds of possibilities.
Uh,
I do.
Yeah.

161
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.370
Because of the fact the metal particles,

162
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.640
there's more bullet fragments in Connolly's body.

163
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:11.130
Then we're missing from that almost pristine bullet.

164
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.000
And even though the fact that it hit Connolly at the very end,

165
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.640
if it went through all that flesh and it didn't hit any bone until it hit his

166
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:23.550
wrist,
then it would not have been compromised very much.

167
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:26.010
Ballistically it would still be going incredibly fast.

168
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.720
It still would have smashed into that bone.

169
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:30.980
It did enough to break his wrist and it would have distorted the bullet.

170
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.270
That's just what happens with bullets.
See,
unfortunately,

171
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:36.450
I didn't really follow JFK conspiracy very much.

172
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.900
And the reason I don't is that they're already like,

173
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.910
I think literally over a thousand books I've read,
I've read a few.

174
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.940
Um,
I got into case closed.

175
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.650
That was a Vincent Bugliosi.
His book is out who it was,
but I was like,

176
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:56.100
this guy has got an agenda.
It just didn't,
it.
There's,

177
00:09:56.101 --> 00:10:00.870
there's many books that you could read,
uh,
about the Kennedy assassination.

178
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:05.280
And some of them favor the conspiracy and some of them favor the assassination.

179
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.820
I think they have a lot of them have merit on both sides.

180
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.270
One thing that drives me crazy when people say that you could never make that

181
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:15.420
shot.
That's fucking bullshit.
That's bullshit.

182
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.230
This is why I know it's bullshit because it was only like a couple hundred yards

183
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.050
and like a couple hundred yards shooting at something.

184
00:10:22.051 --> 00:10:24.210
The size of a person's head is easy.

185
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.920
What about just even Chera trying to do the uh,
yeah,

186
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.690
three three shots against three shots off.
He didn't know what he's doing,

187
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.360
but I mean first of all you would,

188
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.660
if you are used to that rifle and you practice that wasn't,
someone said,

189
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.600
oh the scope was off.
I think that's bullshit too.

190
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.690
The reason why I think that's bullshit.
It's cause it's easy.
Knock a scope off.

191
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.980
You have to have a direct chain of evidence between the time we Harvey Oswald

192
00:10:46.981 --> 00:10:49.050
had that scope shooting that rifle.

193
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.850
The moment he shot that rifle and then you have to hand it off to someone who

194
00:10:53.851 --> 00:10:58.380
checks the scope right then because if you drop an rifle,
the scope goes off.

195
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.060
Just drop it.
I've done that before.

196
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.870
I dropped a rifle once when I was hunting in Wisconsin and my scope was off by

197
00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:06.870
six inches at a hundred yards just dropping it.

198
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.170
So the idea that he could have never made that shot because the scope is off.

199
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:15.090
Scopes get adjusted.
That's what happens when you drop a scope.
They move.
That's,

200
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.880
that's a whole thing about ballistics.
You have to check them.

201
00:11:17.881 --> 00:11:20.880
You go to the range,
you set up a a lead sled,

202
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:25.260
you lay the rifle down so it's perfectly stable.
You squeeze off a shot,

203
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.650
you use the binoculars,
you find out where the,
the shot hit on the target,

204
00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:30.870
and then you adjust the scope.
They're adjustable.

205
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.630
So the idea that his scope was no good.
It's crazy.

206
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.290
The idea that that shot was too far to make insane.
It was only,

207
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.380
I think it was less than a hundred yards when they think you made the first
shot,

208
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.830
which is a chip shot,
that's a shot that you would make without even arrest.

209
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:48.030
Now he's making this shot resting on the window.
So He's perfectly steady.

210
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.430
The idea that that was impossible as crazy.

211
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:54.610
The idea that no one can do that in three shots.
That's been disproven.

212
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.810
Someone can do it.

213
00:11:55.811 --> 00:12:00.280
Someone who's really good at reloading and loading can do it just because Jesse

214
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.060
Ventura couldn't do it,
but Jesse super conspiracy mind is like,

215
00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:06.280
he goes all in with the conspiracy

216
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:06.810
<v 1>vrs,</v>

217
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:11.190
the motivated reasoning part of things at an NFS doing it just for his show or

218
00:12:11.191 --> 00:12:12.430
because he really believes it.

219
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.820
<v 0>I worked with the same people that did his show,</v>

220
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:18.540
the same people that did his show.
The reason why I did Joe Rogan questions,

221
00:12:18.541 --> 00:12:22.560
everything is they wanted me to take over Jesse show after it was done and I was

222
00:12:22.561 --> 00:12:26.820
uninterested.
I was like,
I'm not going.
I'm not that guy.
I'm not like the,

223
00:12:26.821 --> 00:12:30.330
I believe every conspiracy guy I go,
I think there's people,

224
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:35.190
I think people have a real weird vested interest in proving that things are a

225
00:12:35.191 --> 00:12:36.024
conspiracy.

226
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.140
I'm interested in finding out what things really are like legitimately what they

227
00:12:40.141 --> 00:12:42.900
really are.
Yeah,
and even if I'm wrong,
like I'm,
I have,

228
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:47.490
I'm not interested in reinforcing things.
I've already said,

229
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.900
if I find out that what I said was wrong,
I'm interested in repeating it.

230
00:12:51.901 --> 00:12:55.110
I was wrong as many times as I can to get it out to as many people as I can.

231
00:12:55.111 --> 00:12:58.740
Yeah,
I'm with you because I think it's important.
So this,
this JFK thing,

232
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.570
there's bullshit on both sides of it,

233
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.740
but the idea that this guy who went over to Russia,
married a Russian citizen,

234
00:13:04.741 --> 00:13:09.630
came back here was,
I mean,
I mean he was absolutely involved in some shady,

235
00:13:09.631 --> 00:13:13.440
weird shit with Cuba.
He's a fucking weird guy.
Like we have you,

236
00:13:13.441 --> 00:13:16.440
Oswald was a weird guy.
The idea that he was completely innocent.

237
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.790
I'm not buying that either.

238
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:18.660
<v 1>I,
yeah.</v>

239
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:23.660
I don't buy the idea that it's proven that he acted entirely alone.

240
00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:27.780
It's entirely possible that the other people who were like helping him or a

241
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.780
motivating you him or giving him the instructions even.
Yeah.
Uh,
the thing I,

242
00:13:31.781 --> 00:13:35.230
I don't think it's really proven is the additional shooter theory.

243
00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:36.440
<v 0>It's not proven.</v>

244
00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:39.140
And there have been people that said they heard things from behind them.

245
00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.820
The problem with that is chaos.
When you have gun shots,
first of all,

246
00:13:43.821 --> 00:13:47.510
gun shots and an area like at Dealey Plaza,
the echos.
Yeah.

247
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.800
Echos ring out and people claim to see things and hear things and they even

248
00:13:51.801 --> 00:13:56.801
believe themselves have you tell someone that you heard something in the bushes

249
00:13:56.871 --> 00:14:00.530
and then you run away.
That person will say,
I heard something in the bushes,

250
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:04.370
and then other people were repeated.
It becomes the narrative and it just gets,

251
00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.380
it's real hard.
Create Memories.
