1
00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.201
And to let,

2
00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:05.290
wanted to know what's the word for things that do get better when you're knocked

3
00:00:05.291 --> 00:00:08.610
them over.
And the classic example is the immune system.

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.640
So the immune system is an incomplete system.

5
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:15.000
It's a miracle of evolution that we have this system for making,
you know,

6
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:19.380
antibodies.
Um,
but it doesn't know exactly what to be reactive to.

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.420
That has to be set by childhood experience.

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.640
And so if you keep your kids in a bubble and you use bacterial wipes and you

9
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:30.090
don't let them be exposed to bacteria,
you're crippling the system.

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.000
The system has to get knocked over.
It has to get challenged,
threatened.

11
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:37.380
It has to have a test to learn how to,
uh,
expand its abilities.

12
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.240
And so,
um,
so this is why peanut allergies are going up.
Yeah,

13
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.410
that was a really shocking part of your book.
That's right.

14
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:46.540
It's stunning how fast this happened.
Please explain that to people.
The,

15
00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:48.570
the whole peanut allergy thing.
Yeah.

16
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:52.470
So peanut allergies used to be really rare and most of us older folk,

17
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:55.290
we brought peanut butter sandwiches to school.
Uh,

18
00:00:55.291 --> 00:01:00.220
and when my son Max started preschool in 2008,
you know,

19
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.310
they went on and on about no nuts,

20
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.320
nothing that touched and not nothing that looks like a nut,

21
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:05.330
nothing that has the word nutty.

22
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.890
I mean it was crazy how defensive they were about nuts.

23
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.760
And as we write in the book,
I thought back on that and I said,
wait a second,

24
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.580
like why?
You know,
we're freaking out about nuts.

25
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.730
And the more we freak out about it,
the higher the allergy rate goes.

26
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.850
And it turns out there was a study done and published in 2015 where um,
the,

27
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the researchers noticed that the allergy to nuts is only going up in countries

28
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.190
that tell pregnant women to avoid nuts.
And they thought,
well maybe that's why.

29
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.500
And so they did a controlled experiment.

30
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:39.501
They got about 600 women who had given birth recently and ha and whose kids were

31
00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:45.020
at higher risk of analogy cause they had Eczema or some other,
you know,

32
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.230
immune system sort of issue.

33
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.270
So about 300 of them are told standard advice,
your kids at risk,

34
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:52.170
the peanut allergy,

35
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.670
so you should not eat peanuts while you're lactating and keep peanuts wait from

36
00:01:56.671 --> 00:02:01.440
your kid.
And the other half were told,
here is an Israeli snack food.

37
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:05.700
It's a popcorn with a peanut,
a peanut powder dusting on the outside,

38
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.410
give it to your kids,
starting at,
you know,

39
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:10.290
three or four months or whenever they're ready to eat.
And so,

40
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:12.360
and they monitor them,
they made sure that they weren't,
you know,

41
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.830
fatal reactions or sewer or strong reactions.
And then,
uh,
at the age of five,

42
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:19.410
they gave them all a very thorough immunological test.

43
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.540
And of the ones who followed the standard advice,
17% had a peanut allergy.

44
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.060
They would have to watch out for peanuts for the rest of their lives.

45
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.490
That's just such a high number because these were,

46
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.780
because these were kids who are already predisposed and but the half that were

47
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:36.570
predisposed but give in peanut powder,

48
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.700
3% just 3% had a peanut allergy at age five.
In other words,

49
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:46.080
we could almost wipe out peanut allergies by giving peanut powder to kids.

50
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.450
And it just a few months ago in science,

51
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:52.110
the front page article was on doing that.
And so again,

52
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.260
good intentions and bad ideas.
We're trying to protect our kids soap.
Oh,

53
00:02:55.261 --> 00:02:56.071
keep them away from peanuts.

54
00:02:56.071 --> 00:03:00.040
But that's exactly the wrong advice because kids are antifragile and so we're

55
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:01.950
doing the same thing.
Most of them,
they were,

56
00:03:01.951 --> 00:03:04.400
the real issue was the people that have an actual severe allergy,

57
00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:06.430
if that's your child.
Yes.

58
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:11.230
But that's what this science article was about was that a exposure therapies are

59
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:13.450
being tested and they are the most effective.

60
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:16.300
So even with people would you just have to start slow.

61
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.670
So you just give them a very small,
exactly.
Yeah.

62
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.780
Cause I was on a plane once and they informed us that they didn't want us to

63
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:26.680
even eat peanuts on the plane because there was someone on the plane that was so

64
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:30.700
allergic,
right.
That if you eat peanuts and you chew it and it's in the air,

65
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.310
it could adversely affect that person.
Yeah.
And that could well be true.

66
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:34.810
So I have no objection to that.

67
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.650
But the reason we got to that point is because we started banning peanuts long

68
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:39.070
ago.
