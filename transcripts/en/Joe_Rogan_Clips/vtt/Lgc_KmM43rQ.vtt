1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.200
Turn off the bullshit.
Cut the bullshit.
Just get to the weeds of that.
You are,

2
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.910
you are fucking yourself up by not examining your brain.

3
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.600
You're not examining your brain message it,
that's done.

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.910
You examine your fucking brain.

5
00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:19.480
And that takes some hard work and suffering if you're not willing to do that.

6
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.310
I'm sorry.
And it seems like there's no way to do that as a bystander.
No,

7
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.070
you can't watch it,
man.
You gotta get out there and like,
oh,
this hurts.

8
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.610
This hurts real fucking bad.
I don't think this is smart.

9
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.930
And then guess what happens?
The body will adjust.

10
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.250
It will adjust.
And if that goes well,
then the next question I get,

11
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.040
but as your time when it doesn't,
the judge,
what the fuck?

12
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.140
I get some of the stupidest shit man.
Like don't,

13
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.620
don't take with a grain of fucking salt people.

14
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.170
Those questions that people that are wanting to quit.
Yes,
yes.

15
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.410
And that's what I say.
When should I quit yet that God,

16
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.070
did you ever like feel like no,
shut the fuck out.
Stop.
Stop.

17
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.110
I don't want to be like that.
There's always that next question.
No,
don't take it.

18
00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:08.650
Like go out there and run through a brick walls many times as you can.
No,

19
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.800
I'm not saying be me.
Don't run towards him five miles at one time.

20
00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:15.310
Not saying do that.
I'm saying start to learn.

21
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.170
The mind is powerful.
It's powerful,
man.
It's,
it's unbelievable.

22
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.680
<v 1>But if people need,
they need a thing to get them going,
right?</v>

23
00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:29.060
They need a thing,
right?
I need a goal they need,
they need a like,

24
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.170
it's sometimes the first step is the hardest.

25
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.660
Like it's hard to take that 1 million step two.

26
00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:37.870
But sometimes the first step is the mall.
There's something about the,

27
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.420
what do I do?
How do they start going over their phone?
They start calling people.

28
00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:48.421
They don't get out of the house and there's something about procrastination.

29
00:01:50.261 --> 00:01:52.420
It's like,
you know,
it's painful.
You know,

30
00:01:52.421 --> 00:01:55.420
you should be doing things but you just keep doing it.
You keep it

31
00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.370
<v 0>itching.
That scan.
I procrastinate like a motherfucker,</v>

32
00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:02.710
man.
Every day I want to do this shit.

33
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.340
That's what's so funny,
man.

34
00:02:06.341 --> 00:02:09.340
People looking like I'm some damn superhero that came down from the Gods,

35
00:02:09.341 --> 00:02:13.360
from the heavens and earth.
No Man,
I don't want to do this shit.

36
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.500
I'm looking at my shoes for 30 minutes sometimes can man,
fuck man,

37
00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:24.460
people,
people look up to you.
Goggins fucked him.
I want to do the shot.

38
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.620
I'm like,
I want to do this shit man,
but guess what?
You do it.

39
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.840
I'm going to do it as long as you do it.
And that's what I know about it,
man.

40
00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:34.600
That's why I stopped doing.
I'm thinking,
Oh man,
you got to

41
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.460
<v 1>fucking sit here and you look at your shoes for 30 40 minutes.
You Go,</v>

42
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.990
you gotta think about all day long and you go do it anyway.

43
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.540
And sometimes you don't have the time.
I look at issues with 30 minutes.

44
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.600
Those are the,
those are the beautiful days.
Yes.
As you'd know,

45
00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:48.010
you just have to go.
That's right.

46
00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:50.800
And so like there's no room for procrastination.
And that's when I,

47
00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:51.730
when I was in the military,

48
00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:55.950
I love my schedule because I knew I'd be at work at seven o'clock so you got to

49
00:02:55.951 --> 00:02:57.460
get your ass up at four o'clock man.

50
00:02:57.461 --> 00:03:00.070
He had get your shit in brother cause I had to get my shit

51
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.970
<v 0>and before I got my shit in.
Right.
You know,
so that was my mentality back then.</v>

52
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:04.960
Man.
You know,
like I,

53
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.670
I had to get the miles and get everything in man and and get to work.

54
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:12.580
Man.
I'm a competing with the Alpha males,
he said,

55
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:16.300
but how much did that piss other Alpha males off that you were,

56
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.360
you were imposing a very high bar.
I,

57
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.000
I was a very misunderstood human being mouse in the military.

58
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.050
The air force guys liked me a lot.
The Rangers liked me a lot.

59
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.690
So much.
Not The seals because they were with you.
They didn't like me so much,

60
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.450
which is fine,
you know,
I respect him.
I think a lot of them respect.
I've,
I've,

61
00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:40.630
I've a lot of friends in the seal teams so I got to like,

62
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.340
like minded mentalities as me.
It wants to get me.
I grew up and I got over it.

63
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:47.310
A lot of guys still have,
you know,
like they,

64
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.360
a lot of people can't get over the fact of whatever.

65
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.920
When I became a sill recruiter,

66
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.370
a lot of guys thought I wasn't deploying for a lot of reasons and whatnot and

67
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:58.120
they,
I heard a lot.
I was that guy who grinded,

68
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.350
I grind it hard.
I mean I,
I grounded hard.

69
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.690
I was that guy who was up like if we went on an op or we had a,
a workup,

70
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.760
let's say we had a workup,
we're an island,

71
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:13.840
we're out there shooting guns and dual land warfare and we did it to like one

72
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:17.320
o'clock in the fucking morning.
Most everybody go to sleep.

73
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.490
I ain't go to sleep.
I went to the gym,

74
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.680
I worked out or I go sleep and send me to be up at five o'clock I was up at four

75
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:27.760
o'clock and got my hour in.

76
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.630
I made sure to always do that and I did it to a point to where I think it pissed

77
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:38.560
some people off because I,
I want a quiet person.
About it.
You know,
I,
I,

78
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:42.280
uh,
I,
I wasn't the most humble person always,
you know.

79
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:46.570
So when you're on Alpha males,
um,
you're sometimes picking a fight,

80
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.010
you know,
all the time.
And I look different.
I acted different,
I was different.

81
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:54.430
I am different.
And I take a lot of pride in that.
And so,
you know,
if,

82
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.660
if you didn't get after it,

83
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.820
I didn't respect you because I believe that you know where,
where I'm at.

84
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.500
I know that human potential is what we have.
So all we have is what we,

85
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.750
the world sees us a certain way.

86
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.140
And when I saw that people weren't doing that,

87
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.850
I had a funky ass fucking attitude.
And I own it in my book.

88
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.580
I come back from ranger school,
a big time leader.

89
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.930
I was a big time fucking leader,
got honor man out there.
I led by example.

90
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.700
And when I realized a lot of times when you're in these schools,
these schools,

91
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:30.280
people want to graduate these schools because they suck.

92
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.560
They don't want to ever go back to these schools.

93
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.130
Those schools became my fucking life.

94
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.630
People don't want to see your fucking God that wants to go back to day one,

95
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:41.121
week one,

96
00:05:41.121 --> 00:05:44.770
a fucking navy seal training every fucking day of your life and that's how I

97
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:48.550
live and it's a disgusting human being.
I can be.

98
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.920
It is and a lot of people didn't like me a lot.

99
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.960
A lot of fucking people started some stupid shit and started saying this and

100
00:05:55.961 --> 00:05:59.180
that.
The bottom line,
man,
my fucking resume says it all man.

101
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.880
My resumes out there,
guru the motherfucker.

102
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.290
You say whatever you want to say about me,
man.
I missed some diplomas man,

103
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:07.460
for having fucking,
you know,

104
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.990
two heart surgeries and people try to start some rumors.
Shit on me man.

105
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.320
You started rumors.
Shit on me man,

106
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:16.910
because I fucking got the fuck after it and real hard guys like a guy named Hawk

107
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:21.110
I talked to all time.
Yay.
He's a great friend of mine.
When the horse,

108
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:23.840
my first before my heart surgery,
my second heart surgery,

109
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:26.630
I'm going to have Tim Mile Rec room.
If my second heart surgery the day of it,

110
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.710
I'm going to a 10 mile ruck and 50 pounds.
I saw that guy.
He's like,

111
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:33.380
what the fuck are you doing out here?
We get a heart surgeon.
It's Roger,

112
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:36.830
that brother I'm getting in before I'm be out for about six months after the

113
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:37.580
heart surgery.

114
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.810
That was my mentality because I started realizing in a young age we'd always

115
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.860
leaving on the table and once I found out what a human beings capable of,

116
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.330
I didn't know how to control that.
I was,
I was a fucking,

117
00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:53.120
you went to about fucking savage.
That's what that was.

118
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.100
I was a fucking straight up people's talk about savage.

119
00:06:55.101 --> 00:07:00.050
Very likely I was fucking from the back woods,
motherfucking savage dude.

120
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.050
You know,
and at this I was just,
I was,

121
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.580
I told you what I thought I had it.
I ate chips on my shoulder,

122
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.050
I m and a lot of times that wasn't great.

123
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.900
So is it a situation where like with the seals were,

124
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.350
once you've gotten through buds and once you've gotten through all of the

125
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:22.550
physically grueling parts of getting to be accepted,

126
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.810
once you're in,

127
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.920
then you were imposing standards that they didn't want to,

128
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.780
they didn't want to keep up with?
I would say some people,
I had a,

129
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.910
I had one platoon that had the problem with,
you know,
like I like I,
I,

130
00:07:36.911 --> 00:07:40.640
I graduated ranger school and I got in this Petunia and I didn't see out of

131
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:43.850
hockey.
I was in with PT program and you put me in charge,

132
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.710
the PT program is fucking your ass.

133
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.500
And the thing about it is I didn't like it either.

134
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.800
I didn't want to do this shit either man.
But what were you making them do?

135
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.850
Like you know like I it was,
it was some navy,
it was some bud shit.
You know,

136
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:57.080
we went back to bud,
it's like,
you know,

137
00:07:57.081 --> 00:08:01.190
log pts and you know Karen logs over the berms and shit and like I'd had a few

138
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:05.810
like pull ups,
rope climbs,
pull up like for like fucking hour.

139
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.260
So imagine doing rope climb then go over to do like 10 to 15 pull ups coming

140
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:13.400
back.
And we would do like these if they were very hard workouts.

141
00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:17.030
Like there was no like go to the gym,
lift some weights,
type of shit.

142
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.400
And I was imposing my own mentality on everybody.

143
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.380
These are grown ass fucking men.
They know,
you know,

144
00:08:24.381 --> 00:08:26.930
they don't want to be what I'm trying to make them to be.

145
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:31.910
And when they called me off like,
Hey,
you know,
we're not in seal,
you know,

146
00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:35.450
we're not buds anymore.
Goggins it pissed me off and I uh,

147
00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:37.790
and I get a little fucking attitude.
Got,
got my chip and I,

148
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:41.970
I got my ball and meet me and sledge went ahead and started to a workout

149
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.730
together and we developed this like me and sleds workout like fucking garanimals

150
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:48.860
and we had this fucking mentality of fuck yeah,

151
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:52.610
we're getting after it every day and everyone's kind of did their own thing,
man.

152
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.980
And I just,
that's when I started looking at people,
you know,

153
00:08:55.981 --> 00:09:00.330
not just sales but people very differently mad cause I bit in to like,
you know,

154
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:04.020
like to be this special opera.
You,
Gabby,
I have broken legs and these guys,

155
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.550
all those stories.
I was the same guy,
man.
I put people on a pedestal.

156
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.380
I put people like I can never be them.
I can never be that guy,
man.

157
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.110
Never put anybody on a pedestal.
That's what happened to me.

158
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:19.390
I put them on a person once I got up there and with them and I saw him and wants

159
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.430
to get,
not everybody,

160
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.600
some hard motherfuckers out there and do period dot Haar motherfuckers.

161
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.500
I thought every motherfucker was hard.
Yay.

162
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.260
Nay uncommon amongst uncommon men.
That's all it was about for me,
man.

163
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.610
And I took it to another level and I pissed a lot of motherfuckers off and they

164
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:41.450
were trying to find chinks in my armor.
Then they were there.

165
00:09:41.451 --> 00:09:45.090
They were trying to find chinks in the armor.
You know,
all he does is run.

166
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.990
All he does is fucking run.
That's why,
you know.
But once again,

167
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:51.390
that's what we talked about,
the military too much.
Like I said,

168
00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:55.080
the Air Force love me.
The army guys I worked with love me,
the ranger school,

169
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:59.670
all that stuff love me and I wasn't,
you know,
it says where it is,
man.

170
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.260
It's a,
I was part of the navy seals I was at.
I was a team guy,

171
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.180
but I wasn't part of the Brotherhood and that's just me,
man.
That's just me.

172
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.700
It ain't say nothing bad about them.
I got a lot of love for a lot of them.
Love,

173
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.330
I'm in,
got love from me.
Bank of talk bad about them is this.
I'm different.

174
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.080
It definitely,

175
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.760
I figured out I'm different from everybody in the fucking world and I had to own

176
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:26.730
that and say,
you know what man,
you made a lot of fucking mistakes being,

177
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:31.260
it's being who you are.
And I should have been more of a leader at times,

178
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.810
but a lot of towns,
a lot of people should have been a little bit harder to.

179
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.910
<v 1>So was it that some of those guys just didn't want to work as hard or was it</v>

180
00:10:37.911 --> 00:10:41.240
this that they were,
they weren't appreciating how competitive you were,

181
00:10:41.241 --> 00:10:43.550
you were always against them.
Is that what it was?

182
00:10:43.551 --> 00:10:47.540
That it did it Disney foster the sense of brotherhood because you are more like

183
00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:48.374
come on pussy.

184
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.030
<v 0>I,
I didn't really call them pussies,</v>

185
00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:54.570
but you can look at my face and I looked at you and in,
you know,
you can,

186
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:57.780
you can kind of say this,
you know,
so what happens?
I started developing this,

187
00:10:57.781 --> 00:11:02.490
like the separation in our thing about me to mass.
I don't go out,

188
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.720
I don't party.
I don't hang out with the guys.
I don't,
you know,

189
00:11:06.721 --> 00:11:10.850
so I was always forming this kind of separation.
I'm a,

190
00:11:10.851 --> 00:11:13.050
I'm a big time introvert,
you know,

191
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.350
I do my job and I don't want to see your fucking ass again.

192
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.410
I'm to go home refreshed and we'll see you again.
You know,

193
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:21.930
you're in a platoon with these guys for two,
two years,

194
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:26.000
sometimes a year and a half.
And I would,
you know,
we work up,
do our shit and I,

195
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.810
I'll just,
I'll just a different fucking cat.
I'm a different cat man.
Like I,
uh,

196
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.910
you know,
I just,
I think differently.
I believe differently.

197
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.720
Um,
I believe strongly in what I believe in.

198
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.151
<v 1>Well,</v>

199
00:11:40.151 --> 00:11:43.660
some people must appreciate the fact that we're self motivated and that you were

200
00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:46.920
pushing the envelope,
that you were pushing this case.
You were setting a high bar

201
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.790
<v 0>bar.
Yeah.
I have a lot of guys right now within the community.
A lot of,</v>

202
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.160
a lot of guys,
once again,
this is like,

203
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.070
it's like a big soap opera sometimes,
man,
when you,
when you,
when,

204
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.570
when you're in a fraternity like that,
that's where it's like,
man,
so I had to,

205
00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.020
I'd get different vantage point,
look at it and see like,
you know,
a lot of guys,

206
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.750
they respect who I was and what I did.
And um,
I,

207
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.980
I brought it fucking hard a lot in every day,

208
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:16.540
but I also rub people the wrong way.
I'm like that,

209
00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:18.950
that you're talking about.
I'm like,
that itch.

210
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.170
You want to scratch the fuck out my ass.
And I said,
you want us like,

211
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:24.400
fuck this dude,
man.
