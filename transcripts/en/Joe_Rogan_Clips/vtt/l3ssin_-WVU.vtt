00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.250
I'll try and get some weird rules where guns,
you guys like have a,

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.400
they bought up all the guns after a mass shooting,
right?
Is that what that,
well,

3
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:12.940
not all of them.
If you were a license holder,
like a shooter,

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.230
you had a shooter's license and you had a reason to have a gun,

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.160
then you can still keep your guns.
So you had to be like a member of a gun.

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.760
I don't own any guns.
But you had to be a member of a gun club.

7
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.010
I don't own any guns in Australia.
Uh,
you had to be a member of a gun club,

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.580
have we'll perhaps permission on a property where you're hunting and stuff like

9
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:36.960
that to keep your guns is that they keep trying to make it tighter and tighter.

10
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:40.860
I think it's tight enough because criminals are going to get what they want.

11
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.860
Right.
You know,
it's like how many people have been killed with a baseball bat?

12
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.760
Fucking heaps.
Are you going to be in baseball bats?

13
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.130
How many people who've been killed with a kitchen knife?

14
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:53.970
You're going to ban kitchen knives.
So I think if you've got a legitimate reason,

15
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:56.760
they have a gun,
you know,
like you don't have a criminal record,

16
00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:58.470
you don't have a mental illness or something like that,

17
00:00:58.471 --> 00:00:59.670
you should have a right to have a gun.

18
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.330
So you do basically do a safety course and training in Australia and if you've

19
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:10.150
got that reason to have a rifle and you can have it,
no semiautomatics um,

20
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.960
there's a bunch of rifles and there's a bunch of guns that you can't have in

21
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:15.630
Australia that's pretty much like bold action lever,
action.

22
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.690
And those rules might've changed as well.
No expert on obviously.

23
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.630
Whereas in America,
every fucking one's got,

24
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.500
like everyone I meet has got a gun.
I've got a gun too,

25
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.540
because if everyone else has got a gun and on a fucking gun to it's true isn't a

26
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:35.280
true and my guns for protection when I go into the Wilderness for bears,

27
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.910
or if I'm fucking in some weed destination and someone comes in and tries to

28
00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:43.620
fucking rape or murder my family,
I'm going to use it.
And uh,
yeah,

29
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:46.260
it's just funny like that.
But it's crazy to think,

30
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:49.950
and I know it changes from place to place that you know anyone could have a gun

31
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.060
because you know,
it's like you're right.
And to a certain degree,

32
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:58.890
I agree with that.
But uh,
as well,
I think you lose that,
right?

33
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:00.120
If you've got a criminal record,

34
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:04.830
you've got a mental illness or something like that,
then fuck yeah,
exactly.

35
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:07.260
We want good guys with guns.
Not Bad guys have guns,

36
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:11.310
but ban on guns isn't going to stop the bad guys from having guns.
So weird.

37
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.920
It's like trying to take p out of the pool.
Yeah.

38
00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:18.630
It's fucking so how when you,

39
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.710
when you hunt in Australia,
you're not allowed to use a bolt action rifle.

40
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.730
You can use a bolt action rifle.
It's like the automatic semi automatic,

41
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.830
I think an ar and ar.
Yeah.
I think pump actions are being taken out now,

42
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:32.910
things like that.
Yeah.
