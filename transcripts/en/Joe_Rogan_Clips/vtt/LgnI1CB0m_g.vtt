1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
Did you do that carnivore diet thing?
Did you try that out?
No.
You did.
No,
no.

2
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:05.401
I like me,

3
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:08.160
but I didn't do the cardboard that you were going to do it for a certain amount

4
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:12.180
of time and test it.
Thought about it too much of a foodie.
I like,

5
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.710
what I did was I tried to eat Ribeye steaks every night for dinner,

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.430
so I did like a 33% carnivore diet,

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.970
but there was a study actually that came out,

8
00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:28.971
it was just like two days ago on that Tmao the sugar that is associated with gut

9
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:34.230
damage when you're eating a high red meat diet,
right.

10
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:38.430
When your body takes excess protein and it turns it into sugar,
right.

11
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.660
With theoretically the idea of being that that might be present because your

12
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:46.710
microbiome is imbalance from a diet that's too heavy and meat.

13
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.920
Is there a microfiber?
It's,
it's because you're buying them.

14
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:54.660
I thought it was just because of glucogenesis because your body has nothing but

15
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:59.610
meet your body.
Turns it into glucose.
No,
that that would be something different.

16
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:04.230
That that conversion of glucose is a different sugar than the Tmao.

17
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.210
Tmao is,

18
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.980
is that's going to be present if you aren't getting enough fiber or if you're

19
00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:11.490
buy on Amazon balanced.

20
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.170
But what this study a couple of days looked at was people who were eating like a

21
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:21.171
fish and egg and plant rich diet and they had high levels of Tmao too,

22
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.910
but they weren't deleterious.

23
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.550
They're actually as of tech because they had the fiber.
Yeah,

24
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.140
and I mean you could do,
you could do a carnivore diet if you are there.

25
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.290
There's a few populations that do this.
Like in,
in Spain,

26
00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:37.740
I forget the name of the sausage,
but they'll like eat the elite,
the ruminant,

27
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.970
like delete the intestine of the ruminant and get their grasses and their fibers

28
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:45.270
and their plants literally by eating the stomach of the animal.
But like a cat.

29
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.170
Yeah.
Yeah.

30
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.670
And it's the same issue with like a [inaudible] too much of the amino acid

31
00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:54.960
methionine from just eating red meat would be deleterious.

32
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:58.110
But if you're getting glycine and some of these other amino acids,

33
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.640
if you're reading like nose to tail,
bone marrow,
bone broth,

34
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.710
all the organ meats,
you know,
head cheese,
Braunschweiger,

35
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.220
just like all of these different mixes of meats.

36
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.220
I think that would be the way to do a cardboard diet.
Yeah.

37
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:13.800
This is a lot of people that are proponents of that as well,

38
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.720
and then there's a bunch of people that are,
you know,

39
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:16.860
it's interesting because you've got to,

40
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.070
there's a disparity between the anecdotal accounts of health and wellbeing and

41
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:26.730
then blood work.
The blood work these folks get is not impressive.

42
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.730
You mean the people on the cardboard?
Yeah.
What I've seen,

43
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.660
I haven't seen anything where I see all their inflammatory markers down their

44
00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:37.710
testosterone up.
I haven't seen anything where it's looking really good.
Yeah,

45
00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:41.280
to High Blood Glucose is another thing that you see what I should say that there

46
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.680
haven't been a lot of tests done.
It's not,

47
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.570
a lot of people are publishing stuff on it,

48
00:02:45.571 --> 00:02:48.990
but the anecdotal evidence is amazing.
It's like it's really weird.

49
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:53.280
Like my friend Jordan Peterson,
he's had a tremendous success with it,

50
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.600
lost a lot of bodyweight.
He says he's in his intellectual prime.

51
00:02:57.601 --> 00:03:01.240
You said he's never felt better in terms of his energy levels and that guy is,

52
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.430
he is so rigid and disciplined with it,

53
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:07.290
always eating his meat with salt on it and he drinks water.
And that is slowly,

54
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.350
well,
if you think about it,
it's an elimination diet.
Yeah,
right.

55
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.860
Just like an autoimmune diet.
Or you can say,
well,
you know,

56
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.880
I don't know what's giving me trouble,
soy or wheat or dairy or what have you,

57
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:22.690
so I'm just going to stop eating all that stuff and switched to primarily meet.

58
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.870
The problem is that it's,
uh,
you know,
I,
I don't want to call anybody out and,

59
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.040
and,
and call them lazy,

60
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:35.041
but it's almost like kind of a very easy lazy s approach because rather than

61
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:38.770
figuring out how to do,
you know,
like that,
that sourdough bread,

62
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.970
it's slow fermented.
The Rye and the wheat are in there,

63
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.200
but all the fight of acid that would normally inhibit your ability to absorb

64
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:52.150
minerals is pre digested by the lacto bash list and all the bacteria in the

65
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:56.380
wheat.
So you've got a bread that's lower in a glycaemic index and it's,

66
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:59.860
it's more easily digested wheat,
Rye,

67
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.200
and sourdough or more health.
Right?

68
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:05.200
And you put the Ryan it because it lowers the glycemic index.

69
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.970
And then you've got the,
um,
uh,
what's it called?
The,
uh,

70
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.700
the,
uh,
I forget the term.
Uh,
it's a,

71
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.270
it's like a gluten digesting enzyme that gets activated with the lacto

72
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:20.980
Bachelor's.
So that's a smart bread.
I mean,
it takes fricken 24 hours to,

73
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.270
it's not 24 hours,

74
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:25.030
but it's like 15 minutes over 24 hours that it takes to make it.

75
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.470
That's an intelligent approach to food preparation,
right?

76
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:32.890
That's the way that our ancestors or many of the blue zones would have treated

77
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:36.670
their foods fermenting,
soaking,
sprouting,
slow food.

78
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.520
And you can take a lot of these things that would result in,
you know,

79
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:42.970
you're talking about Jordan Peterson,
I know his daughter does this as well.

80
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:47.220
And mckayla Peterson,
they use that elimination diet,
you know,

81
00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:50.530
which is the carnivore diet to clear up a lot of those autoimmune issues.

82
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.800
But you could also just render food more digestible or switch to an elimination

83
00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:59.830
diet or an autoimmune diet for eight weeks or 12 weeks,

84
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.410
something like the Carnivore Diet,
heal the gut,

85
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.810
and then return back to a more all inclusive eating pattern that allows you to

86
00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:10.660
eat,
you know,
dairy,
wheat plants,
et cetera.

87
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.280
All these things that would normally damage the gut if the gut is actually
leaky.

88
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.630
So what are the,
like what,
what's the process like?

89
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:23.290
What is happening when they go on this very strict elimination diet and they're

90
00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:24.220
just eating meat?

91
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.660
Like what is happening to their gut that allows them to have all these pretty

92
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.950
pretty significant health benefits,
a lot of loss of weight,
increase of energy,

93
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:36.090
autoimmune issues like Jordan had some,
um,

94
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.170
some pretty significant gum issues.

95
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:42.280
Those all went away depression that went that way.
But some of that,

96
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:46.630
some of the gum in the joint stuff might be just as much related to the fact

97
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:50.590
that he's getting a shit ton of college and you know,
five or I or I,

98
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.310
or not fiber,
but,
and you know,
Elastin and muscle fiber precursors.

99
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.980
He's getting a lot of protein.
Um,
I don't know.

100
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.810
He's eating bone broth and bone marrow,
but maybe a lot of glycine,

101
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:01.160
some of these other metabolites.

102
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.460
So part of it could just be more fuel on board to repair muscles or to repair

103
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.071
the joints.

104
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:11.810
But then the other part of it is that when you eliminate inflammatory products

105
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:14.880
that you're consuming,
like let's say you're eating whatever,
you know,

106
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.270
Wonderbread and commercial dairy or,

107
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.660
or unfermented soy or any of these things that can actually damage the lining of

108
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:23.940
the gut.
You're creating an inflammatory scenario.
And I know you're,

109
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.010
you're familiar with the gut brain access and how our gut interacts with our

110
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:31.610
nervous system via the vagus nerve.
And when you have inflammation in the gut,

111
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.130
that affects neural symptoms,
that affects sleep,

112
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.170
affects intellectual performance.

113
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.330
And then you've also got the autoimmune component.

114
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:42.770
If you're actually truly allergic to or intolerant to some of those proteins

115
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:46.190
that wind up in the bloodstream in the presence of a leaky gut,
you know,

116
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:50.570
plant proteins,
lectins are another one that a lot of people complain about.

117
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.490
Then you create almost like a full body damage scenario.

118
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.460
So the idea is you get rid of all that stuff.

119
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.550
You introduced the carnivore diet and I don't know that there's a lot of

120
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:05.300
components of the carnivore diet that are actually healing the gut as much as

121
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.350
it's the absence or elimination of the foods that were harming it.
Interesting.

122
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.120
The,
you know,
the,
the bell brothers,
Chris and mark,
do you know those guys?
Yeah,

123
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.200
yeah.

124
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.450
They're take on it is basically they've never felt better and you know,

125
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:19.520
these are guys that work out very heavily.

126
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:22.670
The difference between them and Jordan is probably that especially,
you know,

127
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:26.500
mark is a gorilla.
Yeah,
yeah.
He's powerlifting and you know,

128
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.310
it has been doing that basically his whole life.

129
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.960
These guys are what their take on it is essentially there.

130
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:38.110
At least the way they think is that most people that are talking about diet,

131
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.400
they really don't know what the fuck they're talking about.

132
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.030
Even though you might be able to look at it on paper and you might have these

133
00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:46.520
ideas about what's beneficial or non beneficial.

134
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.650
Some people are proponents of Vegan Diet,

135
00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:51.860
some people were proponents of you know Paleo.
He's like,

136
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:56.861
until you are actually physically doing something until you are actually doing

137
00:07:56.961 --> 00:07:59.630
something with that diet and then you report how much better you feel that the

138
00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:01.610
people that are actually training really hard,

139
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:04.850
those are the ones you should rely on.
And he's saying for him personally,

140
00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:09.230
he's never felt better.
Never been leaner.
Yeah,
and a big part of it,

141
00:08:09.231 --> 00:08:13.190
I mean this just returns to diet,
personalization and customization as a whole.

142
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:13.431
You know,

143
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:17.090
we live in an era where you can self quantify pretty easily with genetics and

144
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:21.380
you can find out what ancestry came from,
what blood markers that you have,

145
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.660
what your gut microbiome looks like.

146
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.740
And I don't think we talked about this on the last show,

147
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:31.760
but there's this idea of eating according to your ancestry and the concept of

148
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.380
what are called cold spots.

149
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.440
Like areas around the world where people have a genetic susceptibility to have

150
00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:41.840
certain diseases that they don't actually develop.

151
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:46.220
Those diseases don't actually manifest because of their traditional diet.

152
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.700
Like you look at like the Icelandic population that carries the genes that would

153
00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:53.870
render them more susceptible to something like depression or seasonal effective

154
00:08:53.871 --> 00:08:58.680
disorder,
but their diet is very rich in omega three fatty acids and Dha,

155
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.610
which we know can protect against those disorders in then you take take the

156
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:05.610
Icelandic population and you uproot them and put them in the context of a

157
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:09.860
westernized diet and all of a sudden depression and sid manifest.

158
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:14.130
It's an interesting,
so the same thing for like a Cameroon,
Cameroon,
Africa,

159
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.140
higher than normal risk for colon cancer,

160
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.680
but they're eating a diet that's high in fiber.

161
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.490
Why is it higher than normal risk?
Well,
I dunno,
it's a genetic susceptibility,

162
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.700
but the idea is that that population probably figured out at some point in human

163
00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:32.310
history that if they eat a lot of plants where they eat a lot of fiber,

164
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:35.850
all of a sudden people don't have as many issues with their colon.
Right.

165
00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:39.000
And then you take that same population again,
strip out the fiber,

166
00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:40.260
put him on a westernized diet,

167
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.370
and you get a large portion of the African American population developing colon

168
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:48.330
cancer.
That's crazy about the seasonal affective disorder.

169
00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:51.240
And you gotta wonder how would that affect people that live in Seattle,

170
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:53.820
the Pacific northwest,
that are dealing with constant rain.

171
00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:56.610
I wonder if that would have some sort of an impact on them.

172
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.430
Probably even more if you come from that population.
I mean,

173
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:02.670
I'm on the Spokane side,
but you know,
I'm,
I'm out in the middle of the forest.

174
00:10:02.671 --> 00:10:06.970
I get Sun for maybe 10 to two and I'm on a north facing slope and I work in

175
00:10:06.971 --> 00:10:11.760
doors a lot of the time.
You know,
I'm typing on my computer,
uh,
blogging.

176
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.510
And so I don't get a lot of sun exposure,
but that's where,
you know,

177
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:20.160
all these new fangled light panels and head worn light devices and things come

178
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:23.040
in that were actually developed for seasonal affective disorder that actually

179
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:25.230
work pretty well just to keep your mood up.

180
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.330
If you're working in doors and you'll get sunlight exposure.
