1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.460
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.290
Just the anecdotal research that some of these people have,
uh,

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.350
had these incredibly life changing experiences.

4
00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:14.130
But I think one of the things that you're saying is I think very important is

5
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:17.910
that this isn't for everybody and that if you have problems with normal

6
00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:20.400
consciousness,
this is likely not for you.

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.090
If you're one of those people that has schizophrenia and your family perhaps.

8
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.560
Yeah.
And in fact those people are screened out of this research very carefully.

9
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.370
Yeah.
It's,

10
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.590
it's a real issue with people with a psilocybin and Ma and many psychedelics,

11
00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:39.120
right?
Yeah.
What happens with schizophrenia is if you are at risk for it,

12
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.480
um,
either for,
uh,
because of inheritance,
um,

13
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.140
a psychedelic trip can set you off,

14
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:51.141
can be the trigger for a life of it and other things can to a divorce your

15
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:56.000
parents getting divorced sets people off,
go to graduate school,
sets people off.

16
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.730
If you're someone who's probably going to get schizophrenia,

17
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.850
any kind of mental trauma,
if it happens that,
that window,

18
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:07.170
which is in your early twenties,
in your late twenties,
I think.
Um,
and that's,

19
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.860
that's why we did see some cases because that's the age people were using

20
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:15.540
psychedelics in the 60s of having their first psychotic break.
So,
yeah.

21
00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:19.440
So if you're at risk for that or,
or bipolar as well,
by the way.
That's right.

22
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.830
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Marijuana can do it.
Also,
I think the,
the,

23
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.960
the numbers though mirror the numbers,
uh,

24
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.760
in standard populations when it terms of like,
I think it's one out of 10,

25
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.980
like one out of 10 people have some form of schizophrenia and that's mirrored in

26
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.940
marijuana use.
I didn't know that.
That's really,
I think it's the same.

27
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.920
I think the problem is,
you know,
it can exacerbate it or it can trigger it or,

28
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.630
you know,
depending upon,
I mean,

29
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:49.990
everyone's biology's different and everyone's,
uh,
the,

30
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.840
the way they absorb these,
these chemicals is different.
Yeah.
And you know,

31
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:59.820
if you are at risk,
something's going to do it eventually.
Um,
so,

32
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.870
you know,
we,

33
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:05.820
we don't have any evidence of someone thrown into a situation of schizophrenia

34
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:10.130
or other serious mental illness as a result of a,

35
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.860
strictly because of a psychedelic experience.
It may have been the trigger,

36
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.340
but there might have been,
it was going to happen anyway.
We just don't know.

37
00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:20.640
But in general,
if you've got serious,
if you have personality disorder,

38
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:23.430
if you have bipolar,
if you are at risk for schizophrenia,

39
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.640
they will not accept you into these trials and you should stay away from these

40
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:29.920
drugs.
Yeah.
Um,
that,
that,

41
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.660
that is a real problem with it being prohibited.

42
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.130
The prohibition has really set back research and understanding decades.
I mean,

43
00:02:38.131 --> 00:02:42.570
we should have been studying this stuff since the 60 is 30 years of hiatus in

44
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:43.290
the research.

45
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.830
I don't know if another time where you had a promising line of scientific

46
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:50.040
inquiry all through the fifties and early sixties,

47
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.880
that's just choked off.
And for 30 years,
nothing happened.
I mean,

48
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:57.180
think of what we would know if we had 30 more years of research with his drugs.

49
00:02:57.181 --> 00:03:01.330
It's crazy.
So now we're picking up the,
and all that research is being resumed,

50
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.030
but your,
but your point about prohibition is really important.

51
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:08.620
When you have prohibition,
you can't regulate something.
It's a free for all.
Um,

52
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.370
whereas if you did legalize silicide,

53
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.120
let's take as an example,
you could set rules.

54
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.050
You could say that it can only be administered by licensed guides or in a

55
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:24.760
medical context,
or that no one under a certain age can have it.
I mean,

56
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.390
it gives you a chance to regulate,
and that's why it's Saner to,

57
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.580
to legalize,
not in a free for all kind of way,
but in a,

58
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:38.581
in a very considered way than to have the system we have now where people are

59
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:42.010
going to take the drug,
whether they should or not without any kind of clearance.

60
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.690
Uh,
and by the way,
who knows what you're getting.
You,
you know,

61
00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:50.680
you can also regulate the,
the strength and the,
um,
and in the case of Lsd,

62
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:51.610
you know,
in the 60s,

63
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:54.160
there was this period where there was a lot of pure LSD round,

64
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:58.210
and then the mob got an interest in it and they started cutting it with speed

65
00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:01.540
and all sorts of things,
and people got into a lot of trouble.

66
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>
