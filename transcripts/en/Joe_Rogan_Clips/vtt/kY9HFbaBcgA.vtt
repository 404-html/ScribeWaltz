WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.880
The joe rogan experience.
We're good.

2
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.160
All right.
We're live sort of,
sort of loud.
We're,
we're rolling.
We're rolling.

3
00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:15.720
We're rolling.
We're rolling dog.
So,
uh,
so we were talking about the game.

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.640
We stopped because we figured this is probably good for the podcast,
right?

5
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.020
So Ari finally paid off the debt.
I paid it off in a big way,
man,
in a big way.

6
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.490
Um,
so if you remember,
I,
when we were doing the weight loss challenge,

7
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.920
it was like whoever wins decides the sporting event,

8
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.450
we're all sports fans basically,
you know,
and,
and I said at the time I was like,

9
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:40.890
let's go see Barcelona.

10
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:45.490
I think I wanted to see Barcelona play Paris in the,
you know,

11
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.560
some tournament cups.
I'm channel a tournament that they were playing in.

12
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.821
And I was like,
you know,

13
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:54.090
two of the premier teams and it'd be fun to go to Europe and make already pay

14
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:56.520
for it,
you know,
so,
so I told him that and he was like,

15
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:59.310
I'm going to like fucking Malaysia.
He just left.

16
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.180
So I never heard from him again.
Then four months later,

17
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.310
you know how it all it all played out.

18
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.390
So when he got back he was getting fucking slam by people because he was

19
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:14.130
supposed to pay up this bet,
you know,
and people were destroying him,

20
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.340
you know that I mean online,
they were just like,
well chill,

21
00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:21.240
you're a piece of shit.
Probably worse than that.
But um,
anyways,

22
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:25.110
once we got it,
we got to like hanging out.
Once we did the sober October thing,

23
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.400
um,
he was just like right before that actually,

24
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:33.600
I think he was like [inaudible],
which means like,
what do you want to do?
Right?

25
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.340
And I go,
well,
how about
I go,
uh,
he was like,
you know,

26
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:40.980
you picked the event.
I go,
I'm a big college football fan.

27
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.000
Let's go to the national championship game.
And I remember,
uh,
in 20,

28
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.300
at the end of 2013 season 2014,

29
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.540
Fsu and Auburn played in the rose bowl out here and Bertrand Fsu alum,

30
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.910
I'm a big FSU fan.
I was like,
let's go to the game.
And I remember that we met,
uh,

31
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.830
it was like we kind of somebody who had student,

32
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.930
cause they both always in the national championship,

33
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:08.400
they allow students to go to the game for pretty expensive,

34
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.220
much less than the general public can go forward.

35
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.920
In other words there because you want students have the ability to go to see

36
00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:18.810
their school play.
So we got like student tickets for,

37
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:22.330
I think they were three 50 each and that's pretty expensive,
you know,

38
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.440
especially for a student.
But I remember Burt treated me.
He,

39
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.960
he bought the ticket from me and we went to that,

40
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:30.870
to that game and he left that fucking halftime of the national championship
game.

41
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.140
Why'd he leave?
He was,
I'm tired.
We going to see the kids who've been drinking.

42
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.960
He left.
There was one of the basket was left you there?

43
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.780
We were sitting in separate sections,
but I was like,
are you fucking,

44
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.190
I was like texting him and he was like,

45
00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:43.620
so you were by yourself and he was by himself?
Yeah.
Yeah.

46
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.790
He knew more people at the game because a lot of his friends that he went to

47
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:50.880
school with were at the game too.
But I'm like,
you're gone.

48
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.390
Did you just see the kickoff return that just the,
the,
the lead just like swung.

49
00:02:55.391 --> 00:02:59.500
And he was like,
I'm at home.
And I was like,
all right.
So all right,
psycho.

50
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.220
So weird.
I,
I gave him shit for it.
I still give him shit for it,

51
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.780
but it ended up being just this amazing finish.
So anyways,

52
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.720
when I tell Ari I want to go to this,

53
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.870
I'm kind of thinking that's the ballpark.
Like,

54
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:16.990
cause that's the only experience I have.
So the games in Atlanta,

55
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.570
he buys tickets and I'm like,
I go,
you're not flying me coach.
You know that.

56
00:03:21.571 --> 00:03:24.580
He's like,
no,
you're the champ.
You give first bird work,
his coach,

57
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.370
he goes on work as coaches,
all good.
It must be bill extension.
Oh cool.

58
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.670
But burden ended up going from somewhere else.
So anyways,
he bought the ticket,

59
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.260
he got an Airbnb,
a really nice house,
you know,
for a few days in Atlanta.

60
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.690
And then it's uh,
you know,
it's the big thing is game day.
I'm thinking like,

61
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.570
oh that's cool that you got these tickets and you got,
you know,

62
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.330
but I think it's like reasonable and then we get to this state,

63
00:03:50.331 --> 00:03:54.130
I mean it was a total fucking disaster to get in because Trump went to the game,

64
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.720
so it was raining,

65
00:03:55.721 --> 00:04:00.721
it was wet secret service everywhere to our lines to get into the venue and I

66
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:06.370
paid a guy,
a security guy,
100 bucks to walk us through the line,

67
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:11.230
which is,
which was almost impossible because it was so packed,
but I don't,

68
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.870
he just started walking us through the line like in front of people.

69
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.760
People were yelling at the security guy,
which was like so uncomfortable.

70
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.910
He's like a young black kid and like old white people,

71
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:24.640
where the fuck are you doing?
He's like,
I'm security.
And they're like,

72
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.480
you're not just security you piece of shit like right to is right in front of
us.

73
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.230
I was like,
God damn.
Like I just have never seen someone flip out like that.

74
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.260
What we were doing was highly unethical.
We shouldn't have done it,

75
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.680
but like we just weren't going to wait in that line.
And then Burt,

76
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:42.520
of course Burt in a crowd like that,
he's like,
it's okay,
I'm famous.

77
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.470
We're famous guys like yelling that to people,
which is like,
no,
oh absolutely.

78
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:48.940
He's like,
he's like,
we're everywhere we went,

79
00:04:48.941 --> 00:04:51.280
if we went to a restaurant they would come up and be like,
Hey,

80
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:54.490
can I get you guys something to drink?
And he'd be like,
do recognize us.

81
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.430
We were like,
they were like,
what was he serious?

82
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.290
I mean I think it's part of his like,
you know,
whatever style.

83
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:05.860
And then,
and they were like,
I'm sorry.
So part of a joke or part of,

84
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.200
I think he's joking,
he's like halfway in the middle because one time,

85
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.610
one time he was like,
we were famous comedians and the lady was like,
Oh,

86
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:16.260
I know who you are.
And he was like,
oh,

87
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.830
isn't it awesome being famous guys like shut up.
And he was serious.
I mean,

88
00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:25.390
he's like half serious.
He's like,
but it's like you see him in his element.

89
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.420
It's like him in with crowds is really like,

90
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:32.440
you realize that he really enjoys it.

91
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.360
Like he really enjoys the large groups.
He enjoys being recognized.

92
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.380
He fucking like sometimes we were walking and people were like,
Hey,

93
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.830
you're the guy,
I've seen you on Facebook.
And he's like,
you want to picture?

94
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.290
And they were like,
okay.
Yeah,
he loves it.

95
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.980
He loves it.
And then we were talking about how like people would say like,

96
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.620
Tom and I were like,
yeah.
And they're like,
hey.
And then they would walk away.

97
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.520
They wouldn't come over to me.
They're like,
hi.
And then they'd walk another way.

98
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.510
But with birth they're like,
hi,
a hug you.
They take the shirt off.
I love,

99
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.650
they love it.
And he's like,
in his glory with it.
It's perfect.
So anyways,

100
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:17.651
we get through this horrific line into this unbelievable one point $6 billion

101
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:23.360
stadium that they built in Atlanta.
I mean,
it is,
it's fucking amazing.

102
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:28.010
It's such a beautiful,
just standalone stadium,
you know,

103
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.160
state of the art.
It's incredible.
We get in there.

104
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.570
Ari got us 50 yard lines of right in the middle,

105
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.290
like 20 rows back.
I'm like,
these are fucking amazing.

106
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.600
Like you couldn't ask for better seats.

107
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.980
It has like some club access for like free booze,
free food,

108
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:49.340
catered food,
prime rib.
I'm like,
Jesus.
I'm like,

109
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.120
how much did you pay for these tickets?
And he's like,
Oh yeah,
I want to know

110
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.810
$3,500 each.
Whoa.
I was like,
Ari,

111
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.190
are you fucking shit?
And he's like,
how to do it?
To do it?
Oh yeah.

112
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.650
But he fucking spent over 10 grand on tickets for us.
Wow.
Yeah.

113
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:15.450
Wow.
Unreal,
man.
That's amazing.
I mean,
those are,
those are great seats,
Dude.

114
00:07:15.451 --> 00:07:17.630
Like those are absolutely amazing seat.

115
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.500
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
