WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.110
She's a,
if you take the interesting about ultra marathons is like we kind of,

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.480
we're small enough sport where it's like you can't really say like,
Oh,

3
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:11.280
I'm a hundred miler.
It's like,
okay.
You know?
It's like,
yeah,
I know.

4
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.790
So like you have everything from a 50 kilometer that's got over 10,000 feet of

5
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:18.150
climbing and descending to a six day event on a track and they're all the same

6
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:18.984
sport.

7
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.980
When you look at like people who can kind of do really well at all of them,

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.620
or in Courtney's case really well at all of them,

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.500
you can't find a better female on the female side of things.

10
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:30.960
Someone who can do it better than that.
Like she does it.
She goes,

11
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:32.550
it goes on the track,
kills it.

12
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.360
She goes and 240 miles through the mountains kills it.
It's,
it's crazy.

13
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.610
<v 1>Yeah.
She's something on really,
really unusual.
You know,</v>

14
00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:42.380
a buddy of mine,
my friend Brian,

15
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.860
it was texting me about her while she was getting Brian is he doesn't even run,

16
00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:47.610
I don't think are barely,
I mean it's not a,

17
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.260
but he was just so fascinated by this one woman that was so far ahead of

18
00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:53.540
everybody just like what the fuck is she doing?

19
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.560
Then she beat the second place guy by 10 hours in a 238 mile race,

20
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.570
22 miles.
She was ahead of him.
Yeah.

21
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.110
<v 0>That's an interesting topic to where like the where like men and women in an</v>

22
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.340
ultra marathon and how that kind of like where it's one of the rare races where

23
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:14.360
women can win and it's the,

24
00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:18.180
the interesting thing to me about it is women can and do win some races,

25
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.050
but when they're like,
like Courtney's very much the most,

26
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.840
I would say talented person to do one of the 200 milers.

27
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:27.870
Yet like there hasn't been a lot of what like the,

28
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.570
the top of the sport hasn't really moved into that.

29
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.390
I mean Courtney certainly is top of the sport,
but she's thinks she's the best.

30
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.600
I think she's the best woman all around.
Right.

31
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.540
If certainly in the United States thinks she's the best at running those 200

32
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:41.190
milers.
Uh,

33
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.660
<v 1>is it dependent upon altitude gain and loss and,</v>

34
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.410
<v 0>and just variables to the day?
I think like,
so like,
I mean there's,</v>

35
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.360
there's some real,
like there's a guy named Kilian journey,
um,

36
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.490
and he spells his name J.
O.
R.
N,

37
00:01:56.491 --> 00:02:01.140
e t and uh,
he won the,

38
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:03.090
um,
or he,
he's,
he's,

39
00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:06.180
he's essentially the best mountain runner by far.

40
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:09.240
Like there's maybe one of the guy who could maybe compete with him at something

41
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:12.420
under a hundred miles,
but if it's like he's,
he's,

42
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.600
he would probably like beat everyone by who knows how much in a 200 we've seen

43
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:20.550
one of these videos before.
Yeah.
He'll,
he'll run on these,

44
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.390
he'll run on these like ridge lines and like,
it will be the death on both sides.

45
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.253
And he just

46
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.690
<v 1>play,
this
is fucking guys,
man.
So,</v>

47
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.170
oh,
I have CMS isn't even nearly a chance of them.
Oh,
Mike.

48
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.680
Yeah,
that's,
that's crazy.
Look at them.

49
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.370
It looks like a freak to the GoPro strapped to his heaven.

50
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.870
That's got to throw your balance off.
He's running with a Gopro.

51
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.960
Put that down intention.
That was my son.
I'd be like,

52
00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:49.970
pay attention where you're running kid Jesus.

53
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.360
<v 0>He's interesting because I mean his parents were like mountaineers I think and</v>

54
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:56.290
like so he was like basically playing in the mountains at like age three and

55
00:02:56.291 --> 00:02:59.610
basically grew up doing this stuff.
So God,
yeah,
he's the,

56
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.390
he's the type of guy who like,
he's,

57
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.730
he's probably the best in the sport right now and it's

58
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.250
<v 1>all my guys jumping around.
He's an asshole.
He's an asshole.
He's,</v>

59
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.990
he is running folks.
What is this a video?
Instagram.
I don't really know.

60
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.440
Okay.
[inaudible] spell his name.
Kay.

61
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.490
I is that two L's one L I a n j.

62
00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:23.810
O r n e.
T.
And he's running in Shumway.

63
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.793
How do you say that?

64
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.030
Chamonix [inaudible] France and he's running one on what looks like the fin of a

65
00:03:31.401 --> 00:03:34.550
shark.
If a shark was the size of a mountain,

66
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.460
this guy's a fucking animal,
man.
That is so scary.
Oh,

67
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.700
interesting.
Sweaty.
My hands are sweating,
scared,

68
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.930
just watching it.
And so he is the best.

69
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.780
<v 0>Yeah,
on the mountains for sure.
He doesn't do anything that's not mountainous.</v>

70
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.820
Like he did Western states and won it in 2011 and he was complaining about it

71
00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:58.530
being too flat.
Oh Jesus Christ.

72
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.190
What is the gain and loss of elevation in Western saying net downhill.

73
00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:06.450
So it's 2100 or 23,000 feet down.
17,000 feet up.
What?
So

74
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.610
<v 1>he's complaining about that.
Yeah,
it's too flat.
[inaudible] 17,000 feet up</v>

75
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.460
<v 0>and it gets much crazier.
And that you can do,</v>

76
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.640
you can do like 50 miles or a hundred k's that have the same profile as that.

77
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:17.800
So you can get like if you're doing like what he's doing,

78
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:19.510
that probably does feel kind of flat for him.

79
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:23.620
Like he likes that steep technical stuff.
So,
but yeah,

80
00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:26.470
so as far as the mountains go,
he's the,
he's the guy to beat for sure.

81
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.010
And he'll do races on a regular basis when he is running,

82
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:32.200
cause he's actually a professional skier too.

83
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:34.960
So like he's only running basically half of the year and he's skiing.

84
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:39.670
The other half is Christ.
So He's,
he's a fun dude to follow for sure.
Um,

85
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.721
but yeah,

86
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:45.370
it's a w when you look at like some of the races that are kind of the big races,

87
00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:46.151
like Western states,

88
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:49.690
100 is the most competitive hundred miler in the United States and ultra trail

89
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:50.290
Mont Blanc,

90
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.240
which is actually by Chamonix where you saw that video is probably at least last

91
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.360
year was the most competitive in the world.
Um,

92
00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.080
those are the reasons I like to look at.

93
00:04:59.081 --> 00:05:03.340
I kind of see like where the divergences from the males and the females.
Uh,

94
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:06.010
and if you look at like course records and winning times,
like,
you know,

95
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:10.630
the men are finishing like two plus hours ahead of the women are on a pretty

96
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.550
regular basis on that type of stuff.
And,
um,
at ultra trail mount blonde,

97
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:18.960
you know,
sometimes it's four or five hours,
uh,
and then it,

98
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.110
so then you can kind of lay,

99
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:23.200
it actually kind of is more in line with what you see with other endurance

100
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:26.260
distances,
like marathons and stuff like that.
Uh,

101
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.090
the crazy thing about it though is,
uh,

102
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.420
that doesn't mean that's going to happen every time.

103
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.630
Like there's certainly years where women do really well and finish like in the

104
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:38.790
top 10 amongst the in like,
look Western states or Utm B..
