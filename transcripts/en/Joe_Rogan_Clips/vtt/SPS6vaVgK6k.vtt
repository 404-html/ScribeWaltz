Hello Freak bitches do.

2
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:06.860
<v 1>Ooh,</v>

3
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.650
<v 0>I'm here with confirmed cosmonaut Steve.
Oh yeah,
man.</v>

4
00:00:15.651 --> 00:00:19.520
Who's been to space a man who knows about the atmosphere.

5
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.290
I can't say I've been to space.

6
00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:25.790
I went up in a Russian Mig fighter jet to the edge of the earth's atmosphere.

7
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.710
Hi.
Was that,
do you know?
I fucking forget shit.
I fucking forget.

8
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.320
But it wasn't that much higher than,

9
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.490
so normal flight is like 100,000 thousand.
And then what's like,

10
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.500
I've heard the Galt,
they've go higher.
Right?

11
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:43.250
They can go up to like 35,000 for commercial flight.
I want to say that the,

12
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:47.310
that I,
that it might've been like,
not much more than 50,000,
but I,
I,

13
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.630
I can't back that up.
I don't remember.
Maybe it was,

14
00:00:49.631 --> 00:00:52.790
it was shockingly less than you would imagine.
Oh,
that's you.

15
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.920
I had a video of it because it showed us wild boys.
Oh,
no shit.

16
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.540
Oh look,
it's going straight up.
Oh my God.
He's a lot of,
uh,

17
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.490
they used a lot of,
um,
stock footage,
but at the same time,

18
00:01:07.491 --> 00:01:10.890
on the way down,
this mother fucker did twirls and fuck it was,

19
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.740
it wasn't like the gnarliest rollercoaster ride ever.
Ah.
And like,

20
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.130
and this is me filming myself like Louie that too.
Oh my God.

21
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.570
It's fucking night up there.
Wow.
That's incredible.

22
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.970
That shows for anybody wants to say that the fucking world is flat.

23
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.490
That's what I can prove.
Motherfuckers.
Well,

24
00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:34.070
you can see the curvature of the earth.
Wow.
That's nuts.

25
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.750
And so when you were doing this,
um,
did,
did you get goals close to blacking out?

26
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.680
Like how has the gene,
of course,
um,

27
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.140
I didn't get close to black man or anything like that and uh,

28
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.870
I thought that that it would be one thing.

29
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.420
What it was was I was just fucking claustrophobic.

30
00:01:50.421 --> 00:01:54.620
Man is in cramped in a tiny little,
I get claustrophobic.
Yeah,
I didn't like that.

31
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.030
Did you,
uh,
do you,
did they tell you how many g forces you were doing had?

32
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.760
That's another thing.
I can't remember,
but,
uh,

33
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:05.120
I feel like there was more g shit going on when we did the,
uh,

34
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.440
the zero gravity plane.
Oh,
okay.
Which,
um,
you know,

35
00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:13.170
it just kind of goes along and then it does a big bell curve kind of deal.

36
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.330
So you'd become weightless.
Right.
And that one,

37
00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:21.170
you could feel yourself really like being pulled down with the gs or whatever.

38
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.770
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
