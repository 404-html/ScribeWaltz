1
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.140
It might be because of the overflow of love.

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.520
It might be difficult to appreciate more like genuine little moments of love.

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.030
<v 1>And it's not for me.
No.
Um,
I,</v>

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.440
I spent a lot of time thinking about that and I also spent a lot of time

5
00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:20.441
thinking about how titanic bizarre my place in the world is.

6
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.301
I mean I,

7
00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:26.810
I think about it a lot and I spent a lot of time being poor and being a loser.

8
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.180
I mean my,
my childhood was not the best.

9
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.680
I went through a lot of struggle when I was young that I cooling to like a

10
00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:36.590
safety rep raft.
You know,
I,
I don't,

11
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.850
I don't ever think there's something special about me and I tried to let

12
00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:44.000
everybody know that you,
anybody could do what I've done it.

13
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.500
You just have to just keep going though.
The,

14
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.540
it's like 99% of this thing is just showing up and keep going,

15
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.610
keep improving,
keep working at things and keep going.
Put the time in.

16
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.840
<v 0>But the interesting thing is you haven't actually a couple of days ago,</v>

17
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.090
went back to your first podcast and listen to it.

18
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.660
You haven't really changed much.
So you were,

19
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.880
I mean the audio got a little better and,
but just like the year,

20
00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:12.700
the genuine nature of the way you interact hasn't changed.

21
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.420
And that's fascinating because,
you know,

22
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.030
fame changes.
People

23
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.830
<v 1>was already famous then.
I just was finding a different way.
Yeah,
I was famous.</v>

24
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.870
I was already famous from fear factor.

25
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.940
I was already already had stand up comedy specials.
I already had.

26
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.130
Um,
I had already been on a sitcom.
Um,

27
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.810
it wasn't as famous as I am now,
but I understood what it is.

28
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.700
I'm a big believer in adversity and struggle.

29
00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:44.110
I think they're very important for you.

30
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.120
It's one of the reasons why I appreciate martial arts.

31
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.590
It's one of the reasons why I've been drawn to it as a learning tool,

32
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.030
not just as something where it's a puzzle that I'm fascinated to try to figure

33
00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:56.560
out how to get better at the puzzle.

34
00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.010
And martial arts is a really good example because you never really the best,

35
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.100
especially when there's just so many people doing it.

36
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.950
It's like you're always going to get beat by guys.
And then I was never,

37
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.070
I was never putting the kind of time into it as a,
an adult outside of,
uh,

38
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.780
my taekwondo competition.
I was never really putting all day,

39
00:02:13.781 --> 00:02:17.140
every day into it.
Like a lot of people that I would train would,

40
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.600
and so I'd always get dominated by the really best guys.

41
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.340
So this certain amount of humility that comes from that as well.
But there's,

42
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.370
there's a struggle in that you're learning about yourself and your own limits

43
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.780
and the limits of the human mind and endurance and just not understanding all

44
00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:42.730
the various interactions of techniques and that,
you know,
there's some,

45
00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:46.330
there's humility to that in that I've always described martial arts as a vehicle

46
00:02:46.331 --> 00:02:49.000
for developing your own human potential.

47
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.320
But I think marathon running has similar aspects.
I think when you're just,

48
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.350
you figured out a way to keep pushing and push through the control of your mind

49
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.600
and your desire and overcoming adversity,

50
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:06.310
I think overcoming adversity is critical for the human.
For humans.

51
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.600
We have this,
this,
um,
these,

52
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.790
this set of reward systems that are designed to do,

53
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.480
to reward us for overcoming,
for overcoming obstacles.

54
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:22.000
For overcoming a relationship,

55
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:25.480
struggles for overcoming physical limitations,

56
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.580
and those rewards are great and there are some of the most amazing moments in

57
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:32.350
life when you do overcome,

58
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.340
and I think this is sort of engineered into the system.
So for me,

59
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:40.540
fame is almost like a cheat code.
It's like you don't really want it.

60
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:44.080
Don't dwell on that man.
Like that is the,
that's like a free buffet.

61
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.230
Like you don't,
you know,
you want to go hunt your own food,

62
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:48.670
you want to make your own fire,

63
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:50.710
you want to cook yourself and feel the satisfaction.

64
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:53.830
You don't want people feeding you grapes while you lie down.

65
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.440
<v 0>What is the hardest things?
He talked about a challenge a lot.</v>

66
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.790
What's the hardest thing you've,
when we'll,
have you been really humbled

67
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.690
<v 1>martial arts for sure.
The Marzano.
Humbling.
Yeah.
From the moment I started,</v>

68
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.110
I mean,
I mean I got really good at taekwondo,

69
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.890
but even then I'd still get the fuck beaten out of me by my friends and got

70
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:17.560
training part.
Especially when you're tired and you're doing your,

71
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.590
you're rotating partners and guys are bigger than you.
It's just,

72
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.130
it's just humbling,
you know,
martial arts.
Very humbling.

73
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.780
<v 0>I got to call you out on something.
Um,</v>

74
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.330
so you talk about education system sometimes I've heard you say is a little

75
00:04:32.331 --> 00:04:36.110
broken in high school and so on.
And I'm not really calling out,

76
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.790
I just,
I just want to talk about it cause I think it's important.
Uh,

77
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.970
and as somebody who loves math,
he talks,

78
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.080
but your own journey was school didn't give you

79
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.860
a passion value.

80
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.740
Well you could maybe talk to that,
but I,
for me,
what I always,

81
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.200
maybe I'm sick in the head or something,

82
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.910
but for me math was exciting.
The way martial arts.
What were exciting for you?

83
00:05:04.911 --> 00:05:08.150
Because it was really hard.
I wanted to quit.

84
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.870
And the idea with education I have that,

85
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.880
that that seems to be flawed nowadays a little bit is that we want to make

86
00:05:16.881 --> 00:05:21.740
education easier,
that we want to make more accessible and so on.

87
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.120
Uh,
accessible of course is great,

88
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.110
but you kind of forget in that and that those are all good goals.

89
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.030
You forget in that,
that it's supposed to be also hard and like teachers.

90
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.000
Just the way you're wrestling coach,
if you like quit,
you say,
I can't do anymore.

91
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.900
I have to come up with some kind of excuse.

92
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.620
You're wrestling coach looks at you once to say get your ass back on the mat.

93
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.250
The same way I wish math teachers did that.

94
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.360
When people say it's almost like cool now to say,
ah,
it's not,

95
00:05:50.361 --> 00:05:52.010
math sucks and that's not for me,

96
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.520
or science sucks as buzz teacher's boring.

97
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.100
I think there there's room for some

98
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.260
<v 1>culture or says,
no,
no,
no,
no,
you're not.</v>

99
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.470
If you just put in the time and you struggle,

100
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.480
then that opens up the universe to you.

101
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.080
Like whether you become an Neil degrasse Tyson or the next fields,

102
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:12.830
medal winner and mathematics.
I would not argue with you for one second.

103
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.720
I would also say that one of the more beautiful things about human beings is

104
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:22.721
that we vary so much and that one person who is just obsessed with playing the

105
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:27.350
trombone and to me,
I don't give a fuck about trombones,
but that's okay.

106
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.200
Like I can't be obsessed about everything.

107
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.380
Some people love golf and they just want to play it all day long.

108
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:35.810
I've never played golf a day in my life.

109
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.530
Set Miniature Golf and just fucking around,

110
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.110
but that doesn't,
it's not bad or good and I think there's,

111
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.070
there's definitely some skills that you learned from mathematics that are hugely

112
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:53.430
significant if you want to go into type of fields that you're involved in.
Um,

113
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.310
for me it's never been appealing,

114
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.120
but it's not that it was just difficult.

115
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.390
It's also that it just,
for whatever reason,

116
00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:07.391
who I was at that time in that school with those teachers having the life

117
00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:10.400
experience that I had,
that was not what I was drawn to,

118
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.850
but what I was drawn to his literature,
I was drawn to reading,

119
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.600
I was drawn to stories.
I was drawn to possibilities and creativity.

120
00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:21.710
I was drawn to all those things.
You are an artist of it too.
Yeah.
I used to be,

121
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.710
I used to want to be a comic book illustrator.
That was,

122
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.220
that was a big thing when I was young,
I was really into comic books.

123
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:31.400
I was really into,
um,
uh,

124
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.840
it was traditional comic books and also a lot of the horror comics from the

125
00:07:35.841 --> 00:07:39.440
1970s a black and white,
like creepy and eerie.

126
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.330
Did you ever see those things?
Creepy and Eerie?
Like black and white?
Yeah,

127
00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:48.210
they were,
they were a comic book series that,
um,

128
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.110
existed like way back in the day was all there.

129
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:55.940
We're all horror and they were like really cool illustrations and these wild

130
00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:59.210
stories,
but it was comic books,
but they were all black and white.

131
00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:03.650
That's creepy and eerie.
Oh,
that's the actual name.
Yeah,
Erie and creepy.

132
00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:06.980
Where the nae see like that was from,
what year was that?
It says September,

133
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:08.090
but it doesn't say what year,

134
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:13.190
but I used to get these when I was a little kid.
Man,

135
00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:18.140
I was like eight,
nine years old in the 70s.
Good and evil.
Yeah,
it was,

136
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.300
uh,
there were,
there were my favorite,

137
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:24.020
like that's a cover of them and like they would have like covers that were done

138
00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:25.820
by like Frank Frazetta,

139
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.960
Boris Valais Ho and just really cool shit.

140
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.200
And I was fat.
Those.
I love those.
When I was little,

141
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:37.660
I was always really into horror movies and really into like Bram,

142
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.220
like look at this werewolf one that was one of my favorite ones.

143
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:44.540
That was like crazy werewolf that was like on all fours.
Who is the hero?

144
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:47.030
Usually Superhero heroes.
Everybody dies.
And those,

145
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.750
that's the beautiful thing about it.
Everybody gets fucked over.
There was nobody.

146
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.050
That was the thing that I really liked about them was that like nobody made it

147
00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:55.100
out alive.

148
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.890
There was no one guy who figured it out and rescued the woman and they wrote off

149
00:08:58.891 --> 00:08:59.724
in the sunset,

150
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:04.250
you turn the corner and they'd be a fucking pack of wolves with glowing eyes

151
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.130
waiting to tear everybody apart.
And that'd be the end of the book that I just,

152
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:11.460
um,
I was just really into the illustrations.
I found them fascinating.
I just,

153
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:15.660
I love those kind of horror movies and I love those kinds of illicit,

154
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:17.320
so that's what I wanted to do when I was young.

155
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.820
<v 0>Yeah.
I think the education system is probably,</v>

156
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.180
we talked about creativity is probably not as good at,
uh,

157
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:28.830
inspiring and feeding that creativity because I think math and wrestling can be

158
00:09:29.591 --> 00:09:32.890
taught systematically.
I think creativity is something,

159
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.660
well actually I had known nothing about it,

160
00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.960
so I think it's harder to take somebody like you when you're young and say and

161
00:09:40.751 --> 00:09:43.560
inspire you to pursue that fire,
whatever's inside.

162
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.700
<v 1>But one of the best ways to inspire people is by giving them,
uh,</v>

163
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:54.090
giving them these alternatives that are so uninteresting.

164
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.770
Like saying,
you're going to get a job selling washing machines and you're like,

165
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.910
fuck that.

166
00:10:00.911 --> 00:10:04.210
I'm going to figure out a way to not get a job selling washing machines.

167
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.230
Like what some of the best motivations that I've ever had been terrible jobs

168
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.010
because you have these terrible jobs and go,
okay,
fuck that.

169
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.650
I'm going to figure out a way to not do this.
You know,

170
00:10:14.651 --> 00:10:19.510
and whether you want to call it add or Adhd or whatever it is,

171
00:10:19.511 --> 00:10:23.290
it makes kids squirm in class.
I didn't score them in every class.

172
00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:28.740
I didn't squirm and science class,
I didn't squirm in,
in,

173
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.360
you know,
an interesting subjects.

174
00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.390
There's things that were interesting to me that I would be locked in and

175
00:10:34.391 --> 00:10:35.740
completely fascinated by.

176
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.160
And there was things where I just couldn't wait to run out of that room.

177
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.430
And I don't know what the reason is,

178
00:10:42.431 --> 00:10:47.431
but I do know that a lot of what we call our education system is engineered for

179
00:10:47.771 --> 00:10:49.000
a very specific result.

180
00:10:49.001 --> 00:10:54.001
And that result is you want to get a kid who can sit in class and learn so that

181
00:10:55.061 --> 00:10:59.770
they could sit in a job and perform and that for whatever reason,

182
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.070
that was just,
I mean,
I didn't have the ideal childhood.
Maybe,

183
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.160
maybe if I did I would be more inclined to lean that way.

184
00:11:06.161 --> 00:11:10.180
But I didn't want to do anything like that.

185
00:11:10.181 --> 00:11:12.910
Like I couldn't wait to get the fuck out of school,

186
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.940
so I didn't ever have to listen to anybody like that again.

187
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.150
And then just a few years later,
I mean,
uh,

188
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.790
you graduated from high school and you're 18.
When I was 21,

189
00:11:21.791 --> 00:11:25.690
I was a standup comic,
and I was like,
I found it.
This is it.
I'm like,
good.

190
00:11:25.691 --> 00:11:28.660
I found there's an actual job that nobody told me about where you could just

191
00:11:28.661 --> 00:11:33.160
make fun of Shit and people go out and they pay money to hear you.
Uh,

192
00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.600
create jokes and routines and bits really.
