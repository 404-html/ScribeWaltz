1
00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.910
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.910
Here's what I realized.
It's like bring this back home to base.

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.820
Here's what I realized during sober October,
October,

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.830
I don't need alcohol,
but I like it.
It's great.
Yeah,

5
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:21.330
it's great.
It is fine.
Great.
No need weed.
But I like it.
Yeah.

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.800
I liked him.
I like it.
Kitten.

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.530
It's for me it's changed how my circuitry works,

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.110
you know?
It's changed how I like,
uh,

9
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.020
how I communicate with people and I think that there's,

10
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:37.100
the thing about alcohol is like you pay for it.
Yeah,

11
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.340
you definitely pay for it physically,
but you,

12
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.220
there's like an exchange to things to figure out what that exchange is like,

13
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:44.670
what's it,

14
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.670
what's it worth getting really lit and having an amazing time and hugging your

15
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:52.810
friends,
telling him you love him and just how that,
and let,

16
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.670
let me tell you something.

17
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.900
I think to this day about one of the Times you and I got drunk together in
Texas,

18
00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.640
we first started going on the road together.

19
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.930
We would go on the road together for like a couple of years and we were in like

20
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:08.730
a honky tonk bar.
I remember that was a Houston or Austin,

21
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.640
I feel,
I don't know why I think of,
I thought it was Louisville or something,

22
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.680
somewhere in Texas and we were hammered and were just hugging Wah.
I'm like,
dude,

23
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:19.500
I have so much fun.
And you said the same thing.

24
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:23.930
And like we could say things that you always knew that I uh,

25
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.510
appreciate you as a comedian and you always knew that we were friendly and we

26
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:32.270
had some gates together but it took us getting drunk to like hug it out.

27
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.600
Go do it.
We're having so much fun.
Like pretty sure I cried.
Yeah,

28
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:41.310
you definitely cried.
So that's not like I didn't want to bring,
I'm crying.

29
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.910
I'm crying right now.
I really am crying right now cause it's like,

30
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.810
cause I knew you were,
you're a good dude,
man.
You were funny as fuck.
And I,

31
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:52.050
and I knew what you were because I had been where you were.
You were,

32
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:54.690
you were at the launching pad.
Like God damn is this happening?

33
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:58.380
Like what's happening?
I do am my fucked.
Is it going to work out?
You know,

34
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.650
there's that weird moment.
And you know,

35
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:04.860
and I had already been there before and we were friends and I was like,
dude,

36
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:06.360
you got to,
you is going to work,

37
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.460
you're going to do it 100% and then we were drunk together and we're talking

38
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:15.660
about that moment.
I think about that all the time,
man.
I really do.

39
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.710
I do now when you're killing it,
I think about,
I'm crying.

40
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.180
I think about that shit all the time.

41
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.210
I do you know to see someone that you like when I met you in like 2007 I mean

42
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.070
you would obviously like been doing comedy a couple of years but you were,

43
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:35.010
you were trying to figure it out,
you know.
Well I think about,

44
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.830
I think about it too cause like,
you know,

45
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.160
it's hard like people don't realize the opportunity when when you,

46
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.490
when you kind of reached down and you bring somebody along for that,

47
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.090
it's hard sometimes to convey like your gratitude,
you know?

48
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.270
So like that was one of those times where like in soap when you're sober you go

49
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:54.570
like do thanks so much.
Like how many times you're going to say,

50
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.020
you know what I mean,
like you go,
I really appreciate it.
But when that's,

51
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.710
that goes back to like what the alcohol kind of opens up for you is like you let

52
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:06.790
down your guard,
you let down that you let the vulnerability come to the surface.

53
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.000
And I think that was really like for me,
cause I've thought about it,

54
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.380
it's like the expression of gratitude overwhelmed me because I realized how

55
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:16.120
lucky I was.
Like,
you know,

56
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:20.350
you and any number of people can bring along whoever they want on the road with

57
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:22.330
them.
So like that for me was just like,

58
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.260
I couldn't believe how lucky I was to be able to travel,

59
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:28.210
could do real shows,
you know,

60
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:33.010
do real shows with like these really appreciative audiences and like you're

61
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:36.610
bringing me along and like,
I feel like,
uh,
like an equal,

62
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.250
it was overwhelming to me.
Do you know what,
what was overwhelming?

63
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.500
You are an equal,
we're all equal.

64
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.590
It's like we're all just like different parts of the road.
Yeah.
You know,
I could,

65
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.680
the road is the same road.
No,
it is,

66
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.010
but there's lessons like there's lessons from that,
you know,

67
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:54.650
like there's lessons that people are willing to burn themselves.
Yeah.

68
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.410
They gotta be willing to learn it themselves to tell you like you have to know

69
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.370
it encouraged,
you know,

70
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:04.510
it does just living through it encourages you to pass it along.

71
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.570
So that's kind of the coolest part is because like,
I mean I really tried to,

72
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.980
to mimic that.
You know,
I bring,
I brought a bunch of guys most recently,

73
00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:18.981
Josh Potter is this really funny dude from buffalo and I brought him on most of

74
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:23.850
these dates and you know,
I,
I I hook up,
you know,
take care of his travel.

75
00:04:23.851 --> 00:04:27.170
Like I've known you and it's like to the ice house.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And he's,
he's a,

76
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.560
he's a great,
he just moved here.
He's just good.
He's really funny.
Really,

77
00:04:31.561 --> 00:04:32.394
really funny.

78
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.060
One of the only times I ever cried on a podcast was I'm listening to a podcast

79
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.760
where you were talking about your and I relationship.

80
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.290
It's one of the few times I ever cried like listening to a podcast.
I was like,

81
00:04:46.291 --> 00:04:47.880
wow,
this is like heavy emotional.

82
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.800
We were talking about like me and you going on the road.

83
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.420
Like in the early days.
It was pretty fun.
I was amazing man.

84
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.620
It was your podcasts where we did the um,
uh,

85
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:05.760
buck hunter podcast is the beginning of that can cause the end.

86
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.020
We were talking,

87
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.340
you were talking about our relationship when you first started out.

88
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.410
It was good to go from open bikes to be able to see like,
like you said,

89
00:05:16.411 --> 00:05:19.770
just like,
oh,
this is like a real crowd there.
It's here.
It's so big people,

90
00:05:19.771 --> 00:05:23.400
some people never even get a taste to them and then you come back to that.

91
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.210
I always try to go back on Sunday night to the potluck.
Excuse me.
It was,
it was,

92
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.270
no,
it was Sunday then.
And then it was like to go back to dose of reality.
Right.

93
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.340
It sucks,
but I know I can do it now.
Yeah,
but you,
you all knew you.

94
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.150
Like everybody knows they kind of can do it.
That's why they're trying to do it.

95
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.950
But you need to,
someone who's ahead of you,
they're like holds a flashlight.

96
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.140
It's like,
come on,
take a look at this shit.
Come on.
We're all the same.

97
00:05:46.141 --> 00:05:48.900
Keep going.
Keep going.
Be like when you took me to the left and limited

98
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.220
and I bombed in front of you for hours

99
00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.781
like our,

100
00:05:58.781 --> 00:06:02.270
he didn't know you from the time where I first met you to you having your own

101
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:06.350
comedy central show to having your own Netflix special.
Was this double special?

102
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.370
Those two hours I had to do to you.

103
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.380
Pretentious as fuck to 45 but it was just 40 fives have still half hour more

104
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:19.250
than anybody,
but it was,
it was still,
it was like,
wow,

105
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.240
that's weird when you can start your reality one way and then like just slowly

106
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:26.990
change over time
and that's what we,

107
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.520
it seems counterintuitive because you seem like you're trying to hold down the

108
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:35.600
competition.
The problem is if you hold down a competition,

109
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.540
you inevitably hold on yourself.
You don't,
you don't mean to.
Yeah.

110
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:40.640
The bar is set lower.
It's not just that.

111
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.380
It's like you're looking at the wrong way.

112
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.310
It's one of the reasons why I always took killers on the road.
Yeah,

113
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.090
that's a tough dude.
I used to always take Joey Diaz.
We took Dunkin,

114
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:54.650
we took Ari.
Like I always took murderers on the road.
Anybody following,

115
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.720
bringing electively,
bringing Joey is as always,
I it,

116
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.390
it was me for the longest time me than dos and rogue.
Great show.

117
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.260
And then it was in Austin.
Diaz goes,
Hey,
I'm going to go first today.

118
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:10.400
You're going to go last.
There are no second.
I mean,
I didn't know.
Now he's just,

119
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:13.580
he likes to go to sleep,
but then I was like,
am I being punished?
What did I do?

120
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.370
I don't do anything.
It's a terrible place to be following Joey in last.

121
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.600
It's not right.
So the thing is if you learn to embrace it,
yeah,

122
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.750
it's a good crowd.
I'm the number one Joey Diaz Fan in the world.

123
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.840
Other than like Joey Diaz is his wife and his daughter.
Yeah.

124
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.130
It's like there's like everybody else is like,
we're all,

125
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.240
if you might be the same,
but you definitely don't love him more than I do.
Right.

126
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.660
So for me it was like taking that on the road.
It's like I want to see him.

127
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.600
That's the only way you learn that doing stand up long enough.

128
00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:47.180
If you embrace the person in front of you,
like you embrace it,

129
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.980
that this is like you enjoy it.
You can fall,
you can,
you can go back look,

130
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:51.863
and yet you can find,

131
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:02.280
<v 1>okay.</v>
