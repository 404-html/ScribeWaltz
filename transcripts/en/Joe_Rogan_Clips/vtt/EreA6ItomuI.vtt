00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.460
The joe rogan experience.
So,
uh,
are you digging doing this podcast?

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.060
Are you kidding me?
On Fire?
Oh Man,
I'm loving it.
I'm having,

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.760
well let's put it that way.
I love doing it.

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.670
It's a royal pain in the ass that he search.

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.360
Cause will your podcast much like Dan Carlin's is very different.

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.950
I always feel ashamed calling my podcast a podcast cause it's just you sit down

7
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:24.540
and talk but yours is like,

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.260
it's an audio lesson on history and in depth audio lesson on like very extreme

9
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:36.090
aspects of history ea gets and you know that pirate I enjoy because the

10
00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:40.200
storytelling part is awesome.
You Guy whose penis story and make it exciting,

11
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.690
connected with pop culture,
do something that's fun.

12
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.400
That's the part that I love is the month prior to that of just brutal research.

13
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.031
Just comb,

14
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:52.050
been through boring historical book after boring historical books to find those

15
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:54.460
little nuggets that are amazing.
Yeah.

16
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.370
And then spin it into a narrative that's the part that gets a little old

17
00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:01.320
sometimes where you're like,
man I do.

18
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:04.440
I really need to read 200 hours of stuff for this one thing.

19
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:07.950
It's like that's a lot.
Yeah.
I can only imagine now when you do that,

20
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.920
when you're going over,
combing over all these different uh,

21
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.420
history books and all these different papers written on various times,
do you,

22
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.920
are you like extracting chunks and like putting them in Microsoft word and then

23
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:22.470
going over it and then like how did you form it?

24
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.340
The question is kind of like do form it as a script or how much of it,

25
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.250
so everything is completely written out.

26
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.180
Not exactly because otherwise they need sound like sound like yard guy or to

27
00:01:32.181 --> 00:01:34.620
getting this thing going and it's boring.
It doesn't sound right.

28
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:37.260
I just take super extensive notes.

29
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.350
Kind of like if you were to give a lecture that you have never given,

30
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.040
you're not going to sit down and read it by you are going to,
you know,

31
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.070
you have something to keep you on track to make sure it's like,
oh,

32
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:49.250
where am I going next?
Okay,
great.
There's nothing.

33
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.770
So it's a as a detailed as possible without turning 18 to a that I guy or ed

34
00:01:57.011 --> 00:01:59.280
niece page type of stuff.
Yeah.

35
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:04.281
I mean history is such a fucking awesome subject because people are crazy and

36
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:10.080
throughout history people have done so many crazy things and it's just,

37
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.060
it's,
it's such a great thing to know like when you,

38
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:16.710
if you only had today,

39
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.720
like if we only had our current era and we're looking around how fucking

40
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:25.920
maniacal people are,
how crazy the world is,
we'd be like,
God,
how did this happen?

41
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.810
How did we get here?
And then you just listened to your podcast and you go,
oh,

42
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:34.950
this shit's been going on forever.
Seriously.
This is the good tosh.

43
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.070
Exactly this in case you are welding that in good times and yes,

44
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:43.680
there's much to complain about and yes there's much we can do better without a

45
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:44.610
doubt,
ladies and gentlemen.

46
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.870
But this is his fucking good as it's ever been by far,

47
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.940
the human psyche is a very weird place because there's so much amazing stuff

48
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:55.980
that human being stupid or just so much.

49
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.850
And then there's the amount of horror that can be unleashed throughout heat that

50
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:01.241
has been,

51
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:05.800
at least through our history by people against other people is just insane.

52
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.360
Yeah.
What is like when you go back and you,
you go over history,

53
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.380
what is the most confusing or disturbing era?
He,

54
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:19.300
ana to me is not so much at biotech will our period because the same patterns

55
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:24.010
emerge a lot of the times at different points in time.
Ease a is more,

56
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:25.870
it was moments,
you know,
when,
uh,

57
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.910
when mob mentality takes over because the reality is the average person is not,

58
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I don't have the award of view where I think the average person,
he's evil.

59
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.700
I don't think that,
I think the average person is weak,

60
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.720
which means that when a inequity nations where everybody's pushing in one

61
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:45.110
direction is very easy to jump on the bandwagon and in some cases then Yvette

62
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.520
already ordinary human being can do horrible actions.

63
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.810
You meet them for dinner and you think pleasant person good enough,

64
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.830
but you put them in the wrong context and every scene turns to shit I just did.

65
00:03:56.831 --> 00:04:00.010
Um,
I just finished right now it is to power.
See is less,

66
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:01.300
probably the most disturbing.

67
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.840
I now I want to do what podcast about flowers and puppies cause test one was

68
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:05.291
heavy.

69
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:10.291
Man I need the city has on kind of compare and contrast on the sand creek

70
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:15.691
massacre of the Cheyenne in Colorado in the 1860s and then me lie in Vietnam in

71
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.150
1968 and actually I split it because I had id design critique and they had um,

72
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.841
this guy,

73
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:26.620
Daryl Cooper was the martyrmade podcast is an amazing podcast there and he

74
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:28.830
covered me lie and that in the third APP is,

75
00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:32.170
or we're going to sit down and kind of chat about what does this all mean about

76
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.610
the human nature.

77
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.270
Why do the reason why that particular story in those two stories interests me is

78
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:42.580
because it's too brutal massacre of civilians.

79
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.080
But in both cases that are soldiers who refuse to participate or actually try to

80
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:50.110
stop it.
They're not the majority.
They are a minority,

81
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:51.550
but they are there and they try.

82
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.750
So it's not just a story of people do we not ugly stuff.
It's like what?

83
00:04:55.751 --> 00:05:00.050
He's that make one guy when or there,
hey go shoot that three year old,

84
00:05:00.051 --> 00:05:03.430
the one guy goes,
yes sir,
and does it and the next guy goes,
no,

85
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:05.740
that's not what we are.
Screw you.
I'm not doing that.

86
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.970
That's what interests me is like the individual element of what make people in

87
00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:11.590
the exact same circumstances.

88
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:15.580
One person go down a really dark path than somebody else instead of having the

89
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:17.500
balls to say no,
that's not what I am.

90
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.740
That's not what we do with the native American masker.
What,
who was,

91
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.530
how many people were the ones that refuse because you never hear about that.

92
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.410
Oh you hear about it.
They're horrific actions of the soldiers.
Yeah.

93
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.300
Which was the majority.
But there was also like,
there was this one guy,
um,

94
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.010
what's a guy named c Silas soul.

95
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.360
He was told about the guy with [inaudible] cause the guy,

96
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.590
he and the capital of other officers or refuse to let the man under them cause

97
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:45.010
they were divided in different companies.
So they are companies,

98
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:48.200
they say no or not participating in this.
This is just straight up slaughter.

99
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.100
These guys are not even a real targets.
These are a bunch of civilians.

100
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:53.200
So they refused.

101
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.860
And then Silas sold testified against his commander,
the inquiry.

102
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:01.190
And Danny was promptly more there shortly after nine.
Wow.
So he's like,

103
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:03.110
it's a crazy story.
But still to this day,

104
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:06.710
there are people from the Cheyenne tribe who every year they have a ceremony for

105
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:09.080
Silas soul because they said it not been for him.

106
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.510
A lot more of us would have died on that day and he did that really brave thing

107
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.300
and pay the price for it.
So,
you know,
if you're looking for heroism,

108
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.500
you can do a lot worse than look at this guy story because that guy was

109
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:23.150
seriously,
you know,

110
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:26.360
stand up for his conviction under the most extreme circumstances.

111
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:27.250
So it can top of,

112
00:06:27.251 --> 00:06:32.251
I admire that dad had to be incredibly difficult to just imagine what those

113
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:35.500
people were doing.
I mean,

114
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.360
when you hear some of the accounts of the slaughters of native Americans,

115
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:43.361
it's just terrifying that people can just look at someone and just decide,

116
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:46.880
that's not a person or that's not us.
This is the other.

117
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.530
They've gotta be eliminated.

118
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.470
So we're just going to kill all these kids and kill all these women.

119
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.570
And it happened all over the country.
I mean there's,

120
00:06:56.571 --> 00:07:01.130
there's two things that happened in native Americans.
One,
the big one is disease.

121
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.810
Sure.
And wasn't on purpose.
There's this big myth that people put,

122
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:10.550
like they put smallpox and blankets and that's all bullshit,
right?

123
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.100
It's pretty much been proven that they didn't really understand.

124
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.560
But bacteria are diseases.

125
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.210
There's one story that's a possible is not a proven thing during,

126
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.020
cause initially nobody understood bacteria and disease or the first [inaudible]

127
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.250
completely unintentional.

128
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.750
There's one tale about the French and Indian war where during a break,

129
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.960
the buddy shar talking about it saying one of the commander saying,
Hey,

130
00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:37.070
maybe we should give them some blankets from the smallpox hospital back in a

131
00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:39.290
while.
We do know that he suggested it.

132
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.820
We have no proof whatsoever that he was actually done.
So.

133
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.530
So that's probably how the rumor got started,
right.
Problem.

134
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.800
But in most cases would happen is just that the Europeans came over and just

135
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.900
inadvertently introduced native Americans diseases and 90% of them were wiped

136
00:07:56.001 --> 00:08:00.210
out.
Yeah.
That's a crazy number.
If you really stop and think about it,
it's to,

137
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.240
they're probably the most dramatic demographic disaster in human history
because,

138
00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:06.200
you know,
I've never,

139
00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:10.280
before you had a situation where a whole continent was not exposed to a series

140
00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:13.490
of diseases.
And so of course there's no immunity the first time they're exposed.

141
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.241
You know,

142
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:17.720
you don't need to even have smallpox of Cannes needs on somebody on the next
day,

143
00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:20.720
half of the villages that,
you know.
Yeah.
That's crazy.
It's just,

144
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.550
it's amazing that if,
uh,

145
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.930
a group of people just has not come in contact with something that other people

146
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:30.140
come in contact with all the time and just God with,
you got a cold,

147
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.130
you'd be fine.
Just have some chicken soup,
take a nap.
Meanwhile,

148
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.600
these people are just dead.
That's just kills them off.

149
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.440
That's probably why aliens don't show up.

150
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.500
It's like those motherfuckers are dirty.

151
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.640
If maybe show up these needle nose and we will,
our whole planet will die.

152
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.560
Or maybe the opposite.
They know they'll kill us.

153
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.180
Maybe they have like some super advanced diseases.
That's the other posts to be.

154
00:08:49.181 --> 00:08:51.980
Yeah,
I guess it's just a immune system thing,
right?

155
00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:54.770
If your immune system's not prepared for it.
So it is,

156
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.820
there's a great book by a guy named Dan Flores.
Um,
well he wrote two,

157
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:02.040
but one of them actually let me actually,

158
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:07.041
it was a paper that he wrote about the buffalo and he saying that it's really

159
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:13.461
interesting because he compares the initial and counters that European settlers

160
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:17.420
had and European travelers had,
um,

161
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.770
before the native Americans were wiped out.

162
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.150
And they talk about how many animals were on the planes and they make it a

163
00:09:24.151 --> 00:09:27.990
direct account of it.
And then after the Europeans had come in,

164
00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:30.300
90% of the native Americans had been wiped out.

165
00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:34.320
And that's when the buffalo population increased goes through the roof and

166
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:39.180
you're seeing these gigantic packs of milk wouldn't be packed.
So it hurts,

167
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:41.880
I guess,
of millions and millions of Buffalo.

168
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.540
And he say that's directly attributed to the lack of predators,

169
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:50.040
which means lack of native Americans because they were preying on these buffalo

170
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.440
of course,
wasn't it interesting when they talked to,

171
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:56.580
but when he talked about all of the people that were kidnapped by native

172
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.120
Americans that chose to live with them.
Yep.

173
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.070
And then when they were taken back by the Americans,

174
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:05.160
by the settlers,
you know,
they were like,
fuck this,

175
00:10:05.161 --> 00:10:07.200
I'm going back and going back to the native Americans.

176
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.080
And they went live with them again.
But no one went the other way,

177
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.460
which is really crazy.

178
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.310
Something not flattered in about the euro American culture of the time.
Yeah.

179
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.950
There's a great Benjamin Franklin.
Cool.
If time I'm going to buck shirt,

180
00:10:19.951 --> 00:10:21.320
cause I don't even remember to big any,

181
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.740
something about no utopia and west tasted savage life and then basically gone to

182
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.370
can be our tool come back to leaving our settlements or something like that.

183
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.510
Yeah.
And I'm like,
yeah,
let's see.
Something about fun.
Yeah.

184
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.330
The way they're living their camping,
right.

185
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.420
There's a hunting and fishing every day and you go back and these assholes are

186
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:43.020
wearing powdered wigs and banging a wooden mallet on a table for everybody to

187
00:10:43.021 --> 00:10:46.450
pay attention.
Fuck off second,
the louder he is.

188
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:51.210
But that area here you at,
that's what I read about called shirts,

189
00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:54.840
right?
People spend time with that romanticize native color choices like Whoa,

190
00:10:54.841 --> 00:10:55.710
they are old,
you know,

191
00:10:55.711 --> 00:11:00.300
hug trees and [inaudible] herself to forest.
And I'm like,

192
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.320
well yes and no.
There are like what you mentioned,
right?

193
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.060
If you are capture spacial in the east when like French and Indian war or stuff

194
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:10.080
like that,
I work going on.

195
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.190
If you are a capture by age getting an ATV that paid one of two things happen,

196
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.690
the good one is that they like you and they decide to adopt you and then you end

197
00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:21.260
up by the police in one of their dead family members.

198
00:11:21.261 --> 00:11:23.430
So like if they lost a brother or a father,

199
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.880
then you become that person for that same purpose.
I see.

200
00:11:26.881 --> 00:11:30.420
That's the weird thing that they did.
It's very weird.
But,
but the thing is,

201
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.080
the adoption process was so thorough that day.
Love you.

202
00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:38.400
Like you're the real deal and you end up feeling like you're part of this family

203
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:40.440
and you know every works out.
It's every scene.

204
00:11:40.441 --> 00:11:45.240
He's great if they don't like you that they torture you to death of her three

205
00:11:45.241 --> 00:11:48.510
day periods.
So it's saying the phone,
these are the same people,
right?

206
00:11:48.511 --> 00:11:50.160
So they can be the sweetest,

207
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:54.580
most also be woman's or really messed same culture,

208
00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:55.600
same individuals.

209
00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.790
Do you think that's just because people have evolved be dealing with tribal

210
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:05.320
warfare and just we have to have that switch?
I think he's a cause.

211
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.770
The thing that's interesting about natives is that it wasn't a racial thing.

212
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.240
They adopted anybody,
right?

213
00:12:10.241 --> 00:12:13.950
Didn't matter what skin color you have that they did not have a barrier to.

214
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.140
But there is a beaky insider outsider.
You know,

215
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.680
if you are part of our tribe and you may become part of our tribe,

216
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.460
race doesn't matter.
You can become part of our tribe,

217
00:12:23.461 --> 00:12:25.540
but once you're part of our tribe or one of us,

218
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.820
but if you're now part of our tribe,

219
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:33.250
then you know the same rules do not apply to you.
You are the other,

220
00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:37.630
you are an enemy.
You are an aim.
That case,
that's when it gets ready.
But older.

221
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.090
Yeah.
Even with other native Americans,

222
00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:43.720
that's the thing that people need to really get an like we especially people

223
00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:46.690
that only have a peripheral understanding of native American culture,

224
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:49.750
like the reason why sewer called sous.

225
00:12:49.751 --> 00:12:51.980
Cause that's a native American word for enemy.
Yup.

226
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.030
Did they call themselves Lakota people?
Right,
exactly.

227
00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:59.390
So all the other Indians are like fuck these crazy assholes are taking over.

228
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.150
They're the enemy.
Yeah,
totally.
They were just dominating.
Yeah.
It's a,

229
00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:08.110
it's really fascinating when you consider that these people had these hunting

230
00:13:08.111 --> 00:13:12.010
grounds and they were trying to protect and one of the things that they've found

231
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:17.040
is that there are areas or wildlife thrived and the wildlife thrive in these

232
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:23.930
like a gray area.
Yes.
Because like this one area would be,

233
00:13:23.931 --> 00:13:27.610
you know,
one native American tribe,
and then there are a hunting grounds.

234
00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:32.020
Went to a specific specified distance.
Yup.
No,
obviously always in conflict,

235
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.800
but then pass,
that was another native American tribes,
but in the middle,

236
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.470
that's where you'd find all the fucking animals,
of course.
Is it like,
I get it,

237
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:39.910
nobody haunts me.

238
00:13:39.911 --> 00:13:43.510
Or they are worried about killing each other in the danger zone.

239
00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:45.980
So now I thought that's how it is that they figured that out.

240
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.530
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
