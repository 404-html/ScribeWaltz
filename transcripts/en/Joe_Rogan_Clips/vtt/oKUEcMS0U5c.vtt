00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.880
Sushi.
That's a,

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.720
I mean it feels like that you want Susan,
I'm some fucking power.
And I'm saying,

3
00:00:08.721 --> 00:00:10.450
can we get,
can we sell it to make some calls?
Calls,

4
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.510
take somebody out to my boy meat into the goddamn states,
but also news.

5
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.470
What does it say?
Well,
we've tried to get this Carmen retired.
Oh Wow.

6
00:00:18.471 --> 00:00:21.560
It seems like their nose.
No.
Insurancing fights and I'm not getting younger.

7
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.890
Let me explain.
Let me just lay my gloves down right here on.
Oh,

8
00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:28.550
he did it on Reddit.
Wow.
Wait.
Why is he done though?

9
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.140
Thank you to each and every one of you.

10
00:00:30.141 --> 00:00:35.141
It's odd to be healthy and unable to compete yet able to compete when so

11
00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:39.760
unhealthy.
I guess we end.

12
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.510
I don't know what that means.
I think he made a mistake there with never.
Oh,

13
00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:45.490
I guess we end with never knowing what could have been

14
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.390
somber would be the best bay to describe the emotion.

15
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.360
Thank you all for the love,
the insults and the great times.

16
00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:59.361
I will sync back into the mode of being a redditor and my quest to become a mod

17
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:03.570
here.
It was series sort of making a little joke there.

18
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.360
I am also on the hunt for a large fedora.
I'm like an eight and a half and hats,

19
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.810
moderate climates as Shane.
Seriously.
Thank you.

20
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.380
Often bottom of my heart for being an amazing,

21
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.000
if for being amazing and for making this sport amazing.
I thought he was retired.

22
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.250
He was coming back out.
Try and fight.

23
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.270
Did Bell towards just tell him no or something?
Yeah,

24
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.130
I think he just put his name in the hat.
You just called out mitre island.

25
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.590
He just literally two days ago he just said he wanted to fight as the ultimate.

26
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.510
Here's what it's weird.
It says it's odd to be healthy and unable to compete,

27
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.310
yet able to compete when so unhealthy mean it's odd that he's healthy now and he

28
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:39.480
can't get a fight.
Did they?

29
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.160
That means the commissioner maybe so and told him he kept fight or maybe belt or

30
00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:44.310
was like,
Nah,
we're good son.

31
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.300
Well I would never say he couldn't fight in terms of like the punishment he's

32
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:51.330
taken.
I mean there's like the junior dos Santos fight was tough to watch.

33
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.090
That was a tough one.
That was a tough one to watch.
He's had some tough fights,

34
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:58.470
but I mean,
a lot of guys have,
if you're going to let Overeem fight,

35
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.000
how could you not let Shane Carbon fight?

36
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.410
Unless it's like the spinal surgery stuff.
Yeah.

37
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.500
I'm not sure what's going on that,
but,
but also he could fight and rise again.

38
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.620
I would imagine that they would take care.
Bye Amy Buddy.
Bye.

39
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.000
You know that they had an issue with him where he was getting divorced and he

40
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.050
had some personal issues.

41
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.560
Apparently they were saying and he had a pullout of their tournament,
remember?

42
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.170
Yeah.
He ended up fighting.
They were very upset.

43
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.200
They were very upset and he backed out and they said,

44
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.860
they said some things about him,
you know,

45
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.060
not having warrior spirit or some crazy shit like that.

46
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.120
Relax rides and shit happen.
Yeah.
I mean,
not only that,

47
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:35.370
you don't want to have so many fucking heavyweights.
Yeah.

48
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:37.970
You're also rising sorts.
Relaxed.
And I'm Shane Carwyn back though.

49
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:40.990
Half Shane car went over there and a lot of them crawl correction,

50
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.980
but I pop him CurrComm wild west

51
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.300
golden snitch.
Yeah.
Just full on Mexican.
Stop.

52
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.160
Let the party role mix it up.
Especially mean chains in his forties right?

53
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.910
How old is shame?
Hell yeah,
he's in his forties yeah.
Let it roll.

54
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.170
Let it roll.
Raisins.
The spot.
I mean,
look,
we should have a steroid league.

55
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.050
We should have a league where some people are not.

56
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:12.760
Daniel Cormier essays for faces.
Volk on owes Demir at UFC two 20 and Boston.
Ooh.

57
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.950
Ooh,
wow.
Breaking news folks.
Breaking news.

58
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.310
[inaudible] scary.
But there's it.

59
00:03:20.311 --> 00:03:22.630
There's a guy who's got the quickest rise to the top ever.

60
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.280
This my face for that fight.
You don't care.
I care.
I'm lukewarm on it with those.

61
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:28.114
I love DC.

62
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.000
I love DC and I wish you was a bigger star and he should be a bigger star and I,

63
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.851
but I,
you know,

64
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:38.851
he's going to be phenomenal as a commentator and I think he flies through those,

65
00:03:38.871 --> 00:03:43.000
the man.
Do you really?
Yes.
Easily think,
oh,
zoom is dangerous for anybody,
man.

66
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.350
Anybody.
Good luck dealing with DC when he gets you in there clinch.
It's true.

67
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.300
It's true.
He's a monster.
Light heavyweight of all time.
Not named John Jones.

68
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.860
Whoa.
Strong ones.
Who's better?
Nobody.

69
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.350
He was the heavyweight champion twice.
Yeah,
twice beat.

70
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.930
Guthman he was the head of state champion Grand Prix.

71
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.070
Then think about the people in that Grand Prix.
Yeah,
Mary did the Josh Barnett.

72
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.120
The judge Brennan had a broken hand,
but through him up in there,
man,

73
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.740
we did a poor Dan Henderson.
How are the way DC,

74
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:19.300
how dare you treat our legend like that?
How dare you take an old,

75
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:22.900
whether Dan Henderson spike him on his head.
You son of a dog.

76
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.280
I mean he ragdolled.
I love DC man.
I liked that fight for DC.

77
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.470
I'm a owes them air fan.
I think be hilarious.

78
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.120
Has Champions this 700 Twitter followers.

79
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.740
But I think that DC is going to mop the floor with him.
Interesting.

80
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.720
Unless it's a barn Florida than stemer story.

81
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.290
I'm just interested in seeing what happens if,
um,

82
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.360
if he gets hit because those demeanor is very fast and hits very hard and has a

83
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:51.300
shocking reaction.
DC's been hit hard.
Oh for sure.
Rumble,
rumble rocked him.

84
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.420
Rock the rocks in it.

85
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:55.370
That overhand right in the first fight and the head kicked him in the second
she,

86
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.830
I remarried.
Sat him down cause he popped up.
Yeah,
I'll beat DC is a monster.

87
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.080
No doubt.
I'm just interested because I think,

88
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.200
oh was the mirror really does have special power.
You'll,
you'll,

89
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:06.130
you'll see him hit people.

90
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:10.600
You're like cheeses and according to everybody that watched him and rumbled

91
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:12.820
train,
like he was the guy that trained with rumble all the time.

92
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:15.160
It's one of the few guys that want to spar with what they say about it.

93
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.180
So they went to war.
Really would watch that,
watch that.

94
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.700
I would watch her mood happy.

95
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.570
That's one of the reasons why those to me are so good.

96
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.820
So that was the was like pump train with the,
and he was like,

97
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.340
everybody's carrying around ball.
The happy,
scared rod it.

98
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:29.770
They're not just knock each other out every day.
I think they're smart.

99
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.830
They hit each other just hard enough to you like let each other know they're

100
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:35.380
hitting each other and look,
you want a valuable sparring partner.

101
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.640
I mean if you take your toys,
yeah,
look,
it's benefiting the both of them.

102
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.350
Obviously.
Here's the one for you.
How about rumble ones?

103
00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:47.110
Come back at heavyweight rumble,
steep pay for the curve ball.
Here's the thing,

104
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.920
you can't really do that because he just fought as a light to every way and then

105
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:53.320
quit and said,
I don't want to do this anymore.

106
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.750
When he comes back and finds that a heavyweight and he's back,
Bro

107
00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.460
said he doesn't like fighting,
says
the rest of,

108
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.700
what do you say?
I don't like blood,
but I'm back.

109
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.480
I mean what happened was that retirement life ain't fun,
is it?
It's not.

110
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:09.261
It's boring.
Right.

111
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:11.750
And I had to spend two years and he knows he can be champion too.

112
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.200
Like he really does have championship skills,
you know what I mean?
He's got,

113
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:16.220
now he does for sure.

114
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.000
Unquestionably has enough power to knock out any human being.

115
00:06:19.001 --> 00:06:22.970
Have a p if DC and Jon Jones are out.
Yeah,
he's,
he's the guy.

116
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.270
If DC got hit with that upper cut that Glover got hit with,

117
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:30.320
he goes night night to Jones.
Those guys are too smart for that.

118
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.930
They don't fight that style.
Well,
they didn't.
Yeah.

119
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.490
Glover was too easy to hit for him,

120
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.290
but I think he realizes that anybody in the world,
I mean he literally,

121
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.750
he might have to have a hundred percent chance to beat anybody in the world,

122
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:44.540
but he might have,
no,
no,
no,
no,
not a hundred percent chance.

123
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.040
Do you know anybody in the world?
But I'm saying he might have like a 60% chance,

124
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.870
like in any fight with anybody,

125
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.740
he could connect with a bomb and put your fucking lights out.
He's that powerful.

126
00:06:55.010 --> 00:07:00.010
So that alone in his head means like if he fought Jon Jones 60% of the time,

127
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:02.090
he might be able to catch John Jones.

128
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.990
It might be if he caught John Jones or anybody,

129
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:10.460
he hits so fucking hard.
But he definitely froze up against DC.

130
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:14.060
And the second fight,
he did not look like a guy who was there to do or die.

131
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.840
Did he hit that path that they keep jacking off to?
Did he hit the,

132
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.040
I would like to see that.
I'd like to see that he hits harder than in Ghana.

133
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.300
Ghana was a lot bigger than him,
man.
Yeah,
but the Anthony Johnson is a up more,

134
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.440
he's more explosive.

135
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.040
Especially if you put at the Johnson on that healthy diet and he's the two 40th

136
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.810
the Johnson.
Yeah.
He's going to hit like a Mack truck.

137
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.110
Very interesting to see him in the heavy word.

138
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:41.390
Ansys rumble Johnson black on black power.

139
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.290
Kaepernick could show up for that bitch.
You got would be rumbles.

140
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:50.180
Got To have tickets.
I'll fight in heavyweight.
It's just gossip.
Oh my God,

141
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.190
he's ready to go.
No,

You get them.
That rush and dude,

142
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:58.070
it looks to choke people
who lets people

143
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.080
know he's a heavyweight.
He didn't think that I'm right.
I'm right.

144
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.840
And that poor soul to pull the Russian has no idea.

145
00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:12.500
I find black men and just fucking get starched.
Yeah,

146
00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:16.100
that'll be interesting as an interesting,
let's see what happens.

147
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.800
I want to see what happens.
Give was that guy.

148
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:25.280
Give him somebody who's,
you know,
can we get to encourage his mouth?

149
00:08:25.281 --> 00:08:26.114
They can get a choke.

150
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.240
The guy's going to come after him and the guy's going to come after him.

151
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:34.250
Alexia holiness.
Yes.
Howard [inaudible] Lexi.
Yeah.
Deepen his forties

152
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.770
same airlines.
Brian Cowen,

153
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.720
52 and 11 he's been through the fucking boring or you think he gives a fuck

154
00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:48.230
about how hard rumble hits now.
He'll tell you they're fine.

155
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.240
Take foot to be all day until the BOA constrictor.
Fucking write the Bolo.

156
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.090
Yeah.
That would be a fun fight.
And I be my head heavy heavyweight man.

157
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.230
Who the fuck knows what?
If he gets rumbled down,
what if he gets rumbled down?

158
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.870
We see him inside mount.
We're going on a rear naked choke from the side.
Yeah.

159
00:09:04.871 --> 00:09:07.260
Have was in trouble.
That mother fucker.
Oh,
it gets hold of your neck.

160
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.250
Rumbles in trouble.
If you get mount on him.
Man.
He like as a monster.

161
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.750
He's a monster from the bottom.

162
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.280
I'm sure he choked that dude out from his back mounted.
He gave it to him.

163
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.130
Crazy.
Crazy.
Yeah.
He's a,
he's a squeezer.

164
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.170
There's certain dudes that just can squeeze your neck.

165
00:09:22.171 --> 00:09:26.100
And I went out rum on the first round.
Might be the most dangerous man.
Oh yeah.

166
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.140
Wonder if maybe look,
I mean,

167
00:09:28.141 --> 00:09:31.080
I don't know how much weight he was cut to make two oh five.

168
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:35.610
But if he's really walking around at two 32 35 and that doesn't have to cut

169
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.920
anything,
he might be better at heavyweight.
So what I'm saying,

170
00:09:37.921 --> 00:09:39.170
let's give him on that punch meter.

171
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:45.060
She got Francis just give them a good fight of her doom from overdose

172
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.470
dude.
For Dude,
we're doing with kill your dreams man.

173
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.290
Who's a mother fucker who was a mother fuck is begun.

174
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.660
Strike that's on the world.
On the ground.
She's huge.

175
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.220
Me Give a fuck about the golden snitch cause he never been cut.

176
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.460
That doesn't take anything.

177
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.880
He had some issues for doom comes on for you and that you Jitsu is just on

178
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:09.890
another planet.
Dude.
How about,

uh,

179
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.950

Oh,
the black beast.
Remember,

180
00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.410
supposed to fight Derrick Lewis Fan.
We're talking about Derrick Lewis,

181
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:19.200
social media.
I used to have the best,

182
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.050

183
00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:29.910
Shout out to the black beans.
Some hilarious shit.
Fight soon.

184
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:30.451
But remember,

185
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:33.390
Derrick loose was fight for doomed and the like hours for the fight.

186
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:38.280
That guy can't do it.
So this filled in random homeboy and he was just happy.

187
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.500
They're Walt Harris Harris.
Just a hair business lock and

188
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.210
just fucking some beautiful transition when it took his back and then took the

189
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:51.360
arm off the bat.
He's teaching his students in tennis about the arm,

190
00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:55.690
but show it's fucking easy.
I show you how it was so easy for him.
Uh,

191
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.400
there's a pay day then fights that rush and goes five rounds.

192
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.300
That's why he won't be ready to fight Steve Bay and a Boston.
