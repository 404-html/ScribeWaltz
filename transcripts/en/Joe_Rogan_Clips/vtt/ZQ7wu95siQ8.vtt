00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.160
So one of the really lovely things that you can do is look for the past and then

2
00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:04.990
say,
well,
how does that manifest itself today?

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.990
And one of my favorite examples is the whites to your eyes.

4
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.090
So chimpanzees have brown eyes,
the Sclera around the cornea.
Ours are white.

5
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.540
Why would you do that?
Well then advertises the direction of your gaze.

6
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.670
Why would you advertise the direction as you gaze?

7
00:00:18.671 --> 00:00:21.040
Because what that says is it on average as a human,

8
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.400
when I look over there and see something,
I want you to know that I saw it.

9
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.910
You and I are probably going to cooperate to help us achieve whatever the goal

10
00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:29.380
is that I just encountered.

11
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.550
A chimp wants to hide it from its fellow chimps because it's competitive,
right?

12
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.680
On average,
whatever the hell is over there,

13
00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.590
you're not going to help me get it right.
Yeah,
exactly.

14
00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:41.350
You're going to make it harder for me to get it.
The chimps ever do that?
Hmm.

15
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.910
Amazingly,
amazingly groupers,

16
00:00:45.911 --> 00:00:50.830
an Octopi hunt together and they do that.
The groupers and Octopi work together.

17
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.440
So the group will be over the Great Barrier Reef.

18
00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:56.860
And the fish is gone in and he goes to the octopus and he goes it right there.

19
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.590
No one reason he doesn't give a shit about the octopus of course.

20
00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:01.900
But if the occupants goes to get it and doesn't get it,

21
00:01:01.901 --> 00:01:03.340
it's going to come out in the groupers.
Got It.

22
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.580
Cooperation always works better than working on your own.
Right.

23
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.231
<v 1>Wow.</v>

24
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:11.160
So is there real evidence that shows that the whites of our eyes developed in

25
00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:12.540
order to indicate which way

26
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.080
<v 0>we're looking at?
Well,
in all these cases,
all we can do is say,</v>

27
00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:18.160
let's do a little file,
a genetic analysis.
Who's got it and who does it?

28
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.720
We're the only great ape with whites to their eyes.
So 90

29
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.090
<v 1>this here's an octopus that's chillin.</v>

30
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.670
And is that a grouper?
No,
it's a weird looking for to spot it,
I guess.

31
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:31.620
I don't know.
Cause you to fall.
Look up.
They really pretty,

32
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:34.440
it looks like a coral trout to me.
Oh Man.
So what do I know?

33
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.690
Look how pretty that octopuses too.
Yeah,
they,

34
00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:39.790
they're really sad and fucking love octopus.
They can change colors like that.

35
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.840
Yeah.
We've gone down massive rabbit holes with these things for hours at a time.

36
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.060
Look at it.
It's changing right now is we're watching him.
So He's,

37
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.870
he's sitting there waiting and the fish tries to get out and the art yet

38
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.250
<v 0>and the group like a scratch.
Got You.
Yeah.
That's really cool.</v>

39
00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:58.450
The way they have the good sense to work

40
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.210
<v 1>together.
Look at the octopus is mad.</v>

41
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:04.530
It's getting dark or happy or how cool his skin is.

42
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:08.700
How it just changes and morphs as you're looking at it.
That is so bizarre.

43
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.230
What a crate.
I didn't,
you know,

44
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:14.070
I didn't know that they could do this until my friend Remy Warren came on the

45
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:17.970
podcast and he,
uh,
had a television show called Apex Predator.

46
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.590
And within on the show they would study,
uh,

47
00:02:20.591 --> 00:02:24.840
the various ways these animals would hunt and the way they would,
you know,

48
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:28.770
all there,
there are different adaptations to their environment,

49
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:32.300
all the different ways that they would use the environment.
And,

50
00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:34.530
and he would try to mimic those different ways.

51
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.970
And one of the things that they studied was octopus and,
uh,

52
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:41.170
what's that other fish?
That's like it.
The cuddle fish,

53
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.520
which is also the octopus is using this clamshell.

54
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.100
What is he doing?
He's lounging.
Picked it up.

55
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.840
Oh my God,
this is crazy.

56
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.710
Oh my God.
The octopus is climbing inside of clam shell and then he it,

57
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.910
that is bananas.

58
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.260
<v 0>There's a BBC blue planet where it shows the octopus picking up all that random</v>

59
00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:10.590
shrapnel when there's a shark coming after it and it covers itself like a big

60
00:03:10.591 --> 00:03:11.424
ball.
And then sharks

61
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.930
<v 1>keeps going.
Wow.
They're super smart Octopi.
Well they eat sharks.</v>

62
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.300
You ever see that one?
There was a video where they found,
um,

63
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.800
this aquarium was having an issue with sharks were disappearing.

64
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.250
They couldn't figure out what was going on.
And uh,

65
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.630
they put a camera inside the aquarium and it turned out that the octopus was a

66
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.483
waiting,

67
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.060
just chilling on the rocks till the sharks came by and they would snatch him and

68
00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:37.560
eat him.
Watch this.
It's really cool to watch.
He's like,
dude,
to do to who?

69
00:03:37.561 --> 00:03:39.660
Me Don't bother with me.
I'm just a piece of coral.

70
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.910
I'm just hanging out here being
like,

71
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.900
and cause he looks exactly even in texture like the coral,

72
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.160
which is so fascinating.
But when they found this,
they were stunned.

73
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.770
They had no idea that octopus could do that.

74
00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:59.490
Could not only did they could do that,
but that they would eat a shark.

75
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.430
And that's a big fight.
Fuck man.
It's not though.

76
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.440
You want to squeeze these emails said first,

77
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.340
but it's an easy fight I looks like is the thing about octopus though too?

78
00:04:08.341 --> 00:04:12.600
They could sacrifice a technical and it just grows back.
Really.
No big deal.

79
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.420
It's annoying.
But yeah,
I don't even know if it's annoying.

80
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:18.550
I mean we're just guessing,
right?
So there's a fascinating animal

81
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.530
twisting them up.

82
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.610
<v 0>There's an amazing case in Australia where a cooling brown is a biologist had</v>

83
00:04:26.611 --> 00:04:30.720
cuddle fish in his tank and they can signal like an Octopi octopus.

84
00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:31.650
They can do whatever color.

85
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.200
And in this tank he's got a bunch of females on one side,

86
00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:35.280
a bunch of males in the other.

87
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.030
So mail goes in between them and he signals to different sides of his body.

88
00:04:39.031 --> 00:04:41.910
He shows a female's,
he's male.
But he shows the males that he's female.

89
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.140
So they want attack him for a sidling up to the fee.

90
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.050
<v 1>Yeah.
What,
how smart is that?
It's weird.</v>

91
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.630
It's weird that they split off from us hundreds of millions of years ago.

92
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.340
Like as closely related to celery basically.
Yeah.
It's crazy.

93
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.210
But they're so smart and their eyes are similar to ours and like,
hmm.

94
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.730
In the the development,
okay.

95
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.470
<v 0>Actually it's the opposite.
So there our eyes are poorly designed.</v>

96
00:05:03.471 --> 00:05:04.430
There's a very well designed,

97
00:05:04.431 --> 00:05:09.230
so our eyes have all the detecting stuff is in its own way.
It's backwards.

98
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.500
And so the light comes in and has to pass all the cellular bodies before it can

99
00:05:12.501 --> 00:05:15.650
get picked up by the detectors.
There's aim in the proper direction.

100
00:05:15.651 --> 00:05:19.460
So the shit isn't in the way.
And we have this blind spot because the big thing,

101
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.800
the,
the nerve connection,
they don't,

102
00:05:21.801 --> 00:05:23.570
there's comes in from the back where it belongs.

103
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.400
So what that tells you is that yeah,

104
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.450
we both started out with some kind of randoms light sensitive spot and there's

105
00:05:29.451 --> 00:05:32.490
happened to work much better if you want to turn it into an eyeball of in ours

106
00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:34.130
did because evolution can always,

107
00:05:34.131 --> 00:05:38.540
it only can start with what you've got but deserves work better because they

108
00:05:38.541 --> 00:05:41.420
could see in water.
I mean is that the no,
I mean because there,

109
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.250
I think it's purely random that they don't have,

110
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.190
we do a great job of getting rid of the seg of their bodies that are in our way.

111
00:05:46.191 --> 00:05:48.260
So what your eye does is it weakens all the time.

112
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.330
And so if anything's retinal stationary,

113
00:05:50.331 --> 00:05:53.000
it's wiggling and equally with your eyeball,
you ignore it.

114
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.150
And so you don't even know.
You have your own blind spot,
you fill it in,

115
00:05:56.151 --> 00:05:58.460
your brain does amazing to fix the problem.

116
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.620
If you have a piece of lint on your eye or something like that,

117
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:02.720
if they were literally attached to vent,
she would disappear.

118
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.720
And because your brain says,
well that's irrelevant.

119
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.500
And so you can't see your own blind spot unless you close one eye and then you

120
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:11.360
sit there with a neutral background,

121
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:15.530
you move your thumb across in literally your thumbnail disappears because that

122
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.930
spot is just being filled in by whatever the background is.

123
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.460
And what happens with the octopus,

124
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.910
it doesn't have that problem because our nerve ending creates a blind spot by

125
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:24.180
being on the wrong side.
There's,

126
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.020
it comes in from the back and so the whole thing works beautifully.

127
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.550
They don't have to deal with the blind spot.

128
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.370
Would that be as effective though in the world that we live in?
Yeah,

129
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.940
it's a water area irrelevant.
It's purely,

130
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:39.410
it happenstance that the light sensitive pit that they had started to get

131
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:41.660
innovated properly from the back and ours didn't.

132
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.950
And then as ours evolved into an,
I mean,
of course we don't know.
This is just,

133
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.550
but as far as evolved to an I,

134
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:49.520
we just had to find ways around the problem that all the fancy structures that

135
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:53.060
we now need in front of it or in the way does anything have an eye like an

136
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:57.310
octopus that lives on land?
Great question.
I don't know.
I don't think so.
See,

137
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.480
I read something about eyes that they think that I got shit information,

138
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.180
prominent memory,
that they have an amazing memory.
All these shows,

139
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:09.410
these still sore away.
That's too many shows,
man.
I don't have any memory anymore.

140
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.960
So it's like full.
Yeah.
Like I'm not a hoarder.

141
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.230
Like my house is filled with the boxes of shit that I don't need.

142
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.140
That's how brains work,
but I'm afraid it is how brains work,
right?
Yeah.
