WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.030
But it is possible that some new form of some new form of particle,

2
00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:09.810
something else could be discovered.
Yeah that will know about it yet.

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.060
Cause we know,
almost know that there,

4
00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:15.060
there are other particles out there in the universe.

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.280
We almost know cause I think called dark matter.

6
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.450
So we look out into the universe and we see that there's a lot of stuff there

7
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:23.400
that's an interacting gravitationally,

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.170
but he's not interacting strongly with the matter out of which we are made and

9
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:30.230
the stars are made.
So it it,

10
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.300
it's almost certain that that's some form of particle that that fits

11
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:38.050
beautifully.
And we see lots of different observations,

12
00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:42.330
the way galaxies rotate and interacts and even the oldest light in the universe,

13
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:44.700
the so called cosmic microwave background radiation,

14
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.790
we see the signature of that stuff in that light as well.

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.140
So we think that there's some of the particle out there.
And,
and to be honest,

16
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:54.390
we thought we would have detected it.

17
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:58.800
I think at LHC where we have lots of theories called supersymmetric theories

18
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.640
that make predictions of all sorts of different particles that would interact

19
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:06.540
weekly with normal matter.
And I,
yeah,

20
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:10.740
I think it's broadly seen as a surprise that we haven't seen them at Lac.

21
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.520
So that just may well mean either they're,
they're very,
they're,

22
00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:16.710
they're a bit too massive,

23
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.820
so we need more energy to make them and we just haven't quite got enough or

24
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:23.220
we're not making enough of them often enough to see them,

25
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.530
which is one of the reasons we're upgrading the LHC.

26
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.180
So we also look for them by the way,
I'm directly,

27
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.840
so we have experiments and the mountains,
we vary them and demand sin.

28
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.260
So the cosmic rays from space don't interfere with them.

29
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.520
And we're looking for the rare occasions when these dark matter particles

30
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:44.760
bumping into the particles of matter in the detector.

31
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.200
So it's a the cause the idea will be these rooms full of them.
I mean the,

32
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.570
the galaxy swimming with that matter as far as we can tell,

33
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.080
but interacts very weakly with this matter.

34
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.060
So he doesn't bump into us very often.

35
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.230
So we are looking for the direct detection of it and we are looking to make

36
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:03.810
those particles LHC.
So it's everywhere,

37
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.980
but it doesn't interact with us very weekly.
Um,

38
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.810
so interacts through gravity and the,
the,
the,

39
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.500
the archetypical particle that's everywhere that doesn't interact strongly is

40
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:18.180
the neutrino.
So we do know about neutrinos.
We've detected those.
And there,

41
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.450
there are something like 60 billion per centimeter squared per second passing

42
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:27.060
through your head now from the sun.

43
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.430
So they get made in nuclear reactions in the sun,

44
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.550
but they go straight through your head and then be straight through the earth.

45
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.010
Pretty much.
Uh,

46
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:38.370
occasionally one of them bumps into something and we can detect those cars were

47
00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:42.590
so many of them going through.
But we only say,
you know,
I don't know,

48
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.860
one or two a day.

49
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.170
And the ideas that dark matter encompasses an enormous percentage of the

50
00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:50.640
universe.
Yes,

51
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:55.641
it's five times as much matter is it dark matter than is normal matter.

52
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.840
And the number is 25% of the universe.
So it was roughly speaking,

53
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.990
but 5% of the universities,
normal matter,

54
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.220
the styles in gas,
you know,
25% is dark matter.
Yeah.
So that,
yeah,

55
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.750
five,
no,
I'm at about 25 dark matter.
And about 70 is dark energy.

56
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.190
That's the other thing.
The other thing,
yeah.
So what the hell's that?
Don't know.

57
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.110
No,
what he does.
So again,
we'll see if we got it.

58
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.470
We talked about Einstein's theory earlier.
So Einstein's theory,

59
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.130
which works spectacularly well say,

60
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.930
is that if you put stuff into the university,

61
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:36.931
we said before then he walks and deforms and stretches and it very precisely

62
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.790
tells you,
given the stuff that you put in it,

63
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.750
how much does it stretch and how does it stretch?
And the,

64
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.050
the measurement we have is how,
how it's stretching.
So,
so we,

65
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:51.850
we observed the thing we observe is how the universe is expanding and how that

66
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:56.020
expansion rate is changing and how is that how it changed over time.

67
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.360
So we have very precise measurements of that.

68
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.890
So then we can use the theory to tell us what's in it given that we know how

69
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:07.360
it's responding to that stuff.
And that's how we discovered dark energy.

70
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.170
So we noticed that the university's expansion rate is increasing.

71
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.170
So the university accelerating in its expansion,

72
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.140
which is exactly the opposite of what we thought.

73
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.460
And this is in the 1990s that we discovered that so we can work out what sort of

74
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:26.230
stuff and how much of that stuff you need to put in the universe to make that

75
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:29.850
happen.
And that's where we get these numbers from.
Um,

76
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.100
was there resistance to that and that was first proposed?
Yeah,
I remember my,

77
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.170
one of my friends that Brian Schmidt and got the Nobel prize for that.
And um,

78
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.520
I remember I talked to him and he said,
uh,
it was a Postdoc,
I think at the time.

79
00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:46.300
So young researcher and he made it,
he's making measurements of Supernova,

80
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.930
the light from supernova explosions,
which are so bright that you can see them,

81
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.020
you know,
hundreds of million,
billions of light years away.

82
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.600
And he noticed that if you look at the data,

83
00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:58.450
the light is stretched in the wrong way.

84
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.590
So we look at the stretch of light as it travels across the universe and the

85
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:05.980
universe and expanding.
It stretches the lights so it changes the color.

86
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.990
And he noticed that there was a discrepancy,
which,
which said that the universe,

87
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.090
that the expansion rate is speeding up.

88
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.800
It's been speeding up from I think something like 7 billion years or so.

89
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:19.780
He's been speeding up.
Um,

90
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.030
so he thought these gentlemen wrong cause it,
you know,
so.
So he checked in,

91
00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:27.310
checked in,
checked it and he couldn't find anything wrong,

92
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.350
so he did what a good scientist does,

93
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:32.260
which is he published date so that somebody else could find out what he'd done

94
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:35.140
wrong and he said that he thought it would be the end of his career.

95
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.170
He thought I'd be a laughing stock and he got the Nobel prize because he was

96
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:42.100
right.
It is stretch.
Wow.
It's a great lesson.

97
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.810
Means that if you,
if you're sure that you can't see what you've done wrong,

98
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.200
then you publish it because of actually that thing about humility we talked

99
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:53.290
about earlier.
You know what we ultimately,
we're not trying to be right.

100
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.600
We're trying to find out stuff and so they're a scientists will be really happy

101
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:02.120
if they set out to be wrong because they've learned something that's there.

102
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.000
That's there.
It's good that you took because he got the Nobel prize.

103
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.740
Now when he received the Nobel prize in this concept started being discussed,

104
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.050
what was the initial reaction to it?
Well,
it's interesting cause it,

105
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.080
it's allowed in Einstein's theory and it was in Einstein's original theory.

106
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.870
So it's car,
it's got a name,
it's called the cosmological constant.
And that's,
um,

107
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.030
it's,
it just allowed in the equations.

108
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.890
And Einstein actually introduced it initially to,

109
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.730
because I signed the equations,

110
00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:38.480
strongly suggest that the universe is expanding or contracting and not just sat

111
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:41.540
there.
So even before we'd observed anything,

112
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.900
Einstein had a theory that suggested that the university just not static.
And,

113
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.670
and actually really strongly suggest that there's a beginning,
right?
So the,

114
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.510
the theory itself on its own suggests that you can see that if the universe is

115
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.640
stretching today,
that he must have been smaller in the past.
Right now,

116
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.020
everything must have been closer together.
Let's say that.
Um,
so the um,

117
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.060
as a magical George Lemaitre who was a,
who worked independently of Einstein,

118
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:10.250
but the same time in the early 1920s,

119
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.520
before we even knew there were other galaxies beyond the Milky Way,

120
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.840
and they notice that the,
the equations suggest the universe might be stretching.

121
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.720
Um,
and so he wrote to Einstein and said,

122
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:25.721
your theory suggests there was a day without a yesterday cause he thought if

123
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:28.910
everything is expanding now than it must've been close together in the past.

124
00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:33.320
And so there might be a time when it was all together and he was a priest.
Wow.

125
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.440
So it was a Belgian priest.
So I think,

126
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.500
I mean I wrote about this now it's just kind of mindset for station a bit,

127
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.740
but I think that he was more predisposed to accept what the equations were

128
00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:47.000
telling him because a beginning,

129
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.980
an origin for priest is really a nice thing because it tells you the creation

130
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.740
event.

131
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.740
And Einstein tried to dodge it and put this allowed term enthuse equation,

132
00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:02.510
which is the almost the stretchy term to say,
well,
if it's old,

133
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.750
if it's all kind of contract in or something,

134
00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.520
can I put something in to make it stretch a bit,

135
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:11.570
to balance it all out so it can be eternal and you can't,

136
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.320
you can't make it eternal that way,
but eat.
So he tried it,

137
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.770
they took it out and called his biggest blunder,

138
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.030
responded,
no eco putting it in his biggest blunder,

139
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.240
or at least some people think what he'd done was miss the prediction of the big

140
00:08:28.461 --> 00:08:29.750
bang.
Really?

141
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:34.970
So by trying to fiddle around to have a static universe that stable,

142
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.560
he missed what the equations were screaming.
His own theory was screaming to him,

143
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:44.720
which is that no,
the universe expands or contracts and he missed it,
right?

144
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.140
So I think that's probably what he meant by biggest blunder.
But in any case,

145
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:53.120
it took it out.
And then later in the 1990s it turns out the notes there.

146
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.480
But it's really small.
It's tiny,
tiny effect.

147
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:02.100
But it still dominate in the universe now.
And it will,

148
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.960
and it will dominate even more in the future.

149
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.640
So we think that we're in the universe that will continue to expand,

150
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.860
essentially doubling in size on a fixed time scale in which is about 20 billion

151
00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:17.460
years.
So within every 20 billion years into the future forever,

152
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.910
unless something happens,
the universe will continue to,

153
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.610
to expand and double in size.
