1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.210
Or a helmet.
Oh my God.
Eddie Bravo's here.
Jesus Christ.
You guys haven't showed

2
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.180
earlier.
We're having a great time talking about a two dimensional beings.

3
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.350
What's up,
bro?
I'll choke you out with this shirt.
Nassa any,
you know,

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.930
I'm gonna make you regret wearing this fucking shirt.
Hey,
listen to high school.

5
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:20.920
We used to choke each other out.
That's like a DMP.

6
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.070
Could go ahead and check me out on it.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Please don't.
Please don't.

7
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.590
I'm scared.
Let's do it.
No,
no,
no.
Eddie don't.
Please don't choke them unconscious.

8
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.970
No,
no,
please,
let's go.
He can't do it.
You know,
you think I'm afraid of this.

9
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:35.520
Let's,
no,
I,
I definitely don't think you're afraid of this,

10
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:40.270
which is why I don't want them to do it.
Touched,
not be pussies.
Choke me up.

11
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.790
Let me tell you a story first.
Let me tell you a story.
First.

12
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.750
Back when I used to work at the Strip club,
you're the one,
hold on Alex.

13
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:52.590
Sit down please.
Come on please.
We have to work together here.

14
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.450
Let's work together.
Come sit down.
Good luck and yeah,

15
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.090
have a seat.
Have a center.
Choke me out.
Alex please.

16
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.350
High School.
I know you did.

17
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:07.020
You told me he grabbed each other and you fall down and hit your heads.

18
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.870
It only takes like 20 seconds.
What were you gonna say about Strip club?

19
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.400
Back when I was a blue belt,
1995,

20
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.110
I worked in Strip club and,
and um,
there was this girl I was dating,

21
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:21.660
she never had any others.
She was a bartender.

22
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:25.940
She was seriously four foot 10 and bartenders and waitresses.

23
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.760
Always the best way to go to strip clubs.
I don't know.
You got to let him.
I will.

24
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.840
She was,
she was 92 pounds bartender,

25
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:37.050
the smallest girl and I showed her how to do a rear naked choke.

26
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:38.910
She was tiny.

27
00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:43.890
Her name is Kimmy and the Strip club manager.
What's your size?

28
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.060
Big used to be buff but Fidesz.
Yeah,

29
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.650
but used to be pumping football player type manager.
You know,

30
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:54.360
you want those guys that manage strip clubs,

31
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:56.220
you know the intimidating looking big dudes.

32
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.670
And he had a corvette and he didn't believe in Jujitsu at all and she said,

33
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.930
he said she could choke me out with one of them Jujitsu moves,

34
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.660
I'll give her the keys to my corvette.

35
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.480
So she had to literally get on a bar stool and she was standing on a bar stool

36
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:18.540
and had to go around him and she went like this and he was just like this.

37
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.110
And then he went out,
lights out,
he dropped like a sack of potatoes.

38
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.170
He hit his head on the fucking floor and the impact of his head hitting the

39
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.000
floor woke his ass up and say,

40
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.010
so we hit the ground and then he pops back up and then he didn't know what the

41
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:39.890
fuck happened.
I was just sitting there going,
no you wouldn't.

42
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.960
I thought he faked it,
but that's what I'm getting.

43
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.030
People usually don't kick the ground pop back up.
Usually they hit the ground,

44
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:49.620
they're done and they need an ambulance,

45
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.220
but he popped right back up and he's like,
what happened?
Like bitch,

46
00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:55.790
you need to give her your quarterback.
I'll pop right back up.
It was a,

47
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.710
it was a corvette.
Oh,

48
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.240
this was a thing I didn't about this about in the seventh grade.
During lunch,

49
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.870
some of the kids would choke each other out.
You put your hands up on their neck.

50
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.380
Kids don't do this.
I'm not teaching like Tom died box.
You can die doing this.

51
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.521
But then he'd be like,

52
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:12.850
the cheerleaders wanted to be shocked up and then they would show us out.

53
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:15.310
I probably did it about 300 times.
You go to school,

54
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.560
go to school where the bill hooks looks good.
He's not bill Hicks,

55
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:23.650
but we already went over.
This guy's talking about this

56
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.030
is you can put together a case where you fucking,
you know,
leave.
Can

57
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.870
you have just saw bill Hicks live?

58
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.970
I've known Alex since just a few years after all these guys.
Oh,

59
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.230
you got to see his old way.

60
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.780
Differs a bunch of holes for separation because you and I worked with somebody

61
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:45.490
that worked with him.
When you worked with thousands of people,

62
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.070
suddenly it's like,
oh,
we do the same person.
It's such overruled.

63
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.080
All you gotta do is just show those pictures of you like at 200 block this off.

64
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.150
I'm like,
Bill Hicks is never 20 and yoke you are you still jacked.

65
00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.140
You were like a bodybuilder and I used to run like,
I think it's,

66
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.870
I wish I get in that zone again.
You can.

67
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:05.530
I had gotten this young where I ran six miles every other day and I lifted

68
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:07.720
weights for people.
Go,
dude,
you'd be bigger if you can work out three hours.

69
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:11.980
I was addicted and then I got on radio and TV and like try to drinking and just

70
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:14.950
stopped and it didn't work out for like 10 years,
getting like a hundred pounds.
