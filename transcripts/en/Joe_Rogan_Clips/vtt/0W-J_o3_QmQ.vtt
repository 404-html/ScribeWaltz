1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340
It was Mr. Freeze.
Right.
But they've got to Ben AFLAC and they were like,
Nah,

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.770
player when I,
whoa.
Isn't that funny?
Like that's real,

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.130
like the amount of people that will see you as Batman.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.390
It's whether or not they really believe it.
Like Christian Bale,

5
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:16.800
I believe that God can be Batman.

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.060
But Michael Keaton for a longest time was Batman.
Yes.
But see,

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.740
he started it off.

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.390
See that the difference between Michael Keaton is there was no one before him

9
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:31.140
other than Bruce Wayne.
And he was the first dark real Batman.

10
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.030
I forgot about val Kilmer.
I forgot about val Kilmer.
God dammit.

11
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.800
Val Kilmer was fucking Batman.
What a talented human being.
Val Kilmer.

12
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.690
He's a beast.
Dude.
Him as a doc holiday.
Oh,

13
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.310
in that,
um,
what's his,
what's the name of that movie?
Tombstone.
God Damn.

14
00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:52.210
This is one of the best.
That's one of the best.
He was spooky ever.

15
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.900
He was believable.
That was a,
that was a straight up murder.

16
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.850
I still the most quoted,
but see,

17
00:00:56.851 --> 00:00:59.850
nobody will think back on Ben Affleck's career and be like,
he was Batman.

18
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.140
It's not just that he's done some good move.
Yeah,
but he's also,

19
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.890
he always says there's nothing around his career that he,
he must feel like,

20
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.980
oh man,
if if this goes bad,
it's going to ruin me.
He's done so many great things.

21
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.310
He's a very good actor.
Don't get me wrong,
but

22
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.690
what is it about him as he too handsome?
No,
because val Kilmer is gorgeous.

23
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:24.990
They're all,
but all those folks were very handsome.
Is it Gigli?

24
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.980
Is it him and Jennifer Lopez?
It's time for us.
It's a tough time.

25
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.950
She just say Giglio cheaply.
I think it was Gili.
Whatever the fuck it is.

26
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.430
Whatever the fuck it is.
Look,
not everybody should get that kind of pussy.

27
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.610
It's just,
it shouldn't be on your diet.
It's too rich for you.

28
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:43.920
Some people get diabetes,
right?
They need to lay off the sugar.

29
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.970
Everybody's got different tolerance cake every morning.
Jennifer loaf has,

30
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:48.720
obviously,

31
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.920
besides being beautiful and having a body like some sort of a test tube person,

32
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.710
some lab created super freak.

33
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.260
Obviously she knows how to throw that thing.
She knows how to throw that thing.

34
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.050
I mean,
it'd be hard to,
it'd be hard to argue with that fact.
Yeah,

35
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:08.810
that's some Goddamn Nolan Ryan Pussy Shit.
Look at,

36
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:12.810
yeah.
Yeah.
I together.
I am not unaware of what you're talking about.

37
00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:17.811
I love the fact that those things go so hard to go so hard and then they fizzle

38
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:21.210
out.
They just,
you know what it's like.
It's like having a,

39
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.250
like a pinto with a fucking corvette.
Zr One engine stuff.

40
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.640
Don't stomp on the gas on the highway and there's no structure to it,

41
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.400
but listen,
design,
those wheels are not designed for that relationship.

42
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.440
Is that why I'm no,
you live in Hollywood.
You're telling me.

43
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:41.430
Is that why these Hollywood relationships always like become huge and then go

44
00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:45.820
away?
Sometimes they do.
Sometimes they work.
I live in Montana animal.

45
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.100
Here's my thing.

46
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.630
This Alex Rodriguez guy that she's with super athlete smashes it.

47
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.810
Obviously it seems to be working.
They've been together for a long time.

48
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.970
How long have they been together though?
Months

49
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.490
play with the other six weeks.
She,
when she was with that little dog singer,

50
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.090
she got mad.
He was at the UFC that one time,
remember?
Oh,
that's right.

51
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.530
That's right.
And then she left.
Which one was that?
That was the dancer.

52
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.390
That was the dancer.
Can I,
can we take a quick,
like a kind of a PSA,

53
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:17.470
public service announcement.

54
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.920
Can we take a hard left of Jennifer Lopez and get ourselves every Kanye West

55
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:23.710
real quick?
Yeah,
we can,
but look at that Alex Rodriguez.
Okay.

56
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.690
Take a look at that man.
Super Athlete.

57
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:28.690
Probably got a Dick like a Goddamn baseball bat.
Right?

58
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.750
Anybody that has that many buttons.
Look at,

59
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.240
there's top buttons coming down size of his fist,
this size that guys,
Paul,

60
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.590
he said two plus $200 million contract.
Yes.
So He's,

61
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:43.591
he's just gotten $400 million in a giant hot super athlete.

62
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.590
Of course it's going to work.
It's going to smash.
You seem to keep it together.

63
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.860
Let's talk about hunting.
He knows that guy knows how to keep it together.
Right?

64
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.620
That guy knows,
he knows how to know when the ball's coming his way.

65
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:55.500
He smashes that fucking thing.
Right?

66
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.750
I think Jennifer Lopez is not tolerating any losers in her life at this point.

67
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.230
That's all that's left.
She's had a few,
but that's awesome.
Look at that guy.

68
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.010
There you go.
Super Athlete.
Big giant Hanson.
I'm a big sports fan.

69
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:09.310
I came up when he was just,
he was,
it was a god,
a baseball God.

70
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.830
They seem to get along together.
Seed.
That makes sense to me.

71
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.400
Just like it made sense with Val Kilmer was Batman.
They made sense to me,

72
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.680
but when Ben Affleck was Ben Affleck,

73
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.590
I don't know how his relationship was with her.
I don't know.
Maybe it was great.

74
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.940
It seemed like it was a tumultuous,
but I'm not.
I'm just observing.
I'm like,

75
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.210
do I know?
Nobody knows,

76
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.860
but there's like some people will you need to like have an online vote.

77
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.240
Should this person be Batman?
The people will tell you they would not have voted.

78
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:37.330
I do not believe they would have voted for Ben Affleck.
I do not believe.

79
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:41.560
Here's the problem.
Like the rock too big for that man.
Here's why.

80
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.480
Because everybody would be like,
oh,
it's you.

81
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:47.400
The Rock you wearing a fucking bat suit?
Is that the [inaudible] 69 they would,

82
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.120
they could do that in the movie.
They can make it funny.
It'd be like,
yeah,

83
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.070
are you in the movie?
They could make it funny,
but yeah,
right.

84
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.550
Is this the rock or the rock?

85
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.410
He could never be superman takes his fucking glasses.

86
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.600
I feel like you're still a giant dude.
The last time I shit doesn't work,

87
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.850
but that's how it works.
