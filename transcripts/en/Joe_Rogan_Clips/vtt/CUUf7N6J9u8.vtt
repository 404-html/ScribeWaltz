1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.860
Yeah.
And the,
you know,
people say,
okay,
it's a right,

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.560
but obviously there's a problem,
so we have to do something about it.

3
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:09.600
So you're going to have to give up your guns.
This is,

4
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:14.601
this is the common conversation and it's very flippant and it's not well thought

5
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:20.070
out and there's no con no consideration whatsoever to mental health issues.

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.740
I think Kickstarter,
this is Marcus.
I think that's the primary problem.
I,
that's,

7
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.630
I've been saying this from the get go.
I think it's the primary problem.

8
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:31.140
I think it's a mental health issue and people say,
oh,
that's simplifying it.

9
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.590
I don't think it is.
I think it's the opposite.
I think it's,
it's ignored.
Yeah.

10
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.800
It's,
there's something wrong when you have this many people on mental health

11
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:43.830
medication.
And then when you look at the number of bash shooters,

12
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.080
it's almost universal.

13
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.920
Almost every single one of them is on some sort of psychiatric medication.

14
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.220
But that's not a part of the narrative.
That's not a part of the conversation.

15
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:55.560
The conversation is always get rid of guns.
Now,

16
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.840
I don't want crazy people to have guns.
I don't think you do either.
No,
don't.
So

17
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.430
outside of taking away the rights to have guns from normal law abiding people

18
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:12.240
like yourself and myself,
I have guns.
What?

19
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.720
What do we do?
Okay,
so first of all,

20
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:19.140
I think we need to frame the conversation into specifics,
right?
You're a lawyer,

21
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:20.160
right?
I am.
Okay.

22
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.300
You understand bills and amendments and law.
Okay.
Yeah.

23
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.550
And so I think one word lumping the entire conversation into one category,

24
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.560
right?
If we're going to talk about school shootings,

25
00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:36.700
let's talk about school shootings.
Okay.
Right?
So the first thing I say is,

26
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.550
because one thing a lot of people on this I'd like to say is,
well,

27
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.660
you guys just don't want any,
any gun laws,
and you say no to everything,

28
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.950
but you have no solutions to just stand up for that.

29
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.060
It's because all they want to do is take away the guns.
Yeah.
They,
they're saying,

30
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.340
let's take away the guns.
Just saying,
we're not going to take away the guns.

31
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.600
You guys just don't want to get your guns taken away.
Yes,
you're right.

32
00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.440
No one wants to get their guns take away.

33
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.810
And then I get laid with a monster as a result of saying exactly,

34
00:02:01.811 --> 00:02:05.650
you want kids to die and it's a fucking real sneaky conversations.

35
00:02:05.651 --> 00:02:07.220
Disingenuine success.
It is.

36
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.660
And that's the odd thing about it is it's you.

37
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.770
Anybody who's paying attention to the discourse,
in a way it's happening,

38
00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:17.410
especially on social media,
right?
Anybody who follows my Twitter,

39
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.490
my Twitter account gnosis multiple occasions.

40
00:02:21.491 --> 00:02:26.290
I've tried to have a rational conversation with people who are on the complete

41
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.550
opposite side of my spectrum of,
of,
of this issue.
Is there any of this online?

42
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.470
They're like debates or anything like that?
Well,
no,

43
00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:35.990
I mean it's just on Twitter tweets going back and you can't do anything rational

44
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:39.150
on Twitter.
You can occasionally you can send it to God.
They're miracle.

45
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.420
That is a clown heart.
People being friendly.
You want to see me,
flustered,

46
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.290
respond to me rationally
cause I'm always,
you know,
I have this guard up.

47
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.360
Right,
right.
Of course.

48
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.800
And I actually had to check myself about that a little bit because how am I any

49
00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:55.390
better than the people on the other side?

50
00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.130
If I had the same at the same energy that they have towards me,

51
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.250
that's a very good point.
And so I've started,
you know what,
let me,

52
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.390
cause I can be incredibly snarky,
like I can't.
Um,

53
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.740
and it's partly due because of my friends.
They're all assholes.

54
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.820
They're just like all the friends I grew up with.

55
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.080
I grew up arguing with a group of guys who when they were losing it logically,

56
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.850
they went to jokes.
Right,
right.
And then a man pretty much,
right.

57
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.000
It took me a second to realize it cause I was the one that law school,
right.

58
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:30.460
I was the one that was going to law school,
pre law,
all that stuff.

59
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:33.700
So everything I did was focused and centered through the idea of logic,
logic,

60
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:35.350
logic.
You're not making any sense.

61
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:38.890
And then I'll crack a joke and everyone's laughing and I realized there's some

62
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:42.670
power to that.
Right.
You know,
humor.
I mean,
you should know something about that.

63
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.200
Just a little for sure.
Yeah.

64
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.380
And so I took on some of those qualities in a way that I advocate for firearms,

65
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.510
you know,
because it can be a little disarming.

66
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:56.260
But the disarming aspect of it can be beneficial because it causes people to

67
00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:59.440
drop their guard a little bit.
And then when you drop your guard,

68
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.810
you can take in information more objectively,

69
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.290
more so than waiting or looking for confirmation bias or instigating your

70
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:10.480
cognitive dissonance because you just don't want to hear the thing that con

71
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.010
that's contrary to what you already believe.

72
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.410
I just think you need a lot of character,

73
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.790
like as a person to be able to communicate reasonably on Twitter.

74
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.680
And there's a lot of people that are just lacking that.

75
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:23.890
So it's almost like the ability to steal and no one's looking.

76
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.280
The ability to just shit on someone with no eye to eye contact,

77
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.990
no social repercussions.
No.
You know,

78
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.010
you're not feeling anything from that person.
You say something rude to them,

79
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:36.670
they're not in front of you,
so don't feel terrible saying it.
Yeah,
no,
it's,
it's,

80
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.830
I'm not gonna lie.
So Twitter isn't dirty place.

81
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.490
It's a dirty place,
but it's a great place to,
sometimes it is.
