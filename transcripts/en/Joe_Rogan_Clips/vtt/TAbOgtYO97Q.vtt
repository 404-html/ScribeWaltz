1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.560
Do you attribute that to exhaustion or do you attribute that to a lack of

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:08.610
recovery from the previous night's workout?
Is it a combination of those things?

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.410
Is it exhaustion causing you to miss step perhaps and like twist an ankle or

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.650
turn a knee?
Yeah,
it's all of those things.
All those things.
I mean,

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.480
even if you look at micro balance,

6
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:22.140
if you look at sort of the stability muscles versus you know,
major muscles,

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.490
those stability muscles also fail when you're not getting sufficient sleep.

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.630
And I think we often underestimate how critical they are in sport performance,

9
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.850
particularly in terms of combating and placating injury risk to see if you just

10
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:38.450
get someone on a stability ball,
you know,
um,

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.110
sort of just dose them down with sleep eight hours,
five hours,
you know,

12
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.083
three hours.

13
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.460
And just notice how those stability muscles help you balance just the basic act

14
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:50.220
of balance that deteriorates dramatically.

15
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.610
No wonder you're getting more injury risk.
Totally makes sense.
Now,

16
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.660
as a neuroscientist,
what do you attribute when,
when,

17
00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:02.100
when people talk about visualization and visualization is a,
uh,

18
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.140
it's a huge factor in improving technical skills.
Uh,

19
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.000
specifically martial arts,

20
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:13.260
which is a big fan of obviously martial arts.

21
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.140
When you,
you visualize people who visualize,

22
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.160
who sit down and like go over their body,

23
00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:24.720
going through the motions and doing things there,
those people perform better,

24
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.460
they perform better,
they um,
they,
they learn quicker.

25
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:30.990
What do you attribute that to?

26
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:34.470
Do you think it's the same thing as what's happening when you're sleeping?

27
00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:37.830
Just maybe to a lesser extent.
I think it's to a lesser extent,

28
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.480
but people have done those studies where they've looked at sort of whether you

29
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:45.060
actually physically practice let's say on a keyboard,

30
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.090
just cause it's easier to sort of manage in Illawarra tree versus just imagining

31
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.790
sort of typing out that sequence and just the act of physical visualization,

32
00:01:56.311 --> 00:02:00.260
of sort of imagination of that motor skill.
It's,

33
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.070
it's about 50% as effective as physically performing it too.

34
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.840
And it's 50% as effective.

35
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:11.250
What I mean there is in changing the plastic connections within the brain.

36
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.800
So even just visualization,

37
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.370
passive play as it were still can actually cause a rewiring of the brain

38
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.390
beneficially.
Wow.
You know,
learning techniques,

39
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.710
specifically martial arts techniques.
Um,
my good friend Eddie Bravo,

40
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:33.440
so world famous Jujitsu instructor,
he's,
he's always um,

41
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.230
comparing it to tying your shoe.
And he said,

42
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.160
do you know how like when you were a little kid and you're trying to figure out

43
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:44.210
how to tie your shoe,
it's an extremely difficult thing to do.
You're like,

44
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.560
how do I do this?
And you put that down and do loops.

45
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:49.380
Like I'm watching my seven year old daughter go through that right now.

46
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.190
But now as a grown man,
when I tie my shoe,
I could just be talking,
you know what?

47
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.320
Oh yeah,
we're going to go tomorrow and I'll do it.
I don't,

48
00:02:56.321 --> 00:03:00.790
I don't even know what I did.
If you tried to ask me to how I tie my shoe,

49
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:02.620
I'd be like,
how do I tell my shirt?

50
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.130
Like I don't even know how I do it because it just,
I have it in there.
It just,

51
00:03:07.131 --> 00:03:11.690
it.
And the idea with martial arts is you've got to be eat.

52
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.060
All of your techniques have to be automatic.
Someone extends the arm,

53
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:19.010
you instantly hook it and go into the arm bar.
You know,
someone,
you,

54
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.860
you have to have these paths like so drilled in that you don't even know you're

55
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:25.730
doing them until it's over.
Yeah.

56
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.230
So automaticity is one of the things that sleep actually accomplishes.

57
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.280
I was talking about those 20 to 30% benefits in motor score performance.

58
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.090
So we did some additional studies to actually say,
well what,
how it,

59
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.500
how does sleep do that?
You know,

60
00:03:39.501 --> 00:03:44.270
where in your skill performance to sleep give you the benefit.
So you're right.

61
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.590
Tying a shoe lace,
um,
you know,
even driving a car with a stick,
you know,

62
00:03:48.591 --> 00:03:53.270
at first it's just overwhelming.
It's so difficult to clutch it's gas pedal,

63
00:03:53.271 --> 00:03:57.830
you know,
it's gear and now it's just second nature.
You know,

64
00:03:57.831 --> 00:04:01.940
it's shifted from conscious to automatic,
from conscious and unconscious.

65
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.980
If you look at performance that is conscious and not automatic,

66
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.190
it's usually very staccato.
It's this,
then it's that,

67
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.990
then it's that it's not fluid.

68
00:04:11.991 --> 00:04:15.080
If you had someone trying to sort of play piano to begin with,

69
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.490
doesn't sound very fluid.
You know,
someone who is a maestro,

70
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.960
it just flows out of them.
So we looked at this with motor skill performance.

71
00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:28.380
Again,
sort of like keyboard playing musicianship and you learn and you learn,

72
00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:31.980
you get better.
And let's see that you type a sequence that take four one,
three,

73
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:34.020
two,
four and people learn it,

74
00:04:34.021 --> 00:04:37.260
but they have these problem points throughout the sequence.
They go four one,

75
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.980
three,
two,
four,
four,
one,
three,
two,
four as if it's,

76
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.270
there's a sticking point.
It's the same thing with any skilled performance in,

77
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.350
in athletics.
And it's the brain chunking things up.

78
00:04:49.351 --> 00:04:53.670
A very long motor sequence gets chunked up into small sort of digestible bites.

79
00:04:53.671 --> 00:04:57.840
It's a good way to begin learning,
but it's not a way to create automaticity.

80
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.703
At some point.

81
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.760
What you have to do is stitch all of those things together and it just flows

82
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.260
like a sentence.
Like a sentence.
Yeah,
like a piano piece,
like a,
you know,

83
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:10.710
a sequence of movements.
If you've got,
you know,
in martial arts you've got,

84
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.880
you know,
so what we found was that before sleep,

85
00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:18.660
you've got these big problem points,
these gaps in your motor skill.
Learning.

86
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.830
Sleep does not necessarily improve the places where you're already good.

87
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.210
Sleep is intelligent.
It goes in fines,
that problem point,

88
00:05:27.211 --> 00:05:30.930
that friction point in your motor skill sort of deficit,

89
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.160
and it smooths it out.
So you come back the next day and now it's just four,
one,

90
00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:36.740
three,
two,
four,
four,
three,
two,
four,
four,
three.

91
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.800
It's automaticity and it's exactly what you're describing,
you know,

92
00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:43.170
speak to musicians.
They'll say playing.

93
00:05:43.171 --> 00:05:45.480
I just couldn't get that piece the night before.

94
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.200
And then it came back the next day and I sat down and I could just play.
