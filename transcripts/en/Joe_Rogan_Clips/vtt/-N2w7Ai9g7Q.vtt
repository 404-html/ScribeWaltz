1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.750
I mean,
how much of what,
what people experience when it comes to the,

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.110
the word depression,
how much of it is their life going?

3
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:10.590
Bad tragedy,
poor health,

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.350
bad job choices.

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.000
How much of it is some sort of a weird genetic thing?
How much,
I mean,

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.180
there's so many variables as to what causes depression,

7
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:25.940
but such a giant number of people suffer from depression.
Well,

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.160
I think it's,
I think it only,
if I'm being honest,

9
00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:30.930
I think it's going to get worse.
You know,

10
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.040
like you look at the way we live and the,

11
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.910
the closer and closer you've spoken about that we're just talking about fucking

12
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:37.800
New York.
We're not meant to be that confined.

13
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.480
We're not meant to sit out like with were withheld from the fucking sun right

14
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:43.170
now.

15
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.840
So many of these things communicate with our bodies and working with a genetic

16
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:47.160
specialist ran for a singer.

17
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.160
He was on Chris Ryan show sunlight influences 500 on off switches on our

18
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:58.200
epigenetic level for the,
for the good,
unless you fucking overdo it,
right?

19
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.590
500 500 plus on off switches in our DNA are affected by sunlight positively,

20
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.400
right?
I mean there's,
they look at vitamin D three takes that,
for example,

21
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.690
they're calling that a hormone now,
not a fucking vitamin real is,

22
00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:15.930
it's a messenger.
That's how much it influences in the body.
Incredibly important.

23
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.170
So when you think about all these things like being barefoot,

24
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.720
being connected to the earth,
going in the fucking ocean,

25
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.880
science will catch up in certain ways,
but we get fixated on the thing.

26
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:31.260
We get fixed in a fixated on our phones,
on whatever TV is going on.

27
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.840
We're closed off from other people.
We think,
you know,

28
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:37.530
communicating through Facebook is the same as being fucking face to face.

29
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.580
It's not,
you know,
and the more we head that direction and we're putting,

30
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.661
you know,
as you put it,

31
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:46.170
put in fucking shit food in our body from mouth pleasured that influences the

32
00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:47.430
brain,
right?

33
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.270
80 to 90% of all of our neurotransmitters are made by the bacteria in our gut.

34
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.600
So you think the shit meals just going to put on five pounds?
It's not.

35
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.360
It might put on five pounds,
but it's going to fuck your brain up for a while.

36
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.620
You make you a little bit more emotional fuck with your,
your,
your sharpness,

37
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:05.100
your memory recall.
All that's impacted.
Sleeps impacted.

38
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.580
I wish Michael Walker talked a bit more about that and it's don't think it's in

39
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:11.750
his wheelhouse.
I don't think it is.
He's a,
he's just to go studies,

40
00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:16.750
sleep and the effects on it,
but fuck,
was that in illuminating?

41
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.000
Yeah.
Eyeopening.
Don't know.
Cast was so important to me.
It was fucking fantastic.

42
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:25.560
I think his book is really good,
but as far as like dialing in sleep,

43
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.970
it's more of this is what happens when you don't sleep.
Sleep,
the book,

44
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:33.060
sleep by Nick Little hills is probably my favorite because that gives you all,

45
00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:38.061
it's a fucking how to guide on how to maximize sleep and when you were younger,

46
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.900
lack of sleep didn't affect you the way it affects you now,
right?
Correct.
Yeah.

47
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.330
Everything he talks about like that,
would that shift that you have,

48
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.930
that happens in adolescence where you become a night owl?
No doubt,

49
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.320
and I probably still could stay out a little bit later until having a kid and

50
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:54.770
then that's your,
your immediate reset bitch.

51
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.980
You're getting up when the sun comes up.
Yeah.
Be prepared,
sir.

52
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.710
Get ready.
Yeah.
It's,
um,

53
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.070
there's so many different factors that lead to a healthy body,

54
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.960
but how much of a healthy body leads to a happy mind?
That's where it gets like,

55
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:14.950
you can't blame some of these people that are suffering from like a disease.

56
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.860
Some of these people that have like something wrong with the way their brain is

57
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:19.900
producing these happy hormones.

58
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.810
I don't think you can say it's just this one thing like,
well,

59
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:25.720
if you just eat clean or if you just went Quito or you just stay Paleo,

60
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:27.820
then you wouldn't have depression.
I don't think that's it at all.

61
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:30.100
But certainly that's a factor.

62
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.160
It's certainly could be a fact being in nature,

63
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.520
being in nature as a fact and unpacking trauma.

64
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:41.470
Gaba motto says at the heart of all fucking addiction is some form of trauma.

65
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.340
Yeah,
I'm sure.
Completely makes sense.
Yeah.
His,
uh,

66
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.700
his theories on that are fascinating.
It's,
I never thought about that way,

67
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.290
that some form of trauma during your developmental stage is led you to seek out

68
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:58.060
this weird,
crazy feeling and experience when you,
uh,
have,

69
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.120
have you known many people that have had like serious addictions,

70
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.020
like meth or,
oh,
yeah,
yeah.
Uh,

71
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.200
without naming names,
people very close to me.
Family members.
Uh,

72
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:15.730
I've been addicted to Meth,
lost a cousin to pills.

73
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.950
Um,
I've been going to Aa,
not for me,

74
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.450
for a family member since I was three years old.
So I've seen that,

75
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.060
you know,
what if is now,

76
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.090
now is that trauma based is like everything because pills don't pills just get

77
00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:38.020
kind of get everybody.
Yeah.
Pills can get everybody.
There's no doubt about that.

78
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.800
Um,
the wing yourself off.
There was this show with some trauma there on a,

79
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.770
in all of those circumstances.
And I'm not saying,
you know,

80
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:47.830
pills can fucking grab you.
There's no doubt.
Um,

81
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.750
but certainly with the meth and,
uh,
the alcohol,
which was other things,

82
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.730
you know,
no doubt there was trauma there.

83
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.350
You have known of quite a few people that got fucked up on pills after

84
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:01.960
operations or injuries or stuff like that.
But,
um,

85
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.330
I know quite a few of them that it kicked it,
you know,

86
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:07.030
that just realized it was happening when whoa down,

87
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.330
like [inaudible] talked about it quite a bit when he fought cro cop,

88
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:11.710
his nose was destroyed,

89
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.760
so they had to rebuild his nose and he started taking pain pills and he said

90
00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:16.151
after a while,

91
00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:18.820
he's just taking them every day just because we wanted to take him.

92
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.780
And then his friends came over and cleaned out.
It's a medicine cabinet and like,

93
00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:24.310
cut the shit,
dude,
you're four months later,

94
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:26.920
you're still taking these things all day long.
You can't do that anymore.

95
00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:30.620
And he's like,
whoa.
He said he almost didn't even realize he was doing it.

96
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.340
It just kind of caught a hold of them.
Yeah.
Shit becomes habit,

97
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.370
especially when it's that euphoric.
It must be amazing.
