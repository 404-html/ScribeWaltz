1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.220
Uh,
unfortunately,
uh,
I was,

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.550
I was reading that and then I got on a flight and I just wanted to zone out and

3
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:07.260
said,
listen to this one on tape.

4
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.620
<v 1>Okay.
All right,
well I'll tell you all about it.
Um,</v>

5
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.990
but the key thing is that that book,

6
00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:15.140
the calling the American mind was something that we wrote because Greg began

7
00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:19.070
observing this weird stuff happening in universities in 2014.

8
00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:24.030
It all starts in 2014.
Um,
most of your listeners have heard about safe spaces,

9
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.010
microaggressions,
bias,
response teams,
trigger warnings,
all that stuff.

10
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.450
That stuff didn't exist before 2014.
It just begins creeping in then.

11
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:36.890
And then it kind of blows up in 2015 and so her whole book is an explanation of

12
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:40.010
why,
why did this happen?
And so to your question about,

13
00:00:40.011 --> 00:00:45.011
was there an event I or answer is there are six different causal threads.

14
00:00:45.261 --> 00:00:47.060
There's like all these social trends,

15
00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:52.010
some going back to the eighties and nineties that came together around 2014 so

16
00:00:52.011 --> 00:00:54.140
that students are a little different.

17
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.470
And then there are certain forces acting on them that are different.

18
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.130
And so you get this weird new game,
you get this explosive mix,

19
00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:05.720
you get some students who are actually very drawn to grievance studies.

20
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.580
Uh,
and so,
um,
very briefly like the,
it's things like,

21
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.270
um,
rising political polarization.
So left and right.

22
00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:17.510
Never particularly liked each other.
But in the seventies and eighties,

23
00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:20.660
if you look at surveys done of how much you hate people in the other side,

24
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.830
it's not that intense.
It begins going up in the,
in the 80s,

25
00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:29.500
and then especially after 2000,
it's going up very steeply.
Uh,

26
00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:30.710
at the same time,

27
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.520
university faculty who've always leaned left throughout the 20th century,
uh,

28
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.700
but it was only a lien and in the 90s,

29
00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:41.180
it begins shifting much further left so that now faculties,

30
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:44.650
especially in the social sciences and humanities are pretty purified.

31
00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:45.860
They're overwhelmingly on the left.

32
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.570
So you have a more left leaning university at a time when left.
Right.

33
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:52.880
Hostility is getting more and more intense.

34
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.850
And so any question that has a political valence,

35
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.400
now there's a lot more people that want to do the football game,

36
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.430
not the truth seeking,
but then we got to defeat the other side.

37
00:02:01.431 --> 00:02:03.350
Don't give me nuance,
don't give me data.

38
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.530
We know what we believe and dammit we're going to,
you know,

39
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.780
so he got this changing political situation and then you've got a couple of

40
00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:16.270
threads about what we've done to kids.
So,
um,
uh,
and to have,
God,

41
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.050
this is a whole nother area conversation for us,

42
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:22.440
but we basically took away free play and gave them social media the same

43
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.410
basically kids who were born in 1995 and after Gen z they had really different

44
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:31.550
childhoods and they're not as prepared for conflict and,

45
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:35.300
and college.
And we'll get into that later.
But you put all these things together,

46
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:40.020
you get kids who are much more anxious and fragile,
much more depressed,
um,

47
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.100
coming onto campus at a time of much greater political activism.

48
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.880
And now these grievance studies ideas about America's a matrix of oppression and

49
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.560
look at the world in terms of good versus evil.
It's more appealing to them.

50
00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:53.420
And it's that minority of students.

51
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.870
They're the ones who are initiating a lot of the movements.

52
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.080
<v 0>Such a strange time to be on the,
and watch</v>

53
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.750
<v 1>this because a person like myself is always counted on intellectuals and</v>

54
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:09.751
professors and people like yourself to sort of make sense of things and to

55
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.320
reinforce the idea that freedom of speech and free debate are critical aspects

56
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:17.920
to knowledge.

57
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.390
And one of the things that's most disturbing you see in schools is people that

58
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.930
are even marginally right leaning or centrist being called Nazis and being

59
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:32.530
silenced,
and they're pulling fire alarms when they're speaking.

60
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.090
And even people like Christina Hoff summers who's a feminist gets shouted down

61
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:40.870
and,
and people yelling at her and calling her a fascist.
It's just very strange.

62
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:42.520
It's very strange to watch from the outside.

63
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.240
And it's also very strange to not see any pushback by the professors.

64
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.080
So sitting here and seeing this happen and thinking,
well,
these poor kids,

65
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.230
they're,
they're going to have to go into the workplace.
They're going to have to,

66
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.900
they're there right now during this very insulated environment.

67
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.120
They're going to escape that environment when they graduate.

68
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.500
And then they're either going to push this ideology,
uh,
into the workforce,

69
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:06.910
which you do see now that's a,
especially with 10 classmates.
Yeah,
that's right.

70
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.660
Now.
That's right.

71
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.420
I know it's strange to look at it from the outside and believe me,

72
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:13.540
it's stranger from the inside.
But one thing I can say that,
um,

73
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.930
that might be helpful here is that from the outside,

74
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.730
what you see is the news reports and the news reports are going to be very

75
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:25.600
selective.
And so especially what happens is because,
you know,

76
00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:29.230
universities have always leaned left and so the right leaning media have always

77
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:30.100
been suspicious.

78
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.610
So the right leaning media has huge coverage of every little thing.

79
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.760
And sometimes it's,
it's exaggerated.
Sometimes it's misinterpreted.
Um,

80
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.860
the most time there was something there,
left leaning media tends to ignore it.

81
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.880
And so I go around the country and you know,
people in the right expect that,

82
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:49.390
oh my God,
it's chaos and mob violence on campus,
which isn't true.

83
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:52.300
That's an exaggeration.
And the left is like,
problem,
what problem?

84
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.900
There's nothing changing.
Um,

85
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.240
and so I think the key thing to keep in mind here is that there's about 4,500

86
00:04:58.241 --> 00:05:00.340
institutions of higher education in this country.

87
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.280
Most of them are not selective schools.
They'll take anyone who comes,
um,

88
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.390
and in those schools,
not much is happening.

89
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.430
But if you go to the elite liberal arts colleges in the northeast and the west

90
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:16.240
coast,
then usually something is happening.
And so,
uh,

91
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.440
at Heterodox Academy,

92
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:19.960
it's a group that I cofounded a professors that are pushing back.

93
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.010
It's bipartisan.
We have as many people on the,
on the left is on the right.
Um,

94
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.060
we created a map of where all the shout tons have taken place and they're all

95
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:31.720
right in the northeast or along the Pacific coast,
like from,
you know,
evergreen,

96
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.340
you know,
down to Berkeley and all that.
Uh,
and then a couple in Chicago.
So from,

97
00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:39.280
in most of the country this stuff is not happening.
Most schools,

98
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:43.870
the culture hasn't really changed much,
but at the top schools in general,
it has.

99
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.030
Um,
so that's one thing to just keep in mind.

100
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:49.000
There is a moral panic on the right about this,

101
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.650
which doesn't mean that there's not something real,

102
00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:52.420
there really is a huge problem,

103
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.850
but it's not as pervasive as it sometimes made out to be.

104
00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.090
So is it a kin to looking at violence in the news media like you,

105
00:06:00.251 --> 00:06:04.640
your,
when you read about violence in terms of robberies and murders in general,

106
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:09.020
you're not gonna encounter much in your life.
The world is a large place,

107
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.500
but we concentrate on these really bad moments.
Yeah,

108
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:17.010
it's a little bit like that except that,
um,
you know,
um,

109
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.620
one of the reasons that we took child,

110
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:22.550
we took free play away from kids is that we were afraid that they'd be abducted

111
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.790
and that almost never,
and that was so rare.
Uh,
and,

112
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.030
but we got a lot of coverage of that in the eighties and nineties and we changed

113
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:31.640
our behavior because of that.
And that was a gross overreaction.

114
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.980
The situation on campus is,
is not like that.
It's,

115
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.530
it's your odds of being nailed are much higher than that.
Um,
and so,
you know,

116
00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:40.430
I hear every day,

117
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:43.730
or at least every week I get an email from a professor who says,
you know,
I,

118
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.450
I used a metaphor in class and somebody reported me.
And like,
you know,

119
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.260
and so once this happens to you,
you,
you pull back,

120
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:52.520
you change your teaching style.

121
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.800
What we're seeing on campus is a spectacular collapse of trust between students

122
00:06:57.801 --> 00:07:01.900
and professors.
And when we don't trust each other,
we can't do,

123
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.650
we can't do our job.
We can't,

124
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.970
we can't risk provoking being provocative,

125
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:11.240
raising new ideas,
raising uncomfortable ideas.
We have to play it safe.

126
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.520
And then everybody suffers.
Is social media partially to blame because it's huge.

127
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.600
Social media's a huge part of this problem.
So,
um,
uh,

128
00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:25.590
in a couple ways,
um,
so one is the generational thing that we have,
um,
uh,

129
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.510
kids born after 1995 got this in middle school.

130
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:31.040
It had a variety of effects on them.

131
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.210
So kids coming in are more conversant with call out culture.

132
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.170
And so that's a big part of this.
Um,

133
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.600
the other thing though is that we used to have what you would call a reasonable

134
00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:46.520
person standard.
So,
uh,
you know,
so,
um,
you know,
for professor,
uh,

135
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:49.550
what's one now?
So professor just wrote to me recently,
he said he,
you know,

136
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:52.700
he got frustrated while trying to explain something and he said,
oh,
shoot me now.

137
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.720
Um,
and a student was offended by this because are you making fun of people

138
00:07:56.721 --> 00:08:00.650
committing suicide and okay,
you know,
add,
she come to him and said,
you know,

139
00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:03.380
professor,
I know you didn't mean anything,
but that was kind of incentive.

140
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.900
That would have been great.
Like that's the way to handle it.

141
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:10.820
But for this generation raised with call out culture and social media,

142
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.680
you almost never hear of a student coming to someone else in private because you

143
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:16.730
don't get credit for that.

144
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.700
So you only get credit when you call them out publicly.

145
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.120
And so that's why we're all walking on egg shells because most of our students

146
00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:26.660
are great.
Most of them are fine.
But if I have a class of 300 students,

147
00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:27.560
a lecture class,

148
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:32.150
I know that some of them subscribe to this new call out culture safety as a

149
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:36.350
morality.
And so if I say one thing,
it's not a reasonable person standard.

150
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.630
It's a most sensitive person standard.

151
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:41.450
I have to teach to the most sensitive person in the class.

152
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.310
It's also that person has the opportunity to score right there.
Exactly.

153
00:08:46.311 --> 00:08:50.240
Throw up that virtue flag.
Like I've got one on the board here.
Look what I did.

154
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:55.241
I nailed the professor on saying shoot me now and now I'm a hero and I made this

155
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:58.770
a safer space for everybody else.
That's right.
And so and so.

156
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:03.030
That's really what is messing us up at so many levels of society and the fact

157
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:06.630
that a lot of these problems,
the difficulties of democracy,

158
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:09.200
the rise of authoritarian populism,
that there,

159
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.960
there are a lot of weird trends that are happening in multiple countries and I

160
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:17.961
think it's the rise of devices and social media is the main way we can explain

161
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:22.480
why it's so similar across countries.
Do you think that this is us,

162
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.910
is this some sort of a trend that will eventually correct itself when these kids

163
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:30.270
get out into the real world and then go through a whole generation of that and

164
00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:34.590
then people realize the error of their ways and the disastrous results of having

165
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:37.860
these unprepared or emotionally unprepared kids?
No,

166
00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:40.110
I'm pretty confident that it will not correct itself.

167
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:42.870
I think that once we understand it,

168
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.270
I think there are a variety of things we can do to change it.

169
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.330
But I think here's the way to understand it and why it's not going to change

170
00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:53.070
itself.
So,
so I'm a,
I'm a social psychologist is my main,
my main area.

171
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.800
Um,
but I,
I love all of the social sciences.

172
00:09:55.801 --> 00:10:00.390
I love thinking about complex systems and systems composed of people are really

173
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:03.720
different from systems composed of stars or new neutrons or anything else.

174
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.400
And so,
um,
if you have a complex system composed of people,

175
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:13.710
these people are primarily working to increase their prestige.

176
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.000
So,
I mean,
once we have our needs for,
you know,
food and things like that are set,

177
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:22.020
we're,
we're always interacting in ways to make ourselves look good,
uh,

178
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:26.280
and to protect ourselves from being nailed or accused of something.

179
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.920
So we're always doing reputation management.
Now.
Um,

180
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:33.060
think about in any group,
what gives you prestige.

181
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.870
And so if you look in a group of teenagers,
you might have a group,
uh,

182
00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:40.530
in which it's athletics.
And so if that's how you get prestige,

183
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:44.070
then all the kids are going to be working out and training and practicing.

184
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.470
And that doesn't hurt anybody.

185
00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:49.470
That doesn't impose an external cost on anyone else.

186
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:54.500
But you can have some really sick prestige economies.
Uh,
and so there's,
um,

187
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.120
there's an ethnography about a fill a,

188
00:10:57.121 --> 00:11:01.910
I'm an indigenous population in the Philippines,
uh,
by Shelly Resolve.

189
00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:02.970
I was the anthropologist,

190
00:11:02.971 --> 00:11:05.850
I think it's called knowledge and passion about the along good,

191
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.850
which is a name for a,
a tribe in the Philippines.
And in this tribe,

192
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:13.320
it's a headhunting tribe.
They find people and cut off their heads,

193
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.940
not just for fun,
for prestige.
So in a lot of societies,

194
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.930
you have a lot of male initiation.
Boys have to do something to become a man.

195
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.890
And if the thing you have to do to become a man is you have to cut off someone's

196
00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:27.360
head.
Okay?

197
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.770
So that imposes rather a heavy cost on outsiders.
All right?

198
00:11:31.771 --> 00:11:34.380
So this is a sick culture.
This is not one where we can say,

199
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.130
oh well that's just the way they do things.
Okay,
this has to stop.
Um,

200
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.100
and ideally they would cut off a stranger's head.

201
00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:43.390
Like they find someone from another tribe or someone,
you know,

202
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:47.370
from a government agency,
they're just cut off his head.
Um,
uh,

203
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:48.630
but if necessary,

204
00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:51.750
if there's a fight or if there's somebody within their larger community that can

205
00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:55.950
also get you points.
So this is a really sick culture now head now,
um,

206
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.010
call it culture is not quite that bad,
but it's the same logic.
Okay?

207
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.160
So if you have a group of teenagers or college students who are all struggling

208
00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:06.550
for prestige as we all are,

209
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:12.030
and if you get a subculture in which the way you get prestige is by calling

210
00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:15.400
someone out,
showing that they're racist,
sexist,
homophobic,
transphobic,

211
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:19.390
Islamophobic,
whatever it is.
If you can catch them,
you get the points.

212
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.560
What you're doing here is your imposing external costs on others.

213
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.800
And that's what makes you so insufferable because you are playing your game.

214
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:34.000
But I'm paying the cost of your game.
And so that,
I think it's hard,

215
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.400
people aren't going to break out of that themselves.

216
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.410
But once we understand what's happening,

217
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.230
I think in a sense we can all come together and call out,

218
00:12:41.231 --> 00:12:44.710
call out culture and say,
stop,
stop imposing these costs on us.

219
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.020
<v 0>But how are we going to reach those kids if professors are so terrified to speak</v>

220
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:53.590
out and to cause controversy in class and no one wants to criticize them?

221
00:12:53.591 --> 00:12:57.400
Because if you do,
you risk your job,
you risk them organizing against you.

222
00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.810
And how does this shift?

223
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.960
<v 1>So the,</v>

224
00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.540
so I'm hopeful that we can shift it because most people hate it.

225
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.280
So even the people who do and recognize that they're always on eggshells,

226
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:13.360
they can be next.
Um,
there's the tendency of people in this culture to,
you know,

227
00:13:13.361 --> 00:13:16.650
as we say,
they eat their own,
they eventually turn on each other.
Um,

228
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.000
and the mental health costs of it.
I mean,

229
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:22.420
there are a number of essays that have been written by people who sort of left

230
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:26.660
that and it sounds miserable to be inside it.
You're always,
you know,

231
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:31.480
there's no humor,
there's no fun.
It's always,
you know,
hyper serious,
angry.

232
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.650
Um,
and so,
um,
so I think that,

233
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.390
I think if we can,
uh,

234
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:41.440
if we can raise kids or encourage them to see the games that social media makes

235
00:13:41.441 --> 00:13:44.020
them do and give them a vocabulary.

236
00:13:44.021 --> 00:13:46.180
I don't know what we should come up with some catchy terms for it,

237
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:50.770
but give them a vocabulary so that they can,
they can be like,
oh,
you're,
you know,

238
00:13:50.771 --> 00:13:52.940
you're a calling out or I don't know,
that's a clunky,
but you know,

239
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.600
we can help them label this behavior as it mocket.
Exactly.

240
00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.980
<v 0>Yeah.
There's patterns that you see in,
in people that</v>

241
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.900
from a distance like a,
if I look at it,
when I look at them objectively,

242
00:14:05.901 --> 00:14:09.590
there's like these,
these patents,
I go,
oh,
that's one of those Mager guys.

243
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.060
He's one of those,
you know,

244
00:14:11.061 --> 00:14:14.900
he's got an American flag with an eagle in his avatar on Twitter rant.

245
00:14:14.901 --> 00:14:16.250
If you go through his page,

246
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:21.400
it's all like talking great about POTUS and criticizing anyone who talks about

247
00:14:21.951 --> 00:14:25.670
about trumpets.
It's strange.
It's like these patterns of behavior,

248
00:14:25.671 --> 00:14:28.220
these predetermined pattern.
It's like there are stereotypes,

249
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.140
not just stereotypes,

250
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:35.170
like they've fallen into a well oiled slick groove that's very easy to predict.

251
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.530
If you are one of those people,
it's,

252
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.860
it's super easy to predict that you're going to be pro second amendment.

253
00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.040
It's super easy to predict that you're probably going to be skeptical about

254
00:14:46.041 --> 00:14:47.030
climate change.

255
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:51.980
There's all these different things that go along with these patterns of behavior

256
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.550
<v 1>and you see them on the right.
You see him on the left and the it's,</v>

257
00:14:55.551 --> 00:14:58.760
it's weird to watch.
It's weird to watch on the outside.
I was like,
well,

258
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:03.470
this is such an easy pattern to slip into.
Yeah,
well that's right.

259
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.070
Um,
so,
uh,
there's data from the Pew surveys.

260
00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:11.370
They've been measuring attitudes of Americans since the eighties or nineties.
Uh,

261
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.420
but they've been publishing this series on polarization in which they show that

262
00:15:14.421 --> 00:15:18.080
in the 90s if you knew somebody that attitude on say,
gun control,

263
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.650
that would only predict their attitude on abortion a certain percent.

264
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.660
And a lot of people on the left,

265
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:28.070
let's say would hold six of the 10 leftist attitudes and same on the right.

266
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.130
But gradually by the time you get to around 2010,

267
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.740
it's like if you know one attitude,
you know them all.

268
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.560
And that's in part just because of you turn up the volume.

269
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.600
So we evolve to do us versus them and the more we see,

270
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.800
you know,
if it's us,
America versus them communist Russia or Nazi Germany,

271
00:15:45.801 --> 00:15:47.300
what then,
you know,
then we all come together.

272
00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:50.150
And that's great for social cohesion and trust.
Um,

273
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:54.800
but as that fades away and as us versus them became increasingly left versus

274
00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:55.634
right,

275
00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.200
and as we lost the liberal Republicans and the conservative Democrats,

276
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.860
those used to exist until the eighties or nineties as we lost them.

277
00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:06.860
Once it becomes us versus them is left versus right now,

278
00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:10.340
if you only hold your team's position on six out of 10 items,
you're a trader.

279
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.510
And so you better get with the program.
And so the pressures for conformity,

280
00:16:14.511 --> 00:16:18.710
the pressures to agree with your team on everything had been steadily rising.

281
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:24.070
And that means there's no nuance and we can't do higher education without

282
00:16:24.291 --> 00:16:29.240
nuance.
We can't do college without free thinking.
And the ability to say,
well,

283
00:16:29.241 --> 00:16:32.660
you know what,
wait a second.
Maybe they do have a point on this,
on this thing.

284
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:36.080
And that's one of the reasons why it looks so weird from the outside and why

285
00:16:36.081 --> 00:16:37.850
it's getting so unpleasant from the inside.

286
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:43.570
When you're teaching classes and a subject comes up that may be controversial.

287
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.310
Do you,

288
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.880
do you have like this overwhelming feeling that you're treading on dangerous

289
00:16:53.451 --> 00:16:56.630
ground?
Yes.
Yeah.
So,
um,

290
00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.190
I taught psych one and one at the University of Virginia and I would do all,

291
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.920
I would take them into,
you know,
sex differences,
origin of sex,

292
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:08.730
sexual orientation.
I would even do race differences.
Um,
and Eh,
you know,

293
00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:12.230
because there was a reasonable person standard and I trusted my students and

294
00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:16.940
they trusted me and we had a great time and we covered a lot,
a lot of stuff.
Um,

295
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:21.110
but now and then I moved to New York University in 2011.
Um,
uh,

296
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.850
when my last previous book,
the righteous mind came out and it's not a,

297
00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:28.730
it's not about Uva versus Nyu is just about the changing time.
Um,
now,

298
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.760
as I said,
I have to teach to the most sensitive students.

299
00:17:31.761 --> 00:17:35.000
So I teach a course on business ethics,
on professional responsibility,

300
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.370
and we have a section on,
um,
uh,
on discrimination and employment law.

301
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.660
It's important to cover it.
We have to cover it,
you know,

302
00:17:41.661 --> 00:17:45.680
Mba students have to know where the lines are,
what the law is.
Um,
and yeah,

303
00:17:45.681 --> 00:17:48.530
I'm kind of scared when I teach that.
Uh,
because you know,

304
00:17:48.531 --> 00:17:52.500
I'd like to get into all sorts of things.
Um,
I'd like to get into,
well,
you know,

305
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.450
what to numerical disparities mean if there's a gender difference in,
you know,

306
00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:01.260
in the percentage of tech but not in the percentage of non tech employers in

307
00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:04.350
Silicon Valley.
Well,
what does that mean?
I would like to talk about that.

308
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:09.770
But if a single student thinks that I am denying the existence of sexism,

309
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.120
they could be offended by that.
And in every bathroom at Nyu,

310
00:18:15.121 --> 00:18:19.920
there's a sign telling them how to report me anonymously and they put these up

311
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:23.190
in 2016 in response to student requests.
Um,

312
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.970
and that means that all professors are on notice that they can be reported

313
00:18:26.971 --> 00:18:30.420
anonymously at any moment.
But children,
well,
these are,
well,

314
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:34.320
I'm not going to call them children.
I mean,
my students were Mba students,
but,
uh,

315
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.010
but the undergrads,
there are 17,
17 to 21 year olds for the undergrads.
Yes,

316
00:18:38.011 --> 00:18:40.380
that's right.
Barely not children anymore.
That's right.

317
00:18:40.381 --> 00:18:44.340
And there's an incentive to this,
this what we were talking about before.

318
00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:48.540
There's this incentive that gives them attention.

319
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.140
They get prestige,
they get value from it.
And this,

320
00:18:52.141 --> 00:18:54.840
that this culture encourages these things.
That's right.
