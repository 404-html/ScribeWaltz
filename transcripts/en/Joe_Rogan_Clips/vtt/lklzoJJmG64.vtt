WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.990
We've thought about that with like what we decide to show and not show after

2
00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:07.980
mass shootings here.
Yeah.
You know,
like,
um,

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.920
I was in Pittsburgh like right after and I was,

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.470
because I knew the rabbi who was doing some of the cleanup and because of

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.520
religious reasons,
your Bat Mitzvah was there.

6
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.140
That is so crazy.
And Yeah,
my dad knew six of the people who were murdered.

7
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.120
And um,

8
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.450
but like it was really crazy to me how locked down,

9
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:34.560
it wasn't like you couldn't take it.

10
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.590
I was there with a photographer and you couldn't take any pictures at all of

11
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:41.040
anything,
you know?

12
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:45.240
And there's a real lockdown on showing people because who don't want to terrify

13
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:45.511
people,

14
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:50.511
but I've wondered would it prick people's consciousness about the reality of

15
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:55.650
what gun violence looks like?
You know,
like the carnage,

16
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.440
like the people that I know that Saad said it looked like a war zone.

17
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.330
And would that change public policy and would that be a positive thing or would

18
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.600
we just become numb to it?
Like we become numb to everything else?
I don't know.

19
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.140
<v 1>That's a very good question.</v>

20
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.370
I never in favor of suppressing inflammation,

21
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.260
even horrific information.
Um,

22
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.470
I was a big critic of that during the Bush administration when they passed

23
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.950
laws on whether or not you're allowed to show,
uh,

24
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.480
actual coffins,
just coffins.

25
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.190
You weren't allowed to show coffins being flown back.
I felt like that was,

26
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.190
that's a disgrace.
That's it.
I mean,
you should,
if you,

27
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.400
if we're going to consider whether or not we want our team,
yes,

28
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.290
we should be able to understand the real consequences.

29
00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:47.800
And one of the best ways is to not just get information in terms of text.

30
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.770
Text is very difficult for you to conceptualize,
but when you would,

31
00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:55.771
seeing American flags covering coffins and you're seeing hundreds of them and

32
00:01:56.891 --> 00:01:59.950
you realize these are your neighbors these year and your neighbor's children's,

33
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.980
this is,
this is people that you,
you know,

34
00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:04.810
and they're dying over there and you can't really,

35
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.800
you can't wrap your head around why they're doing it and whether or not it's

36
00:02:08.801 --> 00:02:10.420
right,
whether or not we should have been there.

37
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.690
And then whether or not they're actually were weapons of mass destruction in

38
00:02:13.691 --> 00:02:16.240
Iraq,
whether or not we're in the business of nation building,

39
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.300
whether or not Ron Paul is right,
whether or not other people are right.

40
00:02:19.301 --> 00:02:19.920
Well who's right,

41
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.520
like the only way we're really going to get a clear picture is to see a picture.

42
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.163
To have an actual,

43
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.140
<v 0>yeah.
Well that,</v>

44
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.490
that's why I've thought about this a lot because right now I think in most

45
00:02:31.491 --> 00:02:35.960
Americans' minds it's like the shooting happens,
then it becomes a Hashtag,

46
00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:40.250
then it becomes a tee shirt.
Then it becomes a memorial thing,
a memorial concert.

47
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:43.310
I mean it's like actually sickening like the,

48
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.400
the choreography of it and I think what's lost is what it looks like and this

49
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:51.860
rabbi in Pittsburgh who's really amazing,

50
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.110
describe to me what he saw and I'll never forget just the description of what he

51
00:02:57.111 --> 00:02:58.880
told me and I wondered,

52
00:02:58.881 --> 00:03:01.780
I've a lot in the wake of that and I'll think about it with the next shooting

53
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:05.260
happens,
would that have made a difference at all in terms of waking people up?

54
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.530
<v 1>What's fucked up as you said,
when the next shooting happens.</v>

55
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.000
<v 0>Well we know it will happen.
Yeah,
we know it will happen.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

56
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.900
yeah.
Why?
Why?
Because,

57
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.700
because there are a lot of guns in this country and people have access to those

58
00:03:23.701 --> 00:03:27.300
guns who are not only mentally unwell.

59
00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:31.770
Sometimes they're just evil and they want to kill people and they want to be

60
00:03:31.771 --> 00:03:34.530
fame.
I mean for a million reasons,

61
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.660
but the fact that we are living in a culture that seems to worship people's

62
00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:43.200
freedom to own those weapons more than human life seems crazy to me.

63
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.843
It really does.

64
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.440
<v 1>I get what you're saying.</v>

65
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.360
The argument against that would be this,
look,
look,

66
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:56.350
the real crazies believe that these things are happening and that they're

67
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:59.860
happening because of the fact that government wants to take away our guns.

68
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.700
This is the real crazies.
Explain that.
I'm not sure I followed that.

69
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:08.290
They are making these people do these things.
The government that the worst,

70
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.490
worst aspects of our society,
whatever,
you know,

71
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.940
fill in the blank with whatever left wing conspiracy that you know,

72
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.700
whatever person,
whatever boogeyman,
George Soros Boogie man,

73
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:25.710
is that the whatever boogeyman or book or cabal of Boogie people that they are

74
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.460
somehow or another either using like Manchurian candidate type influence,

75
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.170
whatever the fuck they're doing,

76
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:39.940
they're getting people to do this and then even creating false flags where these

77
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:43.900
things didn't happen so they can take away guns.
This is the,
I mean look,

78
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.880
this is exactly what it is.
Dot.
It is,
you're right.
It is,
it is.
It is dumb,

79
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.190
but it's real.
It's real.

80
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:55.210
In terms of the influence that it has that people actually do believe that there

81
00:04:55.211 --> 00:05:00.211
are these false flag events that they're designing to to get your guns,

82
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:04.930
that people are training people to go out and kill a bunch of people so that

83
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:06.010
they can take away your guns.

84
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.920
So it makes them more rabid about their support of the second amendment and
they,

85
00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:13.750
they,
they feel like they're being attacked on all sides.

86
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.590
<v 0>Have you lived very shimmer on here recently?</v>

87
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.810
Last week they can see the mindset of the conspiracy thinker is totally

88
00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:22.800
fascinating to me.

89
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.760
<v 1>It is.
A West is actually just as good or even better.
He runs Medibank.</v>

90
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.390
He's a fascinating guy.
I used to do this show,

91
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:34.930
I did the show for awhile on the Scifi.
I called Joe Rogan questions,
everything.

92
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.980
And one of the things that we went into was a why people believe in chem trails,

93
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.590
why people believe that the heat of jet engines,

94
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:44.980
which causes these artificial clouds when it interacts with condensation in the

95
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:48.190
atmosphere and creates,
creates artificial clouds.
You see trails.

96
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.740
Some people believe that these are,

97
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.300
that someone spraying something and that this weather control from these

98
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:58.580
commercial jets that they're there,
you know,

99
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.750
somehow then there's this gigantic conspiracy of all these people involved and

100
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:06.980
that this is in some way,
uh,
they're,

101
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:11.150
they're either doing weather control or the controlling us or mind control.

102
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:12.690
It depends on who you ask.
And,

103
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.860
but Mick had a really interesting way of discussing it.

104
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.770
And one of the things that he said is this is like the training wheels for

105
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:21.950
conspiracy theory because you see it in the sky,
like,
look,
there it is.

106
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.550
I don't remember that you want these photographs from world war two where you

107
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:28.610
can see from the 1940s you could see contrails in the sky that look just like

108
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:31.700
the ones up here.
But people will say,
I don't remember those when we were kids.

109
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.650
And they little,
yeah,
yeah,
I don't.

110
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.420
And then it starts fueling this paranoid idea that there's this program going
on.

111
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.070
And then there are real programs that the government is considering to combat

112
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:45.830
global warming.
Where they talked about this in the,

113
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:48.990
in the 70s and the 80s they talked about,
um,

114
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.410
reflective particles in the atmosphere.
I think there were,

115
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:55.110
when they were concerned that the ozone layer was beat McManamon was the 80s a

116
00:06:55.111 --> 00:06:58.070
pro probably later than that.
But even more recently,

117
00:06:58.071 --> 00:07:01.790
they've talked about suspending reflective particles in the atmosphere to

118
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:03.340
protect it.
But it'd be very different.

119
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.060
<v 0>But why do people believe conspiracy theories?</v>

120
00:07:06.061 --> 00:07:10.770
What is it in the nature of certain people that that I'm just so fascinated by

121
00:07:10.771 --> 00:07:11.190
it.

122
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.670
<v 1>That's a good question.
That's what I was going to ask you.
Oh,
what do you,</v>

123
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.450
when you see it from the outside,
when you see something like a,

124
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.420
like the most horrific ones like sandy hook,
like sandy hook being a false flag,

125
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.290
what would be the motivation for someone saying that?

126
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.850
What would be the motivation?

127
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.970
<v 0>The only thing I can,
I mean the most plausible I guess would be</v>

128
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:38.040
<v 2>okay</v>

129
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.420
<v 0>capturing an audience.</v>

130
00:07:39.421 --> 00:07:44.220
Like getting people to believe in you is some sear behind the veil.

131
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:44.471
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

132
00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:48.270
but that's only the people that are projecting this in terms of in the meeting

133
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.050
<v 0>I'm talking about like an Alex Jones.
Like why does he say that?</v>

134
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.910
My question is why do other people think it?
Why do they look for it?
Not,

135
00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:58.140
not a person who's profiting?
I think that's,

136
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.340
I think the reason people look to conspiracy theories is that the world is

137
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.623
<v 2>okay,</v>

138
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:12.100
<v 0>deeply chaotic and seems to lack a logic and people are desperate for a system</v>

139
00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:16.430
of understanding the world.

140
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:22.060
And conspiracy theories often seem to like offer a very,

141
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:26.000
very,
actually like an incredibly simplistic explanation,

142
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.080
which is there's this secret fee.

143
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.880
Like there's always a secret thing that is a plan that the public doesn't know

144
00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:36.000
about general you'll thing is that no one really is at the wheel.
Yeah.
Yeah.

145
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:40.370
The real thing is that,
I mean,
haven't we learned that from the Trump presidency?

146
00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:40.701
Right?

147
00:08:40.701 --> 00:08:45.701
Like institutions are just made up of people like they can fall apart if the

148
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:52.460
people that take them over are irresponsible,
crazy,

149
00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:54.110
Venal,
narcissistic.

150
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.230
Everything that we're seeing in Trump administration will also like people.

151
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.270
But isn't that kind of,
it's weirdly,

152
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:02.790
I mean it's both terrifying but also comforting.

153
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:08.580
I think like if it's people,
if it's just people,

154
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.730
people can also change it.
Right,
okay.

155
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.000
It's not like there's a secret hand that we need to get to.
Yeah.
Just,
okay.

156
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.310
What's the solution?
Elect better people.

157
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.400
Do you think the hopeful part,
I think

158
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.070
<v 1>that this,
such as it is,
this constant conflict,</v>

159
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.530
this social conflict that we're involved in right now,

160
00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:28.800
the woke left and the alt right and all this jazz,
that there's the,
the,

161
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.660
the boiling of it right now will eventually boil down to something more
rational.

162
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.460
Because if it seems like if you,

163
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.910
if you read Steven Pinker's work and people that study violence and in danger

164
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:44.490
and society over the course of history that we're,

165
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.470
we're certainly on an upward trend,

166
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.700
even though when the data shows know all the data shows that no one's denying

167
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:54.630
that there are some awful aspects to our culture today in society and Crime and

168
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.230
violence and,
and fill in the blank and all disparity.
And yes,

169
00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.190
all those things exist,

170
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.930
but there's more understanding of that is more awareness of that.

171
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.820
And there's certainly a safer,
safer world today than was,
you know,
a hundred,

172
00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:11.920
200 years ago in terms of like,
you're your own existence.
