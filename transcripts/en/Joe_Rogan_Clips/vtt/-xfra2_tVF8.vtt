WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:00.150
Oh,

2
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.380
have you seen that photo or the footage rather of the Jaguar that they found in

3
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:07.120
a Arizona?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's really interesting too.
Right?

4
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.210
They're starting to make their way up from Mexico.

5
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.140
It's such a weird region that because here's this huge Sonoran desert that you

6
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:16.350
think none of these tropical animals can make it across.
And for whatever reason,

7
00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:20.160
southern Arizona gets Jaguars and Coda Monday and peccary and all these like

8
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:23.520
tropical animals.
What,
what the hell?
I don't know the answer.

9
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:24.450
What the Hell's going on?

10
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:28.260
That all these rain forest creatures are making it through this thousand mile

11
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:33.150
stretch of desert and into southern Arizona?
Probably Board.
It could be for cool,

12
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.340
cool places to visit.
Yeah.
You know,
maybe they,

13
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.330
I mean maybe it's just like a natural instinct to Rome and expand your
territory.

14
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.860
There is,
look at that thing that's an incredible animal.
So beautiful.

15
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.990
And it's huge.
Huge there.
There are 200 plus pounds,
right?

16
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.820
So I'm a big fucking aggressive Kat.
What's bigger?

17
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:54.870
A Jaguar or a leopard?
Leopard.
Leopard.
Yeah.
And that's even bigger.

18
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.630
But it's such a beautiful animal to,

19
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.960
and apparently they were all over North America Jaguar point in time.
Yeah.

20
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.370
Like that area,
like Texas during the rezoning.
Oh,
interesting.

21
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:08.010
I didn't even know that.
But,
um,
when did they,
I mean they,

22
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.300
they were pushed out of,
I feel like that might not be true though.

23
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.500
I feel like there were,

24
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:18.390
they were more numerous in like Arizona and the southwest makes sense.

25
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.740
I mean,
you know,
we had so much mega fauna here back in the day,
um,

26
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.200
there would have been a lot of pray for them now because of the fact that he

27
00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:29.580
spent so much time in the wild and you know,

28
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:32.230
and that you have this interest in these,
uh,

29
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.600
what would you call cryptozoology animals?
I'm not a crypto guy,

30
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:39.060
so just to be clear and nothing against crypto guys,

31
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:42.660
but I don't do lock Nasser big foot or anything and I'm a true wildlife

32
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:47.070
biologist,
so I only focus on wildlife.
So not to interrupt you,
but I'm just very,

33
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:51.810
very structured in the sense that I really only look for animals that we,

34
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.220
we have an understanding of.
Yeah.
Right.
Well.
Yeah,
well the big foot one is,

35
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.200
um,
the,
the most compelling but also probably the most bullshit.

36
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.820
I think there's a mix there.

37
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:07.030
I think people believe that they've seen certain things.
Um,
you know,
it's,

38
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.990
do I think that there could have been large primates that we attribute to

39
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:12.690
bigfoot?
Sure.
Whether they're still here or not,

40
00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:16.440
whether people have ever seen him.
I,
I'm so like not well read on that.

41
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.500
Isn't it interesting though that if there was one it would probably be the most

42
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:27.070
spectacular find ever.
Absolutely.
Mima we have chimps and Bonobos,

43
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.750
you know,

44
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.840
we have all these things that are real well cause there's so much like Laura and

45
00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:34.320
culture associated with it.
Right.
And not just like our Western culture,

46
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:35.154
but like k

47
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.410
things of big hairy creatures and like everything.

48
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.200
I mean it would be like this mind blowing discovery.

49
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.640
Have you ever went and looked for the Bondo ape?
No.
I know what it is,
but no,

50
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:50.790
never gone and looked for it.
I'm sure that's a real thing.
Really.
Yeah.

51
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:54.990
They've got skulls and hair samples and photographs and video,

52
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.230
and for people don't know what we're talking about.
It's a gigantic chimpanzee,

53
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.690
right?
Like a six foot tall chimpanzee,
which is just fucking nuts.

54
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.650
And it does walk a rack,
right?
Yeah.
Sometimes.
Yeah.
There's a camera trap photo.

55
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:08.800
There's a guy named Doctor Carl.
Oh no,
he's not a doctor.

56
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.710
I think his name is Karl Harmon.
Call Carl something at Harman.
Is that Ahmad?

57
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.430
Ahmad.
Ahmad.
And he's a,
it was it Swiss wildlife photographer.

58
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.420
Anyway,
he set up a bunch of camera traps and he got one of 'em one walking.

59
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.280
I mean,
it's freaking,
there's some photos of,
um,
these gentlemen that shot one,

60
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.810
uh,
near an airstrip and it's fucking huge.

61
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.940
You don't know how big the the men are.

62
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.230
They might be small and it's in front of them,
but it is without a doubt,

63
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:40.270
like one of the biggest chimpanzees you've ever seen in life.

64
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.040
They have a crest on their head.
Their skull has a crest.
Like a gorilla.
Yeah.

65
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:50.041
It has like the bone of the skull has kind of just picture of that.

66
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:54.850
I'd love to see it.
I'm not not familiar with the anatomy of them.
Yeah.
It's,
um,

67
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.750
it's really interesting because I think for the longest time they didn't think

68
00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:01.750
they were real as a part of that Michael Crighton Book Congo,

69
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.420
because remember there was a really terrible movie,

70
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.730
but with the size of that Fucker,
that's insane.
Yeah.
That's one of them.

71
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.640
And that thing that doesn't look like forced perspective,
you know what I mean?

72
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.140
It looks like they're right in front of them.

73
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.200
And that's one from the early 19 hundreds,
I believe,

74
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.510
where these guys a shot one.
And um,
there were like,
what is this?

75
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.430
This is just giant chimp goat.

76
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.330
See if you find the one of the red above is the one where it's walking right

77
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:32.860
there.
Yeah.
Oh,
that's the camera trap.
Wow.
Walking and he's erect.
Yeah,

78
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:37.000
he's erect.
And he's,
you know,
Izzy,
these people that,
one of,

79
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.020
one of the sightings,
they saw one walked by a truck,

80
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.500
like walk across the road,
they said it was the same height as the truck.

81
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.390
That's insane.
So they have like,
you know,

82
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:50.560
like a Toyota Helix or something like that.
And it's literally the size,

83
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.360
the height,
like a six foot tall man,
but a giant chimp.
And I mean,

84
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.070
you know,
to go back to the big foot thing,

85
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:59.540
you can totally see where we get that from.
Right?
For sure.

86
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.220
You look at this huge primate that's the size of a human being and your brain

87
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:04.690
instantly goes,
it's mythological.

88
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.160
And I'm pretty sure that they didn't have photos of this thing until the 20th

89
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:13.540
century,
like the late 20th century.
No kidding.
Yeah.
That's amazing.
Yeah.

90
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:17.480
It's a trip,
man.
This,
they nest on the ground like I'm like,
yeah.

91
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.260
Wow.
And uh,
the locals have two different name for,
uh,

92
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.580
two different names for chimps.

93
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.710
They called him tree beaters and lion killers and the tree beaters are the ones

94
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:31.570
that are up in the trees,
a smaller champs.

95
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.630
The lion killers are these big ones that live on the ground.

96
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:39.631
I had apparently there's some either video footage or there was some eyewitness

97
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.430
account of one of them eating a leopard.
No Way.

98
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.900
So it was a dead leopard that they were eating.

99
00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:49.210
Whether or not they killed it or they found it,

100
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.010
but they were eating this fucking thing regardless like to be a primate at the

101
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:57.710
top of the food chain,
eating a big cat.
I mean,
that's nuts.
It's nuts.

102
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.040
Would you ever think of going there and trying to find those things?

103
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.470
They're deep in their great,
yeah.
I think they're in a place called ble,

104
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.600
ble in the Congo.
That's where they think they are.

105
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:11.260
They've isolated the population of them.
They're really,

106
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.810
my mom just got back from the Congo and she still does like her own adventure

107
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:17.840
stuff,
and she was saying it's just like she's been all over as well.
She's like,

108
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:18.621
it's mind blowing,

109
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:22.520
like there's so much remoteness and unstudied area that there could be all kinds

110
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:24.110
of things.
God Damn Man.
