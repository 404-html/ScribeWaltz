WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.280
Suge knight gear for La.
I mean,
I feel like this is probably the more conscious,

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.250
we didn't do anything to women,
but you know,

3
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:11.070
like friends who worked with them and say like,
Hey,
we're going out.

4
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:13.950
You want to come out now I'm going to go back and check off.
Like,
yeah,
it just,

5
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:16.530
it was just into watching porn and beaten off all the time.

6
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.440
<v 1>Well,
I think I was talking about,
because we both know him.
Louis,</v>

7
00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:23.450
since you've known him since 1989 probably.
I don't,

8
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.250
I never knew anybody or wound them.

9
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.490
<v 0>I,
I would see him like once a year,
twice a year,
somewhere in say hi.</v>

10
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.030
<v 1>Um,
I know you way better than I know him.
Yeah.
Uh,
the,</v>

11
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.150
so I remember when I moved to New York and 91 and was in the comedy club scene

12
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.930
in 92 93 94 in New York.
I was,

13
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.260
I couldn't believe the amount of jerking off that was going on.

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.520
I just remember her like,
why is everyone constantly talking about like,

15
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.790
what the fuck is going to Louie's apartment four to shoot,

16
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.580
uh,
movies like his shorts that he used to make.

17
00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:04.190
I would like pa on them and uh,

18
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.650
and it always smelled gross.

19
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.720
Like Jay Moore was constantly,
Jay Moore,
we're in,

20
00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:15.020
me and I were roommates for a bit.
He jerked off on one of my socks.
Like,

21
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:19.240
just like,
like why is everyone jerking off all the time?
Just like,

22
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.260
what is the,
what the fuck is happening?
That's rape.
Yeah.
No,

23
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.930
you know what's funny is I was wondering like today,
yeah,

24
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.650
I was thinking about the thing,
the Jay thing again,
cause I'm,
I'm of the mind,

25
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.680
like
again,
Louie was more gross than,

26
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.030
than uh,
malicious and discuss malicious and criminal.

27
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.610
I just gross that what he did.
I think it was good.
It wasn't clear.
Okay.

28
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.160
<v 0>He did it to a man.
It takes on more ominous tones when he's doing it to women.</v>

29
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.800
<v 1>Completely agree.
Yeah.
Uh,</v>

30
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.110
<v 0>it's,
I mean,
I'm not,
I don't know if it's not a crime,
right?
No,
no,
no.</v>

31
00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:58.770
I don't think so.
No,
I think it's just sad.
It's nothing like Cosby.

32
00:01:58.771 --> 00:02:03.720
It's just pathetic.
It's weird.
And you know,
I had some conversations with

33
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.560
uh,
Eliza slessinger.

34
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.830
She was saying that men would say things to her when she first started.
Doc,

35
00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:13.800
she wasn't very good.
You know,

36
00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:17.220
she just started out and these guys were like established guys and they would

37
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:22.221
treat her as if like you're below me and you're always going to be below me and

38
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:25.170
I can get away with saying whenever I want to you,
cause you're less than me.

39
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.800
And she goes and I kind of feel like that's probably why he did that to those

40
00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:33.330
girls.
Like he was above them,
they were below him and it was not just,

41
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.040
hey,
I want to jerk off in front of you.

42
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:37.980
It's like you have to watch me jerk off because I'm above you.

43
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.560
<v 1>You know what's the thing you said earlier?
It was relevant,</v>

44
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.450
which is getting hard right from that.
How can you,

45
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.580
yeah,
that's the thing that's like,
but I,

46
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.540
but then it's also like you don't pick your kinks and all that shit.
Like,
yeah,

47
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.520
you don't pick that.
Yeah,
that's even a direct correlation.

48
00:02:56.521 --> 00:03:00.320
Most kinks are just like,
I don't know,
I'm jogging like uh,

49
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.950
being hung off the roof.
Everybody,
you know what I mean?
Like

50
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.860
uh,
but yeah,
that's the thing of like the,

51
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.000
the getting hard thing but also a

52
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.740
fuck I the whole thing.
It is sad.
It's fucked up.
But I actually think he'll be,

53
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.270
he'll be in a year and a half.
He'll be back stronger than ever.
Yeah.

54
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.480
Cause now he's got something to talk about for.
Yeah,
it's to,

55
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.340
it's going to be a lot of dudes at the show.
It's going to be 90% dudes.

56
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.760
But I've asked the crowd,
I've asked probably five or six different crowds.

57
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.830
If Louis was doing the show after this,

58
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:39.760
would you go and 70% of the people will plug?
Yeah.

59
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.090
They would want to see what the fuck he has to say.
Yes.

60
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.610
I think he should go on stage.
The first words out of his mouth should be,

61
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:50.450
well I asked I there's,
I believe light should just come up and he's jerking off.

62
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.310
<v 0>Yeah,
that's a great idea.
And I'm just like,
lights down and just like,
yeah,</v>

63
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:03.550
I think what he did was freaky and weird,
but I think Louie,

64
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.400
I don't think Louise a monster.
I don't really know him very well,
but I don't,

65
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:08.770
I don't think he's a bad person.
He's always been friendly to me.

66
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.840
<v 1>He's not a bad person.
He's not like,</v>

67
00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:16.470
he's not a bad,
he's not.
He's also,
again,

68
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.010
I don't want to be like defending a sex criminal.

69
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.930
If it's a power thing,
he the more powerfully got the lessee did it.

70
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.430
<v 0>Yeah.
That's the weird thing,
right?
It's like,</v>

71
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:31.000
I think he realized that what he did was fucked up and like he had these crazy

72
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:35.440
urges and he did it and then as time went on,
he stopped doing it and he's like,

73
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.510
I'm a prisoner to some shit that I know

74
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.820
<v 1>just got in front of it.
I feel like if he had just real a,</v>

75
00:04:40.821 --> 00:04:44.200
if he had just talked about it in a letter,

76
00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:49.201
men talked about fucking his staff on the air and no one cared.

77
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.300
Well,
Letterman just went straight.

78
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.500
You mean a hundred percent confessional?
Yeah.
Which I think Louie [inaudible],

79
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.400
he just mishandled it.
Liked having sex with the people that work with.

80
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.110
And by the way,
I talked to the lady about this yesterday.
He goes,

81
00:05:06.111 --> 00:05:09.890
you have you watched it.
He's getting laughs the whole time.
Yeah.
Yeah.

82
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.690
Like the whole time I'm getting big labs.
He was brilliant.
Yeah.
I miss him.

83
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.190
But again,
and the other thing,

84
00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:19.520
it's like the irony of like Netflix didn't pull his show.

85
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.180
<v 0>Yeah.
But he was only having sex with people.
But here's the thing,</v>

86
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.200
having sex with people back then,
but that you now an abuse of power

87
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.810
that can sit again.
We're talking about four years ago.
That's crazy.

88
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.780
You've got to rate,
it feels like it's changed.
What's changed?

89
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.130
Is it just everyone?

90
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.080
I think the Harvey Weinstein thing was so fucking gross and he's such a monster

91
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.770
that everybody's like completely.

92
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.510
I think there's this ripple effect and that this we're,

93
00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:53.511
we're like way beyond normal reactions for things like Matt Lauer.

94
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.030
I'm still trying to figure out what Matt Lauer did that got him.

95
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.300
He had sex with someone on staff.
Yeah.

96
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.220
I think he had sex with someone on staff that probably felt like she couldn't

97
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:10.400
stop.
Mm.
That that would be the,

98
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.810
that would be that sort of rub.
I don't know.
You see,
I don't,

99
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.440
I don't want a victim shame.
Right.
You don't know.

100
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.260
You don't know what really happened.
I don't know his version.

101
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.070
I don't even know her version.
I just know the third hand version,

102
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.510
you know,

103
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.420
like I read one that he had sex with some girl until she blacked out and like

104
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.880
Matt Lauer likes to fuck.
Yeah.
He's throwing in his office girl sir.

105
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.480
And then the other thing was that he had a button on his desk.

106
00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:42.220
We can lock the door.
That,
yeah,
that to me is less,
uh,
uh,

107
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.140
rape trap then than it is just like a fucking,

108
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.200
I don't want to have to get up and go when you're the opposite [inaudible] big

109
00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:53.480
and you're like,
fuck,
you know,
it's probably,

110
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:58.380
I don't want to walk 40 feet.
Right.
Every time I need to shut the door.
Well,

111
00:06:58.381 --> 00:07:02.420
it's also,
he's writing right when you,
right.
You don't want to be disturbed.

112
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:02.811
He just like,

113
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:06.200
it's rather just let me just lock the fucking door and lock into this thing.

114
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.550
I don't even think he was writing.

115
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.800
I think it's just like a convenience thing maybe.
Um,

116
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.220
but there was no,
um,

117
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.930
the only abuses that he was having sex with someone who was above,
below him.

118
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.050
Right.
It wasn't like he,
you know,

119
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:25.070
he didn't chase him down like Harvey did or,
you know,
offer them a Gig.

120
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:28.820
Or another friend of mine said some interesting,
which he said,
uh,

121
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.620
until dating people you work with is illegal.

122
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.830
This is never going to stop.
Yeah.
Whitney's got a great joke about that,

123
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:39.650
that she's doing right now about working in an office,
you know,

124
00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:44.570
cause she works on Roseanne.
No.
Yeah,
it's a,
it's their world,
you know,
it's like,

125
00:07:44.571 --> 00:07:48.110
yeah,
when men and women are in,
yeah.

126
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.440
And you can't,
like,
where else are you going to meet people.
