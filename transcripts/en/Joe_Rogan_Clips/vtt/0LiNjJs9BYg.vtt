1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.430
Top flight boxer.
So for him to knock him out,
of course it was just,

2
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.560
he's so good man.
So for him to do it accidentally makes complete total sense.

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.680
Well look at the GS.
Yeah,
that guy is a beast man.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.260
That's like a legit top flight boxer.

5
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:19.980
So he's in there even just accidentally getting punched in the face by,

6
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:21.210
and that's what I want to see the movie.

7
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:26.211
I'll tell you that Michael Jordan talking shit to recover and get back to

8
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:29.760
training and,
and,
and,
and filming after that.

9
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.740
It's like you never be in the heavyweight class.

10
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:36.150
You never saw abs until the movies.
You never,
it was always like,
I know.
Right.

11
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:40.230
You know,
they were like,
they were like basically punching bags,
you know,
so now,

12
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:43.830
now it's like they have to be so Tyson,
you saw abs when it came out of prison.

13
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.220
I remember that.
I guess so when you fought Peter McNeely,
dude,

14
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:51.210
he was prison jacked.
That was like maybe the scariest Tyson ever.

15
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:54.200
Like they finally released him and all you've been doing in jail,

16
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.680
I don't think he could box in jail.
So I think he was just lifting weights.

17
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.400
You remember he was super duper jacked when he got out of jail.
Let me see.

18
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:06.600
Can I see a picture?
He was,
yeah.
See,
go to Tyson.
This is Pete.
Yeah,

19
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.910
that's Tyson versus Peter McNeely.
That was in 1995 he looks good there.

20
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.420
It's terrifying.
That was the most terrifying movie Tyson ever.

21
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.430
He just looked like he was made out of steel.
Just a tank of a man.

22
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.750
And I'll never forget the fucking way in or the stare down rather cause during

23
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:25.380
the steer down,

24
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.610
Peter McNeely signed up for that fight knowing that he's a tough guy who's going

25
00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:32.610
to take a fucking vicious beating.
That's what he signed up for.

26
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:35.010
He knew what he was doing.
He knew he was gonna give it his all.

27
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.550
But he knew that if you had a bet,
most people were not betting on Peter McNeil.

28
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.960
Yeah,
but you could see it in Tyson's face when he's staring him down.

29
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.160
There's this crazy,
he's following him everywhere.
He goes like a Predator dude.

30
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.600
It's like a Predator who can't wait to get the green light to let the genie out

31
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:56.490
of the bottle.
Watch this.
This is Tysons first fight like look,

32
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.290
see Peter mcneilly's kind of looking down and you look over tie,

33
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.143
so we'll get his eyes.

34
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.260
Dad Is fucking terrifying if you're looking at that and you know

35
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.650
he's smiling and trying to like,
he's trying to like make light of it.

36
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.840
Oh my God.
And he looks just like a prison guard dude.
He is easy.
Oh yeah,

37
00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:19.280
he does same hair.
That's really guard here.

38
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.860
After the Trump [inaudible] hair,
I sat next to me,

39
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.700
sat next to Tyson at after that at the Charlie Sheen roast and made a lot of

40
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:38.490
jokes about him and a afterwards dice call me.

41
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.550
I didn't really know dice at the time.
He'd call me like a couple of weeks later.

42
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:45.930
He's like Java to dice.
He's like,
he's like,
he's like,

43
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.810
he's like basically said that he couldn't believe I said those things to Mike

44
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.750
Tyson and like he was offended and I go,
what do you mean?
Whoa,
whoa.
He's like,

45
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.990
do you have any idea what that animal could have done to you two feet away?

46
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.460
And then we've been friends ever since,
but I didn't think,

47
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.260
I didn't think about Tyson.
He seemed like a pussy cat at the time.
At the time.

48
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.060
But if that was Tyson from like 1986 I think if I watched an old fight,
yeah.

49
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.370
By the end of the night,
I'm literally like laughing and it was lap.
Well one,

50
00:03:22.371 --> 00:03:26.830
he loved it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He loves,
you can take jokes.
He could take jokes.
Oh yeah,

51
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.400
but you wouldn't want to be doing that.

52
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.610
Imagine if I said I don't want to Piss you off,
Mike.

53
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.330
If you would do that to your face,
imagine what you would do to mind.

54
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.220
He's basically the only celebrity to ever pull off a face mask,
right face.

55
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.020
I thought no one else has done it.
What?
Celebrity feud?
Charles Manson.
Well,
those,

56
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.910
those mumble rapper dude's yeah,
postman alone type characters to cal.

57
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.400
She's 69 but he was the first.
