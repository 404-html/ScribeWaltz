1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.000
Right?
There's,
there's something to the placebo effect,
right?
So if there,
if,

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.100
if that is a real thing,

3
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:08.160
if you can convince your body that it's got the medicine that it needs and it

4
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:09.960
starts to heal,
even though there's no medicine,

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.240
there's gotta be something that is working against you as well with the wrong

6
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:19.380
mindset.
Right?
It's funny to me to hear people rediscovering the placebo effect.

7
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:19.860
Now,

8
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.390
I wrote a book in 1983 called health and healing and had two chapters in there

9
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.050
on placebos.
And what I wrote is that the,
the greatest problem is that we,

10
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.870
in the,
when we talk about placebos,
it's in phrases like,

11
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.150
how do you know that's not just a placebo effect?

12
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.090
The most interesting word there was just right,

13
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.420
or we have to rule out the placebo effect,
right?
We should be rolling it in,
man.

14
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:40.770
That's the meat of medicine.

15
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.450
That's pure healing from within mediated by belief on mixed up with the direct

16
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:48.030
effects of treatment.
That's what you want to make happen more at the time.

17
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.580
It just is a mind fuck for a lot of people.
Cause they're like,

18
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:53.370
how am I tricking myself into getting better?
Why can't I just do it?

19
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.700
Because that had must have something to do with the structure of the brain that

20
00:00:56.701 --> 00:01:00.070
the part of the brain in which our will is,
isn't,

21
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.090
it doesn't connect directly to the machinery of the body to be autonomic nervous

22
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.200
system.
So you have to find some way of getting around that.

23
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:12.201
One way is to project belief on to something external and then let it work for

24
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:16.800
you.
Yeah,
but that's so strange that the mind works that way.
It would seem like,

25
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.280
wouldn't it be an evolutionary advantage?
Just have it at access,
you know,

26
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:22.650
like sure.
That'd be nice.
But that's the same thing.

27
00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:26.520
You know that's a similar problem to why can't you just get high without taking

28
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:29.040
a drug?
The high is in your brain,
not in the drug.

29
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:32.850
The drug is a trigger that releases it.
Why can't we just sit down and say,

30
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:35.640
well I'm going to be high for the next 10 minutes.
So the same thing.

31
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:39.990
We don't have access to those controls to.
It just seems like that one though.

32
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.630
Healing and getting better.

33
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:45.780
That one seems like it's something that we should as a culture concentrate on.

34
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.160
Yeah,
for sure.
We really concentrate on is actual medicine.

35
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.790
One way to concentrate on that is by giving people greater confidence in their

36
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:55.170
body's ability to do that.

37
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.310
And doctors have great power to do that because patients project a lot of belief

38
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:00.060
on them.

39
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.240
I've had many patients over the years who said that the most important thing I

40
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:06.360
did for them was that I was the only doctor who told them they could get better.

41
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.190
I mean,
astonishing.
Mm.
Yeah.

42
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.490
Is it because doctors are just seen too many patients and they're overwhelmed

43
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:17.280
and they got a legal bills and they have,
I think some,
I,

44
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:21.510
I've thought about this a lot and I,
there's also the negative side of this.

45
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:25.170
I've seen what there's something called medical hexing in which doctors say

46
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:29.820
things that actually interfere with healing or cause people to get worse.

47
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:32.790
And I think a lot of this is done unconsciously.
Uh,

48
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.510
so here's one of my thoughts in their training.
Um,

49
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.450
doctors see a very skewed sample of sick people.

50
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.750
They see very sick people in hospitals and in that group,

51
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:44.520
healing is less likely to happen.

52
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.610
But if you look at the total spectrum of illness,

53
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.930
the vast majority of things get better on their own.
So I think,
you know,

54
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.520
observing in yourself,
ha wound healing is a good one to start with,

55
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.240
to get greater confidence in your body's to do things that's really valuable.

56
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.440
So,
but this obviously you're not talking about catastrophic injuries,

57
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:07.360
you just talking about general wellness.

58
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.440
I think even in the case of of catastrophic injury,
this stuff operates.

59
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:15.400
I worked a lot with hypnotherapists over the years and one of the,

60
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.990
one of my colleagues did a lot of work in training paramedics to be really

61
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:23.590
careful about what you say around unconscious people who have been massively

62
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:26.140
injured.
Uh,
you know,
when the,
if a,

63
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:29.860
if a paramedic takes an automobile accident victim and they're putting them in

64
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:32.770
and says this one's a corner,
that is a bad thing,
you know,

65
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:35.340
the unconscious mind on.

66
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.350
And on the other hand you'll say something opposite to a person.

67
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.460
You can see cases where you can stop bleeding in unconscious people,

68
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.840
severely injured just by giving them suggestions.
Whoa.
Yeah.

69
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.690
So when you're saying someone's a goner,
you trigger stress.

70
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.190
Are you trigger helplessness?

71
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.080
What does have a medically trained person tell you that you're not going to
live?

72
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.050
That's a curse.
Yeah,
medical hex.

73
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:06.610
How strange is it that sometimes your life is hanging on the border of you

74
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:09.770
believing you're going to be okay and you believe in you're not going to be
okay.

75
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:13.450
So you want to be very careful about,
you know,
whose hands you place yourself in.

76
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.560
Yes.
It never want to stay in treatment with a doctor who thinks she can't get

77
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:22.150
better.
Uh,
negative doc.
Well doctors are just like every other occupation.

78
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:25.480
If people that are really good at it and a really concentrated and focus and

79
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:26.630
it's people that are half fascinating.

80
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.280
Well the ones I trained through our University of Arizona Center for Integrative

81
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.570
Medicine get it.
You know,
we're putting out,

82
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.310
we've graduated about 1600 physicians now from very intensive training there in

83
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:39.160
practice all over the country.
Teaching other people is a good thing.

84
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.590
Now when you say integrative medicine,
when they're in practice,

85
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:44.230
are they essentially general practitioners?

86
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.230
We've trained people from all specialties.
Any specialty you can name,

87
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:51.550
we've trained them.
So orthopedic surgeons and neurologists,
dermatologists,

88
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.570
anything ever does.
Yeah.
And so you try to tend to look at them.

89
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.570
We teach them all the things they didn't get in medical school,
nutrition,

90
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.410
mindbody interactions,
uh,
strengths and weaknesses of alternative medicine,

91
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:03.370
herbal medicine,
all that.

92
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.730
Like say someone comes to you and maybe they have a bad case of psoriasis,

93
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.050
autoimmune issue with that prime,
prime target for mind,

94
00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:14.290
body medicine for traditional Chinese medicine,

95
00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:17.790
which often works well and in that dietary changed,

96
00:05:17.791 --> 00:05:19.780
but people on an anti inflammatory diet,

97
00:05:19.781 --> 00:05:22.240
use of natural products that reduce inflammation.

98
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.370
So there's a wide range of things to choose from.

99
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.610
And this does not reject the conventional treatment.
You know,

100
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.090
we may use conventional medication,
but if you do,

101
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.810
I recommend using the lowest dose,
the least potent agent.

102
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.420
Start off with that and you can ramp up if you need to.
