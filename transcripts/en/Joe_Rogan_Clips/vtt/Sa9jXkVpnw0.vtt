1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.600
Uh,
China announces they've got all these AI drones that are autonomous and all

2
00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:06.580
these AI weapons systems director aircraft show.

3
00:00:06.581 --> 00:00:09.210
So what I'm telling you is China has no rules.

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.180
20 years ago they had cows that produce human milk.

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.650
20 years ago they had spiders.
That British body armor spotter guts.
Okay.

6
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.450
They have human animal hybrid.

7
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.310
30 years ago they've got giant human tissue farms.
You know,
you hear,
oh your,

8
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:27.240
your achilles is torn.
We've got a grown in a lab attended.

9
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.070
It's not a fricking 10 and grown in a lab.
It's a fricking the deal.
A humanoid.

10
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.840
These aren't humans.
The way they get around it is they made me wait.

11
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.420
They were saying so many things.
This is,
listen,
I love you to death,
but you,

12
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:42.480
since you stole a million dollars given with your real,
I believe they are,

13
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.420
but you say so many different things without stopping.

14
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.140
It's hard cause I'm an agency so they'll listen to investigate.

15
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.270
I'm decompartmentalize okay.
But it will be studied for years.
So
no,

16
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.750
I believe you.
Joe.
Joe,
Joe,
Joe.
Yes.
Joe.

17
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.760
It was the an Mit quarterly 25 years ago that they had human animal embryos but

18
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:05.460
they killed him at the embryonic level.
I can pull it up.
Those was this man.

19
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.370
I believe they've got humanoids.
I believe this that I've been,
they look,

20
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.350
they've already used CRISPR to enhance children's higher intelligence and Shiloh

21
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.010
was actually,
it was a side effect they believe of making their intelligence.

22
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:20.370
HIV was something about HIV immune to HIV.
Oh yes.

23
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.400
Everything that roll out is already been tested.
Oh,
I believe you.

24
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:25.590
But it has an aim.
So let me tell you what's really going on.

25
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.550
The globalist want to play God,

26
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.460
they have what they call a breakaway civilization.

27
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.850
What said it was all about the breakaway civilization was talking about Sandy

28
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.790
Hook,
which I get,
I appreciate letting me cover and I'm sorry it ever happened.

29
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:40.590
I believed it happened.
I'm sorry for people's pain.

30
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.880
And then I ask the families and I asked the,

31
00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:47.490
the the lawyers and I asked them all stop in my name saying I'm the wolf at the

32
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:48.060
door.

33
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.620
Shang go after these families and stopped running around to the news everywhere

34
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.990
saying,
Alex Jones Has Sandy Hook didn't happen because the media,

35
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:59.040
how about some media is the most unpopular thing in the world with 7% approval

36
00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:02.430
rating and Gallup.
So when they say that,
I say it's fake.

37
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.210
That sends people to Connecticut because people think the media lies.

38
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.840
So if they're saying,
Alex Jones said it didn't happen,
it must have not happened.

39
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.990
And now they're trying to create a violent event.
Not the families,

40
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:16.740
but I think some of the people involved know that they make it big enough hype

41
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.410
about it.
They're going to have a big event up there in Connecticut.

42
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:22.950
You understand?
And they're going to blame it on me.
So I'm saying,
no,
no,
no.

43
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.960
I believe it happened.
Stop saying,
I said it didn't happen.
And stop saying that.

44
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:32.850
I'm saying no kids die because I want to talk about human animal hybrids and

45
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:36.810
human knowledge because Joe,
why is it gotta be a humanoid?
Why?

46
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.200
Because if you make it a few percentage points,

47
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.150
another animal or another creature,
it's a gray area.

48
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:47.250
There's no human rights.
You have an animal rights movement.

49
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:51.660
You have a human rights movement.
There's no alien movement.
Aliens are real.

50
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.920
They're creating human animal hybrids that are a new creature never here on

51
00:02:55.921 --> 00:02:59.860
earth.
It's alien.
So the aliens already here,

52
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.870
AI is alien.
The kind of mirrors our alien aliens are already here.

53
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.320
So you're saying they're making these human animal hybrid so they would harvest

54
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:12.790
tissue from them.
That's just level one.
What's level two?

55
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.910
What's level eight?
Because a lot,
I'll tell you a lot.

56
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.190
For the best of my knowledge,
a lot of people think,
oh,
it's,
it's,

57
00:03:19.191 --> 00:03:23.230
it's human harvesting of Falun Gong or these Buddhists really healthy.

58
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.850
That's big.
That's going on because they still have a better non rejection rate.

59
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.740
But with the [inaudible],

60
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.260
I don't remember 22 years ago reading a BB she article that was kind of testing

61
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:39.700
the waters.
They occasionally tested and they go,
oh yeah.
Uh,
about 15 years ago,

62
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.900
the first animal human coming here is her maiden test.

63
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.110
If they were not brought to term,

64
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.650
but some scientists want to implant them in utero and cows because I was,

65
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:48.370
that's a bigger uterus.

66
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.500
She can grow up a bigger humanoid and get more tissue and so then I went mapping

67
00:03:52.501 --> 00:03:54.610
or go research that,
so I went to ut library.

68
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:57.700
At that time he could get some of the Internet in like 1996 and I wouldn't

69
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:59.830
actually pulled up all these MIT report.

70
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.860
I took him to my dad and other people who's doctor and they go,
yeah,

71
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:03.850
that's really crazy.

72
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.120
And it was all about how we've got to prepare the public for this because we're

73
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:12.400
going to be able to download their memories and then put it in a new body.

74
00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:15.410
This was before blade runner,
so she,
it's not like this is the will,

75
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.930
the world's not imitating blade runner.

76
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.040
Blade runner is a preparation for what's coming and they're telling you more

77
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:24.220
human than human.
This is going to be more advanced.
This is going to be better,

78
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.540
but like everything,
like a cell phone or like a vaccine,
it's got a Trojan horse.

79
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.050
It's got a back door.
It's already been tested.
It's already been perfected.

80
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.240
It's being rolled out.
You're not given the real technology.

81
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.680
You're not given the real life extension.

82
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.770
You're given the crap Jo and the earth is seen as like an egg yolk to give the

83
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:43.600
propulsion power for this new thing that's going to be born.

84
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.310
And whether you believe it or not,
just like when the new thing,

85
00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:48.550
meaning artificial intelligence beyond that,

86
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.150
it's a younger version of artificial intelligence and a whole synthesis of new

87
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:56.140
life forms.
And so that's the big giant race.

88
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:57.820
When Elon Musk came in and told you,
cause he goes,

89
00:04:57.821 --> 00:04:59.440
he's building and our functions and he has a conscience.

90
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:01.810
So he's freaked out and they go,
these billionaire functions,

91
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:02.680
I don't just know this,

92
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:06.310
I've talked to people and I was in wired magazine 20 something years ago.

93
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:09.020
While the future does it need as bill joy,
a billionaire co owner,

94
00:05:09.021 --> 00:05:12.730
Sun microsystems,
he goes to a billionaire meeting with 200 guys.

95
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.570
And the consensus was we're not gonna have people play video games and party all

96
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.950
day.
We're going to set up a world government.

97
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.730
We're going to slowly titrate the dose employees in the public,
dumb them down,

98
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.690
put electromagnetic radiation out with five g the scrambles or DNA lowers their

99
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:26.320
Iq.

100
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.780
We're going to cause mass mental illness and a controlled societal collapse that

101
00:05:29.781 --> 00:05:34.781
will then be organized and controlled in the mop up crew by robots controlled by

102
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.760
the globalist programmers who believe with the Offworld entities.

103
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:41.200
They're in communication with that.

104
00:05:41.201 --> 00:05:45.310
They're going to be given the operation to upload and be in that larger kind of

105
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:48.400
Borg Cube System.
Okay.
They sell the country.

106
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.980
You got to hit the brakes because I need to do we take this back to,

107
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.730
I'm so baffled.
What's the matter?
I can even go to one of these things.

108
00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.030
My Mit Technology Review estimates that about 20 pregnancies of pig human or

109
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:00.501
sheep,

110
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:04.410
humankind areas have been established during the last 12 months in the u s total

111
00:06:04.411 --> 00:06:07.880
white than 2016 I a hundred percent believe it.
Look,

112
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.320
I think that as this was going on in 1985 I'm sure they tried to recruit my dad

113
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.920
to a Darpa program.
I believe that in college I there when he was a dentist,

114
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.820
I believe that.

115
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.060
I believe that they will take all sorts of liberties in gray areas when it comes

116
00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:22.910
to scientific.
Yeah.
