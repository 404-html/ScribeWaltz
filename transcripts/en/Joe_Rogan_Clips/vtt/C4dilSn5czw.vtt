00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.170
The joe rogan experience faces of destruct and it's probably happened to kids

2
00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:10.171
and give you took any of the people from the trumpy bear commercial and put them

3
00:00:10.181 --> 00:00:11.120
in that gay club.
Why?

4
00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:14.500
Those guys are smelling each other's shit and Tupperwares and jizzing on the

5
00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:17.860
floor and pissing on each other cause they just wandered into their
accidentally.

6
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.090
They'd all start fucking probably.
Have you seen that video?
The trumpy bear?

7
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.100
I put it on my Instagram last night.

8
00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:27.670
I was watching TV and this fucking thing came on and it's like a Tim and Eric

9
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.810
Sketch.
It's a real commercial for real stuffed animal.

10
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.400
Look at this.
The Trump be bear.
No,
no.
You got to see the video though.

11
00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:39.310
Can you play the video?
Oh,
just go to my Instagram.
Wow.
That A,

12
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.190
I'll put the video up on my hands.
Oh,
that's it.
In the upper corner.

13
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.510
Make that larger and give me some volume.
Listen to this shit.
Listen to this.

14
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.730
The great American grizzly introducing the original trumpy bear.

15
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.320
This is real fearless.
Super plus American.
Now tell me,

16
00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:58.210
this doesn't seem like a Tim and Eric Sketch Watch.

17
00:00:58.211 --> 00:01:02.620
Watch how this goes on like day.
Just find the secret zipper and pullout

18
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.453
<v 1>merging.</v>

19
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.260
It gets crazier.
Watch on flag day and on any American holiday.

20
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.030
God bless America,

21
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.840
frumpy bear since probably the front of the motorcycle for all the world to see

22
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.980
and loves to cruise with his brother.

23
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.120
I'm a former marine and I'm proud to have Trump.
You bear ride by my side.

24
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.730
Fuck yeah.
Once a marine,
always a marine.

25
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.940
Everyone got down from Tim and Eric Sketch Golf course.

26
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.960
Look at this and I ride with Trump.
He married.
He makes my golf game great again.

27
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.170
Jumping back from the bear can pop up anywhere.

28
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.280
Simply styled his trademark and placed him in his favorite chair.
I love it.

29
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.000
Toughens guys will love trumpy.

30
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:52.210
He in the top one business is great businesses.
Great.

31
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.560
I am great.
I love you Trump,
you bam.
I am.

32
00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.650
I am proud to own the company.

33
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.370
Bear and I will always be proud to be an American board of the sequela.

34
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.590
That guy,
hold on.
Hold on.

35
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.170
<v 0>This is fake.
Did you see that guys name as of Warrah?
Holic that's frank.</v>

36
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.800
That's frank war.
Holic like an alcoholic for war.

37
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.360
Go back for bro rank or holic.
That's a gag.

38
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:20.750
This thing's a gag.
Do that.
It's on the radio or it's on TV rather.

39
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.820
It's kind of a gag.
I looked it up after last night.

40
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.250
It is for soda isn't real products,
real products,

41
00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:29.890
so but so this is a comedy sketch.
I kind of knew it had to be.

42
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.930
There's no way it could be that bad.
Oh my God.
You know what it is?

43
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.590
They've made a comedy sketch that's comedy for people like anybody who's paying

44
00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:39.614
attention,

45
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.890
but for people so dumb that they don't realize it's a comedy sketch and they,

46
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.460
they think the way the people in the video thing.
Yeah.

47
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.600
It's like a honeypot for dumb dumbs.

48
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.500
It's brilliant because on one level it's like a really funny sketch.

49
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.900
On the other level,
it's just like people like God damn,

50
00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:01.060
I've always wanted a trumpy bear,
so they make this bear,
they sell this bear.

51
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:03.610
They pretend that they're all patriotic and they just made the dump.

52
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:07.480
Of course it is.
What's wrong with me?
I am the storm.
Of course it's fake.

53
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.810
I was pretty sad,
but this is the world we're living in right now.

54
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:13.420
I believed it was real because it is a real product,

55
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:15.310
but when the lady pulled out or flag,

56
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:18.670
I've got a little suspicious and then the other guy says,
once a marine,

57
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.090
always a marine.
I'm like,
this is a Tim and Eric Sketch.

58
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.230
It's pretty subtle,
man.
Like I like it.
Definitely.

59
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.020
I've seen commercials that Shitty for sure.

60
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.130
Trumpy bear official.
There he is.
Once Maroon.
Oh,
is marine.
Look at my boot.

61
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.200
It's dirty because I work.
What do you a what do you,

62
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.100
<v 2>yeah.</v>
