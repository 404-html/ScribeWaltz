1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.580
But,
uh,
one of the things they're doing in Panama.

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.700
I sat my mom down there to a doctor Neil Riordan cause very good.
Yeah.

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.980
Do you know who he is?
No.
No,
no,
no.
He,
I had him on a show with,
uh,

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.770
with Mel Gibson and Mel Gibson's dad was 92 when he went down there.

5
00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:16.740
He's in a wheelchair.

6
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:19.620
It was all fucked up eight years and he walked back a hundred years old.

7
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:23.010
He's fine.
He's a hundreds,
108 years old.

8
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.230
That's what happens when you 92 and you live eight more years.

9
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.890
Thanks for doing the mass.
That's what happened to him.

10
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:32.580
He yells shit out and you can,
you can say racist shit.
You get it off your chest.

11
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.520
You lift to you a hundred.
Well,
it's only the booze that makes them racist.

12
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:37.920
I know.
Fucking guy's my hero.

13
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.770
Fucking love Mel Gibson.
He's as he ever made a bad movie.
Um,
I mean,

14
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:47.790
made it himself.
Maybe becoming a few shit,
shit movies,

15
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:51.510
but to know toxic masculinity right there.
I liked Apocalypto or that.

16
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.570
I thought that was great.
A lot of people shit on that.

17
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.160
It was right up your alley.
Yeah.
I loved it.
Yeah,
exactly.

18
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.710
I'm fascinated with that.
I wish,
wish I was apart.
No,

19
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:04.980
I love that movie.
I,
I,
you know,
I think he's a,

20
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.150
he's a very intense,
very unusual,

21
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:12.330
eccentric guy.
Like just being around him,
you,
you,

22
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:15.080
you get this sense of his energy.
It's like,
well,
it's all over the place.

23
00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:19.050
All right.
Like rigged them out.
Yeah.
From lethal.
I don't have that.

24
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.360
Like a lot of that I think probably came like that,

25
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:25.590
that character probably came from like the dark inner workings of Mel Gibson's

26
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:29.470
mind you had really is,
you would like yell like that too,
though.
I.
