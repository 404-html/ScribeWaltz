00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.580
I always thought shadow banning was a real thing.

2
00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:05.220
But I think he came out and said that that's not a real thing.

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.990
But I've seen it in my,
you know,

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.240
in person where I'll type somebody's name in and usually it splits to come up on

5
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:14.960
the searches,
but it doesn't,
you know,

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.820
shadow banning is if it is a real thing,

7
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.690
like that's another one like shadow banning for what?
Like if it,

8
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:24.330
if it's not something that is,

9
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.200
if you're not doing something that you could get kicked off the platform for it,

10
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:31.770
right.
You're not taking them off,
you just pushing them down weird place.

11
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.850
But if you're doing that,
like why are you doing that?
Like what?
Because like,
uh,

12
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.550
but what would be the justification from the ones that I have seen three used to

13
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:41.540
even be a website that you could type in somebody's user name to see if their

14
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.220
shadow bands.
So that's kind of interesting.
But,
uh,

15
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.950
like a lot of porn stars or shadow banned cause they don't want,

16
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:50.300
if you're looking up Christina Applegate,
they want Christina,
you know,

17
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.220
apple bottom or something like that.
You know what I mean?
So it's,

18
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.010
it's like I still believe that's a thing,

19
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.070
but I'm pretty sure he came out and said it wasn't a real thing.

20
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.130
Technically a shadow banning Justin Bieber from the trending topics.
Right.

21
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.990
I mean,
they had publicly said that that's not a shadow ban.
That's a strategy.

22
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.680
Well,
no,
there were kind of forced into it because Justin Bieber was so,

23
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.110
his fans trend so hard.

24
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.680
They hashtag the shit out of that thing and they just took over the trending.

25
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.280
It's probably happening for other equally popular celebrities too.

26
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:23.730
Like Taylor swift's and beyond con.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're probably right.

27
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.570
You're probably right.

28
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.070
So whatever they're doing at youtube with comments and whatever they're doing

29
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:33.300
with Twitter,
here's the real conversation,
right?
The real conversation is,

30
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.360
do we want that?
Do we want them to cure rate?

31
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.530
Do we want them to decide whose youtube videos you could subscribe to and who?

32
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.710
I mean,
do they unsubscribe people?
Is that real or is that a glitch?

33
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.190
Who knows?
I don't think they,
I'm subscribed.
I don't think so either.

34
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:55.020
But people have,
let's listen.

35
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.960
If they're willing to move Justin Bieber from the number one trending because

36
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:04.230
he'd number one trends too hard and they think it's ridiculous not to just

37
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:05.580
acknowledge that our culture,

38
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.150
there's certain humans in our culture of spending an exorbitant amount of time

39
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.760
thinking about that beautiful man,
right?
There's a lot.

40
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.960
But why do we want to lie and pretend that it's not as big.
So if they just,

41
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.850
I'm not saying they shouldn't,
but if they did that just,
if they did that,

42
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.750
you go,
okay,
well we,
through the looking glass,
now you can change the data.

43
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.490
Like what?
What do you lend?
When do you decide who gets pushed here?

44
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:31.290
Who gets pushed there?
When do you decide.
