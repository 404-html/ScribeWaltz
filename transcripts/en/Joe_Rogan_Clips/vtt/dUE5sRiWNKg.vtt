1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.210
You said you're managing or you're producing rap artists?
How many?

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.950
Um,
like I'm in the,

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.640
I'm in the studio right now with this group called suicide boys who are awesome.

4
00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:13.990
They're from New Orleans and we have a EAP coming out that's called a live fast

5
00:00:13.991 --> 00:00:18.190
die whenever and we just finished over the weekend,

6
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.070
so or yesterday.
So it's,
you know,

7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.480
you go in there at noon and you leave there at four in the morning every day

8
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.200
until you're finished cause they're only in town for a little while.
So yeah,

9
00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:33.550
it takes a little bit.
Um,
and then like I worked on xxx denotations album,

10
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.260
uh,
before he passed away.
Um,
I worked with like smoke per,

11
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.370
I'm Vic Mensa,
a bunch of different artists.

12
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.490
<v 1>Do you like sad because it's a different genre?</v>

13
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.610
It helps you mix it up a little bit.
Yeah.
You just a big rap fan as well.

14
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.320
Obviously you're wearing an ice cube shirt

15
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.250
<v 0>grew up.
I actually listened to rap music before.</v>

16
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:58.251
This isn't any kind of music at all like Beastie boys and run DMC and public

17
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:02.070
enemy in the far side and Krs one.
That's what I grew up on.

18
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.980
And then I discovered,
yeah,
I loved metal too.

19
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:07.320
I'd love to slayer and king diamond.
And then,

20
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.880
and then I discovered a band called minor threat and the descendants and black

21
00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:14.490
flag and bad brains and I just liked it all.

22
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:18.810
And then my dad listened to jazz music and country rebel music.
So I was born in,

23
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:23.470
raised on like Johnny Cash and Owens and everything.
So,
and I,

24
00:01:23.471 --> 00:01:27.990
I kind of learned to love it all and I had people around me when I was young,

25
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:31.020
when I was first learning how to read music that just kept embedding in my head.

26
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:34.710
Like you got to listen to everything.
You can't just learn one thing.

27
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.640
So I was actually taught how to play like traditional jazz when I was really

28
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:42.360
young and then I taught myself how to play everything else.

29
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.580
That's fucking cool.
Yeah,
but that's always loved everything.

30
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.620
<v 1>That's nice that you have an appreciation for all those different genres too.</v>

31
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.620
<v 0>Yeah.
It'd be like if all you did was UFC commentating,
you'd be like,
Oh,</v>

32
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.650
I'm going to go crazy.

33
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.370
Like this must be so much fun for you and all of your other endeavors.

34
00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:01.850
Like same thing,
like if I was only making,
you know,

35
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.120
punk rock records or pop punk records or whatever it was,

36
00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:09.530
I think I would go insane.
And it's been like that for three years,
you know?

37
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.160
<v 1>Yeah.
I think different people,</v>

38
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.790
I think some people if they're just doing like baseball commentary or something

39
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:16.230
like that,
they're fucking happy as shit.

40
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:18.120
They love it and they just want to do that.

41
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.530
But there's some people like you or maybe like me that I need different things.

42
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.970
Yeah,
I will go crazy.

43
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.900
<v 0>I love like studio life is awesome.</v>

44
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:30.230
Like I did a Hans Zimmer thing and the other week and then the next day I'm in

45
00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:33.920
with like a band called nothing.
Nowhere doing something completely different.

46
00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:38.270
This week I'm doing uh,
a little peep and xxx remix.
It's,

47
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.110
it has to be like that for me or I get really bored and I just don't feel

48
00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:46.310
creative.
So kind of like,
I don't know.
That's cool.
I like that.

49
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.740
<v 1>How does that work?
Like you get a phone call or someone texts you,
hey Travis,</v>

50
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:53.730
we need you to come in here and light this mother fucker on fire and you get in

51
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:54.970
there and yeah,
it's

52
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.260
<v 0>been like that,
you know,
um,
or like,
you know,
some projects manifested.</v>

53
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.910
Like there's this band called the fever three,
three,
three that I produce and uh,

54
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.803
and write with.

55
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.800
And they just got nominated for a grammy like throughout for a grammy for best

56
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:09.700
rock performance.

57
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.300
And that was something I just envisioned with the singer of that band,
Jason.

58
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.580
And we started literally a year ago and the,
and they're nominated for a grammy.

59
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.740
Wow.
So like stuff like that,

60
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:24.280
like kind of being an architecture without building buildings,
you know,

61
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:27.460
being architecture and music or whatever it is,

62
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:28.660
whatever it is you're passionate about,

63
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:32.370
that excites me is building sounds like there's nothing better.

64
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.380
<v 1>And working with different genres to has got to be exciting too because you can</v>

65
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:40.210
mix it up and,
yeah.
Wow.
Now when you're like,
what,

66
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.400
when,
how do you,

67
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.290
how like schedule your time in terms of like how much time are you going to

68
00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:48.190
spend on your own studio work?

69
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.670
How much time are you gonna spend on other people's stuff to just play it by
ear?

70
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.990
It seems like with a guy like you,

71
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:56.650
you must get so many requests and you said you have a hard time saying no.

72
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.170
I would imagine it's fucking overwhelming.

73
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.860
<v 0>Yeah.
Well my kids come first before everything.
Anything,
you know,</v>

74
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.050
and then I get a lot of opportunities.
Like my son Landon is a big rap fan.

75
00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:11.150
Like he loves her.
He was raised on rap music,

76
00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:14.600
like he grew up touring with me and little Wayne when I talk with little Wayne.

77
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.930
Uh,
and he loves being in the studio,

78
00:04:17.931 --> 00:04:21.890
so he'll come with me to the studio so I can kind of like double dip work at the

79
00:04:21.891 --> 00:04:26.810
same time as he's in,
be making music in my studio B,
which is really,

80
00:04:26.811 --> 00:04:29.510
really awesome.
And then same with the Alabama.
She's,

81
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.590
I'm lucky they're both musicians cause Alabama and line in both love music.

82
00:04:33.591 --> 00:04:37.970
So they like going on tour with me.
They're like,
that's amazing with me.
Yeah.
Or,

83
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.880
or I probably wouldn't be working so much.
That's really cool.
Yeah.

84
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.400
What the fuck is it like going on tour with Little Wayne?
He was so awesome.

85
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.430
I came out with a rap,
a rap project where I produced,

86
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.640
I made all the beats and I just got all my favorite rappers.

87
00:04:52.641 --> 00:04:57.370
Everyone from like Rizza from the Wu Tang clan to little Wayne a game.

88
00:04:57.371 --> 00:05:00.140
Swizz beats.
Um,
it was,
it was crazy.

89
00:05:00.141 --> 00:05:05.120
I think I had 30 guests on there and Wayne asked me to go out on tour with him.

90
00:05:05.121 --> 00:05:08.930
So me and mix master Mike from the beasties were like the opening act on that

91
00:05:08.931 --> 00:05:12.980
tour.
And Drake was out there.
Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross.

92
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.110
Wow.
Fun.
So I loaded up the bus with everyone.
I brought yellow a foul.

93
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.200
I brought j rock about Paul Wall.

94
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.200
I brought the cool kids and we just got on a bus and we went on tour.

95
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.800
Jesus is the best.
Yeah.
How long are those shows?
All those people,

96
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.450
how long has that show?
That's not go well with all the acts.
At least four hours.

97
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.760
Yeah,
it's a long time,
but it was so fun.
Fucking shows over like,
good,
Laura,

98
00:05:37.761 --> 00:05:40.250
that audience must be beaten into a coma.
Oh yeah.

99
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.120
But then the headliners on who they are really there to see.
But that,

100
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.740
that was a big accomplishment.

101
00:05:45.741 --> 00:05:50.630
Just being able to play in that genre of music because I listened to it as a
kid.

102
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.990
There's never really been a home for live drummer and a wrap scenario right now.

103
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.030
So from the beginning,
I think,

104
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.870
I don't even know what year it was when puff call me when I had just joined

105
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:06.350
blink and he's like,
y'all want you to be in this video?
I was like,
what?
Like,

106
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.460
you know what I mean?
Cause I've pretty much was,
I was just like,
wow,
I'm in.

107
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:13.640
What are the biggest bands in the world?
I'm so stoked.

108
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:16.790
I couldn't ask for anything more.
And I always want to go.

109
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.500
I always wanted to get some of that tour was so fun.
But yeah,

110
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:24.930
once puff asked me to be in a video,
it was kind of like,
uh,
uh,

111
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.420
it just snowballed from there.
He's just gotten into that world.
Yeah.
And I,

112
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.250
I had no idea why he wanted me,
you know,
but I was just like,
wow,
this is so cool.

113
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:37.880
Because I grew up on biggie.
Like I loved all of that genre in music,

114
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:40.220
but I was okay with just staying in my lane as well.

115
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.310
But when I got accepted with like open arms and I was invited to do like bet

116
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.940
awards with TEI or Tyga or Wayne and it was just insane,
you know,

117
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:52.820
playing the grammys.
The funny thing is I've never played the Grammy's.

118
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:57.500
He'll blink,
but I've played the Grammy's with like Pitbull,
Drake,

119
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.050
mnm like it's so weird.
It's so weird to me.
I just feel it.

120
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:02.990
It's a trip.

121
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.280
The opportunities I've had outside of rock music has been such blessings to you

122
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:10.010
when you say all these things and you know that you did all these things is it

123
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:12.990
almost seemed like you're living in a dream.
Yeah,
I feel like smacking myself.

124
00:07:12.991 --> 00:07:15.380
So like it doesn't feel real when people go like,
Oh,

125
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:19.960
who'd you like to collaborate with?
I feel like I'm so spoiled and I've,

126
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.440
I've been so blessed to play with all these musicians.
I love that.

127
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.490
I just say nobody,
you know,
whatever comes,
I'm happy with.
