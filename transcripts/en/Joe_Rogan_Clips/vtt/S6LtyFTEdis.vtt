Hello Freak bitches.
So you don't think there should be any minimum wage at all?

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.600
No,
no,
no.
None boat.
So someone working for a dollar an hour,

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.170
it doesn't bother you.
Well,
I mean it's better than working for zero.
I mean,

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.790
people think that,
um,
you know,
they,
they want to impose their morals and say,

5
00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:22.020
well,
it's not right for somebody to work for a dollar an hour.
Well,
you know,

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.690
people make rational decisions,
right?

7
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:28.140
And so if somebody is accepting a dollar an hour,

8
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.460
and that must mean that nobody offered them a dollar 50,
nobody offered them $2.

9
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:35.250
I mean,
this is a competitive market.
I mean,

10
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:36.870
I know you have an employee over here.
I mean,

11
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:40.050
could you pay this guy a dollar an hour?
Would you work for you?
I don't think so.

12
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.990
Yeah.
What gets me up because he could get more.
Right.
But he's,

13
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.700
he's educated and skilled and he's an engineer and of course,
right.

14
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.580
But it's very difficult for people to get that sort of an education,

15
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:54.480
particularly in Puerto Rico,
thought it was a third world environment.
So country,

16
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.410
it's not third world.

17
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:59.040
But let's say some kid came in here that had no experience whatsoever,

18
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:00.060
but he wanted to learn.

19
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.870
He wanted to just get you coffee and just sit around and be around you.

20
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.510
He's not that productive.
Yeah,
they use interns,
right?

21
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:08.730
A lot of radio stations do that and they don't pay them anything.

22
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.170
I know that $0 million and I can't do that.
Well then yeah,

23
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.120
but maybe you pay him $5 now,
whatever it is,
but people,

24
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.660
people are going to accept a job.
That's the best one they can get,

25
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.520
and so if somebody is working for a dollar an hour or $2 an hour,
by default,

26
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:26.270
I know that they couldn't find a higher job than that because,

27
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.350
and the reason is because they don't have a lot of skills.

28
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.030
But if you don't have a lot of skills,

29
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.880
the best thing you can do is get a job so you can get some skills.

30
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.510
That's where you learn skills,
you get more skills.
You know,

31
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:39.300
there are people that pay to get skills,
right?
If you go to school,

32
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.830
you actually have to pay tuition.

33
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.880
If I'm getting paid a dollar an hour while I learned something that has value,

34
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.480
that's better.
You have people now borrowing money to learn a skill.

35
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:52.320
People Graduate College and they're in debt.
That's a weird argument,
right?

36
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:54.450
Because you're assuming that they're going to get a skill.
I mean,

37
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:57.720
they might just be handling packages and picking them up and moving to another

38
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:01.890
location.
Even that's a whole or well,
even that's like show up on time,

39
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.010
be responsible,
so disciplines and showed a lot of work.

40
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.740
There's a lot of stuff that you learn when you have a job,

41
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:12.741
but the problem with the minimum wage is that the minimum wage basically hurts

42
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.950
the very people that it's intended to help because the minimum wage basically

43
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:19.260
says if you are a worker,

44
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.740
if you cannot convince an employer to pay you seven 25 or $10 an hour,

45
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.230
whatever the minimum is,
then you cannot accept that job.
See,

46
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:29.910
it doesn't hurt the employer.

47
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.420
It hurts the employee because it limits his options.

48
00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:38.421
It limits his ability to sell his Labor for the highest price that he can get,

49
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.690
and it limits his access to the job market.
It's a,
you know,

50
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:46.440
you can't get on that ladder.
You,
you know,
you remove the lower rungs.

51
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:51.300
And so I can't climb up because of this arbitrary minimum wage because when you

52
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:53.940
pass a minimum wage,
you're not going to force an employer,
right?

53
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:58.320
If I'm an employer and there's a minimum wage of $10 an hour and somebody comes

54
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:02.560
to me and they can deliver $5 an hour worth of productivity,

55
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:06.460
meaning if I hire that person that will benefit me by $5 an hour,

56
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.360
I'm not going to pay them $10 an hour because then I lose $5 an hour.

57
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.500
The only way I'm going to hire somebody who's going to give me $5 an hour worth

58
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:16.000
of productivity is if I can buy them.

59
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.350
If I can hire him for less than $5 an hour so I can make a profit.

60
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:22.510
So it just,
it just a floor.

61
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.220
It's like if you cannot deliver enough productivity of whatever that minimum

62
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:28.660
wages,
then you can't get a job.

63
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.830
And so it's basically making it illegal for people to work.

64
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:36.630
It is the stupidest law that anybody has ever conceived.
A,

65
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.050
it should be obliterated.
I mean,

66
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:41.980
there are some countries like Singapore does not have a minimum wage and you

67
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:45.370
know,
the average income in Singapore is higher than it is here per capita.

68
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:48.130
There's a lot more millionaires there.
I mean,
people have no problem.

69
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.710
We didn't always have a minimum wage in the United States.
I mean,

70
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:55.450
this is a creation of government and you know,
but the,
the initial minimum wages,

71
00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:58.630
if you want to actually go to the origins of minimum wage in the United States,

72
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.810
it was about trying to prevent employers from hiring the Chinese or hiring

73
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:08.050
blacks.
They were trying to force them in ways as a way to create unemployment.

74
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.250
It wasn't,
there wasn't a a good motivation.
But yes,

75
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:14.920
when they try to sell it to the voters,
oh,
it was all about,

76
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.330
we don't want people to be exploited,
but you know,
it's not exploitation.

77
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:23.140
If people voluntarily accept the job because it's the best job they can find,

78
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.740
the person who's offering the best job is not exploiting them.

79
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.130
They're giving them an opportunity.
And if you're denied an opportunity,

80
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.690
I mean there are a lot of people,
oh great,

81
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:34.450
you know they're going to get the minimum wage up to $15 an hour.

82
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.360
Well what good is it being unemployed at $15 an hour?

83
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.370
It's better to be employed at $5 an hour than unemployed at 15 because being

84
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:44.490
unemployed means you make nothing.
Right.

85
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.820
We're a devil's advocate would be that if you can't afford to pay someone $15 an

86
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.890
hour,
then you probably shouldn't have employees in the first place.

87
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.030
Your Business doesn't function that well.
No,
there are plenty.
No,

88
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.960
because there are plenty of jobs where you have entry level positions.
I mean,

89
00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:01.960
if you think that there should be no entry level jobs,

90
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:06.961
I mean you go back to the days of a full service gas stations right?

91
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:08.280
Back in the day when,
you know,

92
00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:11.620
you didn't have to pump your own gas to the case in New Jersey and a few other

93
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:14.020
states,
New Jersey,
you know,
they mandate it,

94
00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:16.030
but you still don't get the level of service.
I mean,

95
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:18.610
if you've pulled into a gas station 40 years ago,

96
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.250
not only did they pump your gas,
but they checked under your hood.
They,

97
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.600
I used to do it.
Tires,
you're,
you're,
you're,
you're,
you're,
you know,
they,

98
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.280
they watched your windows.
Um,
you know,
they did all sorts of things.
Uh,
you know,

99
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:34.210
with,
with your car,
they didn't make very much money.
They lived off of tips.

100
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:38.170
By and large,
it was the minimum wage that eliminated almost all those jobs.

101
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.570
It's a minimum wage.
That is the reason that we have,
you know,

102
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.700
people sell so much self serve.
But what happened,
a lot of these people,

103
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.440
these kids that worked in filling stations became mechanics because all these

104
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:53.180
filling stations had a mechanic there.
And,
and they,

105
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.590
they learned to auto mechanics and a lot of them went on to own their own gas

106
00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:59.060
stations.
But of course a lot of them just,

107
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:02.600
this was their work experience that formed the basis for the rest of their life.

108
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.330
A lot of young kids had these jobs,
summer jobs,

109
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.380
and so there's nothing wrong with a entry level employment.

110
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:11.090
There's nothing wrong with people learning.

111
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.880
The responsibility of having a job of showing up of customer service of
salesmen.

112
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.030
My first jobs were all sales.
I was selling subscriptions door to door.

113
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.780
I was telephone sales as the z channel and California I sold,

114
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:26.300
I was knocking on doors selling cable television.

115
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.240
I worked in a shoe store selling shoes.
I mean,
but hustler.

116
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.780
But you were talking about you as a young man,
right?

117
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.410
A lot of people think of the minimum wage as applied to adults,

118
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.810
adults that have to take care of children,

119
00:06:38.811 --> 00:06:41.240
that I have to put a roof over their head and food on the table.

120
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.080
And you're saying that that,
that they shouldn't be having those jobs.
Well,

121
00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:47.210
by the time you are an adult with kids,

122
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.290
you should have accumulated the skills to earn a lot more than a minimum wage.

123
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.980
So that's the argument.
When people say,
Hey,
you can't afford a family.

124
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:57.500
You can't support a family on the minimum wage.
Of course,

125
00:06:57.501 --> 00:06:59.870
you shouldn't even be trying to support a family.

126
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.680
If you can only earn the minimum wage,
you shouldn't have a family.
You,

127
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.020
you should realize,
hey,
I can't afford a family yet.

128
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.650
Let me acquire the skills before I start fathering children.
Right?

129
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.120
And getting married.
Let me make sure I can support myself.
I mean,

130
00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:17.540
a lot of people who are having the minimum wage,
they're living at home,

131
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.090
they're there.
They,
you know,
they don't need to pay the rent.

132
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:23.900
They're living rent free.
What they need is a job they need maybe gas money,

133
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.970
get some money.
So I could take a girl out on a date,

134
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.730
but I gotta I got to get some work experience.
I got to get out there.

135
00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:31.670
I got to know what it's like to work.
I got to see,
you know,

136
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:34.640
I've got to live in the real world and that's what used to happen.
I mean,

137
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:36.830
you don't have all these summer jobs anymore.

138
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.520
Kids don't have the opportunity because the minimum wage has already priced them

139
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:43.550
out.
A lot of older people now we're taking those,
those jobs.

140
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.040
And so the employment opportunities aren't there.

141
00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:47.780
But when you just raise him in a wage,

142
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.860
all you're doing is raising the bar where you can get your job.

143
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:55.610
You're not helping people.
Now,
there's always going to be some people that,
yeah,

144
00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:58.490
there's going to be somebody who will make a little bit more because of the

145
00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:01.040
minimum wage.
There's going to be those people,
there's gonna be some winners,

146
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.310
but you're going to have lots of people that make nothing because of the minimum

147
00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:05.540
wage.
And then of course,

148
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.500
because you're driving up the cost of labor prices are going up.

149
00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:12.770
And so who is affected the most by higher prices?
Poor people.

150
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:15.860
People who are working on minimum wage.
Uh,
and not only that,

151
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:17.600
you end up with less quality.
I mean,
you know,

152
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.490
I hate it when I call up a company and I'm just in voice mail.

153
00:08:22.491 --> 00:08:26.600
Hell.
And I'm going from when I would like a real person to deal with.

154
00:08:26.601 --> 00:08:29.810
But you know the mood,
the minimum wage,
those jobs don't exist.

155
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:33.600
There's so many jobs that have been automated out of existence because not

156
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.680
automated shipped overseas where there isn't any minimum that too.

157
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.290
I mean that too.
Yeah.
You end up,
if you,

158
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.150
if you actually get a real person there in India,
right,
right.

159
00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:43.760
But we have all these people in America who aren't working.

160
00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:45.530
Why can't they do those jobs?
Yes.

161
00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:47.900
You're not going to be able to support a family on those jobs.

162
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.820
But before you even get a family,

163
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:53.660
you can have that job and then maybe five or 10 years later,

164
00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:55.660
you'll work your way up the ladder,
get a skill,

165
00:08:55.661 --> 00:08:56.820
and then you can support a family.

166
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.760
But nobody is supposed to be able to support a family.

167
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:03.240
And if you try to tell an employer,
hey,
you got to,
you gotta Pay Your Fry,

168
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:06.360
Cook enough money to support a family.
You can't do that.

169
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:08.490
There's not enough productivity cooking French fries.

170
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.330
You can't support a family family.
If all you can do is cook a French fry,

171
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.900
you need to learn how to do something else before you can support a family and

172
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:17.910
you can't,
you can't put that on the employer.

173
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Now when you say that Singapore has a higher average income is,

174
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.170
is that because and no minimum wage,

175
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:28.260
is that because there's a shitload of billionaires that have moved to Singapore

176
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:32.430
because they don't have a minimum wage because they can explore no lower class

177
00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:34.110
people or people that don't make much money.

178
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.040
The the millionaires and billionaires don't eve are really not even affected by

179
00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:40.710
the minimum wage.
What you'd have to look at is the rate of unemployment,

180
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.760
which is tiny in Singapore.
Yes.

181
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.920
They have sentence for very rich people to move there and doesn't that Jack up

182
00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:50.580
the minimum wage or not the minimum wage or either the average income?
Yeah.
Well,

183
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:54.900
the fact that you have entrepreneurs that are succeeding in Singapore because

184
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:58.560
they have small government and low taxes means that there's a lot of competition

185
00:09:58.561 --> 00:10:02.190
for workers and so that's what bids up wages,
right?
Competition.
I mean,

186
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.910
I've got no problem with a vibrant market bidding up wages.

187
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.960
You just don't want the government to try to artificially force wages above

188
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:11.010
their productivity.
Right.

189
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:14.310
Because it's ultimately your productivity that determines your wages.

190
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:24.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>
