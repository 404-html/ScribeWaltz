WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.320
Would you have to get a new snake?
Was that your responsibility?

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.110
We had a guy in a Stamford,
Connecticut.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.600
He was Charles Manson revisited.
This guy was a freak,

4
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.880
rather Stanford,
Connecticut to weird place.

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.110
He had a farm in down Connecticut and they did not know that he had over a

6
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:24.810
thousand snakes in that farm on the building.

7
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.960
And about 150 of them are poisonous.
Nope.

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.820
Cause he was collecting venom for different,

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.040
for different pharmaceutical companies.
But uh,

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.190
I remember one time having to get a snake from it and he flipped through,
uh,

11
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.560
Omaha and you know,
he'd been working with me for a couple of years.

12
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.530
So Albert,
man,
we'll take care of you tonight.
Brilliant.
What is it Jake?
I'm like,

13
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.590
I'm going to take you to a strip joint.
He's like,
it's not necessary.
I'm like,

14
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.630
I know it's not necessarily,
hey bro,
let me take you out.
So we get there,
man.

15
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.810
I use just kind of like sitting there and was heading down towards the table

16
00:00:57.811 --> 00:01:00.060
looking at his beer and drank my job.
And I'm like,

17
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.400
I don't get this motherfucker going,
you know.
So the dude,
you pick her out,

18
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.260
if you'll take a price,
I'll pay for it.
It was on binds and blessing.

19
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.180
He goes,
oh,
Jake,
just coming and take my snakes,
man.

20
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.280
Whoa.
Excuse me.

21
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.480
I just want to go back to the room and play with my snake coming

22
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.080
and won't change rooms.
Different floor.
Wow.
Yeah.

23
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.990
Yeah.
He was a real freaking mess in the snakes.
Is he still alive?
Yeah,
he is.

24
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.830
He was enough Florida when that pet hurricane hit down there and he was working

25
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:42.831
in a gator farm and poisonous snake venom collection point and they had like 800

26
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:48.880
snakes down there.
Right.
So the hurricane hits and just fucking levels of place.

27
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.140
One calling for days,
trying to get ahold of him.
See if he's all right.

28
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.820
I'm finally get a hold of me.
I'm like,
dude,
what are you so fucking happy?

29
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.700
Because it was best time of my life,
man.
This is fucking like God's made this.

30
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:01.830
Especially for me.
I'm like,
what are you talking about?
He goes,

31
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.140
I get to find all those snakes.
You get to find them.
Let me think.

32
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.300
You're going to dig through all that Shit,

33
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.010
all that shit and a lift up stuff and stick your hand down and holes and shit to

34
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:20.100
find these poisons sakes.
Yeah,
man,
it's cool.
I'm like,

35
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.480
fuck you all for your fucked up.
What is it with Florida and snakes,

36
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.290
Connecticut,
man,
whatever.
I know,
but he went to Florida.

37
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:31.260
It's like it draws them there like a magnet.

38
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.520
He was in Connecticut men and they asked him to go do anything for the boy's

39
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:39.510
Club,
you know,
introduce them to snakes and blah,
blah,
blah.
It'd be great,

40
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.210
you know,
for the eight to 12 year olds.

41
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.910
So he gets in there and he's talking to him about this

42
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.550
Mexican rattler.
Now,
first thing you know about snakes exists,

43
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.450
it can be poisonous and a poisonous snakes.
Children.
What happens there?

44
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.630
They're not healthy.
They weren't you.
They can kill you.
Yes,
that's right.

45
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.560
So that's why you should always your,
oh,
oh,
oh my God.
Oh,
hold on.

46
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.050
Okay,
look,
he's accidentally bit me.
Ah,
you know,
I've been bitten now,

47
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:13.051
so I do what I'm gonna do something they call nine one one we're going to,

48
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.640
I'm just going to explain to you what I'm feeling right now.

49
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:16.900
So if you ever get bitten,

50
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:20.230
you'll know what you're going to expect to feel after you've been bitten.

51
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.520
When he fucking with these.
No,
no there fees.
Fucking Biden,
man.
Yeah,
he's fucked.

52
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.560
And he knows that he's fucked because here's the thing about Mexican

53
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:32.940
rattlesnakes,
not many of those in Connecticut.

54
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.520
So you don't have any yet,
do you?
Oh Jesus.
No,
they got to fly it in from fucking,

55
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.420
you know,
it Atlanta or wherever.

56
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.020
So by the time they get that shit out there to me and he's fucked up and they

57
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:46.660
went up and they cut all the meat off one of his bones on his finger.

58
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:50.350
So you've got like this gnarly,
so he had a necropsy,
right?
Yeah,
yeah.

59
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.570
I've seen a video or a website rather detailing this kid is horse bid in the

60
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:59.890
arm.
No meet Bruce had to get him somewhere to safety,
but it took hours.

61
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.020
Med Vac,
I'm and a helicopter,

62
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.190
his whole arm rotted away down to the bone so they had to take meat from his
leg,

63
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.880
get it off and put,
you know,

64
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.950
they had to do skin graphs all over.
I think you went through like 16 operations.

65
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.420
She was awful.

66
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.900
They had a stitch them all together like pull the meat of his arm together and

67
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:20.890
stitch it all together.

68
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.960
I mean it was a giant 10 to 12 inch patch of his arm was gone.
Yeah,

69
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:26.950
it fucks you up.

70
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:31.951
Plus it's a really cool looking thing that it does is it causes all the small

71
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:33.790
capillaries in your eyes to burst.

72
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.200
I don't choose show your eyes are like blood red except they're bumpy.

73
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.240
You know like he would close his eyes and I run my finger over his eyelid and

74
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:47.400
you just feel all these little bumps in crevices and Dan is weird how long it

75
00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:50.700
take for him to recover.
He's in the hospital for a couple of weeks,
man.
He was a,

76
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.520
I hate to put him in a coma for like six days.
Oh Jesus Christ.

77
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.820
Lethally such a cool cool.
Is He,

78
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.950
does he have a tolerance to regular venom?

79
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.650
Cause I know a lot of those guys building a tolerance to different ones.
Yeah,

80
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:05.110
they make themselves get bit.
Yeah.
Cobra.

81
00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:06.890
I think he's pretty much clean on this guy.

82
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.090
Sounds like he's going to end up being a super villain of some kind.

83
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:14.380
Just so he could be mad.
Cause I swear to God he is Charles Manson.
Wow.

84
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.150
He looks like Charles Manson looks weird.
Like anyone.
He smiles just like,
dude,

85
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:23.740
that is not healthy.
You know,
he didn't,
you know fuck man.
Wow.

86
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:26.860
He's a true,
imagine what this guy would be like without snakes.

87
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:30.790
Thank God snakes exists.
Well you have the steamboat,
you know,

88
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:32.750
come up with a Komodo dragon thing,
you know,
to,

89
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.510
to come back to snake back in the day.

90
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.580
So of course that's who Albert Albert was the guy with the Komodo dragons.

91
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.990
So he,

92
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.990
he had some pot that he was growing up in the mountains and he took one of the

93
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:49.990
dragons with him
to get it out in the sunlight.

94
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.800
So they put it in this fucking station wagon and they go up in the mountains and

95
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.690
they actually walk to their place where they get their stuff growing.

96
00:05:56.691 --> 00:05:58.730
So they close the car door up,

97
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.990
leave the window down about that much take off,

98
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.690
come back window's busted.
Oh,
Jesus.
Or GS.

99
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.220
Horrible teeth marks on all of it in this fucking Komodo Dragon.

100
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.240
Mature in his way out of this shit.
He was in a wooden Katie.

101
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.910
He chewed his way out of the wooden case.
He got out,
man.
It took off.

102
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.360
I guess it's about two months later,
man.

103
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:25.361
I was like in Indianapolis and waking up and listen to the news and the ESPN

104
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:30.611
zone or like what was thought to be a prehistoric monster was found running

105
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:35.120
across the backyard and Miss Gibbons House chasing her port,
a little poodle.

106
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.190
When we get back,
see our monster.
Wow.

107
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.380
They come back and I'm sitting on what the fuck pull to be prehistoric.

108
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.350
I've gotten,
I'm going to see this shit in the fucking thing comes back up.

109
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:50.330
I'm like,
that's fucking Albert's fucking thing,
man.

110
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.330
It's the thing that had escaped two months later.

111
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.260
It gained like 35 pounds and everybody's dogs and cats in the neighborhood,

112
00:06:59.721 --> 00:07:03.530
man.
And couple of kids too.
Who knows such a ruthless animal,
you know,

113
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:08.120
those are so ruthless that the little baby Komodo dragons smear shit on

114
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:12.320
themselves so that the grownups don't eat them so that their parents don't eat

115
00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:12.800
them.

116
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.410
They roll around and shit so that their parents don't eat them because uh,

117
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.970
when Komodo dragons are eating intestines,

118
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.110
they shake the shit out of and test it.
They don't like to eat shit.

119
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.340
As weird as that is that after this bad attitude,

120
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.220
I had a problem with cocaine.

121
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.640
I imagine that they eat their fucking kids so the kids know this.
So they,

122
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.350
they somehow or another like no,
to smear themselves and shit.

123
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.200
I'd learned pretty quick.
Yeah.
You see your sister get chewed out,
right?

124
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:49.010
You see them avoid shit but eat your sister.
You're like,
that shit is salvation.

125
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.920
You some good shit.
It gained 30 pounds.
That's fucking crazy.
Yeah.

126
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.490
Let it loose in Florida.
They wouldn't even notice.
Fuck no,
no.

127
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.060
Everything else they got down.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That the Florida everglades,

128
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:06.290
it's so crazy with pythons,
man,
so,
so bad that they're eating alligators.

129
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.160
They did this study.
They found that they couldn't find any raccoons.

130
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.000
They couldn't find any swamp rabbits or march hares,
I guess they called them.

131
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.800
Yeah.
Everything got killed by python.
So then the pythons moved on to alligators.

132
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.540
Yeah.
Alligators.
Look around,
man.

133
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:27.070
I've got a picture of an anaconda swallowing an 800 pound horse.

134
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.710
Why?
It's got the head in the front legs already chewed up inside of the last

135
00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:38.250
picture.
You know,
I need it.
I'll get you.
I need that fucking Croesus Shit,
man.

136
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.223
See if he could find that.

137
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.620
Jamille powers bodies like this big place with his back.

138
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:44.450
He probably can't pull it up.
Ah,

139
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.870
Jamie,
he's coming at you hard and whip it.
