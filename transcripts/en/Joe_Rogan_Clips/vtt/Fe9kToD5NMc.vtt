1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.440
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.370
optimism weight about 10 pounds and then they told me he would never fight a one

3
00:00:06.371 --> 00:00:11.320
85 again if I took the fight.
I mean one 70 again if I took the fight.

4
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.020
So he lost me sway,

5
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.970
still got the Tufts coaching job and on top of that he was going to get a

6
00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:21.630
tighter shot.
Had it beaten me.
But why do you,
so you again,

7
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:24.720
it comes to this chip on your shoulder thing.
You feel like everybody's against,

8
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:28.590
you know you do a little,
I don't know.
You want me to though?
No,
you do.

9
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.100
This is what the,
what you're saying is the things that you're saying.
Yes.

10
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.560
I'm just saying that I know,
I know the,

11
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.500
I know the deck of cards I got and I know how to play these technical.

12
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.970
What do you think the deck of cards is?

13
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.690
The deck of cars is going to come a moment when I'm a superstar and when I get

14
00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:43.760
to that moment,
I have more leverage at this time.

15
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.580
I'm not at the point where kind McGregor's at.
So I got,

16
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.360
if I got to fight the number one contender and I can't vouch how to fight at

17
00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:54.170
George St Pierre or piss being or a con or a need at this moment,

18
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.870
I'm going to keep whooping ass until I get to that.

19
00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.200
Well after George beaten right now,
George is in an amazing position,
right?

20
00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:03.170
And George Beats Bisbing if he wanted it and he dropped the title.

21
00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:08.000
But if you wanted to come back and fight you for uh,
the welterweight title,

22
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.390
that's a legitimate super fight right there.
I mean that makes a lot of sense.

23
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.010
Coming off of his big fight.
You don't think he does?
Look,
did you tell me,

24
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.680
you think Joe's wonderful.
Look at your faith.
George had these,
George,

25
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.380
she has to fight me before business.

26
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.140
He chose if I business well maybe you felt like that was a better fight for him

27
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:28.080
to come back with.
It was a definitely a better fight cause he,
it came back,

28
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:30.900
he gets me looking like that.
George would have been right back in retirement.

29
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.980
He did not look great.
Bismuth and did not look great.
Um,

30
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:38.220
one thing that helped George Nfi,
his experience,
he loosened up.

31
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.610
He was a little uptight,
you know,
I hadn't been an octagon what,
four years?

32
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:46.610
Almost a little over two or three.
Right.
It's more than that was it for,

33
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.930
it was almost four.
It wasn't quite far.
It's almost four cause I fought November,

34
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.940
I found November UFC,
there's a 25th anniversary.
I you're right.

35
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.150
I think it was like [inaudible].
Yeah,
okay.

36
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.360
That's a long ass time.
So he,
for him to not fight that long,

37
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.050
how much you train your ass in our fight fighting,

38
00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:10.390
you'll have a training camp focus on a person.
It's tough.
So when he came back,

39
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.150
I saw the experience kicking.
He relax a little bit.
That's when he faked,

40
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.480
lended a left hook heading.
Not relaxed.
I mean,
you know,

41
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.310
who knows would've happened.
You know what I mean?
It was,
uh,

42
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.730
it was interesting because Bisping was tight and I expected,

43
00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:28.960
I expected him to be looser.
Big business doesn't have the,
the,

44
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.390
I mean he's not guys out,
but he's not a guy that,
you know,

45
00:02:31.391 --> 00:02:35.470
you're taking over like a rumble white or incontinence or myself or so one shot

46
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.970
Stephens,
Jeremy Stevens,
somebody that's going to touch you in this overweight.

47
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.970
So with that said,
he's a,
he's a person that's going to be volume.

48
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.270
He's going to be in your face,
great conditioning.
He's very durable.

49
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.260
And George had to make that adjustment.
He said,
all right,

50
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.910
and to be an athlete on this guy,

51
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.370
then we fake him out and then me get them thinking about the shot.

52
00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:56.010
I took him down twice.
Let me get them thinking about it.

53
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.930
Level checks come up and foot,
very smart move.
And that's something,

54
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.690
the experience of being a champion.
Um,
a lot of them do.
Well,

55
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:03.520
there was some talk about him fighting Conor,

56
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:07.270
but I didn't hear any of that from the official people and him fighting Conor at

57
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:10.690
170 pounds would have been fascinating in terms of like,

58
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.980
it's a terrible matchup for Connor.
Yeah.
You know,

59
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.530
in terms of like just physicality.
Once again,
risk and reward.

60
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.010
What happens is the greatest welterweight of all time.
Yeah.

61
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.810
People going to torture him about it.
Yeah.
Mcconnell does.

62
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.500
WHATSAPP was another fight right now.
Like this is not a good time,

63
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:29.440
especially in his division.
There's so much talent.
Like right now.

64
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.830
He want to see he'll be right now.
That's what I'm saying.

65
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.670
That's what I want to say are telling me.
I mean,
Tony's,
uh,
if,

66
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.590
if I was Connor,
which I'm not,
um,

67
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.790
if I had the pick the fight,
they're both are going to be,
I mean he'll be,

68
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:48.250
might be a bigger draw.
Cause you got a huge,

69
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:52.210
huge hundred and 47 million people in Russia might be a bigger draw,

70
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.190
but they both are very annoying fights.
Very dangerous fights.
Dangerous.

71
00:03:57.191 --> 00:03:58.770
Tony Ferguson,
you know,

72
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.350
they don't take much for him to find a way to get around your neck and choking.

73
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.580
He's always get tired.
He doesn't get tired.

74
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:05.780
He looks like he's losing fights and he don't care.

75
00:04:05.781 --> 00:04:07.730
He's striking is very awkward.
Um,

76
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.730
he can really do a Nadya's did to Conor and Nate Diaz no baffled.
I'm like,
damn,

77
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:16.090
I hit you with everything.
You still around.
They kind of will for the damn shot.

78
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.720
The same thing's gonna happen.
He do that to Tony.
Tony's gonna submit them.

79
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.900
Here's my prediction,
my prediction Conners and fight for a while.

80
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.620
He watched those two things to trip him.
They strip Connor and he comes by me,

81
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.850
Habib and Tony.
Fight for the world title for you.

82
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.650
I don't think either one of those guys are in the cars right now.
But for you,

83
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.560
what's your dream?
To be honest is,
um,
you know what my dream was to really,

84
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.730
I wanted to,
I wanted to find yours and as possible,

85
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.230
I felt like if I fall George,

86
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:50.230
I can legitimately say I'm the best welterweight of all time.
If I beat him,

87
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.790
it's still possible.
George hasn't retired.
He said anything about you?

88
00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.010
He asked one time like Fox Q and a or he was gonna like,

89
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.180
so Tyrone,
if you fought,
what would be your game plan?
You know,
if you fought us,

90
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.190
but it got exed out because they didn't want to get all the fans pumped up that

91
00:05:07.191 --> 00:05:11.800
we were fighting.
Why wouldn't they?
Do you think they're plotting against you?

92
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:15.580
It's here it is.
I see it in your face,
Joe.
He is not going to do,

93
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.850
I am too bright.

94
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.980
You want me to be like out the people who know me?
Listen,

95
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.550
I want you to just be focused.
You want me to be real?
Yeah,
for sure.

96
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:31.360
Let me real sure.
Do I think that the people want to see me lose?
No,

97
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:32.410
I don't think they want to see me little.

98
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:36.970
So I think that sometimes I'm a pain in the ass.
Yeah,
I am.
But in business,

99
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:39.010
at one point,
in any business,

100
00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:42.820
there's not the person that's doing the business now what they best interests.

101
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.710
So if I'm an athlete and I'm looking out for my best interest,

102
00:05:46.711 --> 00:05:50.830
and I'm trying to put myself in a position where you know,
I can fight,

103
00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:54.670
become a legend,
become a hall of Famer,
I should do that.

104
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.010
If I want to be paid appropriately,
I should do that.

105
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.080
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
