1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.940
On Twitter.
You know,
Milo wants say mean things block mute.
You know what I'd do?

2
00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:06.800
I press yes.
Yeah,
the block people.
I blocked some people.
Yeah,

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.540
the Milo one was very,
very weird.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.390
They were looking for a re and here's the other part of it.

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.570
You know what he ultimately got in trouble air quotes for was him talking about

6
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:24.201
the positive experiences that he had as a young man being molested.

7
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.600
I think that was after he was already band though.
I don't think so.
Well,

8
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.130
he might've been banned from Twitter already,

9
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.250
but then he got kicked off of Youtube and he left,
I don't think,

10
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.240
say it off youtube.
He's,

11
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:36.220
I think he's still on youtube was it was at Breitbart that he left fired.

12
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.680
He quit Breitbart,
Breitbart.
It's another thing too though,
you know,

13
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.980
I see all these journalists writing all these articles saying like Milo has
gone,

14
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:46.140
Milo is whining and he's no more.
I'm like,
dude,

15
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:49.530
it's got like 6 million followers across his Instagram is youtube and his

16
00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:52.350
Facebook.
He posts all the time.
Yeah,
the journey.

17
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.460
He's not in the public conversation as much as he was before because Dave

18
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.390
censored them when you're not on Twitter.
Right.

19
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.760
The journalists who make up the huge core of their verified users who apparently

20
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.830
according to seen on a car like the lifeline,
their platform,
I'm talking,

21
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.170
I'm talking about you,
but here's my point.

22
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:11.190
He's not saying that men should go have sex with younger boys.

23
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:14.070
He was basically saying that it could be a positive experience because it was

24
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:14.640
for him.

25
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.090
Why don't I don't know anything about what happened in that capacity in my,

26
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.120
my point was if I said when I was 13 a 21 year old girl fondled me,

27
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.080
do you think I'd get in trouble if I said it was awesome?
No,
I better wouldn't.

28
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.500
You wouldn't.
Yeah.
Yeah,

29
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.740
that's right.

30
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.190
My brother was pointing out because a law and order Svu is basically on 24 seven

31
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.070
it's like 98% of the episodes are only ever about women,

32
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.080
never about men being victims.
Sometimes they are,
but he was like,
oh,

33
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:47.520
I just realized that and I was like,
let's decide here.
Well,

34
00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:50.170
that's special victims unit.
That's the show.
I mean the,
the,

35
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.500
they have so many versions of law and order,

36
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:53.870
but that one in particular where I don't know,

37
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.670
but I mean it deals with sex crimes.
Yes.
And almost every episode,

38
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.090
it rarely ever talks about male victims.
Right.
Which exists,
you know what I mean?

39
00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:03.510
And so I don't want to get like into a men's rights thing,
but no,

40
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:06.500
I think it's fairly obvious to a lot of people,
like you mentioned.
Yeah.

41
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.930
If you said it,
nobody would care it but Milo's gay.
Right.
And so that becomes,

42
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:13.950
you know,
becomes a thing for him.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
um,

43
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.580
there's,
we need some kind of clear guidelines,

44
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.290
right.
Where you can operate inside these guidelines and all's fair.

45
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.980
It's just,
I mean,
to an extent,
to an extent,
it is tough shit.

46
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.020
Comedians will be allowed to operate dancing on the line.
You know what I mean?

47
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.150
Like obviously I think so.
Right,
right.
I'll tell you,
I can't tell you this shit.

48
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.450
I'll tell you something after this is over.
That's going to,

49
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.950
you're going to think it's hilarious and we'll find out about it in the future.

50
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.590
Oh,
and everyone's going to be eating secret.
No,
no,
no.
It's not a secret.

51
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:50.930
It's a comedy secret.
It's about something.
But you know what she said,

52
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.250
but I'll take this out to you to remind me,

53
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.280
but I'll take this opportunity to segue into another point when it comes to the

54
00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:59.500
bias,
right?
How is it that you can have Jimmy Kimmel,

55
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.110
Jimmy Fallon dress in black face on there?
Uh,

56
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.770
CNN made a big list.
I don't know exactly when it happened.
I think,
uh,

57
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.450
Kimball was on the man show.
He dressed like a basketball player.
Oh Geez.

58
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.620
And Jimmy Fallon.
Just like Chris Rock.
Oh,
Jesus.
Sarah Silverman did it.
She,

59
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:18.010
I think she addressed it though.
Yes.
Everybody,
nobody loses their minds.

60
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.250
Nobody loses their minds over that because they're on the left.
You think?

61
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.990
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
It's,
it's,
I,
I honestly,
I would say to an extent,

62
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.960
there's probably some kind of tribal bias.
Well,

63
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.370
I think when you're going back to high school yearbooks,

64
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:34.960
looking for outrage from 55 year old people,
if you've lost the plot,
isn't that?

65
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:35.530
Isn't that crazy?
