1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.810
I think that some of what we call paranoia,

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.870
just normal paranoia is hypersensitivity and hyper awareness and awareness to a

3
00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:11.520
lot of things that you're putting off in the back of your head.

4
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:15.510
Because in order to function as a normal person get through this life,

5
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:19.950
you can't really be aware of everything.
Otherwise you'd be paralyzed by fear.

6
00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:23.550
We're in space.
Okay,
we are on a gigantic ball.

7
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:27.240
It's spinning a thousand miles an hour hurling through infinity.
This,

8
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.740
this is reality.
And take us out thin layer of gas.

9
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:35.410
It's protecting us from everything that's flying around in our solar system,

10
00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:39.030
by the way,
a best to give you any five years and then it's all right.

11
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:41.460
And even if you make it to a hundred the last 15 talk shit,

12
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.030
we had the stem cells and stuff like that to timidity.
Yeah,

13
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:51.060
maybe to live to be 300 what do you do with the universe is infinite.

14
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.290
I like you're gonna die like the sun is going to end like at the end.
I mean,

15
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:58.710
imagine if people do live to an infinite number where we realized that fucking

16
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:02.790
son is dying.
You're going to freak out about that.
It's all relative,
right?

17
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.580
So there,

18
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.550
there's only so much you really can think about in some of what paranoia is,

19
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.830
is this hyper awareness of all these variables that you really haven't,

20
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.450
haven't considered.
And then also we were talking about before,

21
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:19.080
the things that can be beneficial to the hyper awareness of how you communicated

22
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:21.480
with people.
Maybe you've could have done a better job with that.
Maybe you,

23
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.710
you came in hot,

24
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.840
maybe you were upset about something else when you ran into them,

25
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:28.220
you already had a seven and they brought you to a 10 it was totally unnecessary.

26
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.210
Within a normal situation,

27
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:33.840
you would have only been at a too that those things are real and sometimes

28
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:38.400
marijuana helps highlight all the errors in your way.
I think it can be a tool,

29
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.150
but my description of it is like any other tool,
like a hammer,

30
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.120
you can build a house with a hammer or you could just hit yourself in the Dick

31
00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:47.250
if you're fucking crazy.
And this,

32
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.990
this is something that I think we should consider when we're discussing almost

33
00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:54.060
any psychedelic medicine.
And I think that,

34
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.450
I really do believe that marijuana is a psychedelic and I don't even think it's

35
00:01:57.451 --> 00:02:01.440
a mild one,
especially when it's an edible form.
I don't think it's mild at all.

36
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.940
Yeah.
I mean there's some people that,
that come in to my office for example,

37
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:10.040
and like just when I meet them,
like after one or two minutes,
I was just,

38
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.840
I just got to decide in my head,
this person's not using THC like this.

39
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.350
This person is anxious with gives you that it was that what it is anxious.
Yeah.

40
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.890
It's just a feeling of um,
they're not really,

41
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:27.180
they're not someone who can just sit and kind of like be by themselves,
you know,

42
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:30.360
they just kind of give me the impression that,
um,
you know,
they're,

43
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:35.361
they're not going to do well with cannabis because if they have any type of

44
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:39.810
change in their,
um,
in their psyche,
they're going to see that as bad.

45
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.080
That's bad.
And like you got it when you're using cannabis,
you,

46
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.220
you have to be sewn and who,
who knows that okay.

47
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.370
Are going to get a little bit of maybe paranoid out,

48
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.210
or at least my psyche's going to change a little bit.
I am using,
you know,

49
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.990
psychoactive substance and not be able to freak out.
Right?
But some people,

50
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.140
um,
you know,
I know that if the youth a little bit of Thc,

51
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.900
they probably would have a freak out.
They probably would have a bad experience.

52
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.050
Generally,
it's people who are,
you know,
very,
very fearful.

53
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.760
Now the other side of that coin though is that if you CBD and like we discussed

54
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:15.610
earlier,
that can decrease learned fear,
right?
So,
so that,

55
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:19.000
so that's something that's,
that's really helpful for those patients.
But,

56
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.010
you know,
I do agree that,
um,
you know,

57
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:24.600
we have to be careful about using high THC in,

58
00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:26.950
in certain groups of people.
For sure.
