1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.330
Good to see though,
man.
What's up?
Good to be here and talk.
Hunter Thompson.

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.960
My my pleasure.
Um,
so your book free kingdom,

3
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.310
you know,
we live in interesting times right now.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.310
It's kind of a kind of a shit show at every campus in a moment.

5
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:18.020
About a fist from your face.
Pull that sucker.
My hands.

6
00:00:18.021 --> 00:00:19.860
Should I put them up and do whatever you want with your hands.

7
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.250
Shoot with this one,
what is all this a,
you had a lot of writing.
Well,

8
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.110
when I wrote the book I wanted to make sure my sentence never sounded like

9
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:32.130
Thompson sentences,
so I didn't write out a lot of his sentences.

10
00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:35.470
But this morning before coming on I went and got some of my favorite quotes from

11
00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:38.310
just word of out long handed to get a sense of what is a,

12
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.380
what his perspective was when rhythm.
Once again,

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.370
didn't he do that with the Great Gatsby?
He like a few times by hand.

14
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:45.860
He like typed it out.
Yeah.

15
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.400
I love that idea that he was trying to find like the rhythm of the words.

16
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.110
That's such a fascinating notion because comedians do that in the early days of

17
00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:57.420
comedy,
like a lot of guys,
um,

18
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.020
in like before they ever start getting on stage themselves,

19
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.140
they'll imitate their favorite comedians,
bits.

20
00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:07.590
Like they'll do a Richard Pryor bit and they'll do it to their friends and

21
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:08.130
they'll get,

22
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.390
get a sense of the rhythm and the timing and get those laughs from doing a

23
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:15.450
Richard Pryor bit to their friends.
And then they get that bug.

24
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.960
It's like part of what infects them.
I mean,
that's the hardest thing to steal.

25
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:21.930
We're not plagiarizing,
but we're trying to understand what decisions they made.

26
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.050
Beautiful work.
Yeah.
I'm sure he wasn't plagiarizing,
but it's,

27
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.380
it's so unfortunate when,
when someone does.
Yes.
You know,
when,

28
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.770
when you have someone,

29
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.820
whether it's a hunter or Richard Pryor or anyone who's just got a truly

30
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.380
exceptional and unique mind or someone who doesn't like our president and

31
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:45.381
decided when he ran in 2016 to plagiarize Richard Nixon's 1968 convention speech

32
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.790
speeches directly.
Really?
Yeah.

33
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:51.240
That was the headlight and the fucking times it said Nixon's inspiration.

34
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.100
I'm sorry.
Uh,
Trump's inspiration.
Nixon is the one.
So the light's about crime in,

35
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:58.260
um,
like barbarians at the gate,
crime,
law and order.

36
00:01:58.261 --> 00:02:01.620
Those were all from Nixon's Shitty but successful in 1968,

37
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.080
a Miami convention speech and Thompson,
you know,

38
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.140
Thompson knew how effective that that was.
Yeah.

39
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:11.880
I wonder if he did that on purpose because he was so good in one thing that

40
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:15.390
Trump is so good at it.
He's so good at getting the media to talk about him.

41
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.171
And like,

42
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:19.410
one of the best ways to get the media to talk about him was give them something

43
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:22.380
to be angry about that no one else is going to give a fuck about.
He was like,
oh,

44
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:25.650
well Anya plagiarize,
but I plagiarize much better from Nixon.

45
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.650
I loved it.
And Melania took some lines from Michelle Obama's speech,
right?

46
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.460
Yeah.
If you plagiarize Nixon,
that's okay.
All right.
So freaking dumb.

47
00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:36.570
The book about Hunter s Thompson.

48
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:40.050
I mean it's really about taking the fucking emotion of living in this present,

49
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.640
looking back at Thompson's career and then trying to write,
um,

50
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.980
it like a novel to dramatize all of the experiences he went through that art

51
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.920
today so applicable to us and just show his perspective that's so applicable to

52
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:56.190
us today.
What do you got here,
Jamie,
from New York Times?

53
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.490
Donald Trump's going to finish anybody inspiration and Nixon,
I was like,
are you,

54
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.150
you're running on Nixon,
that's what you're running on.
Here's some parallels,

55
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.240
you know,
I mean,
do you remember when,
um,

56
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.170
when hunter got together with a Bill Murray and bill's brother and they did that

57
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:17.650
thing where they were trying to get people to a,
Nixon got a bad deal.

58
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.310
We've got to bring them back and people were going along with it.
Oh yeah.

59
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:25.210
That's good.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I remember that like that.

60
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.900
There's a lot of parallels with Trump in that regard.
I mean,

61
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.560
one of my favorite quotes by Thompson is like,
um,
you know,

62
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.590
Richard Nixon is with this Barbie doll family and his Barbie doll wife is like

63
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:39.750
America's answer to um,
you know,

64
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:43.780
it's America's doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and like,
you know,
he is the Werewolf.

65
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.340
He speaks to the Werewolf in us and Nixon chose to hide that Werewolf his whole

66
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:50.620
career until it finally came out cause he was insane with power.

67
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.850
Trump ran on the werewolf.
He's like,
no,
I'm not going to hide it.
That's who I am.

68
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.480
That's what I'm going to use to try to get elected.
And like George Wallace did,

69
00:03:58.481 --> 00:03:59.680
like other politicians did.

70
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.980
It had resonance and it happened with Trump because of our media environment,

71
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.790
because of the place we live in now to amplify them all the way to the most

72
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:08.860
powerful position in the world,
which is insane.

73
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.250
It would be really fascinating to see if hunter was alive and in his prime.

74
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:16.530
Now how he,
I think his take on that were very similar to Matt Tie EBS,

75
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.320
you know like mad tie Eeb is in my opinion,

76
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.280
our more reasonable,
more put together version of Hunter Thompson.
Yeah.

77
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.720
Cause he's more stained discipline,

78
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.570
long career for each of the pathologies like rational and he's there all the

79
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:32.880
time.
Like the,

80
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.630
I'm sure you've heard the recently uncovered recording of hunter calling in to

81
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:41.400
some company that installed a DVD player and he's fucking screaming and yell at,

82
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.880
it's like 15 minutes long and then he like gets lost.

83
00:04:43.881 --> 00:04:46.300
I think that's what the fuck and the DVD player doesn't work.

84
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.950
Y'All got y'all my fucking cards.
I mean that was in the 1980s were not the best.

85
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.830
You know,
I think what Toby does is what Thompson did very well on.

86
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.750
It was really good at looking at Nixon saying,

87
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:57.830
how are you manipulating the way we see you?

88
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.150
You get a version of you out and Toby looks at the way the media gets played.

89
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.240
He looks at the way that an administration manipulates the media and he

90
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:07.060
dramatizes that while everybody else just gives us the information the

91
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:09.610
administration is giving us.
And that goes back to Thompson with Nixon.

92
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.970
Thomson had space when he worked for rolling stone and he could write about how

93
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.710
Nixon made everybody watch his speeches,

94
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:18.670
the press on a closed circuit television and they made the press just like Trump

95
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.270
off in the corner when the plane arrived,
you know,
being berated by everybody.

96
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.930
It's very similar to what is going on now.
And again,

97
00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:28.900
we see people getting hot takes are we see people doing eds.

98
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.230
We don't see people dramatizing how manipulative these corrupt administrations

99
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.520
are.
And were,
and Thompson did that beautifully Tybee does that be a play?

100
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.410
Was a Nixon being berated by the press?

101
00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:42.940
Is that why he chose to have thought it was,

102
00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:46.420
I mean he was a crook so he doesn't want the press to investigate them.
Like he,

103
00:05:46.421 --> 00:05:48.010
you know,
he was a cricket with San Clemente,

104
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.060
like his loans with Bibi rebozo and all of that.
He was a curriculum.

105
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.350
They use the IRS to investigate his,
and it needs,

106
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:56.230
he was a crook when he tried to break into the Brookings Institution to destroy

107
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.073
and fom evidence.

108
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.010
He didn't want the press around him because he had committed very serious crimes

109
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:04.910
that I think that's similar to what we see now.
I mean,
as people sit on the show,

110
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:08.180
no,
no president wants the a journalist,
you know,

111
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:11.600
digging into their lives specifically because you don't want chumminess with

112
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:12.021
journalists.

113
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:16.370
But I think Trump and Nixon both knew they had so much to hide that to actually

114
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:19.310
have a journalist like Hunter Thompson who was a good investigative journalist,

115
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:23.630
to have the most like my TV around,
that's dangerous for them.
They'll go to jail,

116
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.270
which Nixon should have Trump perhaps should,

117
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.320
while who knows what's going to happen.
How did you,
uh,

118
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.690
how'd you get involved with a writing this book?
Well,
I mean,

119
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.860
I've always loved on her assumption in I was,
you get exposed to them,
you know,

120
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:38.060
in,
in,
in,
uh,

121
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.460
I was 17 years old in a Catholic high school at Bellarmine college preparatory

122
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:46.610
up in San Jose and we had a counterculture,
a writing class.

123
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.370
And so I read some of it in there.
And then a friend had an audio book,

124
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.180
the fear and loathing.

125
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.960
And so I just remember the first time hearing that old audio book of fear and

126
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.980
Lillian where somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert.

127
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.660
And then in my twenties I really got into strange rumblings and [inaudible],

128
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.250
which is about a conspiracy within the Los Angeles Police Department.
Um,

129
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.370
regarding the death of Ruben Salazar.
I'm a prominent journalist and I read that,

130
00:07:07.371 --> 00:07:08.390
I'm like,
oh my God,
dude,

131
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.020
this isn't somebody that's just dancing on stage or like performing a road

132
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:12.740
narrative.

133
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.650
This is an investigative journalist who's going to the most powerful people

134
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.940
exposing things they don't want us to see and in a sense of risking his life to

135
00:07:19.941 --> 00:07:22.580
do so.
Because he says in strange rumblings in Oslo long,

136
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:26.510
which has in rolling stone in 1970 he says that they're willing to kill Ruben

137
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.940
Salazar who was the most prominent journalist in Los Angeles.

138
00:07:28.941 --> 00:07:32.000
You could argue at the time what the fuck is to stop them from killing me.

139
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.920
Hunter Thompson for asking these questions.

140
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.600
Well I think that's what a lot of people were saying today with Jamil Cause

141
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.530
Shogi,
you know,

142
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.180
Jamal could show his death has got a lot of journalists really freaking out.

143
00:07:44.181 --> 00:07:47.420
Like what,
you know,
what am I doing if I'm criticizing world leaders,

144
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.900
talking about international politics,
if this could happen to me,

145
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.170
political violence is effective because it's used to silence either opposition

146
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.580
or journalists.
And so for me,

147
00:07:58.581 --> 00:08:01.370
writing this book and I tried to dramatize it like a novel,
it's quick,

148
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:04.850
it's like only 200 2,210 pages and then it's like a hundred pages of notes.

149
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.660
So I like cited every site smeller sound so that somebody that knows Thompson

150
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:11.230
really well,
it can be like,
where the fuck did you get this information right?

151
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.790
And somebody else can if they have questions,
just go back and look.

152
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:16.860
But long story short for me,
the crux of the book,
um,

153
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.630
was in Chicago in 1968 where a hundred Thompson at a press pass,

154
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.100
he went to the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night.

155
00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:28.310
Mayor Daley gave this order to clear the intersection of Balbo in Michigan

156
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.550
because there is a protest going on.
Five,
10,000 people.

157
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.030
Thompson was standing next to the Haymarket in which was on the ground floor

158
00:08:35.031 --> 00:08:36.590
level.
It was a plate glass window.

159
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.320
He was standing with delegates from the Democratic National Convention standing

160
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.620
what there was and the cops have charged,

161
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.860
they did like a double pincher formation like Hannibal and like um,

162
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.600
Qubein like fucking 100 BC and they split the protesters and half beat.

163
00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:52.430
Everybody hit Thompson over the head.

164
00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:56.060
He got his motorcycle helmet on just in time.
So he's not cussed.

165
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.370
He can see everything that's going on and the entire plate glass window behind

166
00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:02.790
him shatters.
Everybody falls in,
cops jump in,

167
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.450
are beating everybody and he's looking around and he's sure that snipers on the

168
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:08.520
roof are going to open fire at any moment.

169
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.690
So he runs to the Blackstone where he staying across the way shows as RoomKey

170
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.370
gets beat up by the cops is trying to get any.
He goes,
I live here,
goddammit,

171
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.640
I'm paying $100 a day,
let me get my fucking room.

172
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.380
And he barely gets it and he just sits on his bed afterwards and he says they

173
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:26.790
knew I was pressed.
They saw my press pass,
the hit me because I was pressed.

174
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.090
And if that's where we're at right now with journalists,
you know,

175
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.290
political opponents and journalists are being clubbed to keep silent and to not

176
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:37.830
respond then this is not the democracy.
We know.
Yeah.

177
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:42.831
His ex wife talked about that as being like one of the only moments where she

178
00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:47.550
saw him cry for two weeks,
toss,
cried afterwards for two weeks.
He couldn't stop.

179
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.110
It was crazy.
It was a,
it was a crazy time.
Right.

180
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.320
I mean that the time is very similar in a lot of ways to what's going on today.

181
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.950
It's just today there's just so much more information and so much more.

182
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.880
People have so much more of an ability to communicate.
Yeah.

183
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:07.890
And I think it's almost easier to coordinate violence.

184
00:10:07.891 --> 00:10:10.260
I was just talking to the head of the proud boys.
You know,

185
00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:15.090
Gavin McInnes is a group,
um,
um,
Enrique [inaudible] and he's like,

186
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.240
you know,
he's an advocate.
He's saying he's using the language of the left.

187
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:21.450
He's like,
I'm a victim.
I can't buy groceries.
They'd taken my big accounts,

188
00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:25.710
my platforms.
But when he talks about violence,
he's like,
who the fuck are you?

189
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:29.490
Antifa like I'm,
you know,
you're 120 pounds in wet.
Like if we have civil war,

190
00:10:29.491 --> 00:10:30.061
you're going to lose.

191
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:33.510
And I was sitting next to him for the podcast and basically what I said was,

192
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:34.591
if we have a civil war,

193
00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:36.510
you're going to be hit by sniper fire from the fucking roof.

194
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.450
You're not going to be at a fist fight when antifa across the way.

195
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.320
And I think there's this idea on the right that we can push towards violence and

196
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:47.610
we can get very close to it with our rhetoric or with our,
um,
actions,

197
00:10:47.611 --> 00:10:50.790
but that it won't spread.
Like the conflagration won't keep going.
Yeah.

198
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:52.630
I don't know if that's how I slid it to the right.
I mean,

199
00:10:52.631 --> 00:10:53.820
not with Antifa on the left too.

200
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:56.700
And that's why I love Thompson was as hard on the left as he was on the right

201
00:10:56.701 --> 00:10:59.340
when he wrote.
And it was so important for his intelligence as a writer.

202
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.640
But I think just even the left and the right in general for a lot of these

203
00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:05.430
people is just an identity and a gang that they belong to.

204
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.010
And I don't think they really understand violence.
You know,

205
00:11:08.011 --> 00:11:11.280
you want to talk about violence,
talk to a military guy,
you know,

206
00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:15.450
talk to someone who really understands what violence actually is and they don't

207
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:19.310
have this empty rhetoric like these fools do.
Exactly.

208
00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:21.800
So a lot of these people that are calling for violence,
like,
no,

209
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.990
you should be calling for camaraderie and you should be calling for

210
00:11:24.991 --> 00:11:27.120
communication.
We should be calling for some way.

211
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:30.580
We could all work this out where the civilians,
the s,

212
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:33.540
the civilization that we live in,
that we all,

213
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:38.570
we all can get along together and most people don't want to impede you from

214
00:11:38.821 --> 00:11:42.120
living your life and doing what you want to do.
Most people,

215
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.510
the vast majority a hundred drums of believed in working within the system.

216
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.400
He knew,
he believed like it might be a fucked up system,

217
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:49.860
but you can still run for sheriff and Aspen and he believe once you resort to

218
00:11:49.861 --> 00:11:53.470
violence,
that means the conversation has stopped and it disfigures you.

219
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.670
So he cried for two weeks.

220
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.220
That was the most surprising thing for me researching this book and writing it

221
00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.680
was to see how much the violence affected him that he experienced at Chicago.

222
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.780
You can speak to someone who's done and then may fighting has been punched in

223
00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:06.460
the face as hard as somebody can punch you.

224
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.060
Most Americans haven't had that and that changes your ability to articulate

225
00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:13.240
something back in that moment.
It means if that's political,

226
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.930
if it's a police officer or a political opponent that uses violence instead of

227
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.570
an argument to respond to you,
we've,

228
00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:22.540
we've left the realm that we recognize and we're not going to be able to

229
00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:25.560
communicate even in the limited way that we're communicating right now at

230
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.820
Thompson knew that.
So that's why after Chicago,

231
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.190
I love that he went back to aspen and he's like,

232
00:12:30.191 --> 00:12:32.020
I'm going to run the fucking sheriff and you want to run.

233
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.670
I'm going to do a mayoral campaign and Aspen.

234
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.400
And that was brilliant because it was his way to control his environment,

235
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.580
knowing that Mayor Daley's not listening to his nonviolent protest.

236
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.460
Richard Nixon is not listening to his nonviolent protest.

237
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:46.210
Thompson needed to find another avenue to try to work within the American system

238
00:12:46.211 --> 00:12:47.140
to make things happen.

239
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.430
And the great contrast is his good friend Oscar Zeta Acosta.

240
00:12:51.431 --> 00:12:54.670
There's a wonderful PBS documentary at rise and fall,
the Brown Buffalo by,

241
00:12:54.671 --> 00:12:57.010
I'm Phillip.
Puerto is a great director and it's a cost his life.

242
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:01.220
That's who Dr Gonzo is based on shore in the,
you know,

243
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.300
Thompson had more advantages than Acosta and Acosta was being pursued by the

244
00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:07.630
LAPD was eventually set up by them and for him working within the system,

245
00:13:07.631 --> 00:13:09.580
he ran for sheriff,
it wasn't an option.

246
00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:14.020
The Cobb set him up for a high speed bust,
you know,
like the cops had,

247
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.440
the cubs had undercover agents from something called the special operations for

248
00:13:17.441 --> 00:13:20.590
conspiracy,
which is a fucking department and the LAPD at the time.

249
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:25.270
And they were trying to use those provocateurs to incite violence against the

250
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.410
plainclothes please.

251
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.310
So that or the normal cost police so that lethal violence could be used to

252
00:13:30.311 --> 00:13:33.100
silence us civil rights movement in the Brown bread.

253
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.030
So they used agent provocateurs to make it look like they're a part of the

254
00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:39.850
protest.
Yeah,
there was an age old tactic,
right.

255
00:13:39.851 --> 00:13:41.080
That's how you destroy a civil rights movement.

256
00:13:41.081 --> 00:13:44.920
Because the most effective weapon in silencing civil rights is lethal force.

257
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:47.590
And you can do that in another country as the US has done.

258
00:13:47.591 --> 00:13:49.930
But you must can't use tactics like Mo,
my lie,

259
00:13:49.931 --> 00:13:54.310
like Thompson writes about this in the US,
unless you have a provocative reason,

260
00:13:54.311 --> 00:13:56.950
unless somebody that's undercover attacks a cop.

261
00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.340
And so the cops then like what happened on August 29th,

262
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.121
1978 during the moratorium,

263
00:14:01.121 --> 00:14:04.940
riots can just flood east la whoever they want and it can,
the blue ribbons,

264
00:14:04.941 --> 00:14:06.640
haulers art's head off with a tear gas gun.
