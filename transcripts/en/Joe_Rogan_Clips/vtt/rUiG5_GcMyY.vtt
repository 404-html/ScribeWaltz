00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.230
This is one of the things that I think Western civilization has contributed so

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.610
brilliantly to,

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.410
to the expansion of knowledge and the world is,
well,
what's the,

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.620
what's the cure for the inadequacies of the group?

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.680
While you might say it's the perfect state.

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.850
So one of the ways I'm going to do a series of lectures on the Bible starting

8
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:28.620
May 16th and for reasons that I outlined to some degree when I was talking about

9
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:32.010
genesis a little bit earlier,
but in the old testament for example,

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.100
the Israelites are always trying to make their peace with God.

11
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:39.030
So they're trying to live in the world without getting wall up to constantly buy

12
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.570
natural events.
And by you know,

13
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.860
invading forces in which they attribute to God's will.
Yes,
yes.

14
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.750
Whatever's beyond their understanding,

15
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:49.010
in some sense they're more sophisticated than merely this,
but the,

16
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.790
whatever's beyond their understanding.

17
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.840
But they're kind of conceptualizing being as such and trying to figure out how

18
00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:58.710
to deal with it.
And one of the hypothesis they come up with is something like,

19
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.250
well,
you can bargain with it.
And the thing is you can,

20
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.000
that's one of the things that's so cool and partly the reason you can bargain

21
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:11.001
with reality is because the reality that you encounter as you move forward in

22
00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:15.930
time is partly the world,
but partly the abstract social system.

23
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.940
And so you can bargain with the future abstract social system all the time.

24
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:22.680
You do that every time you make a promise,

25
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.670
you do it every time you sacrifice one thing for another,
you know,
so you,

26
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.650
you forego a impulsive temptation and that gives you a moral claim that you can

27
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:35.590
redeem in the future.
That happens,
all that.
That's what money is for God's sake.

28
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.630
And you know,
we discovered the future at some point,
as I said,

29
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:42.060
we were chimpanzees at one point we discovered the future,

30
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:45.870
then we discovered that you could bargain with the future as if it was a person.

31
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.060
That's amazing.
It's amazing.

32
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:51.120
And that's partly where the idea of God as a personality came from.

33
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.530
I should flip that.

34
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.190
That idea that you could bargain with the future came out of the idea that God

35
00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:02.250
was a personality because the God as a personality idea came first.
But it was,

36
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:03.084
uh,
it was,
uh,

37
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.240
it was a developmental stage on the way to even being able to say the future.

38
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.861
You know,
we,

39
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:14.490
we have no idea how they said like a 6 million year path from chimpanzee to,

40
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.120
to self aware human being,
you know,
and we don't,

41
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:21.810
we have no idea where these unbelievably sophisticated ideas that we have come

42
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:23.460
from.
Like the idea of sacrifice.

43
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.640
Do you know how much blood was spilled before human beings were able to

44
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.810
sacrifice abstractly instead of killing something?

45
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.190
We had to act out.

46
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.260
God enjoys you killing something because he's happy with the blood.

47
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.950
We had to act that out for God.
Who knows?
20,000 years,

48
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.000
a hundred thousand years before we got anywhere near the idea that you could do

49
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:49.620
that abstractly.
So when I look at these old stories,

50
00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:52.650
I look at them like an evolutionary biologist.
Now.

51
00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:56.430
I'm not trying to reduce them in any way because what we don't understand about

52
00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:58.920
evolution that could make a very thick book,

53
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.560
and there's other strange things about religious phenomenology that we don't

54
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:04.300
have a clue about.
You know,

55
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:07.570
like the fact that the drugs often called entheogens,

56
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.690
psychedelics can reliably produce mystical experiences.

57
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.160
No one has any idea what to make of that.
You can just discount it.
It's like,

58
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:17.500
yeah,
well you know they're drugs.
Yeah,
sure.

59
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.820
People been using the things for who knows,
50,000 years,

60
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.800
150,000 years.
They might be the source of all our religious ideas.
I don't,

61
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.150
I'm not saying that they are,

62
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.300
but they could well be and so why do we have a capacity for mystical experience?

63
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.660
Who knows it?
It's it.
It's associated with the sense of awe.

64
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:40.570
It's associated with the same feeling that you get when you listen to

65
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:45.571
particularly dramatic music or when a or when something moves you deeply and you

66
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:48.850
know the hair on the back of your neck stands up.
You know what that is?

67
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.260
That's pilot erection.

68
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.590
That's the same thing that happens to a cat when it looks at a particularly big

69
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:58.180
dog.
It's all you feel that when there's a swell of music,

70
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.700
aw,
you're the hair stands up on the back of your neck.

71
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.330
It's like you pop up just like a cat except like a bald cat.

72
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.280
So what do you make of this idea that,
well not the idea,

73
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:13.760
but they're the reality that these entheogens closely mimic human
neurochemistry.

74
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.550
No.
What they do,
there's absolutely no doubt about that body.

75
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.260
What do you think the reason for that is?
Well,
part of the reason is,

76
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:24.040
is that we share an evolutionary pathway with all these things that we eat,

77
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.690
you know,
plants and fungi and you know,
look,
we're,

78
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:33.350
we're linked evolutionarily to every form of life on the planet,
you know,
and,

79
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.440
and like Serotonin in lobsters and it has the same effect on lobsters as it does

80
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:42.370
on human beings.
So if you up their serotonin levels artificially,

81
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:44.570
the lobster gets,
stands up more erect and,

82
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.110
and stronger and as much more willing to fight.

83
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:50.440
And if you decrease the serotonin in the lobsters nervous system,

84
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:54.580
then it gets all depressed and runs away and hides.
Think,
think about that.

85
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.180
I mean,
we,

86
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.290
we split off from lobsters about 350 million years ago and they still live in

87
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:02.470
dominance hierarchies.
That's how old the dominance hierarchy is.

88
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.720
There's plant that's older than trees.
It's older than flowers.
It's permanent,

89
00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:12.550
right?
We've evolved for the hierarchy and the spirit of the hierarchy.
That's,

90
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.220
that's the Old Testament God,
that's at least part of it,

91
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.820
the spirit of the hierarchy.
So these things are,

92
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.480
while they're mind boggling to me,
which is partly why I'm investigating them,

93
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.290
but all of our wiring is conditional on that.
So,
and I mean,

94
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:28.750
women use the dominance hierarchy to select mates.

95
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.510
So it's so strange because you know,

96
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:35.250
people think of evolution from a natural selection perspective almost always,

97
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.860
but sexual selection plays a huge role.
So here are all a layout,

98
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:40.180
something wild for you.
Okay.

99
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.600
So we know that you have twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors.

100
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.530
Now people have a hard time with that.
But you could imagine that,
um,

101
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.211
roughly speaking,

102
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:56.530
that would happen if every single woman had one baby and only every second man

103
00:05:56.531 --> 00:06:00.590
fathered a child.
So for man,
it would be you either have two kids,
they're zero.

104
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.580
Well,
that's basically what it is on average across time.
If you're a man,

105
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:09.110
you have two children,
maybe with two different women or zero.
If you're a woman,

106
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.330
everyone has one.
That's how it averages out.

107
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.740
So there's more disparity of success among men.

108
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:17.840
And that's very common in the animal kingdom by the way.

109
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.400
Now the question is how do women select their mate?
Now,

110
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.030
unlike female chimps,
female humans are choosy maters.

111
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.720
Female chimps will mate with any chimp.
They go into heat,

112
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:30.650
they'll mate with any chimp.

113
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.930
The dominant males are more likely to meet with them.

114
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:34.790
But that's because they chase away the subordinate.

115
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.020
It's not because the females exercise choice,
human females exercise choice.

116
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.140
And that's one of the things that differentiated us from chimpanzees.

117
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.330
But how do they do it?
Well,

118
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:48.920
they look at the male dominance hierarchy and that's where the men are
competing.

119
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.200
Now you could say they're competing for power,

120
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.920
but that's pretty corrupt way of looking at it.
Like they're competing for,

121
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:58.310
let's say,
influence.
They're competing for leadership.

122
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.090
And so in some sense the people at the top of the hierarchy,

123
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:04.310
if they're men are elected by the other band.

124
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.400
Now I know there was brutes and there's predators and all of that,

125
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:09.980
but I'm talking on average across time.

126
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.960
It's like the men organize themselves and there are influential men that rise to

127
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:18.530
the top and the women take them.
Now he think about that.

128
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.180
What that means is that over the millions of years that a dominance hierarchy

129
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.780
with those properties existed.
So let's say since we split from chimps,

130
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:28.430
let's say that 6 million years,

131
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.540
that means that the male dominance hierarchy is the environment that pushes the

132
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.320
mating mail to the top.

133
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.090
So that means the mail that's most likely to take precedence in the dorm and the

134
00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:44.990
male dominance hierarchy is the one most likely to leave a genetic contribution.

135
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.280
So that means that the male dominance hierarchies,

136
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.210
a selection mechanism mediated by the female.

137
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.310
So what that means is that as we've moved forward through 6 million years of

138
00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:58.580
time,
men have become more and more well adapted,

139
00:07:58.581 --> 00:08:01.670
not only to the presence of the male dominance hierarchy,
but two,

140
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:05.270
the ability to move up it.
And that's the central spirit.

141
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.420
You could say in some sense,
that's the central spirit of the individual.

142
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.780
The individual is the thing that can move up.
Dominance,
hierarchies.

143
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.610
It's the thing that's at the top.

144
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.020
It's the eye at the top of the pyramid and it's been selected for.

145
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.120
And then what's happened is that we've watched.

146
00:08:20.121 --> 00:08:24.590
So we get better and better and better for biological reasons,

147
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.860
culturally mediated at figuring out how to climb across a set of dominance

148
00:08:29.991 --> 00:08:32.030
hierarchy so we can leave a genetic contribution.

149
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:33.470
That's what's happened to human beings.

150
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.560
Now imagine that that's happened for 6 million years.

151
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.060
So now imagine that we started to watch that because we're curious creatures.

152
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:45.380
We're always trying to figure out who we are.
And then as we watched that,

153
00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:48.980
we started to tell stories about what the people who could climb the hierarchies

154
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:52.670
were like those were heroes.
That's where Harold mythology came from.

155
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.680
And the biggest hero is the person will go out and kill the snake.

156
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.460
Well unsurprisingly,
because that was a big hero man,

157
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.760
and maybe when we are living in trees that was a hero.

158
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:08.400
So the big hero is the person who goes out,
slays the dragon,
gets the gold,

159
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.440
brings it back to the community and distributes it.

160
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.470
He's also the person most likely to go up the dominant Turkey.

161
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.560
He's the person most likely to find the virgin,
right?

162
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:20.070
Cause it's a virgin that you free from the Dragon,
then you get to claim her.

163
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.743
Right?

164
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.460
And so the dominance hierarchy is a mechanism that selects heroes and then

165
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:30.630
breeds them.
And so then we watched that for 6 million years.

166
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.870
We start to understand what it means to be the hero.

167
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.490
We start to tell stories about that.

168
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:40.491
And so then not only are we genetically aiming at that with the dominant Turk is

169
00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:43.350
a selection mechanism mediated by female choice.

170
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.190
But our stories are trying to push us in that direction.
And so then we say,

171
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:49.050
well look,
that person's admirable.

172
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.160
Tell a story about him and we say this person is admirable.

173
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.810
Tell a story about him and this person is admirable.

174
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.840
And at the same time we talk about the people who aren't admirable.

175
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.100
And then we start having admirable and non admirable as categories.

176
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.180
And out of that you get something like good and evil and then you can start to

177
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:09.630
imagine the perfect person that would be not only,

178
00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:13.790
so it would be you take 10 admirable people and you pull out someone who's metta

179
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.330
admirable.
And that's a hero that becomes a religious figure across time.

180
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:19.620
That becomes a savior,

181
00:10:19.621 --> 00:10:23.820
a messiah across time as we conceptualize what the ideal person is

182
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.800
and we didn't in the West,
here's how we figured it out.
We said the ideal person,

183
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:30.780
the ideal man is the person who tells the truth.

184
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.220
And what that means is that's the best way of climbing up any possible dominance

185
00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:39.240
hierarchy in a way that's most stable and most lasting.
That's,

186
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.870
that's the conclusion of western culture.
So in a sense,
psychologically,

187
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:46.440
when you're talking about postmodernists and their rejection of these classic

188
00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:47.790
male structures are,

189
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:51.270
what they doing is realizing that they're not going to compete in the,

190
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.330
the classic as stated male hierarchy.

191
00:10:54.331 --> 00:10:58.590
So they're creating their own version of it.
Sure.
That's the creative element.

192
00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:00.810
Sure.
While we,
we,
we asked earlier,

193
00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:03.690
what's the motivation of these pathological guys who are out there,

194
00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:07.980
like bolstering up the feminists.
Yeah.
Well,
you know,

195
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.440
they don't compete any other way.
They don't compete.

196
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.650
They figured out how to compete.
They compete as allies,
let's say.

197
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.400
Very sneaky.
Wow.
Yeah.
Wow.
Niki.
Yeah.
