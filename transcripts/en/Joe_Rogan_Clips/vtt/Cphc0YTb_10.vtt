1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.950
Yeah.
And I don't want to not be who I am because if I,
I wouldn't want to do the,

2
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.270
this success,

3
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:10.050
would it mean anything to me if I got there by not being me.

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.280
You gotta live with that and that's worse than not succeeding to me.
You know?

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.190
I don't know about other people.
A lot of people just fake it.
Right.

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.790
And they're not who they are and they're okay with that.

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.600
If it comes with success,
in order for me to shift to,

8
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:28.200
I am inherently my fiber of my being,

9
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:33.150
the way I was raised to treat people.
If I had to shift that and have success,

10
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.460
the success wouldn't be success to me.
It won't be on paper,
but not business.

11
00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:41.160
It's just so strange.
Right.

12
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.370
And I don't know how you feel about mumble rap,

13
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.140
but mumble rap is one of the weirdest things to me.
I'm confused.
It's bizarre.

14
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.740
It's bizarre what is happening.
I just,
I feel like,

15
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.540
I feel like I don't want to be that dude who doesn't get it.
Right.

16
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.690
Right.
You know what I mean?
You don't get it.
I don't,
I don't get it either.

17
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.470
I don't.

18
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.470
But when you start dealing with youth culture and when I was the age of these

19
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:09.480
mumble rap kids,
there were older heads saying,
yeah,

20
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.050
you know the generation before us,
the,

21
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.630
the cold crush brothers to the big daddy Kane.

22
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:18.990
So they probably thought what we were doing was crazy.
Is that what's happening?

23
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.790
I don't know.
Maybe everyone's like,
what the fuck is that?
It's like I,
Eh,

24
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.220
it's to the point with me where I'm like,
Yo,
is that even a genre of rap?
Right?

25
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.820
Like I almost look at it,
I guess I don't,

26
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.790
I guess I don't have a problem with it because I don't process it.

27
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.780
Is anything close to what I do.
Right.
It's almost like if you said,
Yo,

28
00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:39.660
what do you think about Edm?
I'd be like,
oh,
I don't know.
I guess it's all right.

29
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.130
It's right.
Right.
I don't even look at it like I,

30
00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:45.450
I can't listen to that and then let him hear a big daddy Kane and think it's the

31
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:48.000
same thing when we were kids listening to music.
Right.

32
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:51.720
If were you were listening to something that you enjoyed,

33
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.410
one of the things you loved was like good lyrics of course.

34
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.980
And when you can't understand what they're saying.
Yeah.
It's also,

35
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.040
it's just so driven by,
if it's like phrase driven,

36
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.610
they just say whatever the line over and over and over again.
Yeah.

37
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:08.490
I don't know if like it's just because these kids are doing Molly or whatever

38
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.000
and they're just in a zone.
Is it drug culture?
Cause that's happened before too.

39
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:15.630
So you know,
one thing creates the other,
it's like chicken or the egg.

40
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:18.740
Are these kids doing Molly and make mumble rap or they don't mumble rapping,

41
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.190
eat and Molly and it's all,
it's,
you know,
the sixties you know,

42
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.670
going back to the fifties and beatniks and not scene and jazz and heroin and w w

43
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.090
what created it,
you know what I mean?

44
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:34.020
Did Miles and Coltrane make some of those records because they were on heroin or

45
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.970
vice versa and it's happened historically.
Is this just the drug driven culture?

46
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:43.570
I don't know,
cause I,
it's,
I'm detached.
You know,
I'm detaching that and I,

47
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.990
and you know,
I'm a,
I'm a kid who grew up listening to metal and stuff like that.

48
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:52.830
So I don't,
I'm not at a shortage for listen to slayer.

49
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.310
I'll just listen to slayer before I listened to that.
If that's my only option,

50
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.130
then I'll listen to slayer.
You know what I mean?
I listen to black flag,

51
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.910
I listen to minor threat.
That's what I'll do.
You know it.

52
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.950
So there,
whether I,

53
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.480
however I feel about it becomes irrelevant when you realize that you have so

54
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:16.900
much good shit out there.
So I don't need,
it's like with film,

55
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:19.800
like I'm not worried about a bad movie.
I'll just watch the dope movie.

56
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.000
There's so many movies throwing them away.
Right.
And it's when you like,
Yo,

57
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:27.070
I'll just listen to thin Lizzy,
right.
If I,

58
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:30.780
if I don't feel like adjusting to that,
you know what I mean?
And,

59
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.210
and there's other things that we might not get because we're not doing what we

60
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:36.130
used to do.
Maybe if we were out of the Bar,

61
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.030
the club five nights a week and you weren't married with kids and we were

62
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:43.840
hammered.
Maybe it sounds different,
Eh,
you know it's time and place shit.

63
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.350
It's like you hear certain songs and you're like,
I'm not listening to my car.

64
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:49.390
I'm rolling the windows up.
If someone sees this,

65
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.810
but maybe it affects them differently in a live environment.
It's something,

66
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.630
I dunno,
I'm playing devil's advocate.
I just,
just to,

67
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.950
it's just a strange trend where it's a lot of mumbling.
I'm like,
what is,

68
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.350
I don't know what they're on about cough syrup.
Yeah.

69
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:06.250
I think this is the lean and Molly.
I just,
and I think that that,

70
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.700
that drug culture created that I think a friend of mine who's a real estate

71
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:13.390
agent,
some mumble rapper was working on the house and she's like,

72
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:16.450
I literally had no idea what the fuck he was saying.

73
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.470
He's talking to him and him talking as a human when he mama,
who is any man,

74
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.480
why you just see,
I didn't know that.

75
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.080
I thought it was like that style on when they run,
but maybe it's just this one,

76
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.460
which she was showing him this dope house and he's mumbling up a storm.
Wow.

77
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.570
So he's like asking her for the Jacuzzi and she thinks she's ordering a pizza.

78
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.490
I don't know.
I mean I,
you know,

79
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:44.491
I love listening to Nas and I love listening to public enemy clean lyrics and

80
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.030
had had a hit to them.
Do Their Karras one.
Yeah.
Big Daddy Kane.

81
00:04:51.031 --> 00:04:55.960
Yeah,
of course.
That's,
that's,
that's a sign of the police.
Yeah.
There was,

82
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.680
there was something to it though that you knew that they were trying to get a

83
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:04.360
message across along with the music and it was something cool about it.
Yeah.

84
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.063
I think,

85
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.180
I think maybe these kids think you can't do both and our era was different.

86
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:13.420
It's like people could dance to public enemy and they were talking about what

87
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:18.421
was going on in an urban community that that era you could,

88
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.910
there were,
there were boogie down production,
krs records,

89
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.090
you could dance the sound of the police.
You danced the Outta here.

90
00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:27.180
You could dance to it.
I think there was a,

91
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.520
there's a disconnect with these kids that they don't think you can say something

92
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:34.090
and I have people dance or whatever.

93
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:35.840
I don't know what these fucking Momma motherfucker.

94
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.830
Then they might just slobber in the corner.
It's just,
well,

95
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:42.520
they all have to have tattoos on their face.
Yeah.
That's another hard programs.

96
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:46.480
Like another mockery.
The tattoo settled down,
man,
you know,

97
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:51.190
they don't come off right.
It's like,
I think these kids think they can come off.

98
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.010
I don't think they care.
I just don't think they care.

99
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:57.980
I don't think that thinking,
I mean,
it's all this,
I don't give a fuck culture.

100
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.690
Yeah.
It's like you just,
and,
and like,

101
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:02.450
they're not trying to get cool shit on their face that trying to get like

102
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:05.940
scribbles.
Yeah.
No,
it looks like,
you know,
the,

103
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.630
you draw on the face of the drunk hated the party.

104
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:13.430
That's where they all look like.
They all look like that with pink dreads.

105
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.940
There's a lot of rap music that slipped through the cracks too.

106
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:19.380
Like a lot of people forget about gangstarr.
Yeah.

107
00:06:19.381 --> 00:06:21.510
And one of the greatest groups ever.
Yeah.
