WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.330
Whoa,
before we go,

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.890
before we go Chicago,
UFC.
Ooh,
it's going to be a good one.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.210
Colby Covington don't snappy.
And I said you gonna slap me down.

4
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:13.830
Slap talking shit.

5
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.550
Well I see you gonna slap you cause I was telling them that Jon Jones might slap

6
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:22.020
him.
Oh
I like Colby.
I like what he's doing.

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.380
He's talking to a lot of shit.
I'm just saying be careful who you talk shit to.

8
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.280
Talking Shit to Jon Jones,
one of the baddest motherfuckers has ever lived.

9
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.270
You know he's making a lot of money.
He's being smart.
Oh,

10
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:35.550
cold reason why Colby is fighting for the title.

11
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.760
The reason why Kolbe is going to fight Hoffeld dos Anjos for the intern interim

12
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:42.690
title is not just because he's beaten good guys cause he has,

13
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:45.780
he beat Damien Maia.
But it's more importantly that he's got,

14
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:47.250
he's going to put asses in the seats.

15
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.370
Well that's part of the fight business part of the fight business.

16
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:51.930
Now you've got to sell.
I mean yeah,

17
00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:56.370
especially in our pre and post Conor McGregor,
right.
And Post Conor Mcgregor,

18
00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:59.550
the fucking game has changed.
It's red panties night,
baby.

19
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.850
Everything is different.
It is.
And it's just like,

20
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.890
I see people hate on it on Colby for,
you know,
did he deserve the shot at all?

21
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:12.360
I know is he wins one fight.
He's holding the belt.
Yeah.

22
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.770
I mean if you look at one more beaten,
pull up his record.

23
00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:20.190
Let me see his record.
If you look at who he's beaten in comparison to somebody,

24
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.340
like there's some people that have been calling him out that can't get a fight

25
00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:28.200
with him tomorrow.
[inaudible] wants to fight him and that guy is a beast.
Yeah.

26
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.350
And then there's some other guys that are really talented but haven't beaten

27
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.170
like any high level guys yet.
Uh,
okay.

28
00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:41.160
So we lost a Warley Alvarez and then look at the guys he's beaten.

29
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.150
Brian Barbarina is a good guy.
Don Young Kim is a,
as a tough guy,

30
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.930
stung on cam and Damien Maia.
That is not really,
I mean,

31
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.920
I'm just going to be honest.

32
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.250
This is not a resume of someone who you would normally see fighting for the

33
00:01:56.641 --> 00:02:01.380
title.
Right now.
I think he's fighting for the title based,
not just on his beat.

34
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.140
Beating Damien Maia,
who's a really tough guy,

35
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.750
but I think on the fact that he's a controversial,

36
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:14.751
very popular character because he talks so much shit and because he's talked so

37
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:20.130
much shit about Brazilians and he's fine aided Maya Brazil.

38
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.450
I mean it was,
it was a domination.
He dominated them and it's a w what?

39
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:25.410
I was a big victory,

40
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:29.850
but that was his only big victory over a titled a former title Challenger.
Yeah.

41
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.230
Who's like a top level guy who is also 40 years old.
Right.
I mean,
Damien Maia is,

42
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:38.880
his best days are behind him.
Just as I say this as a huge Damien Maia Fan.

43
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.350
Yeah.
Well I,
you know,

44
00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:45.330
I look at it is you can't take too much away from Colby because I think of a lot

45
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.450
of great fighters say so.
If you say Nate Diaz,

46
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.600
who's been an icon for years,
one of my favorite of all time,

47
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.270
he's never fought for title.
MM,
right.
Yeah.
No,

48
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.940
sure.
If Colby got there,
however he got there,
he wins one more fight.

49
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.140
He's holding that belt.

50
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.250
I think about fighters who've come up and maybe if they've been,
you know,

51
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:08.800
quiet or maybe they haven't sold their fights,

52
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:10.810
maybe like as as well as Colby has.

53
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.100
And so it had been grinding it out,
beating good guys.

54
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.080
Maybe because they've taken that slow road.

55
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.340
Maybe somebody gets lucky and one of these fights and,

56
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.720
and catches him on the Chin and then there are two rungs back and then they got

57
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.870
to grind all the way back up.
That's a lot of damaged.
They're taking,

58
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.010
we're Colby didn't have to,

59
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.020
I mean he played the game the right way for today and it's paying off was one

60
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:36.340
loss.
Yeah.
I mean I think he's 11 and one now,
but you know,

61
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.630
but other people would say,

62
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:40.990
well look at guys like Anderson Silva didn't talk any shit.

63
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:43.190
Just fucked people up.
Yeah.
You know,
and,

64
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.320
and became one of the greatest of all time because of that.
Yeah,
it's true.

65
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.360
You know,
you could,
you could look at it like,

66
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:53.260
do you want to get that shot at the title or do you want to be the greatest

67
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.050
that's ever done it?
Like how,
what is the difference?

68
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.430
I would rather get the title and then show him the greatest.
Right,
right.

69
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.780
They're not mutually exclusive.
No.
Right now.
Yeah.
So I mean,
if he wins,

70
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.280
then he'll probably get it a fight with Woodley.
Right.

71
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.150
He will definitely get a fight with Woodley if he wins 100% right.
So,
so what if,

72
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.600
what if that happens and what if.
