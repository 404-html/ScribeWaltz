WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.360
Gear for you?
One,
all of your world records drug free.

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.170
Yeah,
I remember seeing a jug free,
uh,

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.850
I a jug free for 37,

4
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:18.830
38 years.
But I did try,
I did try roids uh,

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.340
in 1980 or 81,
I believe it was.

6
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:26.280
Well before it became illegal.
I tried.
What'd you try?

7
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.030
I try and I went to a doctor and I dunno if I should say this fucker's name

8
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:34.230
cause he might still be busy,
still viable.
The same doctor that Arnold and uh,

9
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.970
uh,
all the guys who were in the magazines,
you know,

10
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.120
I thought everybody was drug free.
I didn't think,

11
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.860
I didn't think nobody talks.
It's a weird thing about those magazines,
right.

12
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.060
Nothing to cry.
Branched chain amino acids.
Yeah.
Oh fucking man.

13
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:54.140
I couldn't wait before I get,
some of them will meet her ass shit man.

14
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.370
So they got me for sure.
That's what he was thinking about.
Uh,
uh,

15
00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:03.130
I want a couple of little contest and a guy,
uh,

16
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.390
the guy who was promoting context,
it came to me and said,

17
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.860
what are you taking CT and a half,
28 arms,
you know,
then I didn't,

18
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.770
I thought everybody had thought every fucking buying it.

19
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:17.280
I seen those magazines are honored.
Everybody else was drug free.
He goes,

20
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.200
what are you taking?
And I told him to amino acids and shit.
And he goes,
Oh man,

21
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:25.650
what,
what kind of steroids are you taking?
I said,
what's that?
And he said,

22
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:28.130
you don't know what a stair radius.
And you didn't even know what,

23
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.740
I didn't even know what the fuck he was.

24
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.690
So he told me,
you know,
you gotta go to this doctor.
And uh,

25
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.800
and,
uh,
gave me the address and everything and he said,

26
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.030
I don't know if I'd say the doctor's name,
but I still remember.
And,
uh,

27
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.170
I went to the Dang thing guy looked at my nose and ears and shit and listen to

28
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:53.430
my lungs and gave me a prescription for,
uh,
uh,
decker.

29
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.630
Yeah,
it gave me a prescription for some decades rivaling.
And I take it right,

30
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:02.430
the Kaiser Pharmacy and a pharmacist.
Uh,
I said,

31
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:06.810
you know what this is.
And I said,
yes,
fucking steroids are thinking.

32
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.260
He said,
yeah,
it's bad.
You don't need this shit.
You know what?
Look,

33
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:13.500
I want to give you it.
I want to be a professional body building.

34
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:17.050
They told me if I want to be a professional and be like Arno and Franklin rest

35
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.720
guy,
I got to take this shit.
So I want to take it.
And he gave,
he gave it to me.

36
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:24.980
We grudgingly feel prescriptive.

37
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.330
I took it home and I take my decade,

38
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.540
and then I went back to doctor [inaudible] and he gave me no picture for a

39
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.100
testosterone.
So I took Deca and testosterone.
And did you notice a difference?

40
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.740
Fuck yes.
Fuck yes.
I know that the difference.

41
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.230
I know you got off of it.
Yeah,
I got off of it,
but I had a,
I had read,

42
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.110
I had reasons.
And you want to Jv with those words?
Sure.
Okay.

43
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.110
It worked.
It definitely worked.
Uh,
I got fucking hard.
It's,

44
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.900
you know,
just Titus fuck.
And,
uh,

45
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.270
but,
uh,
I'd also,
uh,

46
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.940
I don't know if it does,
it does this to everyone.

47
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.950
People when I told him I tell him about this sometimes and I Nice you,

48
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:14.560
you must've been an ass hole beforehand.
And that's quite,

49
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.280
quite possibly true because I was a pretty much an asshole because the way I was

50
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:23.800
raised,
you know,
I had a bad attitude going in.

51
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.100
So when I got home sees it and it seemed to amplify my bad attitude and my

52
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.080
editor a short fuse,
like this is a fighter.
UFC fighting him short fused.

53
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.670
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well I should have had that nickname way before.
Head hurt me man.

54
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:43.030
Cause I had fucking short fused big time and everything.

55
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.630
Everything pissed me off.
So I had a really bad attitude.

56
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:48.370
I was married at the time,
you know,

57
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.320
I had a real bad attitude and my wife and she couldn't do shit wrong,
you know,

58
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.610
I mean nothing minute and,
but okay,
that,
that was part of it.

59
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.840
And another big,

60
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.620
big fucking thing with me is what I love more than muscles and lifting weights

61
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:10.540
and fast cars and I love all that shit.

62
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.790
It's sex and a big giant,
big old giant.

63
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.100
While I rolled over to have sex and nothing was happening,
I said,

64
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:22.330
fuck these steroids.

65
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.750
But these days when you got off of them told me,

66
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.630
Oh,
you got to take this,
this other shit to make this

67
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.370
dead.
Anything,
anything.
Donors

68
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.690
fuck it.
Fuck it.
Oh No,
no.
Anything is going to do Amy,

69
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.520
I wrote to be a 110 pounds soaking wet and still be able to,

70
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.270
you know,
get my boner.
Uh,
fuck that.
You know.

71
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:54.640
So it must have affected your lifting too,

72
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:58.300
because what it comes is just a giant dip in your natural testosterone when she

73
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:01.630
get off of it.
Oh.
Oh,
it's bad,
Huh?

74
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.410
It was the,
because I,
you know,
I decided,
hey,
I'm out.
Fuck this shit.

75
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.220
Fuck this shit what you want for a total of six months.

76
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:16.750
But what they do is they told us back then you do two months on,
two months off.

77
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.110
So it took longer.
So I do two months on it.
Take two months off,

78
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:24.140
two months on tomorrow.
That was the protocol.
Yeah,
that's it.

79
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.340
That's what they told us.
That's what doctor,
whatever his name is,
uh,
talk,

80
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.780
talk dude.
So it was told six months but it took longer.
Nigga,

81
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.330
they had two months off in between two months old and um,
uh,

82
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.560
that stuff it fucking definitely,
definitely.
Uh,

83
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.890
but when you,
what they don't tell you is when you stop taking it shit,

84
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.160
we just stopped taking it cold Turkey like that.

85
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.200
Every fucking thing that you gained during that time.

86
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.890
And I came,
I was ready for,

87
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.620
I had one little small body,
Boone County,

88
00:05:59.621 --> 00:06:03.340
cause I thought I was ready for fucking Mister America after this shit.
You know,

89
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.400
I'm like,
Oh fuck,
I'm,

90
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.670
I just got so much tighter and it had a more veins and shit than ever.

91
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.900
And I'm like,
Oh man,
this is great shit.
But when you get off this shit,

92
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.010
everything that you came,
you lose it.
And then some,

93
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.100
I lost it.

94
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.690
Any strength gains that I might've might've gang got from it or any,
you know,

95
00:06:24.691 --> 00:06:25.521
the harness at me.

96
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:30.521
I had to start from lower than where I was before I started taking it.

97
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.950
Cause you to stop time.

98
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.020
<v 1>They say you do gain something and you keep something once your body normalizes,</v>

99
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.390
you know,
you do have some sort of gains.

100
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.350
That's one of the arguments that they say about people that have taken steroids

101
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.130
and gotten off of them.
That if you can normalize your testosterone,

102
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:51.260
you're still going to have an advantage over people that have never taken it

103
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:52.094
before.

104
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.120
<v 0>I don't know.
I'm genuine.
I don't know how true that is.
I felt like that,</v>

105
00:06:57.121 --> 00:07:02.090
uh,
uh,
every single thing game then I promise,
man.
I think I,

106
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.590
I mean I felt like I lost ground actually.
Uh,

107
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.950
cause I just stopped cold Turkey and I think I actually lost Brown.

108
00:07:10.951 --> 00:07:14.570
It's still supposed to wean yourself off and stuff.
But you know,

109
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.970
but I'm telling you when I roll over,
you know,

110
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
I'm fucking 21 years old and I thought that sex every day was the normal.

111
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.910
Right.
I mean,
you,
you,
you just,
that's what you getting married,

112
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.610
safe every day,
man.
That's one of the benefits.
And if I don't,

113
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:37.110
if I can't have sex every day,
then you know,
hey,
something's wrong.
Fuck this.

114
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.620
You know,
so I just,
that was my normal normal thing.

115
00:07:40.621 --> 00:07:44.310
And I'm probably pretty sure that my wife at the time probably didn't think
that,

116
00:07:44.311 --> 00:07:49.210
but I was like [inaudible] we this motherfucker and you know,
that was a,

117
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.110
she had a break when the steroid things,

118
00:07:52.111 --> 00:07:55.460
we got a little break for the first time ever,
you know,
who was married?
Like,

119
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.050
you know,
oh no,
no,
no,
no.
Anything that's going to fuck with that.
Fuck.

120
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.720
That's what gets people back on it.
A lot of,
yeah.

121
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:06.160
You couldn't get psychologically addicted,
of course.
I mean,
uh,

122
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.540
who,
I mean,
you,
you,
you,

123
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.540
Jack and I talked about it,
you know,
and I was,

124
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:17.990
I was interviewed and magazine articles and stuff a few times when I was world

125
00:08:18.271 --> 00:08:19.590
champion back Lena.

126
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:23.250
I brought it up in the art cause I never thought it was anything that high,

127
00:08:23.251 --> 00:08:25.860
you know,
or anything like that.
I said,
yeah,
you know,
I,

128
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.940
I wish that I had never done it.

129
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.130
I wish I could say,
now I'm going,
if I look back,
I wish I could say I have,

130
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.370
I have a perfectly clean record.
Like my,
my training partner,
Richard Sherman,

131
00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:41.130
where for 20 we've trained together for 20 years and this guy,

132
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:45.750
perfect record,
never even tried it.
Well,
he was stronger than me.
He was his,

133
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.580
his mind was stronger than my eye.

134
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:52.230
Peer pressure and wanting to be in the magazines and wanting to make a living,

135
00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:55.440
doing something that I love is did a punch punching the clock every day.

136
00:08:55.441 --> 00:09:00.390
Now that appeal was too great for me as a young guy for me to pass it up.

137
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:05.310
I wanted to do something that I love and make money at it way back then.

138
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:08.580
But I why not working at the Post Office for 28 years?

139
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.180
<v 1>Well,
it makes sense.
I mean,</v>

140
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.710
it definitely makes sense that the appeal would be so strong and it's a,

141
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.650
it's a very,
it works.

142
00:09:15.651 --> 00:09:18.860
I mean that's the big reason why people want to take it out of sports.

143
00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:21.980
And I don't know if he ever watched that documentary that's on Netflix called

144
00:09:21.981 --> 00:09:24.980
ICARUS.
Have you seen that?
No,
I haven't seen increments.

145
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.330
ICARES is all about the Russian,
uh,
anti-doping state sponsored program.

146
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.740
The Russian,
well I should say pro doping.
Oh,
Yay.

147
00:09:32.741 --> 00:09:35.720
You go literally gave steroids to every single one of their athletes.

148
00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.860
More things.
Yeah.
It's a crazy documentary man because the guy,
Bryan Fogel,

149
00:09:39.861 --> 00:09:41.450
who's the director is also,

150
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.570
he's in it because he was an amateur cyclist and what he wanted to do as an

151
00:09:44.571 --> 00:09:48.980
experiment.
So he ran it or he cycled this race one year,

152
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.680
totally clean.
And then the next year he went to this Russian doctrine,

153
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.690
said just fucking juice me up to the gills.
Like,
let's do this.

154
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.490
And they just shot him up with everything.

155
00:09:58.491 --> 00:10:01.760
And in the process of him getting to know this doctor,

156
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.330
the scandal broke out about the Sochi Olympics,

157
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.660
about the Russians cheated during the Sochi Olympics.

158
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:12.110
And it's all documented in this film as the news is breaking.

159
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.230
And then the guy who's the Russian doctor has to flee Russia.

160
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.820
He leaves his family behind.

161
00:10:16.821 --> 00:10:20.510
They take his family's house and they take all their money and they're basically

162
00:10:20.511 --> 00:10:23.330
making this family homeless to try to get him to come back to Russia.

163
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.910
He's in protective custody and America right now.

164
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.690
And he detailed the entire program.
Everyone was hot.
Everyone.

165
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.380
Everyone was on something.
They want 13.
What's hilarious?

166
00:10:33.381 --> 00:10:36.740
They just took some of the metals away and the metals they took with the most

167
00:10:36.741 --> 00:10:41.060
bullshit metals like gymnastics.

168
00:10:41.061 --> 00:10:45.950
You can have this one.
Like they took like four bullshit battles away,

169
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.710
but they kept the big reveal.
Yeah.
They kept wrestling.
They kept

170
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.690
<v 0>date once
it's bullshit and deed.</v>

171
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.750
I did see big,
strong fast.
Yeah.
Um,
uh,

172
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:03.060
<v 1>that's pretty sick take.
Yeah.
Right.
Because they're pro steroids.
Right,
right.</v>

173
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.780
Yeah.
That is interesting.
Yeah.
A pro steroids and a lot of people.

174
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.120
Yeah.
Well the,
the argument is,
I mean,
uh,
see,

175
00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:14.640
I see it in the terms of fair competition.

176
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.690
I see the argument against it for fair competition.
That makes sense.
But like,

177
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.450
I also see the argument in terms of like,

178
00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:26.010
if you're going to be taken amino acids and creatine and all these different

179
00:11:26.011 --> 00:11:28.980
things that do give you some sort of a benefit,

180
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.290
why don't I take the shit that gives you the real benefit?

181
00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:36.190
<v 0>Well,
I,
you know,
uh,
I,
uh,
I,</v>

182
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:41.230
I don't find a fault with people who would be side to take Roy's because like I

183
00:11:43.271 --> 00:11:47.420
said,
I'm 21 year old kid and,
uh,

184
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:48.873
I took,

185
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:53.910
so how the fuck can I talk shit about anybody who's who to make the same

186
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:58.010
decision?
And then I did that many years ago.
You know,
I,
I,

187
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.900
I'd be a hypocrite ass hole if I was,
you know,

188
00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:06.901
to do that as long as everybody in the competition that you're in,

189
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:11.650
whatever that competition might be,
if you fucking flipping ties or whatever,

190
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.130
whatever the fuck it is,
a tech and grab whatever fuck it is.

191
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.590
If everybody else in there is doing it,
then,

192
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.930
then it's a level playing field that,

193
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:24.220
but when you got guys that are trying to compete naturally,

194
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:29.200
right against guys that are not,
then it becomes unfair.
So,
uh,
if they,
uh,

195
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.460
if they have a division and they do it in a lot in these weightlifting contests

196
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:33.911
and things,

197
00:12:33.911 --> 00:12:37.900
now they have divisions that are called natural divisions and they actually test

198
00:12:37.901 --> 00:12:39.520
for steroids and stuff like that.

199
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.540
And maybe I should do something like that for the fighters.
You ain't going,

200
00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:45.420
we ain't going to text you guys if you want fuckers.

201
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.040
He'd just come on in here and whatever you bring went Bree,
Bree,

202
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:52.860
when she got kind of doing that in Japan.
Yeah.

203
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.340
Japan has an organization called Reisen where it's essentially an offshoot of

204
00:12:57.341 --> 00:12:59.650
pride,
or at least some of the people are involved.

205
00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.860
They were involved in pride and pride.
Like I had an ensign.
Anyway,

206
00:13:02.861 --> 00:13:05.020
on the podcast,
he was talking about his pride contract.

207
00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:10.021
He said it specifically stated we will not test you for steroids caps and shit.

208
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:15.120
Damn fucking animals.
