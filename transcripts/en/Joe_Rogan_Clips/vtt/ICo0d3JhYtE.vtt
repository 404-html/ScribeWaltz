WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.880
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.550
What's funny is it grown man crying when he shouldn't be crying?
Yeah,

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.880
that's what's funny.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Yeah.
And it's,
you know,

4
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.510
it's like there's still an instinct.

5
00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:13.020
You still have like a kind of a knee jerk instinct to things sometimes it just

6
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:15.660
makes you laugh if you share that feeling at the,

7
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.750
at the wrong time when you were immature.
Yeah.
And then they'll use charge.

8
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:23.160
And then the flip side is,
uh,
is the right man.
I like,
they're,

9
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:26.850
they're calling everybody snowflakes and then you say one thing that they don't

10
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:29.250
want to hear and they want you all Fox News.
Talk about snowflakes.

11
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.950
Why shep Smith teach it.

12
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.310
Go with Megan Kelly to m and the lame stream NBC and you go,

13
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.240
doesn't that make you,
doesn't that make you a snowflake now?

14
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.050
And then same thing happened with Chris Wallace.

15
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.230
Shepard Smith said that interview with Reince Priebus and people were like,

16
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.380
get him out of here.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Chris Wallace,
his,
you know,

17
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.970
his dad was Mike Wallace.
He's actually a journalist.
Yeah.
It's crazy.
Well,

18
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.050
it's a weird time when you see journalists getting excluded from press gaggles

19
00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:58.080
when you get the New York Times.
And uh,
who else was it?

20
00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:01.980
It was an la times la times and then there was another big one.
Oh,
CNN,
CNN.

21
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.060
Fuck the fuck man.

22
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.600
What the fuck I you remember when Obama was considering removing Fox News from

23
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:10.710
something because Fox News is essentially propaganda.

24
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.480
If you listen to Sean Hannity,
I,
I've heard Sean Hannity is a wonderful man.

25
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.070
I've heard he's a really nice guy when you meet him,

26
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.670
but that mother fucker is spewing straight hot propaganda.

27
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.590
He was the best point man.
After the grab my pussy shit came up,

28
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.510
he was the best because he will just went fucking straight to Bengazi.

29
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.250
He went straight to the email scandal.

30
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.430
Any fucking hammered it constantly to the point where,
you know,

31
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.220
locker room talk aside,
he start,

32
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.180
let me go get you certainly say that was inappropriate.
Well,

33
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:43.050
let's get to the facts.
Your,
let's get to what's important and just Bam,
Bam.
He's,

34
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.530
he's a big Trump ally.
He's good.
It's as good at what he does.
Oh,

35
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.530
he was very good at what he does.
But I mean,

36
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.680
when that was going on w against Obama,
they were like,
look,

37
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:54.210
why the fuck are we having these people?

38
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.170
Even why we even pretending they're press,
this is not journalism.
These,

39
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.800
this is a propaganda network.
And if everybody was like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
you remember?

40
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:06.330
It's like 2009 yeah.
And Obama almost had them removed,
but people protested.

41
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:10.260
He's like,
all right,
fine.
Not Trump.
No.
He's like,
not only that,

42
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:12.720
I'm not even going to the press correspondents' dinner.
Fuck.

43
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.230
That to me is you talked about being a pussy dude.
Like you're like,

44
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:19.280
you're scared,
you're scared to get made.
That's him get being scared yet.

45
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.680
And I was thinking the whole time,
I'm like,
oh,
what can median gets to do that?

46
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:25.890
That's a great gig.
Fuck that Gig.
That guy will go after you.
Well,

47
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.590
it's a district.
That's the problem is you make fun of that dude.

48
00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:29.610
And then like you'll all of a sudden,

49
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:34.380
like you have like you're getting audit right.
And more than audited,
man,

50
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:35.061
more than audited.

51
00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:38.280
They're probably search your emails and find some incriminating shit that you

52
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:40.780
might've did when you were in high school.
But then,

53
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.930
but then part of me is like kind of worth it.

54
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.140
The get stand standup kind of kind of stand up on the stage next to Trump and

55
00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:51.070
just be like,
dude,
come on.
Yeah,
you would definitely get mad press for doing it.

56
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.870
Well,
but yeah,
he would,
he would go,
I don't know.
He doesn't handle it well.

57
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:58.330
Do you remember when Obama was a roast him and he just sat there and you have it

58
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.710
his face?
Yeah,
I know it's,
it's,
it's a weird time,
man.

59
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.150
That was like when Obama said,
uh,

60
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.760
we have video of my actual birth for the first time we're going to release and

61
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:13.120
they go to the lion king over the lion king cartoon was hilarious.

62
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.690
Obama was fucking good at that.
But I'm really pretty funny.

63
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.130
He's a funny president.
Yeah.
You mean?
I just,

64
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:22.510
I still to this day,

65
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.640
I think that he's probably as far as like as a human being,
not,
not as like,

66
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.740
I hate president,
just speeches because I hate,
I hate that whole political talk.

67
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.080
I hate the way people talk.

68
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.520
I know like they're not a real person and he is like the king of the paws man.

69
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:43.700
He's a big fake.
It's stupid artistic pause and pause.
Well,

70
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.000
I mean he's just good at that kind of shit.

71
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:49.600
And there's a thing too that I don't particularly like that,
but I get it.

72
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.470
But I mean as far as like being like a representative of the country and the guy

73
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:56.770
was intelligent,
well read,
I forget his policies aside.

74
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.930
There's something about who the guy who was in charge is what it says about the

75
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:04.840
rest of us and what it says about the rest of us now.

76
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.160
I said we're a disorganized mess.
And that's really what it says.
Yeah,
it's,

77
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.250
it's definitely a,
uh,
I could tell you this though,

78
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.140
Trump is not wrong about CNN hating him.
Like he's not wrong.

79
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.950
You Watch if you watch the election and everything leading up to the election,

80
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.540
they did not like him,

81
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:25.600
even though even though images that use of him and they were pretty openly

82
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.130
against him.
And look,
I want,
like I said,
I worked at the daily show,

83
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:33.250
I watched a lot of CNN,
I watch a lot of MSNBC.
There's problems.

84
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.180
I have problems with all of those cable news now.

85
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.670
Good for you because you should.

86
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.650
And I really think that like the cult of personality media thing,

87
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.410
my biggest issue with cable news is that there were in the same rating system as

88
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.360
like the Big Bang theory.
You know what I'm saying?
That's it.

89
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.280
And it's like they're trying to get
no,
but they're trying to get numbers,
man.

90
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.230
That's all they're trying to do.
Obviously the goal of Sean Hannity show or,
or,

91
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.153
uh,

92
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.390
[inaudible] any of these shows is to get people to watch so they can sell ad

93
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:08.500
time cause so they can make money.
So that's my issue with it more than,
you know,

94
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.990
they're like,
a lot of them were bad at journalism.
I mean,
you know,
I,
I,

95
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.290
it's hard for me to forget things like balloon boy when like we're at war in

96
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.730
Afghanistan and Iraq and like,
uh,

97
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.800
they think a kid stuck in a weather balloon and we have like seven hours of

98
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:26.800
coverage of a weather balloon floating down the street with a live chopper

99
00:05:26.801 --> 00:05:28.390
covers.
And then it turned out the kid was hiding,

100
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.310
the dad was a prankster and that done that before.
Whatever.
Why,

101
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.070
why did I have to watch that for four hours?
You know what I'm saying?

102
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.010
So it's like there,
if a shiny thing happens,

103
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.310
they run towards the shiny thing they do.
They're immature.

104
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.230
They're looking for ratings,
they're looking to be the first,

105
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.630
they never talk about there's like Flint,
Michigan,
right?

106
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:50.381
When's the last time,

107
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:53.530
like people that don't have water still and they live in America still,

108
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.960
but the media is not talking about it.
You know,

109
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.170
they're talking right now about Kelly Conway putting her feet,
feet,
feet,
feet up,

110
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.140
shoes on.
It's what I want to know.
But then another words,
God Damn White House,

111
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:06.060
couch pitch.
So if they get,
they get,
they get well,

112
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.610
that's what people are mad about it.
They're like,
they're like,

113
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.740
that's disrespectful.
If a guy was sitting like that,

114
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.630
but you got to imagine the Scotch guarded that shit.

115
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:14.060
If Obama was sitting like that on the couch,

116
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:17.540
do you have any gay rumors would come out about him if Michelle Obama was

117
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:21.640
sitting like that anywhere?
Oh yeah.
People be so angry.
I would say about people,

118
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.580
the things people say about Michelle Obama has her shoes on.
Oh boy,

119
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.450
that is just unamerican shit,
bubblegum all over the fucking White House couch,

120
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.990
dare you lady dog shit.
And bubblegum.

121
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It's a real problem with what the news is because it's not really the news.

122
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.880
It's an entertainment show featuring events in the news.
Right?
And it's,

123
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.210
they're a hundred percent bias.

124
00:06:45.211 --> 00:06:49.100
There's no real journalism on television when it comes to TV news,
PBS,

125
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.170
maybe they're super liberal,
but they're also very boring.
Yeah.
In other words,

126
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:58.430
they're not trying to Zazi here's what's happening.
That's what we need though.

127
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:01.670
You need to be able to formulate your own opinions and when you're being steered

128
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:02.481
in one way or another,

129
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:07.130
whether it's steered by bill O'Reilly or steered by someone on the left,

130
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:10.130
it's this,
who the fuck is like a big reporter for CNN?

131
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:14.120
I don't even know any Anderson Cooper.
That's it.
We'll both it up.
Wolf Blitzer,

132
00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:17.390
I saw Wolf Blitzer the other day in Vegas.
I ran into him.
I got intimidated.

133
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.220
I was going to say hi,
but I'm like,
maybe it doesn't like me.

134
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.990
Maybe hit for hookers with him.

135
00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:24.800
He was walking into the Bellagio and high five them.

136
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.630
Nobody wants to smoke a joint.

137
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.340
The only thing I will say about Fox is like their opinion guys o' Reilly
Hannity,

138
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.690
they kind of have them under opinion.
Right.

139
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.500
Versus like Anderson Cooper is like news,
you know?
So it's like,
it's like,

140
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.410
but do you think Anderson,
I think Anderson Cooper,

141
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.480
like my take on him is clearly,
he's very left wing.
Right?
He's a gay guy,

142
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:53.090
you know?
I mean he's a,
he's a,
but it's also a Vanderbilt.
Oh yeah,

143
00:07:53.091 --> 00:07:53.660
that's right.

144
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.660
And he also worked for the CIA when he was in college that I did not know.

145
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.990
The big concern is that Anderson Cooper embedded CIA journalist.

146
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.770
Yeah,
that's the big CIA conspiracy theory.
You didn't know that.
No,

147
00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:10.460
I did not know.
I would imagine that once you work for the CIA,

148
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.240
you're in the fucking CIA.
Imagine you always have a little contact.

149
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.170
I have a friend who used to be in the CIA and I still consider him in the CIA

150
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.063
and you know,
I mean,

151
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.990
I know another guy whose dad was in the CIA is a fucking dad's still in the CIA.

152
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.810
Essentially.
You figure you got to know a couple people over at this.
I like,

153
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:29.360
I don't know.
I don't have any CIA contacts.
You know?

154
00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:31.130
It's like I used to work there.
You'd probably have a few,

155
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.930
and this is a shitty comparison,
but if I left the UFC,
I'd still be with the UFC.

156
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.240
You know what I mean?
Like there's,
there's like,
there's this,
there's a,

157
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:44.270
a giant bond that you've got to have with the fucking Central Intelligence

158
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.950
Agency.
You know,
you don't fuck with those guys.

159
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:49.340
You don't fuck them over and if they call you,
you answer the Goddamn phone hook.

160
00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:52.070
Yeah,
you did.
Yeah.
I'm still like I,

161
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.080
that's why I really got word of that when Trump was being so hard on the

162
00:08:55.081 --> 00:08:56.310
intelligence.
Crazy

163
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:00.270
<v 1>dude.
Like,
I don't know,
man,
like all of those guys in the intelligence community,</v>

164
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:02.670
like they're the reasons we're safe.

165
00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.490
<v 2>Okay.
Yeah.</v>
