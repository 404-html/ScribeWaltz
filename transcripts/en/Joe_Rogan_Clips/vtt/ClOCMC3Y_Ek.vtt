1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.610
The great part of all of this country.
He is,
you know,

2
00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:06.600
as as polar opposites as people try to make say a you and I,

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.940
here we are together as equals,
you know,

4
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:11.880
here we are together engaging one another as equals and we don't look like one

5
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:13.200
another and now from the same places.

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.460
And I think there's just a whole bunch of opportunity in that.
You know,

7
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.390
I think that there's money to be made in promoting that versus promoting

8
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:24.180
division and fear.
And so absolutely you should be,

9
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.780
there is money in helping children be better there.
There is in there.

10
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.780
And if we're going to live in a capitalist system,

11
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.260
be a compassionate capitalists and be the best you possibly can because we need

12
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:36.760
more of you.
But just seems like something like an,

13
00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:39.750
in terms of something that we think about as a civilization,

14
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:42.690
we don't think about neighborhood rebuilding.
No,

15
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.950
it's not a primary concern even though one of the biggest problems we have is

16
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:47.970
with crime and violence.

17
00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:50.550
If you ask people what's the two biggest things you're afraid of?

18
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:53.670
It's crime and violence.
Next be car accidents and cancer.
Right.

19
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.910
And but crime and violence,
you could severely mitigate.
Yeah.

20
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.190
My consider if you had all these community programs,

21
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.710
if you think about the amount of,
if they,

22
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.090
I bet if they calculate it out probably a wash,

23
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.330
the amount of money you'd spend fix things versus the amount of money you would

24
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:08.910
save by not having as much crime.
Agri,

25
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.970
Roxanne Shawntay I saw her and I don't know shit,

26
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.320
so I'm just guessing I south eight anything is better than to what we're doing

27
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:17.650
more prisons.
What we're doing it.
Yeah.

28
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.410
Well that's the scariest shit we got going on.

29
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.860
The idea that someone's profiting off of putting people in cages and that they

30
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:25.440
also lobby to make sure that there's more laws on the books.

31
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.680
I told Larry King earlier today that I'd rather stop arguing over the second

32
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:35.040
amendment with people that I should be arguing for amendment of the 13th

33
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:39.480
amendment with.
We should stop arguing over guns and we should start to say,

34
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:43.110
why does that 13th amendment have a loophole that allows for slavery that says

35
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:46.530
slavery is illegal except for yeah,
to people.

36
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.190
People have no idea how much prisoners get paid to work when they were working

37
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:53.750
on the fires.
Yes.
What was there were,
I think it was $2 or something.

38
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.630
Some fucking insane amount of money.

39
00:01:57.631 --> 00:01:59.610
They pay them and when they get out of prison,

40
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.590
they are not allowed to be firemen.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
Is that real?
Yeah.
It's real

41
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.370
life because you're a felon.
Every crime,
every mass it for everyone,
but,

42
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:14.820
but I need a felony.
You can't be a fireman.
I can't say any,

43
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.610
but a lot of the guys I've known that have gotten out of prison have not been

44
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:22.050
allowed to to apply for a fact.
There's,
there's felonies where violent felonies,

45
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.010
drug selling California is paying inmates $1 an hour.

46
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.450
Holy Shit.

47
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.340
Not even $2 your life is worth 99 Pitney's plus one.

48
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.010
Just stop and think about fighting fires for 10 hours.

49
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:38.700
You make $10 that's insane.
That is that,

50
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.900
but not only is that slavery,
that might be worse than slavery because

51
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.700
$10 an hour isn't even going to buy you food.
That's what I said.

52
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:48.720
Walmart pays it's,

53
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.910
but it's less money to work all day then you could feed yourself.
Yeah.

54
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.050
Yeah.
This is the why it got thing.
That's,
that's what I tried to tell people.

55
00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:01.390
People Talk Shit when I was on here.
Yeah.
That was all right.
I was like,
Yo man,

56
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.840
these are the guys in ally.
I appreciate you saying that because that's true.

57
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:08.710
And it's not just black guys is poor white people.

58
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:13.670
I almost wish I could have a convention went to say we got the same masters.
He,

59
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.770
they're saying this right here.

60
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:18.370
More than 2000 volunteer inmate firefighters and they volunteered,

61
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.690
including 58 youth offenders are battling wildfire flames through California.

62
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.030
Inmate firefighter serve a vital role,

63
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:28.480
clearing thick brush down to bare soil to stop the fire.

64
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:33.400
Spread a wonder.
Um,
do they get better service for that?

65
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:37.150
Do they they get out earlier?
Nope.
They don't think nothing.
I don't think so.

66
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.750
I would hope they do.
But if we're paying them a dollar out,
what do we care?

67
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.910
But we're like,
we are,
the public should be up in arms about,
yeah.
Well,

68
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:48.940
they're obviously trusting those guys to not run too,
because when you're,

69
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:52.170
when you're chopping down bushes out there,
when there's a fire going on,

70
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.790
but where do you,
where are you going to go with it?

71
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.830
Nobody knows what the fuck is happening.
It's chaos awaiting on to go,

72
00:03:56.831 --> 00:03:58.780
where are you going to go?
Right.
Yeah.

73
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.260
And then when they get you shit dollar an hour,
just how insane is that?

74
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.370
You know something else we do in our prisoners that's cruel and brutal.

75
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.790
We put people in a box of 23 hours a day.
Yeah.

76
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.910
A lot of math for an hour to walk in a space.
Yeah.
You driving him crazy.
Yeah.

77
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.410
She doing your fucking with their senses to the point where they're going crazy.

78
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:19.870
Absolutely.
Or they get solitary.

79
00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:22.510
I have friends there had been in solitary.

80
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.080
They talk to you about solitary and they're just there for themselves with your

81
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:29.920
own mind day after day after day.
I remember going to in school suspension,

82
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:33.580
not being able to talk about to go fucking nuts after three hours,
you know?

83
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.350
So imagine being in Georgia state corrections.
Exactly when you're a little kid,

84
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:42.760
you can't shut the fuck up for anything.
Coach dollar used to tell him,
you know,

85
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:46.900
he used to be on,
I was like,
shut the Fuck Cameron dollar one 1995 UCLA.

86
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:49.870
He played,
um,
play point guard for them when they won national championship.

87
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.910
His Dad was the culture of high school.

88
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.290
His Dad was the basketball coach and he'd soft the end school and I stayed in,

89
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:58.810
in school.
Oh Man.
I knew his dad like a fucking player.

90
00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:01.180
I couldn't play any basketball.
I'd just be sitting there quiet.

91
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:04.600
He'd be reading the paper just like,
I can't wait to get the fuck outta here,
man.

92
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.010
Coach Donlon home at and say Shit.

93
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.530
That's how I knew I didn't want to go to prison.
Thank you.
Coach.

94
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.360
Shouts out the camp not talking to anybody for just a couple of days.

95
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.890
It would be enough to drive you crazy.

96
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:17.770
And I imagine some people that had been locked in the hole for like eight
months.

97
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.080
Yeah.
They do that to people.
Yeah,
they do.
They break.
I mean that doesn't,

98
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.150
isn't that what they did at Chelsea Manning?
Yeah,
didn't they?
Yes,

99
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.220
that's exactly what they did.
I think
I forgot what her original name was.

100
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.660
[inaudible] I forgot it.
No,
it's not.
You might it,

101
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.260
you might get to play Chelsea.
I was going to say,
you might say piece of shit.

102
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:40.690
It's always been Chelsea,
but yeah,
she um,

103
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.000
I think they locked her in the hole for like 10 months.
Damn.
Yeah.
No talking.
No.

104
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.870
Nobody just by herself.
Fuck you by herself.
That's crazy.

105
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.770
I mean you could break someone's brain easy,
easy,
easy.

106
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.710
I heard a people's brain gets broken on a good edible.

107
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.830
I watch first 48 mm.
I see.

108
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:04.220
Mother fuckers rang get broken 15 minutes to cigarettes at a honeypot.

109
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.370
Yeah.
That's another reason I tell kids don't commit crime with your homies,
man.

110
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.330
Watch first 48 you're going to see everything go bad man.
For a Newport.

111
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.360
Yeah.
Just so many fucking crimes.
So many laws that don't,

112
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.970
don't need to exist.
Poverty.
We end poverty.

113
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:26.170
We fixed crime when he takes a fuck load of it,
that's for sure.

114
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.910
Then I'd still be sociopaths and greedy people that are going to have that,

115
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:32.290
but far less than crimes of opportunity like Robin Moms,

116
00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:35.210
if their persons at gas stations car jackings,

117
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:37.550
you're not going to see stolen cars.
You're not going to see burglaries.

118
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.270
You're not going to see that.
If you start to have an influx of,
you know,

119
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:43.220
we'd need to bring a lot of stuff back to America.

120
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:46.460
We need to start making shit again and you'd start buying shit.
We make again.

121
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:50.240
We need to,
we need to start refocusing on what we could be doing in house.

122
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.780
I think,
you know,
I think that would certainly help us.

123
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.230
I don't know what we could do,
uh,

124
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.950
to sort of promote that idea of,
um,

125
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.713
I mean,
why doesn't it,

126
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.600
it's nothing that ever gets discussed in any political discussion.
Like when,

127
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.080
whenever there's some debates going on or whenever there's,

128
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.340
cause we're being given an agenda,

129
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.540
but nobody ever thinks of that one aspect of our culture,

130
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.980
the weakest aspect of our culture economically.
If we don't really consider it,

131
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.950
you just look at it as a source of crime.
It's a statistic.

132
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.910
But we look at sitters as though it's something that just is just has to be,

133
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.040
but it doesn't have to be like that.
Well,

134
00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:33.860
especially about history and to tell them to shut us all.

135
00:07:33.861 --> 00:07:37.310
I'm really trying to say like there are other alternatives or other ways to try

136
00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:39.980
this and we could,
yeah,
you can't,

137
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:44.570
you can try to fix homelessness without criminalizing being homeless.

138
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:45.830
Right.

139
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.820
We know that most men that are homeless and have some types of mental illnesses,

140
00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:50.654
schizophrenia.

141
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.350
So that means that we've broken down and we're not taking care of the mental ill

142
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:57.860
in a way that we should be a could be.
So if you start to fix that,

143
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.610
you start to fix that kind of homelessness.
We know that women and children,

144
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.000
we know why they're on the street and we know that if they're subsidized into

145
00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:07.400
these type of affordable housing apartments in the city,

146
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.500
the kids have the opportunity to go to better schools,

147
00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:13.220
to become better parts of society in terms of having to networks and resources.

148
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.010
We know the mothers are closer to work,
can be home,
but we don't do that.
We,

149
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:17.841
we build cities.

150
00:08:17.841 --> 00:08:21.110
Like right now we're developing in Atlanta and we've been promised a certain

151
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:25.460
amount of,
um,
of workspace in the city for working class people,

152
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:28.370
for poor people.
Some of the developers aren't doing what they say they do.

153
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.800
And because you do that,
you start to increase the,

154
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.170
the things that are blights on us.
You know,

155
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:36.050
we just have to be really committed to it and do it.
And that's it.

156
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.780
And once we do it,
it's done,
you know?
But if we,

157
00:08:38.781 --> 00:08:43.760
if we keep acting like it's not happening and complaining about poverty and

158
00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:46.760
crime in war and not doing anything,

159
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.060
it's just the cycle never stops nasty under the insanity.

160
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:51.110
I really don't understand.
