WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.220
Yeah.
The,
the ultimate legal case,
public legal case,

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.320
uh,
or one of the ultimate ones is Julian Assange.
Oh yeah.
That's a weird,

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.880
he hasn't seen sunlight and months.
Yeah.
No Internet access.
No Internet access.

4
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.670
Yeah.
They shut down the Internet.
Yeah.
And they're trying to kick him out now,

5
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:20.850
Ecuador.
But where's it going to go if he goes,
he's going to,
if they want him,

6
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:22.950
what?
Sweden,
they want him,
they want him in Britain.

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.740
And I don't think they've been charges filed against him here yet,
technically,

8
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.300
but I'm sure they want his head on a platter of what they want him for.

9
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.240
So preposterous.
It's so nice.
It's like a water,
right?
It's just like Al Capone.

10
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.920
Yeah.
Yeah.
Activation instead of being a mobster,
right.
Yeah.
But it's,

11
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.840
it's interesting because I would think that someone like Trump who is such a

12
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:47.841
conspiracy minded person would actually like Juliana massage because I'm sure

13
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:51.990
there's been,
I mean,
I don't know what he's ever said in the past.

14
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.110
I think it was anti,
he was anti wiki leaks from the start.
No,

15
00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:58.830
but he said things about Giulia signs that were anti it.
My understanding.
Yeah.

16
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.370
Because there was something,
Julian Assange tweeted,
my friend,

17
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:05.280
Cassandra at fair bank,
she's a big support of him and she's like,
well,

18
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.340
there goes to the idea of clemency or a pardon.
Oh really?
Yeah.

19
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.310
So that Trump tweeted,
or Julian,
I think.
Yeah.
Oh Man.

20
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.930
Yeah.
It's a piece of praise or virtual prisoner.
Yeah.
It's like,
where's that end?

21
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.370
It's not gonna end.
Well,
he can get visitors though.
No,

22
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:25.710
I don't it Camela Anderson.
Oh,
that's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.

23
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.890
But they may have taken that away.
Take that away.

24
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.810
I wonder how long they could stay there.
It's been years,
years.

25
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.080
It's been years.
Years,
yeah.
Yeah.
To be in one building.
Yeah.
And he,

26
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.660
he doesn't go outside anymore.
He can't,
they won't let them.
I don't think they,

27
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.320
I don't think he ever could went on the balcony.
Okay.

28
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.800
Now I know he doesn't see off sunlight.
That I'm positive.
That's terrible.

29
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.540
They give them vitamin D at least.
No.
Yeah,
I dunno.
I Dunno.
I mean,

30
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:52.890
he's awfully pale to begin with,

31
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.650
but if you don't get vitamin D like you can get really sick,

32
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.760
but that's what they do in North Korea.

33
00:01:56.761 --> 00:01:57.960
They get their skin starts falling off there.

34
00:01:57.961 --> 00:02:02.740
It's been there since June 19th of 2012 there the embassy doc,

35
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.990
that's six years.
Whoa,

36
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.500
whoa.
This Christ,
how much?

37
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.800
Almost six and a half years.
June.

38
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.420
How much solitaire can you play and you don't even have internet anymore.

39
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.630
He has an Internet for how many months?
I'm looking at timeline is,

40
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.840
I want to say it's been about four or five months.
It's been a while.

41
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.930
I think it was more than that long.

42
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.110
March 27th they were suspended for the songs time.

43
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.930
Eight months for the Second Todd's October,

44
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.980
2016 fuck who the hells over at Wiki leaks still running shit.

45
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.410
That's the intern who's hanging in there,
you know God.

46
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.120
That's crazy.
Like how does that one play out?
I mean they're,
they're,

47
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:53.190
they're really what they're doing for sure.

48
00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:57.540
When we're talking about punishment being a deterrent in certain situations,

49
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.500
that is absolutely a deterrent.
Oh,

50
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:02.650
they're making an example of him for the whistle blower.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

51
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.090
Where's Chelsea Manning's out now?
She just had her surgery.
What surgery though?

52
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:10.110
Per transgender.
She goes,
yeah,
that one there.
She tweeted out.
I have,

53
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.940
I have a vagina.
Oh,
okay.

54
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.940
Yeah.
Well,
there you go.
Yeah,
she's out.
She's out.
She's out.

55
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:22.810
Hobnobbing and maybe using that thing.
I met her,
she came to an event.

56
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.270
She was very nice,
I'm sure.

57
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.050
But she's out.
She's out.
She's been out for a,

58
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.840
Obama pardoned her computer.
Her sentence,

59
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.790
he's locked away forever in the embassy.
And then there's Snowden,

60
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.070
who's also hiding right in Russia.
Right.
What?
And actually a lot of these,

61
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.410
yeah,
there's just Holla.

62
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.600
<v 1>Mm MM.</v>

63
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.330
<v 0>After almost a decade of fighting through prison.
The courts,</v>

64
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.180
a hunger strike and through the insurance company.

65
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:56.920
I finally got surgery this week.
Not lasik apparently.
Oh,
you son of a bitch.

66
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.860
She's wearing glasses folks.
Um,
yeah,
house.
He's going to be in Russia,

67
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:05.650
probably forever eight.
Had a lot of these farmers from South Africa.

68
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:09.180
That's where they're going to Russia and Putin is letting them in.
Really?
Yeah.

69
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.730
So they better learn how to write those ares backward pretty quick.
Oh,
right.

70
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:15.430
They've got weird ours.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well you have to learn the whole,

71
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.270
the whole language and just that weird.
Ours you,
Russia,

72
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.240
Russians got a lot of weird ones.
We do.
We got,
oh yeah.

73
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:25.660
I was barely literate in Russia.
The letters look fake.
All letters are fake,

74
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.320
but they look like alien language.
You know?

75
00:04:27.321 --> 00:04:30.790
It was like somebody writing something that was this once a piece of metal from

76
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:35.500
a spaceship
like Snowden is,
he's fucked too,

77
00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:39.640
right.
I mean,
he can't even be public in Russia.
Yeah.

78
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.660
I am not sure about him.
I know,
I know.
Sorry.
I haven't been following stolen.

79
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.960
He's deep under.
Lindsey must know where he is though.
I mean,

80
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:48.510
there's no way the intelligence community is,

81
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.350
doesn't have a fucking full line on exactly where that guy is at all times.

82
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.000
The question,
do they know all this stuff or are they incompetent?

83
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.630
And there's examples of both directions.
Yeah,
I got to think they know,

84
00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.790
or Snowden is,
I can't,
I can't.
I mean,
hi,

85
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.700
Glenn Greenwald talks to him all the time.
Glenn Greenwald's in Brazil.
Yeah.

86
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:05.770
That was how to glean broad,
kind of made his name,
I think,

87
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:09.910
who's also a great lefty.
Yeah,
he gets it a lot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

88
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.000
that's just,
how does that guy go on?

89
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.010
Like is he just in hiding,
getting his restaurants,
you know,

90
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:20.530
like sneaking in?
Like where does he,

91
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.860
how does he get around?
Yeah.
I don't know.

92
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.350
And who wants to getting some money from,
he's got to pay for food.
Right?

93
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.250
What does he do for food?
Yeah,
a lot of Borscht.
Fuck,

94
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.750
I just looked him up at Google is like kind of broken.
Here's an example of it.

95
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.040
It says,
when did he die?

96
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.800
And then it just highlights that date and it doesn't say he's not dead.

97
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.070
So Snowden flew to Hong Kong where he was staying there,

98
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.320
but that was part of his whole trip.
He had to go through it.
He,

99
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.250
this whole journey through a bunch of countries.
Yeah.
It's weird.

100
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.670
I think they tacked on Thailand or something at some point.
It is weird.

101
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.630
It's like,
does that guy just,
that's him forever.
That's,
that's what he does.

102
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.770
Who Snowden.
Yeah.
I mean,
he just tends to hide.
I think so.

103
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:06.860
Or maybe he safe in Russia and Putin is having him there as a fuck you to us.

104
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.410
Yeah.
I mean it must have something to do with it.

105
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:10.910
The Putin's deciding to do this,

106
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.630
putting wouldn't do it unless there's some advantage to him.
Yeah.
It's just,

107
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.190
it's a strange,
you know,

108
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.150
strange as these things are just these floating like a den,

109
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.990
uh,
uh,
like little chapters.

110
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.520
So these stories that are just,
you know,

111
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:35.150
we all know about them but they don't get resolved well,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

112
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.630
yeah,
yeah.
They're just floating on,
hang on here and it's just thinking,
I mean,

113
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:41.060
this is why I talk about North Korea at the time since I've been there.

114
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.380
Everyone's still there.

115
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.710
Everyone I met and like thinking about six years a song has been in that one

116
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:46.280
building,

117
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.910
six fucking it's itself and all the people in jail also who had been jailed for

118
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:53.900
six years.
Just,
we can't wrap our heads around that six fucking year.

119
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:55.190
Thinking about where you were six years ago.

120
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:56.270
I'm thinking of where I was six years,

121
00:06:56.271 --> 00:07:00.520
not just at like six years and things are deteriorating.
Right.

122
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.400
They want them out of the embassy.
He's got nowhere to go.
If he leaves,

123
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:07.310
he gets arrested.
He doesn't have any internet.
Yeah.

124
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.510
Can't see sunlight knowing that the most powerful people in the world were doing

125
00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:14.030
everything they can to fucking put you in jail for life.

126
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.560
And you kind of already are in a sense.

127
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.830
I can't see it.
Julia sound,
just never in the rest of his life.

128
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.970
Probably going to be able to like take a jog around a park like ever.
No,
never.

129
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.840
We're like walk a dog.
Yeah,
it's over.
It's,

130
00:07:29.841 --> 00:07:33.250
it's scary.
And the thing is a lot of this shit that he,

131
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.370
almost all the shit that he put out his true.
Yeah.
That's what's crazy.

132
00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:41.000
It's like he's doing what journalists should be doing instead of getting up in

133
00:07:41.001 --> 00:07:44.360
the press core and just pitching a fit.
Yeah.
But it is,

134
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.830
there's real repercussions for doing what he did and that's what they're letting

135
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:52.280
us know.
Yeah.
And they're letting us,
he said turning matter what the law is like.

136
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:57.250
What are you getting them for?
Secret sex or a surprise.
Yeah.
What?

137
00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.000
All right.
Snowed is running.

138
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.720
His Twitter account says he's the president of something called freedom of
press,

139
00:08:02.721 --> 00:08:06.980
which is a website and Twitter account also have the same name and they tweeted

140
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:10.160
this out a couple of days ago.
She story I'd never heard of.

141
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.730
It says in the latest case in the Trump administration's cracked down on leaks.

142
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.720
Natalie Edwards,

143
00:08:14.721 --> 00:08:18.260
US Treasury employee was arrested and charged with giving suspicious bank

144
00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:20.870
records involving Trump campaign associates.

145
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:25.700
Paul Manafort and Rick Gates to a news outlet in the legal complaint,

146
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.870
the Justice Department sided word for word conversations he allegedly had with a

147
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:33.050
reporter over and encrypted messaging APP.

148
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:38.740
The government claimed it got ahold of her phone and with it her encrypted

149
00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:43.790
messages with a reporter.
Now she faces prison time.
Wow,

150
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:48.550
dude,
I'll report.
It should be using apps that this,

151
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.120
this make all their messages disappear.
Yeah,
like signaling.
What's that?
Yeah,

152
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.940
that's what he's this website.
Yeah,
but even then someone can take screenshots.

153
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.780
No,
I think something that you can't,
it's disabled automatically.
Really?
Yeah.

154
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:02.820
But you could take a picture of your phone with another phone,
obviously,

155
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:07.080
but signal.
Yeah.
My friend,
who's the knows more than anything.

156
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:10.980
I know that in resecure it,
he was signaling,
signaling,
secure drop.

157
00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:14.970
And so what is signal?
What do you do with signal?
Basically it's,
it's encrypted.

158
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.290
So if you send messages to me,

159
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:18.630
like they v four you could set it to vanish at the certain time,

160
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:22.750
and I can't do a screenshot.
Ah,
interesting.
Yeah.
Hmm.

161
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.820
And it's,
it's,
it's not hackable,
apparently.
It's the best one.
