1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.220
Ma'Am.
It's just,
it's still good.
Yeah.

2
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.850
You don't even understand what he was saying.
Sometimes you're like,

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.560
I can't do that.
A lot of you do that.
How do you do that?
I can't do that.

4
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:10.230
And he's doing it sober.
He's not like some dudes who do that.

5
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:12.530
They're all Adderall our up.
No,
he's on the Nache.

6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.160
I liked these kids in school.
I'd just be like,
you know,

7
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:19.650
I was just the kid that was just like kind of like more chill.

8
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.770
I don't need to like,
and sometimes when you just goes over stupid stuff,

9
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.870
but I do wonder if he's learning anymore.
That's the one thing.
Yeah.

10
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:30.900
Cause he doesn't like to have like,
it's like once he has an opinion,

11
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:35.250
like I like to be like to have conversations and I like to be wrong about the

12
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:36.600
conversation cause I don't know everything.

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.000
I think that's kind of like why people love this podcast so much.

14
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.010
Because you're open to learning anything.

15
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:43.500
Like it would have people on this podcast,
you're like,
what was he having?

16
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:47.130
You know?
Because there's some,
there's always something that you can learn.

17
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:50.580
There's always something that you don't understand that you don't know if you

18
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.120
have an open mind.
Right.
And I think that in many ways,

19
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:58.240
and that like sometimes he's just not open to learning about certain things and

20
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.040
then somebody might know something about a culture beyond what he knows.

21
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:05.500
And it's just like,
nope.
That like the idea,
right?

22
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.070
Like it's just drives me crazy,

23
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.840
but I like him is really fucking smart.
That's the problem.

24
00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:17.700
Exactly.
But he thinks everyone is stupid.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like,
no,
like I hated,

25
00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:21.380
like I got so annoyed with like the Kanye West,
like four seconds.

26
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.380
He like writes an article saying Kanye West is just crazy.
And I'm like,
yeah.

27
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:27.120
And I wrote him an email.
I was just like,
dude,

28
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:30.030
like I understand that to you and the way that you've done your life,

29
00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:31.260
this doesn't make sense.
Right.

30
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:34.610
But this is actually really important for black people to see this.

31
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.840
It was the most important thing.
Him,
uh,
like,
you know,
him tweeting out.

32
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.730
I love the way and things,

33
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.320
but beyond that saying that he openly supported the president.

34
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.160
So I can see why Ben shuts or something like that down initially because to him,

35
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.070
like culture is not the way you talk about politics,
right?

36
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.330
Like because he's by the book.

37
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.690
But he has to understand that by the book is not the way people in the hood or

38
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:55.740
being raised by the book.

39
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:57.540
It's not the way people in the projects are being raised.

40
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.560
He people have had their families destroyed and decimated by,

41
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:03.510
by the welfare system,
right?
The fathers aren't even at the homes.
You know,

42
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:08.280
the single motherhood rate jumped from 25% in 1965 to 74% today.

43
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.450
And so these kids turn to culture to father them.

44
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.170
They turned to Jay z and Beyonce and hip hop and Kanye and to tell them what's

45
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:17.880
right and what's wrong.
So for so long,

46
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:20.250
because the left had a stranglehold on culture,

47
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.170
they've had a stranglehold on black America.

48
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.620
So the most significant thing that opened up this dialogue beyond the work that

49
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:28.350
I was doing was this simple tweet.

50
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.810
And the simple show of support from Kanye West.

51
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.620
And I was so frustrated that he had,

52
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.900
he had to like in that moment just write like dismiss him as crazy.

53
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:39.540
It's just like,
dude,
like just be willing to learn.
Like,
you know,

54
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:40.560
just be willing to say like,

55
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.270
I don't understand why the hell this is the way that this is black people

56
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.670
willing to talk about politics.
Right?
But maybe there's something here.

57
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:50.760
And I always understood that culture was the most important vertical.

58
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.790
When Charlie and I first met and we sat down,
I defined three verticals.

59
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.140
Charlie Kirk,
Charlie,
Kirk.
Okay.
So Charlie Kirk is like this 18 year old.

60
00:02:59.141 --> 00:03:03.850
Like we started turning point USA who I work for when he was 18 and he is like a

61
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:07.930
savant.
They call him like Trump's boy wonder.
Like he's a brilliant,

62
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:11.110
if you want to talk about like smart beyond like get the smartest person I know

63
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:14.410
is Charlie Kirk hands down and he's only 24.
Um,
he didn't,

64
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:16.270
he didn't go to college just like,
I dunno,

65
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.710
just like it was reading weird stuff when he was seven,
you know,
I don't know,

66
00:03:18.711 --> 00:03:21.100
like,
just like things that everyone's like,
oh yeah,
I just read that Thomas Soul.

67
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:24.010
He's like,
yes,
they write it when I was six,
you know,
what am I trying?

68
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.250
Could you not say that?
Could you be cool?
But so,
um,
when,

69
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.120
when Charlie and I met and I like I told him like my plan to sort of help black

70
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:32.200
America and to wake them up,

71
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:35.080
cause I understood how we had fallen victim to this brainwash.

72
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.060
There was the leftist dogma.
There's this idea that because we're black,

73
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:41.350
we have to vote Democrat anyway.

74
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.840
That is not a Democrat is racist and against helping us.

75
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.920
That is like what so many black Americans believe.
I believed it.
I believed it.

76
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.140
You know what I mean?
So,
and I'm a,
I'm a pretty smart girl.
You know,

77
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.690
I've always been a very smart girl.
I've always,
I've always been,
you know,

78
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:56.050
I've excelled in,
in academics,
right?

79
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.260
So how did I fall victim to it?
The exact same system,
right?

80
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:01.840
These three verticals,
the first being the family,
that breakdown of the family.

81
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.590
The second one,
um,
being culture,
which then to me,
like growing up,

82
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.190
it was like Jay z,
like Jay z was God to me.
Like I would throw on,
like,
I was,

83
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.690
you know,
I went through a lot of stuff when I was a kid.

84
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:13.210
I didn't have a great family,
um,
you know,
um,

85
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.390
but I would throw on a Jay z album and like whatever he said,
it was like,

86
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.200
it was like going to church,
you know?
Um,
and then,
and I can't stand him now,

87
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.720
but the third vertical,
no,

88
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.850
because he knows exactly what he's doing and he's a trader,

89
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.480
but third vertical being education,
which was,

90
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.093
yeah,
it's like,

91
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.590
like Beyonce hazy under because he knows what's happening to black America.

92
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:39.730
And he's somebody that built his entire career off the backs of black America,

93
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.670
you know,
of being the guy who started in the honing in,
in,
um,
you know,

94
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.620
queens and worked at,
you know,
it was a drug dealing,

95
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.520
worked his way up and it became the io for Sony people in Black America.

96
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.950
And then he stands on stage and endorses Hillary Clinton.

97
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.270
He stands on stage and tells black America to put the same people in,

98
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.340
in the White House that locked up more black men than any present history of

99
00:04:57.341 --> 00:04:58.900
United States.
Bill Clinton.
Right.

100
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:01.480
The person that stands on the crime bill of 94 is Bill Clinton.

101
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.270
But because Jay Z is now focused on getting a piece of the pie,

102
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.570
the globalist piece of the Pie,
he doesn't care about black America.
Um,
that's,

103
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.710
that's my opinion.
Um,
so what,
that's what it was,

104
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.900
or do you think that maybe he thought the Donald Trump represented a lot of

105
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:18.730
racist white people?
No.
Oh God,
no.
Not even.
Kind of,

106
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.900
not,
not for a single second,
Jay,
because Jay z's very smart.

107
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.230
No,
I didn't speak to him.
I just,
I know like I should,
it's a,
there's a,

108
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.940
there's a certain thing where like,
I just,

109
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.880
I know that Jay z and Beyonce betrayed the black community.
Like there they are.

110
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.080
They did it purposely for financial gain.
Yeah.
I think,
yeah,
I think that they,

111
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:36.520
they've,
they were interested in having,

112
00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:40.330
they want to be the people that control the world and they felt that Hillary

113
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.730
Clinton,
like,
you know,
they were working with Obama very closely,
um,

114
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.470
and very cluey.

115
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:47.200
Now we know that the Obama administration worked very hard to get Hillary

116
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.100
Clinton to office and they wanted to stay in that group.
Um,

117
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.730
and so they supported Hillary Clinton who was selected behind closed doors,

118
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:58.390
forget the American people to be the next president.
United.
Yeah.

119
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.510
So it's like two,
certainly by the DNC.
Yeah.
All 100% but beyond that,

120
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:05.330
it was an embed with Obama.
You know,
she was our secretary of state and she,

121
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.150
she was doing deals behind closed doors and Jay Z and Beyonce,

122
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:09.920
we're a part of that click,
right?

123
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:14.570
So they were a part of the celebrated celebrities that were allowed to go to the

124
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.080
White House and they'd wear the ties and everybody would be taking photo ops.

125
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.210
But it was a cool thing to be friends with Obama,
right?

126
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.440
Like nobody wants to go to the White House and like celebrities,

127
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:26.210
it's hard to get celebrities to go with Trump.

128
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:28.970
There's so much controversy attached to it.
The damage of career,

129
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.170
part of left and right.

130
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.410
Part of what's happening with Roseanne is not just that she made a racist tweet.

131
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.160
She was,
no,
she didn't know it was racist.
She supports Trump and then she,

132
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.570
her character supports Trump and people were looking for something to hate her

133
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:46.690
over and she handed it to them.
You know?
