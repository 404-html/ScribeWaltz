1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.460
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.980
but now when I sit down and I cook something for my family,

3
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:11.520
I know where that came from.
If we have vegetables that we grow in our garden,

4
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.240
this is a great satisfaction for serving up some cucumbers or some,

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.900
some Kale or whatever it is that we grew in.
Our garden tastes better when you,

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.350
when you go out there and you cut that cucumber off the planet and you cut that

7
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:25.320
Kale down,
it is like half an hour old.

8
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.070
Like nothing compares to that freshness that you go to the grocery store that

9
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:31.440
may be a couple of days a week,
a month old.
You have no idea.

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.820
And for me as a chef,
um,

11
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.850
that's why I love hunting and foraging and having a garden in my backyard

12
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:42.510
because when you go and pick something,
nothing tastes as good as that.
Right?

13
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.440
Yeah.

14
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.440
I mean I appreciate where vegans and animal rights activists are coming from

15
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:52.620
because it's coming from,
I think there was,
there's a lot of distortion,
um,

16
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.190
with like really angry ones and,

17
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.830
but this is my take on a lot of this is you get a group of a hundred people,

18
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.720
one of them for sure is a fucking idiot.
Just out of just sheer odds,

19
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.100
right?
Like what are the odds?
One of them is a fucking,
it's pretty strong,
right?

20
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.320
Well,
if you're going to get a group of 100 vegans,

21
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:12.750
you're going to get at least one of them.
That's a fucking idiot.

22
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.600
And they're going to be,
some of them are violent.

23
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.980
Some of them were super aggressive about it.
I mean,
there's a ton of them online.

24
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.500
You can go,
they,
their identity is completely wrapped around veganism.

25
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:24.750
These vegan in their name,
it's always,

26
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:28.620
I'm the Vegan this or the Vegan that that is 100% of their name.

27
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.120
So 100% of their identity.
So they can't,
they can't separate from it ever.

28
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.510
Like that is who they are forever.
And they have,

29
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.060
there's been some serious problems.
What was the name of that cafe again?

30
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.280
Cafe gratitude.
Um,

31
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.550
there were some people that were running a Vegan restaurant.

32
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.550
I think they have a couple of them right in la.
And um,

33
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.040
they were having health issues and some people,

34
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:56.190
the Vegan Diet just doesn't agree with them.
And maybe they were doing it wrong.

35
00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:59.190
Maybe they have unique dietary needs,

36
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.730
but they started raising cattle and they started eating those cattle and the

37
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:06.030
fucking vegans freaked out.
Death threats,

38
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.870
all this crazy shit coming after them protesting.
And you know,

39
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:12.300
these people were terrified.
They're older folks.
They're,
they're,
you know,

40
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:13.260
they're elderly.
They're,

41
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:16.830
it is Vegan restaurant owners received death threats over animal slaughter

42
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:19.110
scandal.
Yeah.

43
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.910
I mean this is the bad ones.
Right.
And it's not,
most of them,

44
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.430
most vegans I think,
are vegans for all the right reasons.
Yeah.

45
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.660
And if you are misinformed,
if you choose to,
to not,
uh,

46
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.460
to not eat meat and choose that kind of lifestyle,
like power too,
that's a too,

47
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.460
it's amazing.
And I think that,
you know,
if,
if,
if it works for you and your body,

48
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.110
that's great.
And for me,
it doesn't work for me.
Like I,
I've,

49
00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:46.380
I've done Vegan cleanses,
I've done the juice cleanses.
I've,
I've done,
you know,

50
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.090
I've gone out for,
as a chef to Vegan restaurants and I'm not full,

51
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.760
you know,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll eat three or four courses,

52
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:58.280
I'll spend tons of money and half an hour later I'm starving,
starving.
And it's,

53
00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.820
I just,

54
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.390
I need eat something with protein and lots of protein and it's,

55
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.240
it's meat or fish or,
you know,
uh,
I've made tofu from scratch,

56
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:11.470
from soybeans and it's just,
it doesn't,
it's not the same.
Yeah.
Well,

57
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.850
right now people are screaming at there,
you're doing it wrong.
My vegan food is,

58
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.060
I love it.
It's tasty,
but I'm not,
some of it is,
some of it's good.
I mean,

59
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:25.060
I eat vegan raw all the time.
There's a Vegan restaurant near me.

60
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:29.320
I go to all the time.
Sometimes you get dirty looks,
this motherfucker's here.

61
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.650
Why are you here and why you're not allowed to eat.
You're not one of us.

62
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.680
You're not allowed to eat our food.
Um,
it's just,

63
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.710
it's very unfortunate that I think these,
uh,

64
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.560
ideological groups get tainted by the most extreme members.

65
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.630
And I think that's true on the hunting side too.

66
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:48.810
And you got guys like fucking Ted Nugent,
you know,

67
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.800
and all the people that I think that they distort the,
the real

68
00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.540
sort of fascinating and mystical qualities of wildlife and harvesting wildlife

69
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:06.610
and being out there and,
and experiencing nature.
It's an,

70
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.500
it's an almost psychedelic experience to,
to,
to hunt and be in the wild.

71
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.680
And that sounds so counterintuitive to someone who's never experienced it.

72
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.360
But the world of these animals,
when you are away from your cell phone,

73
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:23.740
when you're away from,
you know,
television and all the bullshit and the computer,

74
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.260
when you're,
when you're out there in the wild,

75
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:28.510
you are almost in another dimension.

76
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.230
If you are in complete silence in the forest and you,

77
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.470
your mind goes into a completely different sort of mode that is familiar but yet

78
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:46.150
alien,
it's familiar in a way that your body is like,
oh,
this is hunting.

79
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.870
This is what humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years.

80
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:51.760
This is why we became human.
I mean,

81
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:55.480
this is literally one of the reasons that scientists believed that our brains

82
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:58.450
grew is because we started eating meat,
we started cooking meat,

83
00:04:58.451 --> 00:05:00.250
the nutrition became more accessible.

84
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.670
And also we started thinking about how to hunt,

85
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.800
developing tools to hunt with.

86
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:08.920
I mean all of this is the reason why humans are humans today.

87
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.920
And I'm sure the Vegan argument against that would be,
well,
that's then,

88
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.340
and we're past that now.
While we're not,
no,
we're not.
We're not.

89
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:17.830
Because of controlling the population of animals,

90
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.650
we're certainly not because of controlling the population of predators.

91
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.380
And that's another thing that people need to accept and understand.

92
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.130
There's a reason why they eradicated all the wolves in North America before they

93
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:29.680
reintroduced them to Yellowstone and now they're thriving.

94
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:31.090
And many parts of the northwest,

95
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.760
it's because they were fucking killing everything.
And there's,

96
00:05:33.761 --> 00:05:37.120
they don't have any predators.
And the only predators that they have are humans.

97
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.590
And if we don't keep the populations in check of them and have grizzly bears

98
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.490
have black bears and all the other predators,
they start eating each other.

99
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.130
They start tearing each other apart.
They start coming after us.

100
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:50.620
They start encroaching on p well,
we're in their territory.

101
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.640
We shouldn't be in their place.
We humans.
Well,
look,
I'm on team people,

102
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:56.080
so I don't know what the fuck you're saying here.

103
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.670
If you're saying that we should move out of San Francisco and give it to the

104
00:05:58.671 --> 00:06:00.650
wolves,
you can go fuck yourself.
All right?

105
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:04.610
And this is literally what it boils down to because you have to draw some line

106
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:08.510
in the sand somewhere because if someone doesn't control the population of

107
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:11.900
animals,
then what's going to happen?
Well,

108
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.340
you can leave them to their own devices and they can sort of sort it out,

109
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:19.650
but you know how they sorted out through disease and starvation.
I mean,

110
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.630
what happens is there's too many animals and not enough food.

111
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:26.870
So they get horrific diseases.
That's where mange comes from.

112
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:31.871
That's where a lot of like serious diseases that infect wildlife come from.

113
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.410
They come from a lack of food or overpopulation.
That's how nature sorts it out,

114
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.260
you know?
And that's how nature sorts of that with people too.
We're just sneaky.

115
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:42.810
We've used vaccines and shit and we're at the top of the food chain,
but we are,

116
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.950
we've worked hard to get there.
We are.
And I think we,

117
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:49.940
it comes with a certain responsibility and that responsibility is really,

118
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.930
we were really doing a disservice to that responsibility with factory farming.

119
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.080
And that's the one of the main arguments for veganism.

120
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.650
The one of the main arguments is the horrific treatment of those animals,

121
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.210
whether it's veganism or or,
or,

122
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.240
or whether it's weather factory farming or whether it's a large scale dairy

123
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:11.660
farms where they mistreat their cows or the chicken farms are all these

124
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:16.550
different factory farms where they treat these animals not as a living being,

125
00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:20.360
but as a commodity.
Then it becomes a giant problem.
But if you look at guys like,

126
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:24.740
do you know Joel Salitan is no,
Joel Salitan is a very fascinating guy.

127
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:30.100
He runs a farm called Polyface farms and what he has essentially done is made

128
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.460
large scale animal agriculture possible in a humane and very natural way.

129
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.600
He has enormous electric fences that he uses for his pigs and he just moves them

130
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:46.490
around,
moves the fences around.

131
00:07:46.491 --> 00:07:50.660
So the pigs wander around his a huge rolling chicken coop.
I mean,

132
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:54.800
it's fucking huge.
And he pushes that thing around.
He moves it to a new space,

133
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.590
the chickens go out,
they wander around and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

134
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.500
They do the chicken thing and they go right back into the chicken house and this

135
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:03.360
is where it gets the eggs from.
This is how they raise chickens.

136
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.600
This is how they raise cattle,
does that,

137
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:07.430
they do it with all these different animals.

138
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:12.140
And His perspective on all this is that if you've,

139
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:16.310
if you do it right,
it's not horrific.
It's not an evil thing.

140
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.910
And that these animals are living the way they've,
they're,
they're meant to live.

141
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:20.773
Right.

142
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:21.400
<v 1>That's one.</v>

143
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.360
That's one of the things that we do at Antler is t is to find those farmers and

144
00:08:25.361 --> 00:08:29.170
guys like that.
One of the farms we get our deer from,
they have thousand acres.

145
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:30.700
The deer roam as they pleased.

146
00:08:30.701 --> 00:08:34.660
They're eating nuts and apples and acorns and grass and everything they're

147
00:08:34.661 --> 00:08:38.060
supposed to eat.
Uh,
and then when it's time,
they're,

148
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.260
they're collected and harvested.
And that,
that is where we get our meat from.

149
00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:45.220
And we try really hard not to buy from these facts.

150
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.530
We don't serve chicken,
beef,
or pork.

151
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:52.150
We have bison pheasant duck a wellbore because,
you know,

152
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.000
these game farms,
they don't have these massive,

153
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.020
large scale operations and eye buy direct from the farmer.

154
00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:01.680
And they can tell me what their diet is,
you know,
uh,
would,
they're good months,

155
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:02.280
they're bad months.

156
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.180
We know all about these animals that we're bringing to the restaurant.
And,
um,

157
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.840
and,
you know,
we're really proud of that.

158
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.550
<v 2>Okay.
Okay.</v>
