1
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.700
Four three,
two,
one.

2
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.620
And we're live Mr. Roth as live,

3
00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:17.570
as live will ever possibly get on the intergrade international.
Good to see man.

4
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:21.800
You really do look great.
You look healthy,
you look vibrant.
You look surprised.

5
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.970
No surprise.
I've,
I haven't been to sleep since the late eighties.

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.530
I didn't miss a thing,
but I'm a little groggy,
but I'm good to go in my job.

7
00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:34.040
You expect Desta dissipation and illness rights,
you know,

8
00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:35.910
kind of goes along with you.

9
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.180
You expect a disintegration in my kind of job.

10
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.320
But Lemmy from Motorhead style,
um,

11
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.140
do you know the term Wabisabi do you know what that is?
No.

12
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.950
Wabisabi is Japanese term.
That succinctly put means that,

13
00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:53.420
which is perfect cause it's a little fucked up.
Uh,
your favorite jeans.
Very well.

14
00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:55.940
This is like a Patina on an old car.

15
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.250
The Guitar player in the rolling stones.
Very,
oh,
of us up.
Yes.
Yes.

16
00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:05.360
He's very Wabisabi.
Yeah.
New York City,
for example.

17
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:09.230
The old bit starts to fall apart right next to the new,

18
00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:13.550
that's part of the beauty.
They're your favorite leather jacket.
Is that,

19
00:01:13.551 --> 00:01:17.960
can you expect that to increase?
But,
uh,
I dunno,

20
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.250
I'm not really an athlete.

21
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.110
I don't really train 'em kind of a singer who always traded his celebrity to,

22
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.520
you know,
hey,
show me how you do that and how many times should I lift this?
And,

23
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.900
uh,
what happens if I fall off of this going this fast?
But you used to train,

24
00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:35.420
right?
You used to,
didn't you train with Benny or Kitezh oh yeah.

25
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.190
I went through a martial arts the first time.
Um,

26
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.530
let me go back.
Okay.

27
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.190
I lived in student housing up until I was just about a teenager.
Okay.

28
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:50.660
And it was a time when you bought one paint brush at a time.
Okay.

29
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.350
And most of my values come from that public library.

30
00:01:54.351 --> 00:01:59.351
I learned to swim at a public swimming pool and my dad finished medical school.

31
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.010
Okay.
I happened,
I wasn't planned in the 50s that happened a lot.

32
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.120
And uh,
so we had a lot,

33
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:13.010
a lot of patients who were kind of on the periphery of Pasadena,

34
00:02:13.011 --> 00:02:16.490
California,
which is where we came.
Okay.
I was born in Indiana.

35
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:20.450
I lived in Massachusetts.
He was a resident grow up around the hospitals.

36
00:02:20.451 --> 00:02:25.160
Dinner meant going to the hospital,
meet Dad,
you know,
and when we came out to la,

37
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.430
the Japanese were kind of peripheral Spanish speaking people.

38
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.450
Curiously enough,

39
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.800
you know the running story w was that there were six Spanish speaking people at

40
00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:40.970
Ucla and three of them were in gardening.
No,
really?

41
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.550
That went back in the 60s that was the case today.
Easily,
you know,

42
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.210
massive amounts of percentages of [inaudible] Bunuel Tom.
Hey,
okay.

43
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.040
It's not a second language.

44
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.070
It's kind of the first in half now things have really changed a mental and I

45
00:02:58.191 --> 00:03:02.880
grew up in those.
Okay.
So I can gang sign the whole alphabet.
Can you really?

46
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.950
Yeah.
I have two low riders.
I've got a really,

47
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:10.690
well I got a 51 mercury that's chap drop low and slow.
Do you drive it?

48
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.470
Oh yeah.
I got a 66 v Dub bug with a Chevy engine.

49
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:18.400
A three 83 up in the front or Denali is he and I couldn't.
Oh my gosh,

50
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.600
you gotta roll your Rs.
Is He horn?
Allie?

51
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.200
What did he drive those things?
No,
we drive them all around,
you know,
it's,

52
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.630
it's southern California of course is different.

53
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.410
A lot of you are listening in with five layers and gone,
hey fuck,

54
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.700
I'm not driving anywhere for the next three days according to the weather map,

55
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.530
you know.
But uh,
here for example,
it's tee shirt,
weather.
So you know,

56
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:46.060
the great outdoors means,
how's that sound over the headphones?

57
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.060
It sounds like an engine.
Yup.
Yeah.

58
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.060
But I always trip the first time I ever,

59
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.680
we were just a plan with a sword there.
And that's not a summarize story.

60
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.100
That's like calling a nine millimeter a police gun.
Yeah,

61
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:04.490
it kind of is because they used,
but that's a Catana.
Right.

62
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.130
And we were playing with that a little bit.
First Time somebody handed me those,

63
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:12.550
we were at the Buddhist temple in Pasadena 19.
You Bet.

64
00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:17.551
I remember 1965 and there was a demonstration of the Japanese culture.

65
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:23.530
Thank you.
And a fella came out and demonstrated,

66
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.440
I thought,
oh,
and you know,
there's sort of arts and stuff.
And then he,
she said,

67
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.290
I'm going to take somebody from the audience,

68
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.530
and my dad pushed me and I walked out in the middle of that floor and held it

69
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.480
here.
Hold that sort.
It just like you said,
wow.

70
00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:42.481
That's what does that 100 year olds or it's from the 15 hundreds years whammo

71
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.000
mood Hamachi or something like this.
First Time I held that story,

72
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.520
it was like out of a graphic novel,
lightning

73
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.750
and as a ma,
it's Japanese for lightening.

74
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.240
Careful what you show your kids Joe.
Wow.
