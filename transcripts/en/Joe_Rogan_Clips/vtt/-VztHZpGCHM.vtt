1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.800
Did you say infinity?
That's only a mathematical idea.

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.270
Yeah,
I mean how can anything be infinite?
I mean I know,

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.790
well there's a make mini math.
You can say it.

4
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:15.480
Like you can say that a straight line goes on forever and two parallel lines

5
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.880
will never intersect.
Pi Is there theoretically,

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.490
but you know it never ends well.

7
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:24.540
Why is that difficult to grasp though?
That's the real question.

8
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:25.530
Like why is,

9
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.590
why do we need everything to be defined by a very obvious beginning and an end?

10
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.190
Cause it's in everything we experienced has the beginning of that biologically

11
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.190
because we expand this time.
Time doesn't,

12
00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:42.450
is not experienced everywhere the same way.
Well time is experienced at all.

13
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:45.780
If you're not sentient true Arizona,

14
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.870
they're whacking off.
It's different.
But yeah,
it's the,

15
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.300
I always wondered if like there was a reason why we wanted things to have a

16
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:55.290
beginning and an end.

17
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.430
Like is it because we have our life and our life has a beginning and an end all

18
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:03.420
the lives of the people we know or we definitely,
but you have to eat,

19
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.350
are obsessed with it.

20
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.740
We want to be the beginning or an end or are we terrified of beginnings and ends

21
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.670
thought too.
That's why we create,
you know,

22
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.380
God's and religions is because the idea that that life ends and that it's all

23
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:20.700
been for nothing.
It was terrifying to people.
There's a little bit of that.
Yeah.

24
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.870
There's a little bit of like doing it to create order in the community and

25
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:28.610
there's a little bit of people find mushrooms and they need an explanation to

26
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.850
fuck their feelings.
Brains are constructed in such a way that we need an end.

27
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.870
Yeah.
Or else you don't understand.
Why am I now I have,
there's no end.
My,

28
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.740
uh,
very uninformed theory,
which is that

29
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.100
first off that everything is meaningless but that only the brain damaged are

30
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:50.580
capable of conceiving of meaninglessness.

31
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.280
Cause our brains are meaning machines.

32
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.600
And that we evolved and it gave us an evolutionary advantage that we give

33
00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:00.570
meaning to things.
Like I said,
this is a table because we say it's a table.

34
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.280
It's not a table to a cat.

35
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.650
That's why cat will just get up and walk around on it from a mutual agreement.

36
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.150
We agree this is a table and that kind of meaning let us organize our lives,

37
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:17.100
let us be better hunters.
Uh,
you know what?
You know it constantly,

38
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.360
it occurs to me and bothers me,

39
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:22.230
is that we decide not to drive into each other because we've painted a little

40
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:27.030
line on a road in the middle.
Yeah.
We've all agreed not to cross that line.

41
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.531
That's what I'm say.

42
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:31.500
We ascribe meaning to objects and that gave us an advantage over other animals.

43
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.170
And so our brains just evolved.

44
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.290
And then when we got to the point where we realized we're going to die,
we go,

45
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:39.270
well,
there's gotta be some meaning there too.

46
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.860
So then we had to create myths that where do we go created meeting about our

47
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:44.670
lives?

48
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.050
That's a very dangerous loop of there's no meaning to everything and nothing has

49
00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:52.200
no mean nothing has meaning that that's a dangerous loop for a person

50
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:56.610
psychologically because you can get stuck in that and you can really,

51
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.830
but I don't think you can because it's impossible to,

52
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.140
of unless you are seriously brain damaged.
Well,
no,

53
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:05.770
I don't think it's impossible to conceive.
It's,
it's you won't,
you can imagine,

54
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:08.950
you can intellectually think about it,
but you can't,
you can't grasp it.

55
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:13.140
Really living in the now kind of the same as life has no meaning.
No.

56
00:03:13.141 --> 00:03:15.670
Cause you're not often sing about the future.
You're not thinking about,

57
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.390
you're not thinking about the fact that it has no meaning.

58
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.380
You're enjoying life,
you're enjoying experience.

59
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.950
You're enjoying each interaction with people and enjoying your thoughts.

60
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.950
I think the,
the.
