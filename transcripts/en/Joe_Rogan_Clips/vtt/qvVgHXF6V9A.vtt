00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.360
Hello Freak bitches.
Listen,
the fucking,

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.200
the NBA had that mobbed up ref and he said that he fucked the warriors out and I

3
00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:11.230
mean the,
uh,
the kings out of that series against the Lakers.

4
00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:14.560
No one's going to take the fucking Lakers title away for that year.
Really?

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.670
Is that real?
Yeah.
What is it?
He was a referee.
Who's fucking fixing games?

6
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.200
Yup.
Really?
That's how much you don't watch.

7
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.330
<v 1>No,
it was fit him Donna.</v>

8
00:00:25.331 --> 00:00:29.310
He 100% of NBA refs gamble.
What,

9
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.653
what?

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.350
<v 0>But he's also like,
he's in jail now.
He's just trying to say shit,</v>

11
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:37.680
but like I know this is the guy that was the rough that was in jail.
Yeah,

12
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.010
but like he,
he sat him right there.
Yeah.
He fixed gay.

13
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:42.660
He used to say from in jail.
He goes,

14
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:44.880
you tell me who was reffing the game and I'll tell you who wins.

15
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.011
<v 1>Wow.</v>

16
00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:50.090
He spent 15 months in prison after pleading guilty of two charges of case he's

17
00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:51.980
out freedom.
How much do you think he made?

18
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.940
He joined Callen Co Colin Cowherd,

19
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.870
Wednesday afternoon had a fascinating answer when asked what percentage?

20
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.170
He said 100 wow,
that's,
no,
nope,
no,
not true.

21
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.120
That's just the fucking jail bird talk at.

22
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.380
I used to gamble on UFC fights way back in the early days when I first started

23
00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:16.190
working for them.
I was like,
who gives a shit?
I can't really affect the outcome.

24
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.280
So like in many,
many years ago,
like I would,
they would,

25
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.450
they'd bring in these guys,

26
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.530
like they'd bring in some guy from like Brazil that I knew about and I would

27
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:27.260
look at the line and I'm like,
you guys are out of your fucking mind.

28
00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:30.650
This guy should be like a 10 to one favorite and you got them at an underdog.

29
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.560
I'm like,
Ooh,
I'm putting some money on that.
And I'd put some money on it.

30
00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:36.620
But then after awhile it's like,
this is probably not smart.
You know?

31
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:39.860
I don't think it's illegal because I can't stop it for the company.
No.

32
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.300
It's also not good for me if I come off as biased anyway.
You know,

33
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.860
I've been accused of being a biased commentator anyway.
Even worse,
he tap out,

34
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.540
c'mon,
c'mon.
Yeah.
But,

35
00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:56.570
um,
that's a,
that's a different kind of thing though.

36
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.970
Gambling when you're a referee is a big deal.

37
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.920
<v 0>Yeah.
And that's a game that's easily fixed.
How do they fix it?
What do they do?</v>

38
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.750
Because you can,
you can take stars out of the game by giving them files.
Oh,

39
00:02:07.751 --> 00:02:10.410
is that what they did?
Yeah.
Mobbed up guy.

40
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.910
Just you just sit people down.

41
00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:15.550
It's just like if you're the best player on the team and the first quarter I

42
00:02:15.551 --> 00:02:16.810
give you two quick fouls,

43
00:02:16.811 --> 00:02:20.050
I'm not going to see you again until the second quarter.

44
00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:23.320
And I've never fixed a fucking game.
But I mean,
I'm just,
you know,
I'm just,

45
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.540
I give you another one in the second quarter.

46
00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:28.960
I don't see it til the next half and at some point you're going to get mad if I

47
00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:30.130
keep calling bullshit files,

48
00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:35.131
I might get you in a technical foul that saves me a ticky tack file that counts

49
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.190
towards your files.
And then two files,
two tacticals,
you're out of the game.

50
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.070
You're objected.
So was it obvious that this guy was doing files?

51
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.520
That it was great because the NBA was kind of fixed for a while.

52
00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:48.460
Like I was sitting going like,
yeah,
I just,
I went to a game,
what time?

53
00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:51.850
The Celtics First Utah Jazz and I'm watching the fucking game and like,

54
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.800
just like the game starts that letting them play and then they call it a tight

55
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:57.810
and then they're letting them play.

56
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.120
Then they call and a tight and it's like there was never an ebb and flow and how

57
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:03.880
they will call in the game.
It's like a,
an umpire,
you know,

58
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:06.040
you've seen the first day and it got to step out of the box going,
okay,

59
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:09.400
that's a strike tonight.
Okay,
cool.
Just finding out where you strike zone is.

60
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.490
But like an umpire,
if you start changing the strike zone,

61
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.700
kind of change in sports on your hair.

62
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.980
But it's like people are going to know like what the fuck's going on?

63
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.910
You gotta be consistent.
So like with um,
NBA reps,
we,

64
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:23.770
NBA Games,
you would watch and it's just like,
oh,

65
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:27.610
they're calling it close tonight.
Oh,
he's letting the boys play.
And like,

66
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:30.070
that was the game.
They wouldn't just keep,

67
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.220
obviously if it got really out of hand,
they would tighten down.

68
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:35.980
But I never saw a game where it was just like you're pulling back on the range,

69
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:37.990
you letting them run,
you pull it back,
you letting them run.

70
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.660
And it just made me feel like they were shaving points of something.

71
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:44.260
I'm a for years,
I said the game was fixed and um,

72
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.420
everybody said I was out of my fucking mind.

73
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:50.350
And then they find a guy who's all mobbed up and I go,
damn vindication.
They go,

74
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.333
oh,
it's just one guy.

75
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.520
<v 1>Now when you say mobbed up,
like how was he mobbed up?
What was,</v>

76
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.470
what was the issue with darker?
I just an expression,

77
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:57.730
I don't want to get in trouble with anybody,

78
00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:01.960
but he was basically working for other people that were part of a gambling that

79
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:04.240
took,
uh,
you know,
bookie.
So whatever.
Right.

80
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.420
And he did something to make sure that the,

81
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.150
the game leaned in that direction.
Like you couldn't totally fix it.
Yeah.

82
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.080
<v 0>So if a team was favored by eight and they want him to win by eight,</v>

83
00:04:15.081 --> 00:04:16.250
he'd make sure it happened are probably,

84
00:04:16.251 --> 00:04:20.150
it's probably easier to make sure they didn't buy fucking over there on offense

85
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.560
and then they would just,
you know,
they try to get money,
like,
look,

86
00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:25.730
if you're a legit bookie,

87
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.200
all you're trying to do is get an even amount of money on each side.
Okay.

88
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.130
Because with the combination of people tease in it and plus the juice and all of

89
00:04:34.131 --> 00:04:35.960
that,
you're going to end up on top.

90
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.260
You don't want a bunch of money all on one side and losing your fucking shirt.

91
00:04:39.261 --> 00:04:43.100
So what these guys would do is you get greedy after awhile.
It's like,

92
00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:46.160
I'm sick of this ticky tack Shit.
Let's go for a big fucking score.

93
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.670
And they wouldn't do it every game.
They just,
every once in a while be like,

94
00:04:49.671 --> 00:04:53.990
all right,
listen,
here's a game.
Probably,
you know,
I don't,
I don't know.

95
00:04:53.991 --> 00:04:55.250
I've never fixed the fucking game.

96
00:04:55.251 --> 00:04:58.760
I'm just guessing how they would go about doing it to fix this one.
All right.

97
00:04:58.761 --> 00:05:00.520
Make sure these guys don't win by.

98
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.580
<v 1>So this guy had meant that he fixed it.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.</v>

99
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:06.910
He went to was somebody went to jail for gambling on it.
Right.

100
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.540
But I went to jail phones fixing her,
fixing it.
So what,
what did he say?

101
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:14.210
He said like he made files that weren't really fouls.
Well,
yeah,
yeah.

102
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.380
You do whatever he had to do.
This is what it is.
Uh,

103
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:21.750
attorneys submitted saying the manipulation that happened during one game.
Okay.

104
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.240
So it was officiating a playoff series between team five and team six in May of

105
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:29.800
2002 as a six game of a seven game series and a team five victory that night

106
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:30.880
would have ended the series.
However,

107
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:35.590
Tim learned from referee a that referees a and f wanted to extend the series of

108
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:40.300
seven games.
Tim knew referees a and F to B company,
men in quotes,
uh,

109
00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:42.370
always acting in the interest of the NBA.

110
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.550
And that night it was in the NBA is interest add another game.

111
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:49.820
So the NBA wanted to fix it.
Yeah.
Follow the NBA,
fixing referees.

112
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.840
A and F heavily favored team.

113
00:05:51.841 --> 00:05:56.530
Six personal fouls resulting in obviously injured players were ignored even when

114
00:05:56.531 --> 00:05:58.160
they occurred.
Full view of the referees.

115
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.821
<v 0>Conversely,</v>

116
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:03.821
the referees called made up fouls on team the highlights of the Lakers kings

117
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.590
game.
It was ridiculous.
The files that they will come,

118
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:09.050
but that's my thing is when they said it was just one guy,

119
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:13.820
it's like how long could you be on an officiating crew while the in one of your

120
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:18.230
guys is dirty before you'd realize like what the fuck is this guy doing?
Well,

121
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:20.390
what about the guys that we're betting on the other team?

122
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:24.590
I'd want to kill that fucking referee.
You imagine if you saw him call fouls,

123
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:26.720
it weren't really fouls and [inaudible] was going on.

124
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:28.130
You knew your money was going out the window,

125
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.640
but I think they're really susceptible to it because like the amount of money

126
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:35.090
that NBA players make us fucking insane,
right?
They make like,

127
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.260
you know some of the contracts that they have coming up in this and so does so

128
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:44.261
few guys on the team and there's like every year the draft is like two rounds in

129
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:46.490
the draft.

130
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.490
Like fucking NFL goes on forever is 40 something guys on a team in the NFL.

131
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:55.100
There's 20 something in baseball,
20 something in,
uh,

132
00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.410
in the NHL.
And I think,
I think basketball,
it's no more than 11 or 12 guys.

133
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:06.130
So it's a very small group of people and the income that they're generating,

134
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.970
like their revenue share,
I don't know how I,
like,

135
00:07:08.971 --> 00:07:11.150
it's all that's all like super sports nerd shit.
Like,

136
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:13.670
I don't know how that works,
but some of the contracts that they,

137
00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:15.170
that some of these guys have been signed in and like,

138
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:17.270
they can afford to fucking pay that guy that.

139
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.430
So now you're a ref and you're running with your fucking black aerobic Reebok

140
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:26.840
sneakers up and down the court,
you know the Velcade.
Yeah.

141
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.650
Yes.

142
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.610
And just seeing the cars these guys are getting in and all the women hanging out

143
00:07:31.611 --> 00:07:34.280
and you're on the stage two,
you're running up and down.

144
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.580
No one gives a fuck about you.
And A,

145
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:41.480
I dunno what the pension is for the NBA,
but like if I was in the NBA,

146
00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:44.870
I w if I was running I'd be like,
we gotta fucking triple these guys' salary.

147
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.790
Is this the salaries of the players of the referees NBA player salaries for

148
00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:51.350
right.
What about the referees though?
So look at that.

149
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.980
35 million a year for Lebron.
That's just,

150
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.510
that's just what he makes the play hoop,
right?
Not about like most of,

151
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.310
most of the sneaker contracts are like more than what they make.

152
00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:05.680
It's fucking nuts.
It's nuts.
It's a lot of cash.
Good for them.
I'm not,

153
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.550
I'm not like saying they should make the money.

154
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:09.640
Obviously if people are putting it out there earning the phone,

155
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.120
but like it can you put up what a ref makes.
Do you know who Mike Conley is?

156
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.411
That's what's hilarious.

157
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:19.800
I only know like the biggest guys at that Mike Kahn who that's my Conley.

158
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.530
Who fucks.
I don't know who that is.
Either.

159
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.610
Guy made $30 million last year was the highest paid player in the NBA.

160
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.760
He says because the contract is a guy named Mike Conley.
Yeah,
he was,

161
00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:33.050
he's the starting point guard for the Memphis Grizzlies.
Yeah.
Oh,
there you go.

162
00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:34.010
Let's find that amount of time.

163
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:37.430
Like his contract came up at the time last year and the uh,

164
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.850
when the rest of the guys are going to get more of this coming year and the

165
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:41.060
following year,

166
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.450
the TV contracts have gone up and there's a percentage of their going up each

167
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:45.980
year based off of the TV rights.

168
00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:49.220
And that's why I watched almost every Celtic game last year.

169
00:08:49.221 --> 00:08:53.660
I never heard my con,
my con,
that sounds like a fucking politician.

170
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.600
Which Ohio State Samuel was Greg Oden who was that big bust and he was just a

171
00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:59.760
point guard.
Is he still playing in China or no?
No,

172
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:02.160
he's a actually Ohio state assistant coach right now.

173
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:05.370
He went back to school for playing in China.
That's when it gets weird.
Right.

174
00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:08.760
And you got to go overseas to Europe and you playing for a hundred grand a year

175
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.650
and you're like,
Ooh,
I don't know.
Sometimes if you're famous enough,
they'll,

176
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.680
they'll give you a little more.
I don't know how that works either.

177
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.540
I don't know how to,
a lot of shit works.

178
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:17.800
I just know I have a show coming out called F sister's family.

179
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.800
That's why I'm here.
The average salary,

180
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:23.880
that'd be a reference from 150 grand to 550 grand.
That's a big spread.

181
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.070
What about the guy who was making the extra four?

182
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:31.100
How's he getting an extra four average salaries of spike considerably since 1983

183
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.970
when NBA officials may between 18,070 8,000 each season.

184
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.510
550 grand is not bad.
That's a lot of scratch.

185
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.410
So you'd have to give them enough money where they don't feel tempted to cheat.

186
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.850
Right?
Yeah.
That's the problem with politicians,
right?

187
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.630
You make 550 grand a year,
you're making 50 grand a year more than the president.

188
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.170
So you kind of like,
those guys are like set up to be like,

189
00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:59.730
here's a job that cost 100 million to get and you're going to get paid 500
grant.

190
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.060
So could you just setting them up to have to cut deals with people.

191
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:13.200
<v 2>Okay.</v>
