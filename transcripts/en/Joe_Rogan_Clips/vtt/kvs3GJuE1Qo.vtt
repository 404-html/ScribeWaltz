1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.540
Well,
he's so hard to hit to San Chai is just so elusive.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.490
Why wouldn't someone like him end up in a UFC fight?

3
00:00:06.491 --> 00:00:09.030
He doesn't know how to fight on the ground.
I mean,
that's all it is.

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.710
It's just pin him with another standup guy.
Ah,
if they were smart,
yeah,

5
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:16.700
that would be the smart thing to do.
But I mean,

6
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.690
they're not going to put cm punk and gets another ground guy,
are Ya?
Right.
Well,

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.680
cm punk.
Yeah,
that would be a disaster.
Cm punk.

8
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.980
The whole thing was everybody's like,
I could do it.
You know,
you watch cm punk,

9
00:00:27.981 --> 00:00:30.240
you like,
fuck,
I'll fucking fight.
Like Yo,

10
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.370
I guarantee you Sam Sam punks probably a lot tougher than the average guy
anyway.

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.770
I mean,
I don't know.
I don't know fighting,
but you know,

12
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.590
if you would in the average fighter,
no,
nothing average fighter,

13
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.130
but maybe the average guy in a bar.
Right?
Cm punk is a real nice guy.

14
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.980
And I don't want to say anything bad about them because I mean the guy gave it

15
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:50.240
his all.
He really did.
Totally,
totally dedicated.
I don't have any of the banks,

16
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.350
some humble pie and he was totally cool about it.

17
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.440
He was in these cool about it the first time and he was cool about the second

18
00:00:55.441 --> 00:01:00.240
time.
Yeah,
he's a real good guy,
but he doesn't have what I would call talent.

19
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.770
The skill he says moves wrong.
He doesn't see him against him.

20
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:06.310
Mickey Golar came in and just went,
you know,

21
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.800
over the top and he was probably so nervous to never being in that situation of

22
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:13.500
a real flight.
I mean he's been in front of the crowds,

23
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:17.220
but that was a nightmare that Micky gall fight was so ridiculous.

24
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:20.970
Micky gall is fucking good.
He's really good.
He's fucking dangerous.

25
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.430
And to have a guy like cm punk that doesn't have a back,

26
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.610
it's not like Brock Lesnar.
Brock Lesnar came to the UFC.

27
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:30.720
He was a nice champion as a wrestler.
He's a fucking gorilla as a human being,

28
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.310
just a freak athlete.

29
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.220
Cm punk is a regular guy like he's not.
There's nothing freaky about him.

30
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.770
He doesn't have crazy power or weird speed.
You don't see him and go,

31
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:44.050
that guy looks super scary for a guy his size,
right?

32
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.550
I mean there's guys that don't look like sand.

33
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:51.550
Shy himself does not look like a freak.
Freaky,
so freaky.

34
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.690
But when you see him,
he looks pretty,
he looks like an athlete,

35
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:56.000
but he doesn't look like it.

36
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.340
It's not like Roy Jones Jr and his prime or something.
When you see him,

37
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:02.880
he's just go,
Jesus,
look at this fucking guy.
He was just,
I mean,

38
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:05.160
he's just so good.
But a guy like cm punk,

39
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.530
he didn't have a background and he tried martial arts when he was like 30 so he

40
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:14.940
had no background,
not really even wrestling back.
He didn't even wrestle.

41
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.800
It was all theatrical wrestling.
It was all entertainment.
You know?

42
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.050
You would think though that those guys would even,
even the theatrical wrestling,

43
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:25.350
they would go and work on the skill like day in,

44
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:27.840
day out when that's all you have to be as a wrestler,
right?

45
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:30.870
This is such a difference,
but you can work on the scale day in,
day out,

46
00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:33.480
and then work on the skill when someone doesn't want you to do it to them.
Yeah,

47
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.440
that's the thing.

48
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.280
And then when they're trying to do things to you like just fucking you up and

49
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:41.400
just nothing you can do about it in your mouth.
Breathing,

50
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.050
you're mad about phrasing,
everything's wrong.
But I mean,

51
00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:49.710
I'm sure he made a ton of money and he,
oh,
he tested himself.
The Guy,

52
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.440
I mean give the guy some credit.
He tell he really did test himself.

53
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.380
I think it was a good thing for,

54
00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.120
for Dana and everyone to see too,
like,
oh,
okay,
we're not going to do that.

55
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.790
Let's just not,

56
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.230
let's not put someone in that position that's not put ourselves in that
position.

57
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.510
But they were talking about like Logan,
Paul Logan,

58
00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:10.000
Paul fighting in the UFC and he was like Logan Paul and get killed.

59
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.900
Logan Paul is fucking way better,

60
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.520
way better than cm punk.
Logan Paul like actually knows how to fight.

61
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.040
He had a boxing match with that other Youtube Guy,

62
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.430
but I was watching him throw punches in that fight.
I'm like,

63
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.240
this is a guy who actually knows how to punch.
Like kids punches look good.

64
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.810
He gassed out.
He got a little tired first real fight like that,

65
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:35.500
but he has a background in wrestling and he,
he actually can punch.

66
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.480
Like I was watching him punched this guy.
I was like,

67
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:41.290
that's a guy who actually knows how to throw punches.
He now he knows how to,

68
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.970
he knows distance and timing.

69
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:46.600
He knows how to connect and he doesn't look like Canelo Alvarez or anything

70
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:47.081
crazy,

71
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:49.450
but he looks like a guy who can actually punch in where you can give them a

72
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:52.150
break on it.
But Dana is like,
you know,
have him fight in the UFC would be,

73
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:55.870
he would get killed like fucking cm punk fight.

74
00:03:55.871 --> 00:04:00.250
This guy is way better than him.
He really has a background in fighting.
