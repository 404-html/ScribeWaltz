00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.920
You know,
uh,
when I was in high school,
well not high school,

2
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:08.910
I guess it was in a great school.
So what does 11 what grade is that?

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.270
Depends on how smart you are.
Really.
Fifth Grade.
Yeah.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.050
Depends on how smart you are.
You know what I was reading his out crate.

5
00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:19.950
Ronan Farrow,
you know Woody Allen and I'm the guy wrote that article.
Yeah.
Yeah.

6
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.550
He's not really woody Allen's kid.
By the way.
Look at that kid.

7
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:28.020
Look at Frank Sinatra.
Holla at your boy.
Hello Joe.
Boy,

8
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.800
that kid is Frank Sinatra's kid.

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.860
One thousand one million percent.

10
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.750
Cause me and Farrell used to bang Frank Sinatra.
Oh really?
They had a freak.
Look,

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.890
I know.
Look,
come on.
Get the fuck Outta here.
Look at it.

12
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.440
First of all,
handsome men.
That Ronan Farrow handsome man.

13
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.540
Yeah,
that is God dammit.
That is frank fucking Sinatra's kid.

14
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.670
1 billion trillion percent.

15
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.910
You better stay the fuck away from 23 and me cause they'll out that.
Yeah,

16
00:00:59.911 --> 00:01:03.390
look at that one and route 23 in meal.
Just send back the song.
New York,

17
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:07.110
New York when he was 11.
This,
how smart this guy is.

18
00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:11.850
When he was 11 he was taking college courses.
Oh my God.
11 nerd alert.

19
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.240
That's what I read.
Makes sure that's true.
I don't want to,

20
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.750
I don't want to write an article about me.
It's a bit of bad information,

21
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.140
but so they had a freak relationship anyway when they were together.

22
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.690
That was their only biological kid and it's not really their biological kid.

23
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.110
Why not?
Because it's fucking Frank Sinatra's kid.

24
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.410
Sarah was started college at age 11 wow.

25
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.400
He says he fell apart while pursuing the Harvey Weinstein Story.
Whoa.

26
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.330
What do you mean he fell apart?
Probably because it was so dark.
Oh saying,

27
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.620
come on man.
Do you remember before that story came out,

28
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.070
everybody knew that guy was a creep.
Right.
But it was like this thing about like,

29
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:52.770
like more door,
you know,
like he lives,
you know,

30
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.270
lived in Soran lives under the rock somewhere.
Everybody knew he was a creep.
You,

31
00:01:57.271 --> 00:02:02.130
everybody had heard stories,
but this guy,
he graduated at 15 from college.

32
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.990
Oh my God.

33
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.540
Why does it keeps saying the son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen?

34
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.020
It should say wink,
wink,
nudge,
nudge.
But that's crazy though.

35
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.850
They're trying to push that so much.

36
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:16.860
You know this son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen?

37
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.260
Well he was raised by them for a little while until what?

38
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.690
He started banging his sister.
I'm like,
God,
yeah,
that's a freak household.

39
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.560
And then they're out here.
Hollywood's got the darkest arts,
Bro.

40
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.920
They lived in New York.
Well even New York.
Hollywood.

41
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.830
Cause some of it's the same thing.
New York,
Hollywood,

42
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.710
Hollywood is just show business.
Yeah,
show business.
That's what I mean.

43
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.520
Well there's definitely something to that cause how about that composer that

44
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:45.450
turned out to be even more of a fucking asshole than Harvey Weinstein.

45
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.590
This is one composer that was just fucking all these young boys and if you

46
00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:52.260
didn't fuck him and they just,
they recently got rid of him,

47
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.330
but he was just running things through sex and you know,

48
00:02:57.331 --> 00:03:00.670
he just basically had a sex cult going on.
Find out who the fuck that guy was.

49
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.200
But he was a cherished,
famous loved composer.

50
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.760
And it turned out this,

51
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:09.520
this dude was just running the freak show behind the sturdy,

52
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.870
just not just being dirty,

53
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:14.020
but that was the way to get in and if this guy shut you down,

54
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.330
you were shut down forever.
You weren't working anymore.
