00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.170
And you see people of great age with like they look,

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.220
they're just ripped and you look at what they're eating,
like fish,
rice,

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.420
vegetables,
and it's all lean,
smart food.

4
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:17.070
And the sugars are all,
uh,
monosaccharides,
like fruit,
sugar,

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.720
you know,
the occasional banana or orange is a treat.
But you know,

6
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:26.260
the sugar is really not in the Diet at all.
Maybe Rice should be,

7
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.770
you know,
but not like we are doing it.
No.
Now,
no one's ever done it my,

8
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.690
the way we were doing it and no one's ever been as fat,
you know.

9
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:37.350
And then we have these things to shield people from,
we call it fat shaming,

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.681
you know,

11
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:41.970
don't tell someone their fat and let them just be morbidly obese and go through

12
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:46.470
life at a massive risk of heart attack or stroke or diabetes.

13
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.630
Don't say anything because then you'll hurt their feelings.
And while you,

14
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.850
you could say something to someone and it might be uncomfortable in the moment

15
00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:56.610
of,
Hey Mike,
um,
listen,
I don't want to be that guy,

16
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.900
but you got to lose some weight.

17
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.810
And then that guy could go and look in the mirror and go,
fuck,

18
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.430
I really do need to lose some weight.

19
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.610
And then they'll lose some weight and there'll be healthy and they'll talk to

20
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:08.400
you four or five months later and go,
you know,
you fucked my head up that day.

21
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.331
And because of that,

22
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:12.240
I really started changing the way I eat and I'm so much healthier and I feel

23
00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:15.930
better.
And because he's your friend,
my friend Tom Seger and,
and Bert Kreischer,

24
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.840
they did this thing last year,
well,
two years ago where they did,

25
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.510
they had a weight loss competition.
And uh,

26
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.680
one of the things they kept doing is fat shame each other like ruthlessly.

27
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.280
And they would use Hashtag bird is fat,
Hashtag Thomas Fat.

28
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.890
And they had this weight loss competition.
Oh.

29
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.970
And they fucking both laws a shitload of weight.

30
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.150
I think they both lost between 50 and 60 pounds and they looked fucking

31
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:43.620
incredible.
But then after it was over,
Tom was like,
dude,

32
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:47.760
let me tell you something.
Fat Shaming works.
It works.
It got me off my ass.

33
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:52.080
I realized I was a fat fuck.
And it made me lose weight.
It doesn't feel good.

34
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.640
That shaming thing is you like fat shaming doesn't work on people weren't fat.

35
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.300
Okay,

36
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.650
it works on people who have a problem but don't want to address that problem.

37
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:03.960
So you bring up that problem and then they go,
oh,

38
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:08.700
you're making me feel bad by thinking about my problem.
You're a bad person.
No,

39
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:13.080
you have a weak spot.
That weak spot shouldn't be there.
I've got it.
Shouldn't,

40
00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:16.170
you shouldn't Belabor it and constantly ridicule someone for being fat.

41
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.140
But the idea that you're never supposed to bring it up,

42
00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:23.390
even with someone you care about,
even in jest or friends busting balls like,
no,

43
00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:27.330
no,
no.
You should bring it up because that,
that bad feeling is a gift.

44
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.150
It makes you realize like,
Oh my God,
I've been remiss.

45
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.930
I haven't been paying attention to my own physical sovereignty.
You know,

46
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:37.590
I have control over what goes in my body.
I have control over the,
the,

47
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:41.490
the amount of calories I take in the kind of calories I have control over how

48
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:45.450
much body fat I'm carrying around and there's ways to fix it.
Yeah,

49
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.960
I think you should,
uh,
use discretion.
Yes.

50
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:52.840
And she got in line at the supermarket and to sue people you'd like,

51
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.420
you know,
it's just,
but it was funny to hear Tom,
he was getting angry.

52
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.210
He's like fucking fat shaming man.
All these people that say don't fat shame.

53
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:06.010
Fuck.
That's how I got skinny fat shaming works until you know.
But you know,

54
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.061
again,
yes,

55
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:10.300
don't be rude to someone out in public for no reason to drive an 11 year old to

56
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:12.000
suicide.
Definitely don't do that.

57
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.180
Well there are little kids is the worst cause like their parents will get them

58
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:20.230
hooked on those sugary sodas and once it's the God damn sodas man,

59
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.500
I mean that is one of the primary causes for people being fat in this country.

60
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:26.950
And it just seems so innocuous.
It's just an a class,
I'll just drink this.

61
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.760
It's got some ice cubes.
No big deal goes down so fast,
tastes great.

62
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:33.220
And the weekends,
um,
I,

63
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.660
I like ginger beer and that the Bundaberg,

64
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.590
it's this same power as a coke.
I mean,
it's a lot of sugar.
And I,

65
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.090
I,
uh,
buy a four pack and I have one bottle a week,
Saturday night,

66
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.800
my big drink,
like,
Ooh,
discipline.
He's going nuts.
Look at him,

67
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:54.910
he's got his drink,
the best tasting stuff.

68
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:59.590
But man,
it tastes good for a reason.
It's so sweet and like,

69
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:03.220
you just want the next one when you're done.
But man,
I,
I,

70
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.880
and I could drink them all day,
but I just can't do that to my system.

71
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:10.750
So I do one a week.
That's good discipline.
Yeah.
But it's like,
you know,

72
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.130
he something to look forward to.
