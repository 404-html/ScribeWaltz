Did you see the green,
the green new deal?
Alexandria causer Cortez?
No,

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.370
there's so she publishes.
It's a nonbinding resolution,

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.930
which means that even if it passes,
they can't enforce anything,
but my God,

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.380
I like the fact sheet.
They released alongside it,

5
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:20.520
literally said they want to provide economic security for people who are

6
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:24.660
unwilling to work.
Right.
What?
Unwilling.

7
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.980
Okay.
Really,
I swear to God.
Yeah.
Yeah.
CNBC reported this.
They covered this.

8
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.350
Apparently this got removed from the site.

9
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.390
The reason I bring this up is there's a chart from the ACA,
the economist.

10
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.750
I frequently show this in the content I make where you can see the Conservatives

11
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:42.750
are coalescing around a common ideologies.

12
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.050
For a while there was some upset in the party because people didn't like Trump,

13
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:48.420
but now they've pretty much,
you know,
they say it's the party of Trump.

14
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:49.254
People agree with them.

15
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.110
Ted Cruz even stands and gives them a standing ovation at the state of the
Union.

16
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.660
But the left has been spreading out and again,

17
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:56.640
this is from a chart put together by the economist.

18
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.590
The Democrats are very clearly being spread from far left to center and it's

19
00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:05.080
kind of making it very difficult for the Democrats to,
you know,

20
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.910
put forth something that makes sense.
If Alexandria Ocozzio Cortez,
you know,

21
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:12.840
she puts out the green new deal,
but in the bill it talks about equity,

22
00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:14.520
racial justice,
the gender pay gap,

23
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.020
things that have nothing to do with the environment.

24
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.050
And then Nancy Pelosi says it's green dreams,
you know,
and she,

25
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:19.950
and she derives this,

26
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.970
you can see that there's a new faction of the Democrats that will have,
you know,

27
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.710
holy ideological drive.

28
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.670
And I think one of the reasons for this is what we see on social media,
right?

29
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.821
The,

30
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:34.821
the ideological bent of the platforms then lead to the mass followings of

31
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:39.900
specific individuals who then use specific tactics to get elected.
And it's,

32
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.530
you know,
when,
when these platforms only allow certain ideas to form,

33
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:46.560
those ideas will naturally rise to the top of our political space.

34
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.170
And then you get crazy stuff.
Like,
if you're unwilling to work,

35
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:51.390
we'll provide you economic security,
which,
you know,

36
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:54.120
I don't know necessarily what that means other than some people who choose not

37
00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:56.460
to work.
We'll get paid,
I guess from taxpayer money,

38
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:59.460
but that seems completely insane.
And not only that,

39
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:01.320
where's that money coming from right from you?

40
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.670
This is actually another funny thing that,
no,
I mean,
I mean,

41
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:10.260
let us know what you mean.
Literally.
Yeah.
Andrew is Andrew Cuomo Sad,

42
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:13.950
God forbid if the rich leave New York because,
uh,

43
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:18.590
I believe 1% of New York,
the top 1% pay 46% of their,
of their,
uh,

44
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.010
taxes of the revenue they use.
And so they just had a big budget shortfall.

45
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.160
I believe it was,
uh,
something Trump did that caused a short fall in there.

46
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.160
And they were asked if they would tax the rich and he was like,
no,
God forbid,

47
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.860
you know,
they'll leave and they're already leaving.
So I,
I'm,
you know,
incoming,

48
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.330
incoming,
a million people saying I'm conservative for bringing that up.

49
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:39.600
But you know,
facts are facts,
I suppose.
Well,
facts are facts,

50
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:44.220
and that's what's really important about this.
And when you suppress any,

51
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.670
any ideology,
if you are on the left and you suppress the right,

52
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.300
it is just going to shore up their defenses and they're just going to harden

53
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:54.390
their line.
That's just how it goes.
That's how human natures,

54
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.180
you can't tell people what to do.
You can't.
