1
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.500
Gear for Floyd talked about it.
Apparently,

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.690
this is one thing I can tell you.

3
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:11.250
Dana told me that Floyd wants to make a deal in the UFC like legitimately,

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.230
and I go,
did he?
I could.
So I texted him,
I go,

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.770
this void really talking about fighting MMA.
He goes,
yeah,
he's fucking crazy.

6
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:21.360
I told him to get killed,
but he's still talking about doing it.
Hmm.
Whoa.

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.160
For us,
a hobby teases GSP versus Mayweather or McGregor as next fight.

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.800
We need a mega fight.
Okay,
let me just stop this nonsense right there.

9
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.630
She GSP just fought at 185 pounds.

10
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:38.631
If you fucking really think that Floyd Mayweather is going to fight GSP kiss,

11
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:43.170
shut the fuck up.
Just stop.
Just stop it.

12
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.080
We may where there's going to be like a pass.

13
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.060
That guy's huge GSP.
So big.
We would have to be like,

14
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.983
like joints.

15
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.180
You'd have to get GSP to die it down to one 55 and he would be so depleted and

16
00:00:57.181 --> 00:01:00.530
making one 55 Floyd would light him up like a Christmas tree if Floyd in light

17
00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:04.050
him up like a Christmas tree.
Anyway.
I mean,
they're going to fight in MMA.

18
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.850
He gets smushed 100% there's no way.
Stop or fight one 85 gs pain.

19
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.230
No,
no,
but they might fight at one 70 if the money was right.
If,
if,

20
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.460
if Mcgregor won't take it.
I don't know about that man.
That could be a mega,

21
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:19.620
mega fine.
That could be a $20 million fight.

22
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.460
Conor might want an extra 20 spent a lot of money on Versace.

23
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:27.300
He's always wearing furs and shit.
Flying around in private jets.

24
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.920
That shit's pricey,
man.

25
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.410
Is the latest with Mcgregor like what's going on like today?

26
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.630
Hashtag Bowlin that's what's going on.
He's on top of the world,
man.

27
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.660
Look that guy.
Let him enjoy this.

28
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.490
He's got plenty of time to come back to fighting.
Just have fun,
man.

29
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.690
Stare at your watches.
Take Instagram pictures of your Dick.
Who Cares?

30
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.540
You're the fucking man.
You made $100 million.

31
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:54.000
You're not even 30 relax.

32
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.570
Do whatever the fuck you want that no need to force him to come back and fight.

33
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.480
But if he does come back and fight,
if he,

34
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.170
if he thinks an MMA fight with GSP is a good idea,

35
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.560
like that's a big guy.
He's very big.

36
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.980
George Saint Pierre is one of the best fighters of all time.
Take that fight.

37
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.020
He's so fucking good at grappling.
But Connor might go fucking now,
fuck it.

38
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.560
Give me a couple months to put some weight on.
That's not a good fight for them.

39
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.470
But if that's where all the money is,
who knows?

40
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.170
I think Tony Ferguson is to fight.

41
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.550
That's the fight I want to see now in more until I see what happens with Barboza

42
00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:31.170
and Norma Madoff.
Right.

43
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.290
The problem is if Barboza and near mcmeadow fight and Durga Madoff smashes

44
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.640
Barboza he's gotta be next in line for the title fight,

45
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.300
right?
Nope.
You don't think so?
I not fighting.

46
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.660
Tony is the Oh,
but counters out fighting.

47
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.160
Well then to vacate,
right?
What does it say here?
Sorted rounds tonight.

48
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.830
It SGB BG,
Ireland.

49
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.230
He's trained.
I mean,
he's definitely not fat.
You look at him there.

50
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:05.620
He's in shape for sure.
I mean,
but he might just be working on his skills.

51
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.470
He's got $100 million.

52
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.100
I would not be mad at a world fight if they decided to like strip him of his

53
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:18.880
belt and have Tony Versus Cubby for the undisputed title.

54
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.700
I wouldn't be mad at that.
Yeah,
that'll probably happen.

55
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.330
I would not be mad at that.
I liked that fight.
Tony.
So fun.

56
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.860
He's so wild to watch,
man.
You know,
like when he was fighting Kevin Lean,

57
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:33.820
he's walking towards him when his hands down and just pot shot him and slowly

58
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:37.750
wearing on him,
slowly chipping them away and then the finish him off his back.

59
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.930
Come on man.
Sweet.
How many people get finished off their back?

60
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:44.170
Do you still a lot of sweet things that,
um,
that he came up with,
right?

61
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.300
They're like,
uh,
working,
you know,

62
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.710
there's different ways you can get up off your back with the cage.

63
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:53.690
Just like basic wall walking and stuff like that.
But you can't walk,

64
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.030
walk on everybody.
Right.

65
00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.570
It all depends on where your level of wall walking is and how good is your

66
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:03.430
opponent at countering that?

67
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.850
What did you think when Kevin Lee walked in with Javier staph infection on his

68
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:11.070
chest?
Did you notice it?
I was like,
cool.
I hope he's weak

69
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.580
because he was forced.
Tony said Das.
Tony,

70
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.960
did you notice as the staff goes?
Yeah,
I was trying to punch it,

71
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.370
but what,
what tone?
The Way Tony got up off the cage when,

72
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:29.530
when Kevin Lee put them up against the cage,

73
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.240
he actually can opener Kim from the bottom and full guards.
Okay.

74
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.180
Tony was head was against the cage and Kevin Lee's head was right here.

75
00:04:38.181 --> 00:04:40.890
So he basically did like a Muay Thai clinch,
like,
um,

76
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.570
can open it up right at the bottom so he couldn't get hit.
And then he had,

77
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.320
he had,
um,
his left foot on the hip and his right leg was just around his,

78
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.220
his ribs.
And then at the right time,
Kevin was naturally trying to push,

79
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.980
pull out cause he was holding him in,
he couldn't hit him.

80
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.540
He was safe against the cage.

81
00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.850
And then Tony put both feet on the hips,
pushed him up,
kicked up,

82
00:05:01.851 --> 00:05:06.260
and then says,
stood up bra like,
wow,
we're going to be doing that one.

83
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.140
Yeah,
I'm going to be,
I mean he,
Kevin Lee couldn't do anything.

84
00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:13.160
He had him exactly where he wanted him against the cage on his back.

85
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.140
Head pressed against the fence,

86
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.740
but he couldn't do anything cause Tony did a can opener arm.
No one,

87
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.490
no one does that.
I know he's in it.
He's an interesting guy,
man.

88
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.040
That was the first time we ever did that and it was crazy.
Yeah,
it was perfect.
